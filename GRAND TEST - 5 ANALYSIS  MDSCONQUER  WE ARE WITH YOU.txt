heaviness very very good morning one and
all so this is Dr srikan from Team MDS
conquer so now I'm going to give a brief
glance about yesterday's examination
that is GT5 so first for most important
thing about GT5 GT5 is mostly focusing
on module 2 subjects so more than 95
percentage of the content of GT5 is from
model to subjects only so definitely
your performance should be better than
any other GT and GT5 if not
then you need to focus on the second
important aspect that I want to stress
uh in in GT5 examination is uh there are
so many questions I'm not telling that
the question paper is easy but there are
so many questions in fact there are more
than
110 to 120 questions means half of the
question paper okay even if you are not
preparing extraordinary even if you are
not able to work or not able to complete
the syllabus extraordinary there is a
scope that you can give a damn
performance with 120 questions so 120
into 4 is going to be 480 so 400 in this
examination is going to be so easy if
you are not below 400 then you need to
think or seriously okay so I am
splitting the contents I'm splitting the
tasks and everything from now because we
are done with GT5 if your performance is
not 400 on average in GT one two three
four plus five Okay add those scores and
divide it by five if it is not more than
400 then you need to take preparation
very seriously okay you're reading but
there is some issue with the pattern
that you are reading so that may be the
biggest reason why your performance is
not up to Mark so you need to focus on
and you need to follow for example if
you list out uh the what just just I'm
just telling the WhatsApp activities
okay
if you just list out what has been done
from the the module 2 has started so
first and foremost we have posted oral
histology slides video okay there were
like two questions from oral histology
slides video so two into four you'll get
eight marks
okay uh then there were so many things
that are discussed uh as we go uh deep
into the preparation so I'm just going
to highlight few important aspects which
were given in the uh in the in the
examinations okay so one is about
microbiology there were so many things
about microbiology that has been
repeated uh in the examination and uh
there are lots of things like for
example yesterday's paper we have

following except the question was
repeated and followed by Harry tongue
question uh sorry uh
right
then our punched out lesions seen in the
case of your hand hand radiograph finger
radiograph was repeated okay and
then after I mean there were so many
such questions which are straight away
repeated uh repeated from the activity

straight away repeated and the diagram
of uh Sago spleen was repeated and uh

by uh

ah vitamin deficiency that is nowhere
related to the periodontal ligament I
mean the PDL that is vitamin D that
question was repeated there is some
diagram based question given on your
gingival inflammation which vitamin is
mainly associated with vitamin C is
mainly related to gingivitis that
question was repeated
and uh
they were very very easy and simple
questions on cysts tumors where you can
like if you go wrong in Pharma if you go
wrong in general medicine if you go
wrong in physiology that's okay but if
you're going wrong in oral pathology
even after reading if you are not
reading okay find a way to read it even
after reading if you are not going right
then we need to think about this then we
need to sort about this as fast as
possible because we are short of time
star is appearance question was repeated
okay right so there are many such uh
questions which are simple and easy I
mean like to my calculation it turns
around like 100 plus so even if you just
Mark those 100 so you'll get 400 plus
it's very easy to score 400 just keeping
yourself limited to only the group
content don't do any extraordinary just
to follow the group content do the quick
revision video or if you're a pro-life
student do the pro-life your offline
student do the offline papers and do
whatever that is being posted on the
group in yesterday's family it is very
easy to get 100 marks 100 into 400 it
will be so if you are not Crossing that
400 okay then you need to think very
very seriously about this okay
so the next step on what I want to
stress on is uh things to be done okay
so if your score is below 400 I want you
to stick on to only these things for
example if you are a normal if you are
in a regular student you can go with
quick revision videos followed by the
group content and followed by only the
mcqs of every subject the recent mcqs
and topics from two zero to one two two
zero one one make sure this has to be
done at least five times
if you are not Crossing 400 you have to
do it five times then only you can cross
400 if you are still below 300 200 you
need to think you need to do this five
times then only there is a chance that
it is going to be possible that you are
going to hit that 400 Mark and you have
to take things very very seriously
because we are running short of time we
are hardly 65 days towards the
examination and this is a peak time
where you need to take the calls and
decisions perfectly so that your scores
will improve drastically so once a
student hit that 400 500 Mark
continuously there is a scope that he
will move ahead of had in scoring better
if you're not doing it take things very
seriously so people who are crossing 400
in the range of 400 to 600 so my
suggestion is apart from these five
times revision I want you to check out
the web content website content that is
your questions explanations okay so make
sure you do you do the rqs from 2021 to
2001.
and people who are above 600 good I'm
very happy for you okay but do maintain
that Integrity in the preparation and
take care of yourself during the
preparation emotionally mentally
physically okay I want you to do
everything along with these things
everything whatever you have done in the
round one or round two of in a
particular subject okay so people please
do start Magics can happen in the last
two months also there is still a scope
chance that your performance can be
improved your preparation can be
extraordinary the only thing is follow
up with the mentor talk with the mentor
do what Mentor is telling if you're
still able not able to score 200 250
after reading vigorously every day then
there is a biggest mistake that is being
with you in the mode of your preparation
or the more you give the examination so
think over talk with the mentor okay
talk with the mentor start it away
questions are given okay so if you just
check out the last three days content of
WhatsApp activity there were many
questions directly indirectly discussed
on the group and posted in the form of a
notes if a same question is repeated in
the exam and if you're going wrong
then who is going to help you no one can
help you so my suggestion is uh don't
read everything read what is really
required read what is really required
read what is first of all give you a
scope to go 400 plus how a person can go
600 or 700 places first to reach 400 is
a minimum score you have to
okay to get to get to get into the
competition first you have to reach 400
then you can move yourself from four to
five five to six six to seven or seven
to eight so first 400 is mandatory for
everyone if you are not able to reach
that 400 please do this five times only
these things
then then then try to give more exams
then try to attend more activities try
to analyze why the answer is find out
the reason and just try to try to read
and go I'm seeing students who are just
reading the question and reading the
answer just mugging
this is not going to work out guys
trust me is not going to work out
certain questions
or certain contents or certain subtopics
in a particular subject you can do this
but you cannot do for every question
that is being posted to you on the group
or in the examination or on the
discussion okay make sure take things
seriously here we have mentors who are
going to help you out which may not be
possible in many many other areas or
many many other apps or anything where
you don't have a mentors here and
mentors are sitting
for you okay so please try to talk with
them and try to find out where you are
facing an issue and try to take
citations from them try to start
implementing those suggestions in the
preparation and try to see betterment in
your preparation all the best stay
positive take care
