agenda that is how to calculate average
in excel now let's get started with the
practical mode
now you can see that i have sales data
on my worksheet so
let us imagine that your manager asked
you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottom most cell and you
know write it down as average here
okay average sales
so here this is a cell where you want to
keep your average right so here we'll be
writing a small formula that is average
and
tap to select it
now you must select the array of data
right
so
this is my array since average is an
array function and now press enter so
there you go you have the average sales
data that happened in your company now
