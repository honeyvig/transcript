hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel today we'll be
taking you through some interesting
stuff in this tutorial we'll create a
verle game from scratch using HTML CSS
and JavaScript I believe you guys must
have played this game somewhere but
let's create one of our own today and
we'll see how easy it is to create this
whole game using HTML CSS and JavaScript
before we begin make sure that you are
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
press that Bell icon to never miss any
updates from Simply learn so without any
further delay let's get started before
we move on to the programming part let's
discuss what a Wordle game is the verle
is a popular felet word guessing game
that has become popular in the last
couple of months the game was actually
designed by a software engineer as a
gift for his partner but with time the
game gained popularity and now everyone
on social media is talking about this
game on the rules for this game are
simple the game tells you if the letters
you picked are in the word and if they
are in the right place as well if the
letter is in the right spot it shows up
green and a correct letter in the wrong
spot shows up yellow a letter that isn't
present in the word at all shows up
green color so let's go through the game
once and you guys will understand it
much better here we are in the browser
you can see we have blocks over here and
a keyboard present beneath them we have
six rows over here and each row contains
five columns for each letter of the word
the task is simple we have only one
correct word if we write something on
the first R the system will check for
all the letters if a letter is present
at the correct place then the color of
that particular letter will change to
GRE for example if we write here
River and press enter key you can see
all the words or all the letters of this
word changed to GRE this means that none
of these letters are present in the word
so let's try another word we'll write
here
Apple press the enter key and you can
see a is correct but present at the
wrong spot let's try some more now we'll
write here let's
say toq fine click on enter and you can
see o is also correct and the last word
is O now we have two letters of the word
we have a and o o is present at the last
and a is present in the word so let's
think of any word which is like this the
word coming in my mind right now is
let's try mango over here so we'll write
here mango click on enter and you can
see mango is the correct word for this
Wordle game fine we can get any random
word from the word list we have in a
JavaScript part so we'll discuss about
it later on so I hope you guys got what
this game is so let's move again to the
programming part now so here we are in
the HTML
part now the task is to create this
whole game again from scratch so here we
are in the VSS code and we'll start
writing the code for the same now we'll
create the layout of this web page using
HTML first so let's say what we are
doing here is we are writing here inside
the body we are writing here H1 let's
say the ID
is ID is H1 title fine title is the ID
for this and now what we'll do is we'll
use an underline tag so we'll write
something over here we'll write here
verle
using JavaScript fine save the program
and this is a actual program save it now
open it with live server once
again and you can see we have this
heading over here which says Wordle
using JavaScript which is underlined as
well now let's write the code again so
what we are going to do here is we are
going to use a Break Tag now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to take a div so this div is going to be
for the board so we are going to create
the board of this game later on in the
CSS part we'll keep this div empty here
now the next thing we have to do here is
we have to use another Break Tag and
then we have to print the answer as well
right right so we'll write here
BR now we'll write here H1 so inside H1
the ID is going to be let's say answer
and then inside this H1 we'll keep this
empty fine we are done with the HTML
part we'll manage the rest in the CSS in
the JavaScript Parts as well so let's
move on to the CSS part now but before
that let's save this program and you can
see nothing is changing over here in the
browser so let's move on to the CSS part
now here we are in the CSS file what
we'll do is is we'll write here body now
we'll first style the body tag of a
whole web page so we'll write your font
family so font family is going to
be Gil sense and then we'll write
here will sense Ms Mt sorry and then
we'll write here
calibra and then we
have this over here so we'll write
here trib
Ms and then we have sensor over so here
we are done with
this and it's showing some error over
here so what we have to do is we have to
put this inside single inverted commas
as well now let's zoom out the V is code
and here you can see something is wrong
over
here so the wrong thing is we have to
put this s siif inside single inverted
commas and calibr like this so we are
done with the font family next thing we
are going to do here is we are going to
write here text align at this
Center then we have background color so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the linear gradient over here so
we'll write here linear gradient now
inside this we have to pass the degree
or the angle we can say so we'll write
here degree as 120 then we have specific
colors so we'll write here 3 B 7 c e
fine so this is one of those colors then
we'll write here 50% and then we have
another color so we'll write here hash
218 ed6 so we'll write here 218 ed6 and
this is a second color we'll write here
50%
again now save the program move back to
the browser and we'll see if this is
working fine so this is working fine as
of now we'll check back at it
later now the next thing we have to do
here is we
have to style the HR tag as well so
we'll right here width as 500 pixels for
this HR te save the program move back to
to the browser and you can see nothing
has changed over
here so the next thing we have to
mention over here is the title tag so we
have the IDS title for our title so
we'll write your title now inside this
we'll write the font size font size is
going to be 36 pixel for the title then
we have font weight so we'll write your
font weight as bold then we have letter
spacing so we'll write here letter
spacing is 2 pixels for this save the
program move back to the browser and you
can see we have this heading over here
which says verle using JavaScript
and that's it so the next thing we are
going to do here is we are going to
write the code for board so we'll write
here hash board and we'll write here
width of this board is going to be 350
pixels so we'll write here 350 then we
have the height as well so we'll write
here the height as 420 pixels
and then we have margin so we'll write
here margin margin is going to be zero
and auto then we have margin top so
we'll write here margin
top okay so we have to write a margin
top and margin top is going to be 3
pixels so we'll write here three pixels
then we have the display as
flex and then and lastly we have the
flex WP so we'll write your Flex WP as
RP now save the program
and here you can see some things are
changed over here now let's style other
things as well so the next thing we have
to change here is the tile so tile is a
class over
here we'll go back to HTML and you can
see we have no class named tile over
here so we'll Define this class later on
in the JavaScript part so we'll write
here tile now inside here what we'll do
is we'll style the Box first so we'll
put a comment over here as box then
we'll write here border border is going
to be 2 pixels
solid and the RGB value of the Border
color
is
19 then for green we have 18 and for
blue we
have 180 fine so this is the Border
color then we have width so width is
going to be 60 pixels and then we have
height as well so we'll write your
height height is going to be 60 pixels
again then we have margin so we'll write
your margin margin is going to be 2.5
pixels let's
say now we'll style the text as well so
we'll mention it over here we'll comment
text over here now we'll
Define the color so the color for text
is going to be black then we have the
font size font size is going to be 36
pixels and after font size we have the
font WID so we'll write here font weight
font weight is going to
be bold then we have display so we'll
write here display as
flex and then we have justify content at
the center and finally we have align
items at the center so we'll write here
align items at
Center so here we are done with the
styling of the body title and board now
we are left with the keyboard the colors
for correct absent and present letters
so we'll write the code for it later on
for now let's move ahead to the
JavaScript part but before that let's
save this program once and we'll check
so here you can see nothing is changed
as of now so let let's refresh it once
and we'll see if something is wrong or
not so here you can see nothing is wrong
everything is working totally fine let's
go back to the JavaScript part and we'll
go through the logic behind this whole
game
now so here we are in the JavaScript
part we'll start writing the code over
here so here you can see we have the
keyboard already with us so this is
going to be our keyboard now the next
thing we are going to do here is we are
going to take a variable
as height so so the value of height is
going to be six initially so this is
basically the number of guesses we have
in a program so basically we have six
number of guesses that's why we are
taking the variable height as six then
we have the variable width so width of
each word is going to be five letters so
the width is going to be five then we
have a variable as row and the initial
value of row is going to be zero that's
because of the current guesses or we can
say the current attempt then we have a
variable call so we'll use zero for this
variable as well so this is the current
letter for that
attempt now we'll take another variable
over here we'll take a
variable game over and the initial value
of this variable is going to be false
fine the game over variable is for game
over if the game is over then the value
will change to True here we have taken
the height variable as six and the words
width is five letters the current row
will be zero and the call variable is
also set to zero the game over variable
is initially set to false that's it
right so let's move ahead and we'll
create two lists now the first one is
going to be a list of words and the
second one will be a list of guest words
so if the user enters a word then the
guest word list will be checked if the
word is present in the list or not if
the entered word is not present in the
list then the system will return that
the word is not present it so what we'll
do is we'll write here where word list
so we'll write here where word list is
equals to we are going to take a list of
words so let's say we have some words
over here we'll write here
apple and then we
have mango so there are basically a lot
of words present inside this list maybe
more than th000 2,000 or 3,000 words so
for now it's just a prototype of this
whole Wordle game so we are going to
take four or five different types of
words that's it the next word we have is
River then we have hyped so we'll write
here
hyped and then we have Tokyo so we'll
write here Tokyo let's
say we'll take another word over here so
let's say we have title over here and we
have oua fine
so we have to write here hyped with a
small H and that's it this is our word
list now we are going to create another
list this time we are going to create
the guest list which will contain all
the words that can be guessed by the
user so inside the guest list we'll
write here
apple and then
mango then we have River hyped so we are
basically going to take all these words
and we we are going to paste them over
here now let's use some more words so
let's say we are using here carbo then
we have let's say another word over here
proxy fine so we have these words in the
guest list as well now the next thing we
have to do is the guest list will also
contain the words from the word list
right so what we'll do here is we'll
write
here guess list and guess list is going
to be guestlist do concat so what we are
doing here is we are basically
performing concatenation so we'll write
here word list inside this and that's it
now it's time to pick up a random word
from the word list we have for that
we'll use traditional math. random
method so for that what we'll do is
we'll write
here where word and we are going to take
this variable and we'll write here word
list
then inside this what we are going to do
is we are going to write here math.
floor then we
have math do random so this is a method
basically meth. random so we have to put
parenthesis over here then we'll write
here asri word list
dot length so we'll write here word
list.
length and finally what we are going to
do is we going to change the word to
uppercase so that's why we are adding
here two uppercase over here so this is
also a
method now that's it let's print this
word and what we'll do is we'll write a
console.log we are going to print this
word on a console
fine so here we are done with the task
of picking up a random word from the
list of words now the next thing we have
to do is to work upon the body of this
game and then on the screen keyboard now
the next thing we have to do is to work
up the body of this game and the on
screen keyboard we have on our web page
but before that let's save this program
mons move back to the browser open
console and here you can see again on
refreshing the web page the word is
changing over here it's taking a random
word from the word list you can see on
refreshing we have River as of now I'm
not sure if you guys are able to S so
let me Zoom it out a bit now I refreshed
this page and you can see the word is
changing over here we have a list of
words and a random word will be picked
at once so here you can see
it now it's working totally fine so
let's move on and now we'll write the
code for the body and the on screen
keyboard so we'll write here
window do onload so we'll write here
window.onload
and on loading we are going to create a
function fine so we are going to
initialize so we are going to write
right here
initialize and we are going to call this
initialize function fine now the next
thing we have to do is we have to create
this function so we'll write here
function
initialize now what we have to do is we
have to create the game board now so for
that we are going to use the for Loop we
are going to write here for
let R is equals to 0 so the initial
value of R is going to be zero R is less
than height so this is the condition and
we are going to write here
r++
fine now inside the body of this for
Loop we have to take another for Loop we
have to take the for Loop for column as
well so we are going to write here for
let's say we have a variable C and the
initial value is set to zero and the
condition is going to be C less than the
width so we'll write here C less than
width and then we'll write here
C++
fine now we have to write here again
this curly braces because we are going
to write inside this for Loop now so
we'll write here
let tile so tile is a
class uh we have in a CSS file so we
have use tile over here we'll write here
document
dot create element so we are going to
use document. create element over here
and then we are going to write here span
fine now the next thing we have to write
here is the tile ID so we'll write here
tile do ID is equals to R do two
string fine so we have to write here r.
two string is a method so then we have
to write here plus now inside double
inverted commas we have to put a dash
over here then we have to write here
plus and we have to add the C value so
first we'll convert the value of C to
string and then we'll add it away so
we'll write here plus C do2
string so we'll write here C do2 string
we are going to call this method again
and that's it fine the next thing we
have here is tile
dot class list then what we'll do is
we'll write over here add and and we are
going to add the tile class over here so
we are going to write here
tile and the next thing we have to do is
tile dot inner text so we have to write
here inner
text and we have to give the value as
null over here fine the next thing we
have to do is we have to write here
document dot get element by ID then we
have to get the element of basically we
have to get the value of board so what
we are going going to do is we are going
to pass your board and we are going to
pass append child over here so we'll
write append child and we are going to
append the values of board and TI so
we'll write here TI fine that's it save
the program move back to the browser and
you can see we have this board over here
so you can see the board over here we
are able to see it so we have five
columns you can see 1 2 3 4 5 and six
rows away five so it is working totally
fine till now now let's create the
keyboard as well
so we have to write here after this for
Loop so what we are going to do is we
are going to create a keyboard so let's
write a comment over here we'll write
here
keyboard and we'll start writing the
code over here so we are going to take
uh variable over here so let's say the
variable name is keybo board and now
what we have to do is we have to write
the values present inside the keyboard
we already have those values over here
so we'll copy these from here and we are
going to paste them over here
fine so let's do one thing let's write
it this way so we have the keyboard over
here we have all the keyo keys of the
keyboard you can see we have q w e r t y
u i o p then we have the next line and
finally we have the enter key ZX cvbn M
and backspace fine so this is a symbol
for backspace basically you can download
it from Google as well now the next
thing we have to do is we have to Define
here a for Loop we'll write here for we
are going to take a keyword let I is
equals to Z then we have I less
than keyboard Dot
length and then we have I ++ over here
fine so now inside this for what we are
going to do is we are going to take a
variable so we'll write here
where current row so we'll write here
where current row is equals
to keyboard and what we are going to do
is we are going to pass your I inside
this then we have
let keyboard row
is
equals to then we'll write your document
dot create element so we'll write your
document. create element and we are
going to create a div tag over here fine
so we will write here div then we'll
write here
keyboard
row
dot class list do add we are going to
add the keyboard R class over here so
we'll Define this class later in the CSS
F keep this thing in mind we'll write
here
keyboard row so we'll write here
keyboard and then we'll write here
hyphen fine so this is going to be a
class we are going to Define it later in
the CSS part I keep mentioning it again
and again so that you guys will remember
what we have to do later on so we'll
take another follow Loop over here let's
say we have a variable named as J we'll
write here let J is equals to Zer J less
than current
row dot
length and we'll pass g++ over fine now
we'll write inside the body of this for
loop again so we'll write here
let key tile so we'll write here let key
tile is another variable we have taken
over here so we are going to write your
document dot create cre element and then
we'll create a div tag over here so
we'll write here
div and then we'll write here
let key so key is another variable over
here so we'll write here current row and
we'll pass J inside
it so we'll write here key
tile dot inner text so we'll write here
key ti do inner
text is equals to and we are going to
pass the value of key over fine then
after this we'll use the IFL statement
so we'll write here if
key is equals to is equals to enter so
what will happen is the key tile ID will
change to enter so what we are going to
do is we are going to write here inside
this key tile. ID is equal
ALS to
enter and we have to use the lsf
statement as well for other keys so
we'll write here
save key is equals to is
equals to backspace so we have a symbol
for backspace here so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste the symbol over
here and now inside the body of this lsf
statement we'll write key tile
do ID is equals
to backspace fine so the ID is going to
be backspace then we have another else
if so we'll write here else
if we'll write here a and we'll put less
than equals to sign and we'll write here
key we'll pass another condition so
we'll write here key is
less than equals
to
Z then what will happen
is the key tile
ID is going to
be
key plus key
fine and that's it we are going to add
an event list over here to process the
key so after this what will happen is
we'll put a semicolon over here first
and after the body of this LF tag what
we have to do is we have to write here
key tile dot add event listen now so we
have to add an event over here we'll WR
here click
comma process key fine so this is going
to be the event
and now we have to write some mode core
over here so we'll write
if and we'll write here key is equals to
is equals to enter
again then what will happen
is key tile the key tile dot class list
so we are going to add a class over here
so we'll write here
add and we are going to name the classes
let's say Enter
key typ fine so we'll create this class
later on in the CSS part again then
we'll write here
else and we are going to write
here key tile dot class list. add and
let's say we have the class name
is key tile
fine that's it then after this we have
to write here
keyboard row do append
child so we have to write a keyboard
row. append child now we are going to
append the key tile class over here so
we'll write your key
tile and after this we have to write
here
document dot body dot upend child and we
have to write here keyboard
fine so that's it
now we'll do this letters entering task
from the system keyboard as well that's
basically the keyboard we have in our
system so for that what we are going to
do is we are going to write
here document dot add event list now so
we are going to add an event then we'll
write here key
up key up is going to be the event then
we'll write here e inside this and we'll
create an arrow function over here so
this is going to be an anonymous Arrow
function now inside the body of this
function what we'll do is we'll write
here
process input and we are going to pass e
over here fine so this is basically the
keyboard part we have save the program
move back to the browser and we'll see
you can see the process key is not
defined over here is the error so we'll
Define the process key
later now what we'll do is we'll write
the CSS part for the keyboard and for
that we'll move back to the CSS file so
here we are in the CSS file and what
we'll do is we'll Define the classes
over here so the first class we have
is the keyboard row class so we'll write
here do keyboard row now we'll write
over here width of the keyboard width is
going to be 400 pixels then we have
margin so we'll write here margin margin
is going to be zero and Auto for this
keyboard then we have the display as
flex and finally we have the flex tab
Flex W is going to be WP and that's it
for the keyboard row class then we have
the key tile class so we'll write here
key
tile and now inside this what we are
going to do is we are going to mention
the width again width of the key tile is
going to be 36 pixel then the height we
have of this key tile so we'll write
here height height is going to be 40
pixels let's say then we have margin so
margin is going to be 1 pixel again for
the key tile then we have the border
border is going to be 1 pixel solid in
nature and the RGB value
is 12a 12a 12 which is black so then we
have the Border radius border radius is
going to be 5 pixels
again and then we have to mention the
font family for the text so the font
family is going to
be this one then we have Cambria coochin
Georgia times Times New Roman and serif
over here
fine now the next thing we have to
mention for the text is the font size so
we are going to write your font size as
20 pixels then we have font weight font
weight is going to be bold then we have
the display display is going to be flex
and finally we have to justify content
at the center
fine then we have to align these items
at the center as
well and that's it now we have to write
the code for the enter key time so we'll
write here Dot
Enter key tile and inside here we have
to mention the width width is going to
be 76 pixels for the enter key you have
seen the enter key is bigger in size
than other keys so we have to mention
the height height is going to be the
same as 40 pixels then we have margin
margin is going to be 1 pixel again for
this Enter key and we have the Border as
well border is going to be 1
pixel solid so we have to write your one
pixel solid and the RGB value
is going to be 0
comma 0 comma 0 so we'll remove this
blue and green from here and that's it
the RGB value is black basically then
we'll write here border radius border
radius is again going to be 5 pixel for
the enter key as well now we have to
mention for the text as well so the font
size is going to be 20 pixels then we
have font weight so font weight is going
to
be bold and then we have display as
Flex finally we have justify content at
the center and we have to align items at
the center as fine so we are done with
the enter key tile as well now what
we'll do next is we'll move back to the
JavaScript part but before that let's
save this program and we move back to
the browser once again you can see it
says process key is not defined we'll
Define it later on so for now let's move
back to the JavaScript part
again now what we have to do is we have
to create a function over here so we are
going to create the function process
input before we move on to the process
input function what we'll do is we'll
create the process key function because
we are getting the error for this again
and again so we'll write here function
then we'll write your process
key now inside the body of this function
what we have to do is we have to write e
is equals
to code and then we'll write
here this Dot ID fine so I guess it will
work fine then what we have to do is we
have to write here process input and we
have to pass e fine we have to call the
process input function for so save this
program move back to the browser and you
can see now we have the keyboard over
here so you can see on clicking any key
over here it says process input is not
defined so let's define it as well first
and then we'll see if the keyboard code
is working totally fine or
not so for the process input function we
have to write
here function then we'll write here
process input we have to pass e as a
parameter over here and we'll write
inside the function
if game over is true then return form
here
fine now we have to write the e do code
over here so we'll write here
if key
a is less than equals to e do
code and then e do code
is less than equals
to
keyz then what will happen we'll write
here inside the if block we'll write if
column is less than
width so we'll write here
let current tile so we'll write here let
current tile is equals
to document dot get element by ID so
we'll write here get element by ID and
ID is going to be row
dot to string
plus then we'll put Dash over here or we
can say a hyphen We'll add what we'll
add is We'll add call do two string fine
so we'll write here call do two string
this is again a
method so we have to write here this and
we have to write here row. two string
fine so I guess this will work totally
fine
now now after this what we'll do is
we'll write here again
if so we'll write here current
tile do inner
text is equals 2 is equals to
nothing then inside the body of this if
statement we'll
write current
tile dot inner
code or we can say inner text over here
so we have to write here current tile do
inner text equals to e do code so we
have to write here
three then we have to change the value
to column plus is equal to 1
fine so we have to mention the else if
statement as well so we'll write here
after
this if statement we'll write here else
if e do code is equals to is equals to
backspace now we'll
delete the letter so we'll write here
backspace and inside the body of this LS
if we'll write
if a 0 is less than call so we'll write
here 0 less than
call
and call is less than equals to
width then what will happen is call
minus is equals to 1 so basically what
we are doing is we are deleting the
letter so we'll write here this and
after this lsip what we have to do is we
have to write
here inside the lsf only we'll write
let current tile so we have to write
here current tile is equals to document
dot get element by idid then we'll write
here row dot two string so we'll write
here row. two string this is a method
then we'll write here the same thing
again and we have to write here call Dot
two string fine so this is a method
again we are good with it and the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to write here current tile do inner
text is equals to null over here
fine now the next thing we have to do is
we have to write the code for Enter key
as well so we'll write
here after this we'll write here else
if
e do
code is equals to is
equals to
enter and what we have to do is we have
to call the update function
fine so this is going to be a function
we are going to create the update
function after this function so don't
worry about it now what we'll do is
we'll write here
if game is not over so we'll write here
not game
over and
then row is equal 2 equal to
height and what will happen inside the
body of this if tag we have to write
here game over is equals to
true and we have to write here
document dot get element by ID and we
have to get the ID of the answer so
we'll write your
answer dot inner
text is equals to word so we are going
to print the word fine if the row is
equals to height and the game is not
over so basically if we have all the
blocks filled we have all the rows
filled and if the last row is also
filled then what will happen is it will
print the answer in word so it will
print the word as the answer fine so
save it now move back to the browser and
we'll
see so you can see as of now this thing
is not working but we have no error over
here so let's refresh it once and you
can see there's no error still so I
guess it will work fine after
we'll do the update function as well so
let's write over here what we are going
to do is we are going to create the
update function for rest of the things
we'll check the input given by the user
here only so what we'll do is we'll
write your
function
update and what we have to do is we have
to write here a variable so let's say
let guess is equals
to null for now we are going to take
variable guess and then what we'll do is
we'll write
here
document. get element by ID now what we
are going to do is we are going to use
the answer so we are going to write here
answer dot inner
text is equals to null for now now what
we have to do is we have to string up
the guesses into a word so basically
what we have to do is we have to take
all the letters from a particular row
and we we have to pile them up in a word
so what we'll do here is we'll write
here four let's take a variable C is
equals to Zer we'll write here C is less
than width so let's write here C is less
than width and
C++ fine now what we'll do is we'll
write here
let current tile is
equals to
document. get element by
ID and we have to write here again row
dot to
string
plus then we have to put a hyphen over
here then we have to put a plus and
we'll write here call Dot two string
fine now the next thing we have to do
here is we have to take another variable
so we'll write here let
letter is equals
to current tile dot inner
text so we'll write here current tile do
inner
text and then what we have to do is we
have to
add this value to a gas variable so
we'll write here gas plus is equals
to letter
fine so we are done with this for Loop
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to update the value of guess and we
have to change the guess to lower case
now so we'll write here
guess
dot to lower case fine so we have to
write here to lower
case this is again a method so we have
to put parenthesis over here this is
case sensitive basically then we'll put
it on the console so we'll write here
console. log and we'll write here guess
fine now what we are going to do is we
are going to check if the guest is
present in the guest list or not fine so
for that what we are going to do is we
are going to write
here so let's put some space over here
we'll write here if
not guess list dot
includes what guess if the guess list
does not not include the guest so what
will happen
is we'll write here document dot get
element by ID and we are going to write
here answer so instead of answer what
will be there is dot in a text is equals
to not in
the word list or not in word list
basically over here we'll write not in
word list
and that's it
fine now what we have to do is we have
to write here
return we have to return this thing so
that's it we are done
with this guess part now the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
start processing the guest we have so
for that what we'll do is we'll take a
variable correct the initial value of
correct is going to be
zero and let's say we have another
variable letter
count fine so we are going to
take so basically what we are going to
do is we are going to keep a track of
letter frequency so that's why we are
doing
it now what we have to do here is we
have to write
here for we are going to use another for
Loop so let's say we have a variable I
with initial value as zero then we have
I is less than
word.
length and we have i++ over here fine so
basically we are done with the for Loop
let's write inside the body of this for
Loop what we'll do is we'll write
letter is equals to word and then we
have to check the word so we'll write
here I then we'll use
if letter count
count of
letter and we'll write here inside the
body of this if
statement letter
count
letter plus is equals to 1
fine now what we'll do is we'll write
after this else now inside the body of
else what we'll do is we'll put the
letter account to one so we'll write
here letter count now inside this we'll
write
letter is equals to one
fine so basically what we have to do is
we have to write here after
this console Dot loog and we have to put
the print the let account
fine so till now we are done with this
now what we'll do is we'll check for the
first iteration we'll check for all the
correct ones first so what we'll do is
we'll write here after this for we are
going to use another for Loop for this
so let's say we have a variable C the
initial value of C is set to zero we'll
check the width of C so we'll write here
C is less than width then what will
happen is c will increase so we'll write
here C++ now inside the body we'll write
let current tile is equals to document
dot get element by ID now we are going
to write here the same thing again row.
two
string we have a method as row. two
string now we have to put a hyphen over
here then we have to
put call
Dot two string over here
fine now we have to take the letter
variable so we'll write here letter is
equals to current tile do inner text so
basically it has the value of the
current tile so we'll write here current
tile do inner text so is it in the
correct position now we are going to
check it fine so we'll write here
if word so what is the word c is equals
to is
equals to
letter then what will happen
is the current tile value so we'll write
here currenti dot class list dot add so
basically we are going to create a class
for correct which will change the
background color of that particular key
and of that
particular box or tile fine so we'll
write here correct so we are going to
create this class in the CSS part now
after this what we have to do is we have
to write here let key tile key tile is
equals to document dot get element by ID
so we have to write
here key plus letter
fine then we have key tile dot class
list dot remove so we
have to write here the present
class and then we have to write here key
tile dot class list do add the correct
class so we'll write
here correct fine so we are going to
Define these two classes in the CSS
part now the next thing we have to do is
we have to increase the value of correct
by one so we write here correct plus is
equals to 1 fine then we have let
account and we are going to decrease the
value of let account by one so we'll
write
here minus is equals to 1 let's put some
space over here as well so that it will
look good to you guys now we are done
with the let account as well so what
we'll do next
is we are going
to write here after this particular if
statement so right here we are going to
write
if correct is equals to is equals to
width then what will happen is game over
will change
to True
fine this is another condition we have
now what we have to do next is we have
to write
here so basically what we are going to
do is we are going to print the
console or we can say we are going to
print the letter account on the console
so we'll write here let count inside
console.log and now what we'll do is
we'll go again and Mark which ones are
present but in the wrong position that
means the yellow color ones right so
we'll write here after
this console.log we'll write for we are
going to use another for Loop so we'll
write here let C is equal to 0 again C
is less than the width so we'll write
here C less than width then we'll
increase the value of C by one so we'll
write here C++ then we'll write here
let current
tile is
equals to document dot get element by ID
so we are going to write here row dot to
string and then we have this hyphen over
here and and we'll write here
plus all do two string fine so we are
going to take the values of these and
then after this what we are going to do
is we are going to set the value of
letter variable so we'll write here let
letter is equals
to what's present inside the current
tile so we'll write here current tile
dot inner text
and the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to skip the letter if it
has been marked correct so for that what
we have to do is we have to use the if
statement so we'll write here
if not
currenti DOT class list
dot contains what it contains is the
correct class so we'll write here
correct if it contains correct what will
happen
is we'll check if it is present in the
word we have to make sure that we don't
double count right so what we'll do is
we'll write here again inside this if
statement we'll take another if
statement and we'll write here word
dot
includes now we have to write
here
letter and we have to mention it over
here after this we have to write here
letter count count now what we have to
do is we have to write here
letter and we have to write here greater
than Z fine now what will happen is
we'll write here current tile current
tile
dot class list do add we have to add it
to present class so we'll write here
present
fine now what we have to do is we have
to write here let
eile is equals
to document do get element by ID what we
have to do is we have to write here key
plus letter
fine okay so we have to write here after
this what we have to do is we have to
take another if fine so we'll write here
if not
key tile dot class list dot contains
which class the correct class so we'll
write here
correct and we'll write here inside
this keyti do classlist do add but we
have to add over here is
the present class fine now what we'll do
is
will deduct the value of let account by
one so we'll write here let account and
we have to pass letter inside here and
we'll write here minus is equals to 1
fine now what we have to do is we have
to write the code for else as well so
we'll write here
else now what we'll write inside else is
currenti do classlist do add which class
we have to add now is the absent class
fine so we'll write here absent we are
going to describe this class or we are
going to Define this class in the CSS
part later on so for now we have to
write here absent and we have to change
the value of key tile so we'll write
here key tile is equals
to document dot get element by ID we
have to write here again key
plus letter fine let's put a space over
here and that's
it what we have to do is we have to
change the key tile class as well so
we'll write
here key tile
dot class list dot add which class we
have to add again is the absent class
fine we are almost done with the
JavaScript part as well what we have to
do is we have to start a new row for for
a new word so we'll increase the value
of row as row plus plus equals to one
start a new row and we have to change
the column value to zero again fine so
basically we are done with it so before
we move on to the final outcome let's do
one thing let's go through the CSS part
once again and we'll Define these three
classes the correct present and absent
class fine save the JavaScript part here
save it now and let's move back over
here and what we'll do
is we'll write after this tile class
what we'll do is we'll write over
here do correct we are going to define
the correct class first so the correct
class the background color is going to
be this one hash
3fc and the value is
031 so the green color basically the
font color will change to White so we'll
write here color as white and then we
have border color so border color will
also change to White fine then we have
the present class as well so we'll write
here present and inside the present
class the background color will change
and the value of background color is HH
F 5 c e 23 fine so this is basically
yellow color so
the color and the background color will
remain the same
so okay so we have to write here border
color not background color so we'll
write here border color and again we are
going to define the Border color here
fine so we'll write border
color so border color is going to be
white in this case as well now we have
to define the absent class as well so
we'll write here absent
for the absent class the background
color will change to gray fine so we'll
write here
hash
787
C7 e fine so this is the gray color we
have the color is going to be
white and then we have the Border color
fine so the Border color is again going
to be
white that's it we are done with
everything now save the program save the
JavaScript part and the HTML part once
again move back to the browser and here
you can see we have a program so if we
click on the keyboard so it's not
working as of now maybe we have some
error over here so let's check it out
once again we'll move to the JavaScript
part
and if we can see
here key tile is fine so we have to
write here key tile like
this and let's check the other key tile
as well so everything else is fine save
the program now save the CSS part and
the HTML part as well move back to the
browser and I hope this will work now so
you can see it's working as of now now
we have written over qu you can see it
says not in word list we have qu over
here so the word we have is title let's
write title over here and you can see
the second line is not
working so we have to get back
to this and we
have save it now move back to the
browser
okay it's working
now and you can see so the word we have
here is hyped so let's try to write okay
we have to remove this first that's why
it was not working so we have to write
here another word let's say we have a
word mango click on enter and you can
see now it's working fine now the word
we have here is hyped so we'll write
here
hyped click enter and you can see we
have all greens over here you can see
the word count as well we have h y p e d
as
11111 and we have all the words here in
the console so you have seen here the
program is working totally fine the task
is done here and with that we come to
