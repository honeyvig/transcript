hey everyone
welcome to yet another interesting and
informative video by simply learn in
this video we will understand the
control statements in c programming
before we get started make sure that you
subscribe to our simply learn channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from us
now let's get started with the agenda
for today's session
first let us start by understanding what
are control statements in c and then the
types of control statements
now let's begin with what are control
statements in c
control statements and see help the
computer execute a certain logical
statements and decide whether to enable
the control of the flow through a
certain set of statements or not
also it is used to direct the execution
of statements under certain conditions
let us consider an example of a
stationary shop
when a girl wants to buy a ball pin she
says to the shopkeeper that she has the
condition to purchase a pen of either of
two colors which are black or blue so
the shopkeeper first search for the
black color pen keeping the condition in
his mind
if the black color pen is not available
in the shop then the shopkeeper will
search blue color pen
and if the condition is satisfied the
girl will buy the pen
else she will not buy it
similarly the computer executes these
statements when the given condition is
satisfied
great now that we know what are control
statements in c
now let us understand the classification
of control statements in sync
first off we have decision making
control statements
then we have conditional statements and
finally go to statements and loop
control statements
first let us understand all the decision
making control statements in depth
decision making control statements are
simple if if file statements nested
default statements and lc flatter
let us go through them in detail
now let's have a look at simple if
statements
when you look at the flowchart it is
very clear that it first evaluates if
condition and if the condition is true
the statements under if will be executed
else other statement outside the if will
be executed
and the syntax of simple if is if
condition followed by statement inside
the curly brackets
now let's execute the simple program
using if statements
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skill up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
in this particular program based on
simple if statement it asks user to
enter value for e and b
and it takes the condition a greater
than b
and if a is greater than b it prints
this statement a is greater than b
in case a is not greater than b it will
not print anything now let's run it
enter the numbers for a and b let's
enter 10 and 5
and the output is 10 is greater than 5.
next if will statements
in this it evaluates the condition and
if the condition is true the statements
under if will be executed otherwise
these statements under else will be
executed and followed by other
statements
syntax of if else statement is if
condition statement one is statement two
let's understand the if statement with
the help of an example program
this particular program is based on if
statement as i discussed before it
checks the if condition and if the
condition is satisfied it will print the
statement under if block
otherwise it will print the statements
under else block
let's run it
enter the numbers for e and b
so as you all can see the output the
value of a is not greater than b
that's why this statement under else
block is executed
next we have nested if statement
the nested if all statements consist of
another if or else
let us understand necessarily statements
with the help of syntax
this consists of another if else
statement inside the outer if block and
another if else inside the outer else
block
let's understand by an example
this program is based on nested effects
this is an order if block and it
consists of another if and else
it first checks the condition of order
if and if the condition is not satisfied
then it checks the inner if condition
even if that condition is not satisfied
it executes the statement under else
block
in case even that condition is not
satisfied it comes outside the outer if
block and execute the statements under
order if else block
let's run it
enter the numbers for a and b
then enter
as you can see the value of a and b are
same it has print statement under outer
else block
now let's enter different values for a
and b and check the output
so
since a is not equal to b and a is
greater than b the output is printed
successfully
next lc flatter
lc flat statements contain multiple
elsif when either of the condition is
true the statements under that
particular if will be executed otherwise
these statements under the else block
will be executed
the syntax is
if condition and followed by multiple
else if
so now let's execute the program using
an lc flatter
enter the number for year let's enter
10.
so
it checks the condition a not equal to
10. since the condition is not satisfied
it checks the next if condition
since a is not greater than 15 it checks
another if condition and the condition a
less than 20 is satisfied and the output
is 10 is less than 20.
now let's have a look at the control
statements in c
as per the value of switch expression
the switch statement will allow
multi-wave branching depending on the
expression the control is transferred to
that particular case label and execute
the statements under it if none of the
cases are matched with the switch
expression then the default statement is
executed
syntax of switch statement is switch
expression and inside the curly brackets
multiple case labels and at the end
default statement
let's execute program based on switch
statement
so in this particular program if the
expression of switch matches with any of
the case label then it will execute the
statements under it now let's run the
program
enter value of n
let's enter 4
and the output is value is invalid
it's because since the value of n is not
matched with any of the case label it
has print the default statement
now let's have a look at go to
statements
go to statements are used to transfer
the flow of control in a program
go to statement is also known as jump
control statements because it is used to
jump to the specified part of the
program
the syntax is go to label name and
semicolon
label in go to statement is a name used
to direct the branch to a specified
point in the program
in the example
label name is odd
next we have loop control statements in
c
in loop control statements we have for
loop while loop and while loop let us go
through them in detail
for loop is also known as pre-test loop
from the following syntax expression 1
is an initialization expression 2 is the
conditional expression and expression 3
is an updation the variables can be
initialized in the for loop statement
itself
you might get a clear idea of using for
loop when you look at the flowchart
in the for loop expression 1 is used to
initialize the variable expression 2 is
evaluated and if the condition is true
then the body of for loop will be
executed
and then the statements under expression
3 will be executed
this process is repeated as long as the
follow condition is true once the
condition is false control will return
to the statements following the for loop
and execute those statements
let's see the example
in the for loop the variable i is
initialized to 0
and expression 2 is the condition that
is i less than n and then the updation
let's run it
as you can see the output the value of i
is printed until the condition is false
up next we have a while loop
a while loop is also known as an entry
loop
because in a while loop the condition is
tested first then the statements under
body of the while loop will be executed
if the while loop condition is false for
the first time itself then the
statements under the while loop will not
be executed even once let's have a look
at the syntax of while loop
while condition and inside the curly
brackets we have statements
let's execute the program using while
low
so here it first checks the while
condition and then prints the statement
let's run it
enter the number for a let's enter 5.
so since the condition is satisfied it
has executed statements under the while
loop
now let us try to enter different value
for a
let's enter 20.
since the condition is not satisfied
that is 20 is not less than or equal to
10
it has not executed statements even once
next the two while loop
dual is also known as an exit loop
because in the do-while row the
statements will be executed first and
then the condition is checked if the
condition of the while loop is true then
the body of the loop will be executed
again and again until the condition is
false once the condition is false the
control will transfer outside into while
loop and execute statements followed
soon after the dual loop
the syntax is
do and statement inside the curly
brackets
then while condition
as you can see this particular example
is based on a dual loop
it prints the statement first and then
checks the while condition
so it prints the value of i until the
condition is false as you all can see
the output until the value of e is less
than or equal to 5 the values are
printed successfully
so with this we have come to the end of
the session on the control statements in
c programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
