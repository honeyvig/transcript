pin comment so let's get started so
let's start with what is normalization
normalization in dbms is a method used
to organize data within database to
reduce repetition by breaking down large
data sets into smaller more manageable
tables and ensuring these tables are
properly related normalization helps
prevent issues like data rency data
rency means the unnecessary repetition
or duplication of data within a database
for example when a same piece of data is
stored in multiple places it can lead to
inconsistencies and take up more stor
space than needed for example Data rency
before normalization you can see the
table mentioned above where we have
order ID customer ID customer name
customer address product and quantity
you might see some of the data which is
being repeated again and again in the
above table the customer address for
John do is repeated three times let's
suppose if John do moves to a new
address every occurrence of his address
in the table must be updated if any
instance is missed due during the update
it leads to inconsistencies and errors
can occur in the database the solution
is reducing the rency through
normalization let's check it out how so
you can see this is the normalized table
we have created first is the normalized
customer table and then we have the
order table so what are the benefits of
normalization the address for joho is
stored only once in the customer table
if John do address changes it needs to
be updated in one place ensuring
consistency through the datab base this
reduces the risk of errors and maintains
data Integrity the process involves
multiple steps that transform data into
a tab below format removing duplicates
and establishing clear connections
between different tables making the
database more efficient and reducing
problems like errors during data
insertion updates or deletion let's now
discuss the types of dbms normal forms
normalization rules are categorized into
different normal forms the first one is
one and if for a table to be in first
normal form it must satisfy the four
rules single valued Atomic attributes
each column should contain only one
value per row this means that there
should be no repeating groups or arays
within a single column same domain
values all values stored in a specific
column should be of the same data type
or domain for example if a column is
meant to store dates all values in that
column should be dates then we have
unique column names each column in the
table should have a unique name this
ensures Clarity and avoids confusion
when referring to a specific column then
we have order of data which doesn't
matter the order in which rows are
stored in the table should not affect
the data or its Integrity let's check
the example of the first normal form
consider the following unnormalized
table customer ID customer name and the
phone numbers as you can see the phone
numbers are repeated twice the problems
with the original table is the nonatomic
values the phone numbers column contain
multiple phone numbers separated by
commas which violates the atomicity rule
of 1 andf converting to First normal
form to bring this table into one and F
we must ensure that each column contains
only Atomic value this involves
splitting the rows where there are
multiple phone numbers as you can see we
have splitted the data each row now has
a single phone number ensuring that the
phone number column contains Atomic
value same domain names all the values
in the phone number column are
consistent in format and type all are
phone numbers then we can see that the
unique column names The Columns customer
ID customer name phone number which has
unique name satisfying the requirement
order of data the order in which the
rules appear does not matter as the
data's meaning and integrity are
preserved by applying these rules the
table now confirms the first normal form
eliminating any rency related to the
four numbers and ensuring data is stored
in a more organized and efficient manner
let's go through each of these database
normal forms step by step with simple
examples to help you grasp the concepts
more easily let's talk about the second
normal form for a table to be in second
normal form it must satisfy the
following condition number one it must
be in one and F number two no partial
dependency every non key attribute
should be fully dependent on the entire
primary key not just part of it this
rule applies primarily to tables with
composite primary Keys example of second
normal form is consider the following
table that is in one NF the order ID
product ID product name quantity and the
supplier name the problems with this
table is that the partial dependency the
product name and the supplier name
depend only on product ID not the entire
primary key which is order ID and
product ID this violates 2nf converting
to Second normal form to bring the table
into 2nf we separate the data into two
tables to remove partial dependencies
order table and the product table no
partial dependency in the order table
quantity is fully dependent on both
order ID and product ID in the product
table product name and supplier name are
dependent only on the product ID this
ensur that each non-key attribute is
fully dependent on the primary key
bringing the tables into 2 and F let's
now talk about the third normal form 3
andf for a table to be in third normal
form it must satisfy the following
condition number one it must be in 2
andf number two there should be no
transitive dependency where non-care
attributes depend on other non-
attributes rather than the primary key
let's check out the example of a third
normal form consider the following table
that is in 2 andf
the problems with the 2nf table is that
the transitive dependency the instructor
name is dependent on the course name
which is not directly on student ID or
course ID and this violates 3nf so how
do we convert this into 3nf to achieve
three and F we split the table to remove
the transitive dependency student course
table and course table no transitive
dependency now the student course table
there are no non-key attributes
depending on other non key attributes
the course Table stores the course and
instructor information separately this
structure eliminates transitive
dependency ensuring the tables conform
to 3 andf Let's now talk about the boys
called normal form which is bcnf bcnf is
an extension of the third normal form
3nf a table is in bcnf if it is in 3nf
and for every functional dependency a
implies to B A should be a Super Key
let's check out the example of a boy
called normal form bcnf so you can see
this table here consisting of employee
ID department and the manager the
problem with this table is that the PCN
a violation in this table Department
determines manager but department is not
a Super Key since employee ID is the
primary key this violates bcnf so how do
we convert this to bcnf to achieve bcnf
we split the table to ensure that every
determinant is a Super Key as you can
see the employee table and the
department table the Super Key
requirement in the employee table
employee ID is the primary key and in
the department table department is now
the primary key the decomposition
ensures that every functional dependency
is Satisfied by a Super Key meeting the
requirements of bcnf let's now talk
about the fourth normal form which is
4nf a table is set to be in 4nf if it is
in bcnf and has no multi value
dependencies so let's consider an
example of a fourth normal form consider
table where an employee can have
multiple skills and work on multiple
projects as you can see the employee ID
skill and the project the problem with
this table is that it is multivalue
dependency an employee skill is
independent of the project but both are
stored in the same table this leads to
multivalue dependency violating 4nf so
in order to achieve 4nf we separate the
skills and the projects into different
tables the employee skill table and the
employee project T and now you can see
that no multivalue dependency by
separating the skills and the projects
we eliminate multivalue dependencies
ensuring the table conformed to for and
let's now talk about the fifth normal
form the employee skill table and the
employee projects table so as you can
see that no multivalue dependencies is
there by separating the skills and the
projects we eliminate multivalue
dependencies ensuring the tables
conformed to 4 andf now let's talk about
the fifth normal form which is 5 andf a
table is set to be in fifth normal form
if it is in for enough and cannot be
decomposed into any smaller tables
losing information also known as joint
dependency let's consider an example of
a fifth normal form this is a table here
that records the relationship between
suppliers parts and the project the
problem with this table is that the join
dependency the table has a complex
relationship between suppliers parts and
projects that can be decomposed further
so how do we convert this into fifth
normal form in order to achieve 5 andf
we break the table into smaller related
tables the suppliers part table and the
suppliers project table also Parts
project table eliminating joint
dependency by decomposing the table into
three smaller tables we remove the
complex relationship and eliminate the
joint dependency ensuring the tables
confirmed to 5 and if so guys this was
