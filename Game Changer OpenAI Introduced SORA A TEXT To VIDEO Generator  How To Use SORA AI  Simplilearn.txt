there's much more on the list so what
are you waiting for hurry up and enroll
now you can find the course Link in the
pin comment and description box below so
let's get started so you could see the
open aai Sora website and you could see
that they have mentioned their
capabilities safety and research about
the openi Sora and how they will
transform the text or the prompts into
videos so let's have a look and imagine
crafting stories that come to life where
every word paints a motion picture Sora
our latest Innovation or the Open Eyes
Innovation is designed to understand and
simulate the physical world in motion
creating video scenes from Simple Text
instructions so now let's see the
examples as you could see the prompt
that a stylish woman walks down a Tokyo
Street filled with warm warming neon and
animated City signage she wears a black
leather jacket a long red dress and
black boots and carries a black purse
she wears sunglasses and red liptick she
walks confidently and casually the
street is a damp and reflective creating
a mirror effect of the colorful lights
many pedestrians Boke about you could
see like how they have depicted or how
this AI model that is Sora has depicted
The Prompt and how beautifully it has
created this video and similarly you
could see other prompts that is the
several Giant buly mammot and you could
see the output of the open a SORA it's
mesmerizing similarly they have all the
prompts that they have provided to their
open a SORA and the outputs they all
have mentioned on the website as you
would be knowing that the product is not
available for all of of us they are in
the beta version and they have provided
to some of the video creators and some
developers so they mentioned the prompts
and the videos that on the website
only as you could see that Sora excels
in generating complex scenes maintaining
visual Fidelity and adhering closely to
the Creator's Vision all while ensuring
that characters and styles persist
accurately throughout the video so with
this technology they have transitioned
to visualization of Sora diffusion model
with digital representation of the video
generation process as we will see its
capabilities so you could see that they
have provided some info for you guys
also that is we are teaching AI to
understand and simulate the physical
world in motion with the goal of
training models that help people solve
problems that require real world
interaction and they have introduced
Sora that is text to video model and can
generate videos up to a
minute as we have talked about the Lumia
that can generate the videos up to 5
seconds and they are also transforming
to the longer section of videos and if
we talk about the Sora becoming
available to Red teamers to access
critical areas from harms or risk
they're also granting access to a number
of visual artists designers and
filmmakers to gain feedback on how to
advance the model to be the most helpful
for Creative professionals as you can
see that they have provided to these
sections of the people only and the
product is not available for all the
users you could see see the prompts here
that is historical footage of California
during the gold rush and how beautifully
the Sora has curated this video and if
we talk about its technology behind it
so that the heart of Sora lies a
diffusion model architecture similar to
that of Chad jpt and Dal representing
videos as collections of data patches so
this allows Sora to extend the
boundaries of video generation creating
or extending videos with unprecedented
detail and accuracy and you could see
that they also mentioned the current
model has weaknesses and it may struggle
with accurately simulating the physics
of a complex scene and may not
understand specific instances of cause
and effect for example a person might
take a bite of a cookie but afterward
the cookie may not have a bite mark in
the video with the output so they're
improving with all the prompts and how
and how the red teammates and the beta
version they will be entering the
prompts and with the time and the
prompts they will improve this model and
the model may also confuse spal details
of a prompt for example mixing up left
and right and may struggle with precise
description of events that take place
over time like following a specific
camera trajectory so you could see the
prompt that is strap printing scene of a
person running that is a cinematic film
short in 35 mm and you could see the
person is running backwards and
similarly here you can see that the
prompt was five grave wolf pups
frockling and chasing each other around
a remote Gravel Road surrounded by grass
and in this they have mentioned the
weakness that is animals or people can
spontaneously appear especially in
scenes containing many entities so it
has a weakness but it will move on and
will be capable to overcome this
weakness with time and the prompts and
now talking about its safety and
responsibilities so visuals shift to
more sober throughout tone with a focus
on digital logs and filters and in ping
this technology opena is committed to
safety and responsible AI that is
collaborating with domain experts
they're testing Sora against potential
harms developing detection tools for
misleading content and ensuring
compliance with their stringent usage
policies so you could see that they're
also focusing on the safety of the AI
models so that they won't be in the bad
hands as you could also see that they
have also mentioned that they planning
to include c2p metadata in the future if
they deploy the model in an open a
product so they're also having the
safety methods in existing D 3 product
also and they are also applicable to
Sora as well as theyve also mentioned an
example that is once in an open a
product A text classifier will check and
reject text input prompts that are in
violation of our usage policies like
those that request extreme violence
sexual content hateful imagery celebrity
likeness or the IP of others they've
also deployed or developed robust image
classifiers that are used to review the
frames of every video generated to help
ensure that it adheres to our usage
policies before it's shown to a user so
you could see how they are concerning
about the safety and now moving about
the research we have also discussed that
Sor is a diffusion model which generates
videos by starting off with that one
looks like e static noise and gradually
transforms it by removing the noise or
many steps so it is similar to GPD
models and can have a Transformer
architecture unlocking Superior scaling
performance and if we talk about the
patches so they represent videos and
images as collection of smaller units of
data called patches Each of which is aen
to be talken in gbt and you know that
the Sora buils on past research in Dian
GPT models and it uses the recapturing
technique from D 3 which involves
generating highly descriptive captions
for the visual training data and as a
result the model is able to follow the
users text instructions in the generated
video more faithfully and now if we talk
about the future of Sora so the tone of
the all the videos are uplifting again
an Sora is more than a technological
Marvel it's a gateway to new forms of
Storytelling education and artistic
expression by engaging with policy
makers Educators and creators worldwide
wi open AI is aiming to unlock the full
potential of AI in harmony with human
creativity and ethical standards and
