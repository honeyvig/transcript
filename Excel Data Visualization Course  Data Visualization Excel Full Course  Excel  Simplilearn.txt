description box below to find your data
science and data analytics program it
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with our one point agenda
that is data visualization course in
Excel now what exactly do you mean by
data
visualization so let's say you run a
company something similar to Amazon
which is also having an online website
and it has some stocks and everything
you have customer data have ERS data
delivery data category the lead numbers
profit made Etc right and you give that
data to your marketing team or maybe
your marketing team gives that data to
to you then how do you understand it
exactly right it's nothing but all
numbers and alphabets and nothing
understandable all you can see is just
ta the data with some entries in it
right and you are ought to make a
special decision for your company which
improves the sales in all the states and
regions of your nation right or
worldwi in those scenarios what exactly
comes to your help is data visualization
if your data can be transformed into
some graphs some charts maybe which can
help you understand what exactly is
going down in your data and what exactly
is growing in your business data right
that exactly is known as data
visualization so there are multiple data
visualization tools like Excel PBI
tablet Etc so in this particular
tutorial we will have Excel data
visualization so for a clear
understanding purpose let me show you
what exactly me so this is what I meant
before right so imagine you are given
this particular data set from your
marketing team and just by looking at it
you need to make a business decision do
you think it is possible to make it
business decision no right now what if I
tell you I would like to convert this
into some graphs and charts so that it
helps you understand which is the
category that bringing you the most
number of leads so just select the
category here and go to the Le column
once you have selected those both go to
the insert option here and here you can
see some options for pivot tables pivot
charts charts and spot lines filters
slices and everything I would like to go
with the charts and I'll expand the
button and you can see already Excel is
recommending some charts for you it
would like to go with the bar the peral
chart and other things if you just go
into other forms of charts you have P
chart you have donut chart Etc right
what if I go with a pie
chart something like this or the initial
recommendation which was column chart
right if I go this then I will have this
particular pivot table generated all by
itself from Excel and here you can see
the number of leads given by the
categories so the home category gives me
about 37,000 leads on an yearly basis so
if I go back to sheet one this
particular data set belongs to the year
2020 so in this particular year I have
received about
37,000 leads from home category and
about 39,000 to 40,000 close 49,000 lead
from Office category and Technology
category gave me about 34,00
right now you can understand technology
is not performing so good compared to
home and office now to improve the sales
you might want to make a decision a
business decision apply some office or
add on some marketing uh teams or run
some campaigns to improve the technology
right so you can borrow some of the
profits which made you uh richer from
Home and Office category and invest that
money into the marketing so that that by
the next year you can see some prominent
growth in technology as well which will
make your company a little more richer
right so that exactly is what I meant by
the term data visualization so in this
particular tutorial we will explore data
visualization in Excel so now if we go
back to the insert option once again by
getting back to the sheet one we can
find a lot of charts right all charts
and here you can see colum charts which
we had an example of and here we have
line graph and pie chart bar graph area
graph Etc right we will try to generate
one example of each and every charts
available here and after that the most
important part of today's session I will
help you learn how to automate this
particular task let's say you are a
business analyst working for your
company right and you have generated
data for 2020 tomorrow comes
2021 and you might have to do this task
all together once again and comes 2022
23 24 and 25 and so on would you like to
do this operation again and again and
again right if it's once in a year it's
fine but what if you are supposed to
generate this particular report on a
month-on-month basis or maybe on a week
on WE basis wouldn't be it a little too
mundane right so to avoid that I will
tell you how to automate this task but
before that let's explore all the
available charts for us now let's uh try
to go with the second option in our
charts which happens to be the langine
graph so when so uh it's important to
understand which is the time and which
is the chart you need to take so
whenever you're dealing with dates right
the audit date the delivery date let's
say the problem statement is I want to
understand how the sales are going on a
month on Monon basis right how are the
orders received right which is the month
in the year 2020 which has the highest
ERS receip how would you do that so to
do that you will go with the line drop
which will show you how the ords perform
on a month-on-month basis so so go to
the pivot chart again here and uh let's
we don't want this particular chart here
so um instead
of category and sum of leads we will go
with order date as row which will give
us the months J to December of 2020 and
we will take leads to the values sum of
leads make sure that it is sum of leads
so we are calculating the total leads in
month now select all of this and go to
the chat section here and select the L
gra and press okay there you go now you
can see which was the peak month so we
happen to be the peak month which
performs so well you can also go with
some effects here like adding some
markers and uh you can also change some
colors you can modify the color of the
line the markers Etc right so these are
all the modifications you can do and you
can and the size of your graph for a
better visual so why are you changing
the size of the graph so again uh we
will also discuss the dashboards in this
particular tutorial so once you create a
dashboard you might want to adjust the
sizes of grabs and everything that you
create so uh it looks like a perfect uh
dashboard you can have dets of
everything right so that's the overall
point of creating the dashboard now this
was the second type of graph that we
explored today and uh coming back to the
sheet one once again now if you go to
the insert option here you have a few
more types of charts right so far we
have dealt with the col chart so we have
clustered Stag and everything and we
also explored the line graph now we
would like to go with the bar graph
right now let's say you wanted to know
difference between the leads and traic
let's say you have marketed a specific
product or you have run some campaigns
and the traffic you received is volum
Right a lot of traffic in terms of lacks
or cres or thousands of hundreds right
he never expected those many uh number
of people visiting your website but even
after getting those many number of
traffic numbers the leads are less or
the conversion is less or the orders
received are less let's say 100 people
visited your website but only one or two
people people out of those traffic place
the orders right so you wanted to know
if your marketing is working well or not
right in those scenarios such bars or
such bar grops will help you now let's
cancel this and go back to our pivot
table once again clear
everything clear some Cs and now delete
this particular chart and values or no
traffic values and Order of Lo
values and the rows you want
month select order
date and now select all of these and go
for a chart which looks something like a
Barra so you can see Excel has
automatically selected a graph for the
orders versus traffic here see you can
see the traffic numbers were so high but
the orders were less so here you need to
identify was that one reason which led
to the drop in ERS despite getting high
number of traffic now let's check the
leads if we have good amount of leads
yeah even the leads play the same amount
of Road and decrease in sales so there
is something which you need to change on
the marketing perspective so now let's
go back to the sheet one once again and
check the insert button and here is if
you go down to the options of all charts
you can find the area chart so now let's
try to figure out how to use the area
chart so similarly you can go back to
the pivot table here and uh eliminate
the traffics and P or maybe we can use
the
same data and change the chart maybe
right I select all this and go to the
PIV charts over here and if you get onto
the area chart you can
see traffic we received against the
number of leads if you add orders to it
you can also get the details of orders
against the number of traffic number of
leads and number of ords right so this
this will give you a clear data now you
can also emphasize it a little more
something like this which give a better
picture and you can change the colors of
your graphs that is also possible
now let us get back to the sheet number
one and again to our insert menu and
charts so so far we have covered line
graph uh column graph bar graph air
graph and
P I think we missed by but not a problem
let's go back to that once
again let's close this and going to
sheet two so you can delete this one
and get into theb table once again can
clear
this and C audit date and you can select
category now we have okay audit dat is
suppos to be
removed and now we just have ERS and
there are some of the category select
all the table and go to the perect Chart
or normal charts and select the P chart
and press okay right and if you don't
want this particular pie chart you can
also go with some other types of charts
which are available at this particular
section which look like this a 3D pie
chart or even a doar chart maybe which
looks so the 3D pie chart looks like
something like this and uh it gives you
a better view of what exactly is
happening with the a specific category
and if there are multiple options which
look something like this and if you go
with the to the Chart so basically if
you're choosing the pie chart then you
have these many types of charts which go
along with the pie chart so it's your
opinion or it's your option to go choose
any type of P or to chart so let's go
with the initial one which is a p chart
it's okay and there you go let's quickly
delete this one and go back to sheet one
and uh let's check the other types of
charts available so basically uh you
need to build the business problem and
decide which type of bar graph or which
type of Charter graph is more suitable
uh for that particular problem statement
and makes the solution more readable and
understandable right so that's the
overall motto so proceeding ahead so far
we have covered column line by bar area
Etc right now the next one is the
scatter plot so you can already see
Excel has automatically generated a
scatter plot for series one to three so
basically uh you might be having a lot
of people have a doubt when exactly to
use scatter plot so think of it this way
uh let's say you have an ice cream store
and you wanted to know which time of the
year your iceam sales are increasing
right based on the climate based on the
weather based on the temperature so
during Summers the temperatures are high
so the ice cream sales are high during
that particular season so that can be uh
understood using the scat moving ahead
we have the map chart so uh let's try to
implement a example map order
ID some of orders and instead of order
ID let's take State Now using this we
can try to create a mure
you cannot create that in PIV table so
let's try to repeat you cannot create
that in a pivot table so let's try to do
it in normal
sheet go to Maps here you
come there it is so since we have taken
all the American nations you can see the
darker areas have the highest ORD and
the lighter areas have been leased a so
this is uh this comes handy when you
want to identify that one single state
which which is your biggest customer
which is your biggest client right and
uh now head uh this's dig down which are
the charts still we can cover so uh stop
map so let me select all the data and go
to the chance
ones so the next step of the chart is uh
stocks so you can already see Excel has
already recommending um the category 1 2
3 charts for us so we have different
categories of products in our sales data
So based on that it is providing the
sales performance of our categories and
the surface thre map so you can already
see it is identifying there and tree map
similar to the map data structure tree
map is a geometrical identification of
which particular product is highest
selling so let's try that out right ta
and select the ERS columns and go to the
maps and here you can go to the all
charts option and select the um tree map
option which shows you the highest sales
so uh for that uh you can also apply
this to the pivot table as well go to
Old
charts and dream up okay uh the pivot
table is not supporting anyways so
basically uh if you go back to the
original sheet this is how it looks
like so here you can see the highest
selling product is this one which
happens to be the office tag
ID and so on and the least selling ones
are ailable somewh here in the corner
right now if we expand our chart options
once again we are left out with
histograms sunburnt boxing viscus
waterfall and fan
combo let's select the entire data so
that uh we can make it a little
quicker histogram this is histogram
sample chart this is the box and visus
Sample chart that can be created using
this particular D set to identify sales
of all the major products and this is
the waterfall one where you can see the
increase decrease total so you can also
change the colors the increase can be
turned as green color decrease can be
turned as red color and total can be
turned as a yellow color or something
basically it looks something like this
one a waterfold model which can be an
alternate to the line graph that shows
the increase and decrease in the number
of sales and funnel and a combination so
basically combination is something where
you can identify the let's say you
wanted to identify a particular category
so in office category you might be
having some products related to Pro
office right the office taxs Office
charges Office tables and office shares
right and based on early performance
since the start of the month to the end
of the month how are the products
performing in terms of sales that's what
you can identify from this uh type of a
chart which happens to be a combination
chart so far so good we have a brief
understanding of all the major charts
that you can use in your day-to-day data
visualization now let me um navigate you
to the different part of today's session
let's delete the B let's move on to the
next part of today's session which is
about automating this particular data
analysis uh procedure right uh let me
close this up and I don't want to save
any
results and if I go to the uh downloads
where I have my I have data for 2020
2021 to three and four now I have an
empty folder named as sales data so let
me put one file in that drag and draw
one file into sales data and now I have
an address right let me go back to
Excel and here let me open a
file let me create a new file actually
and blank workspace let me import the
data right go to the data option and get
data from file s we be getting the file
from an Excel file so you can give it as
a file and select folder because we are
okay the overall idea of this what's the
idea of this right uh let's
say this particular sales St you're in
2020 let's imagine you're not in 2020
but let's imagine you're in 2020 right
and it got the data now you happen to go
into 2021 and under new 2021 data has
been successfully created what happens
now is if you just drag and drop that
particular file into this folder the
overall report automatically gets
updated that's the reason we are going
into this procedure uh so to better
understand that I'll leave a tutorial in
the description box below and also you
can follow this tutorial to understand
what exactly I mean right now let's get
back to excel p
go to get data from file and select the
fold from folder and go to downloads
where we have our Sal data select this
part file and open right now the Excel
power query will open up right now if
you're satisfied with your data you can
just load the data and if not you can
just go for the transformation
option right now I think you might be
having a brief idea of excel VBA or
Excel macros where every step can be
registered right now just select the
data double click it and select the data
here and it will give you a brief
preview now you have the first sheet
select the sheet and you'll have a prly
okay select okay and it will be
loading in a moment processing some
queries
so there you go now we will make some
transformations to it firstly we don't
want the first uh column name which is
Source name you can remove it and here
you can see the step has been recorded
right that is very important for us to
understand the automation right now the
next automation step is convert the data
types so here you can see the order ID
we don't want to mess up the order ID we
want to change the order date Del date
right so for that you might want to
change the data type which is not in a
date data type it's just numbers so uh
just double click and change data type
to uh date
right so just select both the delivery
date and audit date double click and
here you can see change data type and
you want to change the data type from
whole number to uh Advanced okay the
date
cancel this s visually change
that change type from whole number
another error don't worry you can just
remove that transmiss step if you don't
want that transformation to be
implemented you can just remove it so
change data type from whole number to
date right now you want to let's say you
want to add a column which shows the
number t St to deliver right now select
the delivery date first then the a date
and
now double click add a column and
here subtract days and here you have it
instead of subtraction you can rename it
as name and number of days okay days to
deliver so here you can identify how
exactly your product is been delivered
and how many days it is taking and if it
is too long you can identify some uh
mistakes with The Delivery Agent or
something like that right so let's have
a track of that now let's keep it along
with the audit date and delivery date
for a but understanding and if you go
ahead here you can see customer ID right
so the problem is customer ID is along
with the customer name so what you want
to do is you want to split the customer
ID and customer name you can do that
just double click and here you can have
split column option buy D limiter and
your D limiter is automatically set to
hyphen since it identified but the issue
is we already have a space there so uh
you have spaces and there you go your
customer ID and customer name are split
so instead of id2 just replace id2 with
customer name there you go another
transformation is
done proceeding ahead uh so we have
quantity traffic leads orders and
revenue and cost to company or status so
we want to identify the profit so we
don't want if you filtered out you can
see delivered and transer not delivered
or Auto canell right so not delivered
and auto canell will be rejected from
the list because we want to identify the
correct profits okay and uh what I mean
by rejecting not delivered or cancel
because canceled orders will be refunded
to the customer so you cannot add that
number to your profits and not delivered
will automatically get cancelled and
again that money will be sent back to
the customer right that money can also
will not added to your overall revenue
or profit right now we want to
identify profit so we want to subtract
revenue from cost of the company right
select Revenue first then cost of the
company and go to add
column and then
substract and you have profit rename
that as
profit and you can drag and drop that
particular thing to here and there you
go now you have a fully uh functional
data set which is fine now you can this
particular data right go to
home here you can close and load right
close save close and
load correct your data will be now
loaded to the D
reset there you go right now you have
the order ID order date delivery date
days to deliver state region customer ID
separated customer name separated and uh
everything else right and you also have
the profit which you made and up table
is ready the ability for you right if
you don't want this you can ignore you
can freshly prepare pivot table for
yourself so now you can create a pivot
table and you can also create all the
charts that you wanted in your dashboard
so so far so good we have successfully
loaded the data now we have everything
in place now what we can do is we can go
ahead and create some dashboards which
is the last part of today's session and
remember youve created a macro before
loading this data into this particular
table okay and this particular data only
has the information from
2020 and our files are from 2020 to 21
22 23 and 24 and in case if in future if
you get 25 we can also add that into the
same folder okay remember that we have
created a macro we have automated the
task of data analysis report or
dashboard correct now we will create a
dashboard and finalize that particular
dashboard in future we're going to drag
the data of 21 22 23 and 24 into the
same folder location and magically all
that data will be uploaded onto the same
dashbo and the data analysis report will
be ready all you have to do is just go
to data and use this refresh option okay
now let's proceed with the creation of
dashboard so first we will select the
region
and
revenue okay and out of this we'll try
to create uh
bar okay this the first
one and let's go back to the sales data
we have the region wise sales and now we
will proceed with category wise
sales and we will insert maybe a pie
chart
or let's rename this as
region Vice
sales this
one let's eliminate this sheet sales
data and Sheet two there's nothing in
sheet two as well right now let's insert
a privot
table in a new work
worksheet select all the data
from the table range in a new worksheet
and now we have a new paper table and
name it as category wise
sales and now we will drag and drop
category into rowes and the aggregation
of Revenue will be
sum right now we will select this data
and insert uh
pie chart good now we are good with
region wise sales and category wise
sales if we go back to the data again
what are the different possibilities a
date and we I think we have uh graphic
leads customer ID region days to
deliver okay we can what we can do is we
can create a line graph for monthon
month sales as well right now let's
select the entire data once again
quickly let's insert a pivot
table and the pivot TBL will be from the
selected range new worksheet let's
rename the worksheet as month on
month
sales is Select order date to Rose ID so
that we get
the month on
Mon the orders Revenue so we'll take
Revenue summation ensure that it is
sumission and now let's
insert a
langra there you go and you can modify
that as I discussed before you can add
markers but I don't want any markers I
want this to be clear and clear and if
you want any other modifications you can
do that as well right now we will create
a new sheet for our dashboard we will
copy this and paste it over here and we
will copy
this paste it
here here you go you might have to
select the cell first okay now finally
category wise sales and
Sal region wise sales is the last one
okay
so we are on the region y sales select
the chart and go to data 6 sheet six and
select any cell paste it okay there you
go we have the three dashboards now you
can rename this sheet as
dashboard there you go now you can if
you want you can save
it okay have a quick look at all the
numbers
right now we have this data for only one
year if you go back to the sales data
and filter the data out you can see as
2020 okay now what we will do is go back
to our download
section there you go these are the
downloads uh let's imagine that we just
received fresh data for all the other
remaining years you can copy or cut the
files I'll cut the files and go to sales
data and paste them right here now we
have the data for 2020 1 2 three and
four correct now close the file come
back to the data set go to data and
click on refresh
all it might take a while but it's
completely fine data will be updated
shortly there you go now it's seems like
the data has been successfully updated
let's check for our satisfaction there
you go now we have the data for 2020 1 2
3 and 4 right now let's quickly go to
the dashboard as well and here if you
refresh you will get the updated report
or dashboard also for all the remaining
other years that is 1 2 3 and four as
well including 2020 so that's how you
can automate the data visualization
process with Excel so far so good we
have understood the various charts
available in Microsoft Excel now let's
go back to the sales data yeah so far we
have understood all the different types
of charts available in Excel the column
the line the P bar area right we have
also built a story line or use case for
each and every chart and we have created
multiple types of these charts and after
that we have understood much about the
pivot tables and pivot charts and after
that we have used Microsoft power Query
in Excel to load and transform the data
so we basically we have also covered
data cleaning and data transformation
and data loading and after that we have
automated the data analysis or data
visualization or data reporting in
Microsoft Excel right now by yeah or so
on 26 or 27 whenever you get a new file
you just have to drag and drop the file
into the location of the sales report
and your data will be updated after that
you will find the report and you can
invest the major part of your time in
which you spend majorly in creating
reports right you can spend that major
time in building strategies and
improving your business and that brings
us to the end of this session on a data
visualization course in Excel if you
