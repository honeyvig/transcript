did you know that in August this year
Google openly admitted that some of its
Gmail accounts were hacked by an Iranian
group fortunately the event was isolated
and was taken care of but rarely our
security breaches this easy to stop with
more and more data moving to the cloud
the prospects of hacks like these have
grown in the past decade exponentially
it's consequently organizations have now
discovered the need to secure the
digital infrastructure against various
attack vectors fueling the need for
ethical hackers in the IT industry so
today's video is all about how you can
learn the ins and outs of hacking and
cyber security irrespective of your
learning background so welcome to our
video on how to become an ethical hacker
by simple learn before we get started
ensure you are subscribe to the channel
so you always stay updated with the
latest Technologies and Trends let's
first clear the air on an ethical
Hacker's role the term hacking has
inherently negative connotations however
this will only be applicable until the
duty of an ethical hacker is properly
understood ethical hackers are the good
people in the hacking field wearing the
white hat so what exactly is the
responsibility of an ethical hacker
instead of utilizing the extensive
computer expertise for criminal purposes
ethical hackers find gaps in data and
computer security for businesses and
organizations worldwide to defend
themselves against hackers with less
than noble intentions ethical hacking is
a subcategory of cyber security that
involves lawfully breaking a system
security mechanisms in order to discover
possible threats and data leaks on the
network ethical hackers can work for
cooperation as independent Freelancers
in how security staff for its website or
its applications or as simulated
offensive cyber Security Professionals
as well
all of these careers need knowledge of
current attack methodologies and tools
albeit the in-house expert may need to
be knowledgeable about a single kind of
software or digital asset but how can
you hone your ethical hacking skills
let's take a look at few steps one can
take while starting a career in this
field the first step is getting
comfortable with Linux there are
operating systems catered specifically
to ethical hackers like Kali Linux and
parrot security both are based on Linux
derivatives and have a plethora of tools
to make your hacking workflow easy and
relatively stress-free the better burst
you are with Linux and its terminal the
quicker you can achieve things when
hacking the next would be to master the
mother of all programming languages
which is the C programming language
since Linux and a lot of back-end code
are written in C having a strong hand
over this programming language is very
important it's always helpful to learn a
couple more relevant languages like
python or JavaScript which will help you
dissect giant pieces of server code like
button
remaining Anonymous is vital in the
hacking sphere since giving a malicious
actor news of your existence on a Target
Network can cause him then to flee or
attack your device instead the usage of
Mac address randomizers and proxy chains
is highly beneficial and recommended
when monitoring networks for criminal
activity and speaking of proxies ethical
hackers must understand networking
fundamentals and exactly how they are
established learning about various
networks and protocols might help you
exploit flaws and ethical hacker with an
extensive understanding of networking
tools such as Wireshark nmap and others
can overcome field incidents relatively
unscale the fifth skill in our list is
traversing the dark web using the famous
store browser most of the internet is
hidden behind the torn networks and
getting a closer look at the people who
often are at the Forefront of the
hacking industry in the dark web
directly can help you familiarize
yourself with a certain domain Secrets
while keeping you updated with the
latest happenings in the cyber crime
World A major advantage that can tip the
skills in the favor of an ethical hacker
is the knowledge of cryptography for
encryption encryption is used in various
elements of information security
including authentication data Integrity
anonymity and others passwords and other
sensitive information are always
encrypted on our Network hacker must
understand how to recognize and break
these encryption standards exploring
vulnerabilities make you a better
ethical hacker simply keeps you aware of
the security measures that are kept in
place as industry standards while
handing you the most advanced
penetration testing tools on the market
learning how to scan networks and
systems for vulnerabilities that might
result in a security breach ethical
hackers may also attempt to write
vulnerabilities to exploit the system in
question as a final tip join forums for
conversations with other hackers
worldwide to trade share expertise and
collaborate Discord ready Telegram and
other platforms all have communities
where you can join and collaborate with
fellow Learners to broaden your learning
Spectrum Tata we understand some B6
skills ethical hackers need to excel in
this domain let us look at the roadmap
one can follow to get started many
ethical hackers begin their careers by
studying computer science you can also
acquire an A plus certification from com
Tia by appearing for and passing to
additional tests these tests assess an
individual's understanding of PC
components and their ability to
disassemble and reassemble a PC however
before advancing in your profession you
must gather experience and obtain on
network Plus or a ccns certification the
network plus certification certifies
fundamental Network expertise such as
Network Administration maintenance
deployment and troubleshooting the CCNA
certification guarantees the same skills
and stripes for foundation level
proficiency once qualified you can
advance to the next level of your career
in network support you'll be responsible
for monitoring and upgrading installing
security software and testing for
vulnerabilities you will obtain
expertise in network security and your
goal should be offered as a position as
a network engineer as a network engineer
you will build and plan networks rather
than simply maintain them your focus
should now be on the security part of
your journey to becoming an ethical
hacker this is the time to focus on
earning a security certifications such
as Security Plus or cissp the U.S
Department of Defense has approved the
Security Plus acquisition which covers
testing on critical areas such as Access
Control identity authentication and
cryptography the cissp certification is
a worldwide recognized security
acquisition that validates the expertise
of risk management Cloud technology and
application development
The Next Step would be to start working
in the information security Division and
information security analyst study
systems and network security engages
with security breaches and strives to
implement Security Solutions for this
profession you should focus on
penetration testing to gain Hands-On
experiences some of the most essential
tools of the trade
getting the certified ethical hacker or
the CES certification should be your top
priority the training will teach you all
you must understand to become a
productive and ethical hacker you will
be engaged in a Hands-On environment
where you will be guided through
breaking into a network and finding any
security flaws after obtaining this
certification you can begin marketing
yourself as a professional ethical
hacker we have already covered some
skills one needs to learn when starting
their Journey however an ethical hacker
has certain rules and responsibilities
that must be carried out ridiculously
the first of which is threat modeling
threat modeling is optimizing network
security by identifying vulnerabilities
and determining counter measures for
avoiding or reducing an attack's impact
on the system a threat is a real or
projected negative incident jeopardizing
the organization's assets the role of an
ethical hacker is to give a thorough
assessment of potentially harmful
assaults and their potential
consequences they can also conduct
information security audits or a
risk-based evaluation of a company
security
these regular exercises assess
Securities Readiness identify it system
weaknesses and offer strategies for
reducing future attack threats they also
assess how successfully security related
policies are implemented resulting in a
report that includes discovered flaws
and appropriate Solutions ethical
writers must be able to collect data
detect vulnerabilities and correlate
risks to create clear and unambiguous
professional reports these evaluations
are frequently used to justify
finalizing security asset expenditures
the market for trained ethical hackers
has never been this expensive according
to various surveys the job outlet for
ethical hackers and information security
analysts is supposed to grow by 33
between 2020 and 2030. companies like
IBM Google and Microsoft are always on
the lookout for train cyber security
