on the hackers road map at the simply
land YouTube channel as vast as the
field of cyber security is there's often
an overflow of information about it at
the same time for people who wish to
know more about how to venture into the
cyber security or ethical hacking space
it is very important for them to know
what's the career progression what are
the skills needed and how a person with
no or bare minimum knowledge can take
their first step in this amazing career
well this video is for all those
individuals who wish to pursue a career

opinion in the comment section below and
now we will start with what is ethical
hacking and how is it different from
hacking so in the world of cyber
security hacking can be broadly
categorized into two types ethical
hacking and unethical hacking ethical
hacking involves using the same tools
and techniques as malicious hackers to
identify and fix security
vulnerabilities before they can be
exploited and these expert known as
Whitehead hackers work with a focus on
security rather on theft and on the
other hand we have unethical hacking
that refers to unauthorized access to
digital devices or networks with
malicious intent performed by black hat
hackers and additionally there are gray
hat hackers who possess knowledge in
offensive and defensive computer use
sometimes working as Security
Consultants during the day and engaging
in black hat activities at night it is
important to understand these
distinctions to protect against cyber
threats effectively now we'll see the
objective or roles of an ethical hacker
ethical hackers also known as whad
hackers use their skills and expertise
to identify vulnerabilities in system
and network before malicious hackers can
exploit them their primary objective is
to simulate real world attacks and help
organization strengthen their security
measures the role of an ethical hacker
involves several key phases and we'll
see those roles and key phases so they
are responsible for reconnaissance
scanning can and maintain access clear
their tracks document their findings and
compile detailed reports
so firstly they conduct thoro Recon
gathering information about the target
system or organization this includes
understanding the organization structure
Network infrastructure and potential
weak points and through scanning they
identify the easiest and quickest
methods to gain access to the network
and gather further information and once
access is gained ethical hackers
maintain it allowing them to exercise
their privileges and control the
connected systems this step helps them
identify any potential security flows
and weaknesses within the network they
also work to clear their tracks covering
their footsteps to evade detection and
ensuring the security Personnel cannot
Trace their activities and throughout
the entire process ethical hackers
document their findings compile detailed
reports on the vulnerabilities
discovered and provide recommendations
to address and mitigate the identified
security issues their vulnerability goal
is to help organization strengthen their
defenses prevent data breaches and
protect sensitive information from
falling into the wrong hands ethical
hacking is a crucial aspect of cyber
security as it allows organizations to
stay one step ahead of cyber threats by
leveraging the skills of ethical hackers
businesses can proactively identify and
address vulnerabilities ensuring the
overall security and integrity of their
digital infrastructure so now we'll see
the skills that needed to be an ethical
hacker
so now we'll see the skills so the first
skill is knowledge of computer networks
then it's the programming languages then
the knowledge of web applications
databases ethical hacking tools and
knowledge of common attack vectors and
techniques then what certificates that
are required for an ethical hacker now
we'll start with knowledge of computer
networks understanding computer networks
is fundamental for ethical hackers this
includes Concepts such as IP addressing
Network protocols example TCP IP routing
switching and firewalls a strong grasp
of how networks function will enable you
to identify vulnerabilities and
potential entry points the next is
programming languages Proficiency in
programming languages is essential for
Effective ethical hacking languages like
python Java C++ and scripting languages
such as Pearl or ruik are widely used in
this field programming skills enable you
to write custom scripts and tools
automate task and exploore
vulnerabilities and the next we have is
the web applications in today's digital
landscape web applications are often the
target of attacks therefore a solid
understanding of web application
architecture protocols example HTTP and
security mechanisms example SSL TLS is
crucial knowledge of web programming
languages like HTML CSS JavaScript and
Frameworks like PHP or asp.net is also
beneficial then we have databases so
databases store and manage sensitive
data making them attractive targets for
hackers familiarize yourself with
database Management systems dvms such as
MySQL Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server
learn about database security including
access control encryption and
vulnerability assessment then we should
focus on the skill to have a knowledge
on ethical hacking tools so to perform
ethical hacking task efficiently you
should be familiar with various hacking
tools these include Network scanners
example nmap vulnerability scanners
example nessus password crackers Joon
the riper packet snipers W shck and
exploitation Frameworks metas sploit
mastering these tools will enhance your
Effectiveness as an ethical hacker then
you should have knowledge of common
attack vectors and techniques that is
understanding common attack vectors and
techniques is vital for an ethical
hacker this includes knowledge of
different types of malware social
engineering Network attacks that is DDOS
and web application vulnerabilities
example crite scripting staying up to
date with the latest threats and attack
methodologies is crucial for Effective
defense the next is certificates so
obtaining relevant certifications
demonstrates your expertise and
commitment to the field certificates
like certified ethical hacker CH
offensive security certificate
professional oscp or coma Security Plus
are highly regarded within the industry
they validate your skills and can boost
your credibility when seeking ethical
hacking opportunities the CH
certification is a multiple choice exam
that evaluates your understanding of the
penetration testing structure and the
tools that are utilized inside it it
gives job Seekers the information
security field a head start start by
ensuring that the certificate holder
understands the fundamentals such as
information gathering attacking
computers or servers Wireless attacks
and social engineering so the objective
CHS inform the public that credentialed
individuals meet or exceed the minimum
standards
second establish and govern minimum
standards of credit
entity third professional information
security specialist in ethical hacking
so now we'll have an exam overview so
the exam name is EC Council certified
ethical hacker and the exam duration is
240 minutes and you will get questions
that is 125 questions you will get in
the exam and it is a multiple choice
question exam and the passing score you
need is
70% and to register for the exam you
should go to peon view or ECC Exam
Center and eligibility criteria for CHS
there are two ways to satisfy the
eligibility criteria that is attend
official CH training and this can be in
any format example instructor Le
training computer Based training or live
online training as long as the program
is approved by EC Council and attempt
without official training in order to be
considered for the EC council
certification exam without without
attending official training you must
have two or more years of documented
information security experience remit a
non-refundable eligibility application
fee of $100 submit completed CH exam
eligibility form including verification
from an employer upon approval EC
Council will email you voucher number to
register for the CH exam so this was all
about the CH exam and now we will move
to the steps to become ethical hacker so
ethical hacking is an exciting and
rapidly growing field that requires a
combination of technical skills
knowledge and a strong sense of Ethics
