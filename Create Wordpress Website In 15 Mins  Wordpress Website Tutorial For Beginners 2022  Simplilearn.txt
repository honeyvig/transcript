hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn
in this video we will create a website
using wordpress
wordpress is perhaps the easiest way to
build a website especially when compared
to thousands of lines of code
if you wish to write blogs or showcase
your photography skills
wordpress offers several amazing
templates and features
but before starting off with wordpress
let's go ahead and go through a few
pointers that we need to keep in mind
for developing and launching a website
on the internet
first
domain name
this is the url that a user types on the
address bar to reach a particular
website
for example wordpress has the domain
name www.wordpress.com
google has a domain name www.google.com
and etc
second
hosting
this is done by a computer and server
that keeps running 24 7.
all the data of our website stays in
that server without hosting users can
reach the website but won't be able to
see anything since data won't be stored
anywhere
third website
this is the part that we'll be working
on in this video
and clearly we are using wordpress for
building the website
now that you are familiar with the
process of building and launching a
website on the internet
let's now start building one using
wordpress
now the first step is creating an
account on the wordpress.com using email
and password
i have already created an account on
wordpress so i'll just log into my
account
click on the create site button on the
screen wordpress has its own custom
setup that guides us through initial
setup of the website the first step
get a domain for our website
so let's enter a domain name say my
website
you can change it anytime you like
we are presented with multiple options
domains that end with dot com and other
similar options usually are chargeable
so for now let's get the free
option that has wordpress appended to
its name
we'll go ahead and select that
wordpress again reminds us that we need
to buy a custom domain name for a
website in order to launch it properly
on the internet
now wordpress offers several templates
to choose from you can choose the one
that suits your needs
click on continue once chosen
while choosing a plan click on the free
version that helps you build simple
websites quickly
now wordpress performs several
operations behind the scenes and a
dashboard is presented on the web page
you may notice the custom domain name in
the address bar that starts with
my website
there are a few things that we need to
do in order to complete the initial
setup
but don't worry wordpress guides us
through the whole initial process
first step is to update the home page
clicking on this button opens your
website editable mode
meaning that you can change
every element in the website
for now let's just change the banner
text
we'll dive into more customizations
later on
also go ahead confirm your mail id for
security purposes
step is to customize the menu
you can change the name
for the options shown in the navigation
bar
i am changing it to explore and about me
you can also add pages which we'll see
later in the video
there are many sections in the sidebar
of the dashboard many of those sections
are not relevant for this tutorial
since they are focused on advanced
feature
while in this video we are building
along with a starters website
although we will need to use some of the
sections and we will go into that in a
minute
you change the theme of the website
for that we can go to the appearance
section and choose anything we like from
a large variety of free themes available
for the website although we have chosen
one already
if you change your mind you can go ahead
and change the theme
next let's check out the pages section
this section contains all the pages used
on our website we can edit these pages
just by clicking on the names and a
separate window opens in which we can
realign delete or add sections and
basically every element of that web page
we can then either preview the changes
or update them so they reflect on the
website
now we also have an option to add a new
page within the pages section
when you click that button a new browser
windows opens
which presents the template of many
kinds of pages that we might want to add
to a website
i'll choose a simple contact us page so
just choose a contact page and that will
get added to our website we can link to
that web page by editing the website and
going into the menu section
now the website settings also contains
several sections in order to edit the
aspects of the website one of them is
the menu section
that we use to link all the pages within
our website
and we do the exact same thing in this
case in order to add the contact page to
the website and add a link to it in the
menu section of the website
we can also edit the website background
and colors to our linking
add or delete website logo also add
additional css whenever needed
let's go back to the admin section and
see what the plugins section has to
offer
there are some really nice third party
plugins that offer a lot more
functionally that what vanilla wordpress
tends to provide
the thing here is that we are using
wordpress.com and in this version of the
website plugins can only be installed if
you are subscribed for a business
account
there is also wordpress org
version that offers plugins without any
extra cost but it is mostly focused on
professional
blogs
and has a complicated initial setup
and the last section that we dive into
is the users section
it shows the list of all the users added
to a particular website
there are a few settings available for
customizing the user properties lastly
if we want to delete our website we can
do so by going over to settings and
clicking on delete website
since this task is irreversible
wordpress gives several warnings and
confirmations before deleting a website
from its server
so there you go you just build your own
website without a line of code all
thanks to wordpress and its intuitive
user interface and website builder
keep in mind that we still have to pay
for a custom domain and a hosting server
in order to launch a newly created blog
on the internet
in case this tutorial entices you to get
your hands dirty with web development we
have a whole youtube playlist on react
and angular javascript framework that
can help you in developing fancy web
applications
and with that we have reached the end of
