hello everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video by simply learn today we
will go on a quest to uncover how to
crack an aptitude test the syllabus for
aptitude test and how you can prepare
for it we'll go through all these
details so stay tuned until the end of
this video at first let's look at the
agenda for today's session we'll begin
this session by looking into the
aptitude examination format after that
we'll discover this lapis for different
sections of the aptitude test and
finally we'll understand how you should
approach the preparation for an aptitude
test i think i have made myself clear
with the agenda so without wasting any
time let's get started with today's
session first let's look into the
aptitude examination format
every placement journey begins with the
aptitude test and it's no surprise that
maximum numbers of students are filtered
away in this round itself so it doesn't
matter how good your technical knowledge
and communication abilities are if you
don't make it through the aptitude
rounds in these rounds you compete with
the thousands of students where the cut
off is not usually pre-decided thus your
performance along with the performance
of your competitors decides whether you
get selected for the next round or not
and concerning this reason it is
absolutely important to be amongst the
top scorers in this exam furthermore the
aptitude exams help employers to
evaluate candidates logical and critical
thinking abilities can the candidate
work with numbers and does he possesses
required problem solving abilities all
these concerns of employers are resolved
via these aptitude tests the factors
such as examination schedule mode of
conduct whether it is online or offline
or the exam duration are planned
according to the company's norms the
level of difficulty for these exams is
dependent on the job role companies
hiring for these tests are moderate for
entry-level job roles and for advanced
level job roles such as software
developer or data analyst these tests
are comparatively difficult the aptitude
test is basically segregated into four
parts verbal reasoning is the first one
here you'll be tested for your
grammatical and linguistic knowledge
then comes the logical reasoning it
checks the candidates ability to extract
and work with the meaning information
and implications from the data and given
patterns next is quantitative analysis
the quantitative reasoning domain test
your ability to use numbers and
mathematical concept to solve
mathematical problems the final section
of this aptitude test is technical
assessment this section assesses
candidates technical expertise for
software development roles you'll get
programming questions and if the role is
related to software testing then you'll
probably get a program or dummy website
to find and locate bugs moving forward
we'll discuss each of these sections in
detail and how you can prepare for them
let's begin with verbal reasoning this
section evaluates how well you can
analyze the written information usually
the format for this section is kind of
fixed you'll receive multiple choice
questions based on reading comprehension
sentence correction para jumbles grammar
and vocabulary let's begin with reading
comprehension the reading comprehension
questions evaluates a person's ability
to swiftly read and absorb written
information you'll be given with a long
paragraph reading which thoroughly might
cost you some time and perhaps strangle
you for time to complete your aptitude
exam that is why our first step is to
perceive the meaning of context via a
quick i read skimming over the text
first and then reading the question and
choosing the right alternative is the
ideal method to approach reading
comprehension problems if you are good
skim reader you may be able to answer
the question at first read itself
otherwise you'll need to rapidly skim
through the text twice or thrice knowing
what you are searching for this time
reading pace and your vocabulary are the
key attributes while dealing with
reading comprehension questions so it is
best that you include reading in your
daily habits doing that will definitely
help you get perfect scores for reading
comprehension question next we have para
jumbles para jumbles are one of the most
prevalent questions in the verbal
ability part in these questions you'll
get a passage with jumble phrases the
sentences must be rearranged in the
correct order so that the paragraph
makes sense and that is what precisely
you will need to do consider the sample
question for an example here we are
supposed to find the logical order of
sentences given below let's first read
them before making any conclusion
statement a says on monday the secretary
of state is due to hold a meeting with
high-level political military and
business figures to further a strategic
dialogue aimed at further expansion of
u.s trade in india the statement b says
u.s secretary of state hillary clinton
arrived in india on sunday for strategic
talks aimed at bolstering bilateral ties
and securing former support for the war
in afghanistan the last statement c
states that clinton arrived by plane in
delhi before noon according to the
reporter traveling with her ahead of
expected talks with prime minister
manmohan singh and president pratibha
patil in evening now if you just skim
through these sentences quickly you can
see that statement b is more of an
introductory statement which is building
the context for other two statements
hence b will be the first statement of
our paragraph further if you move to
statement c you'll notice that it is
expanding details about clinton's
arrival in india also if you arrange
events in chronological order you'll
find statement c is discussing
activities on sunday whereas statement a
is expressing activities to be held on
monday hence it is pretty clear that the
most logical arrangement of given
sentences will be bca
the trick for answering this type of
question is finding opening and closing
sentences and recognizing chronological
patterns or orders of events by
analyzing these facets you'll be able to
pick up the right alternative for these
para jumble questions next up is
sentence correction sentence correction
is most important and high scoring
section of this aptitude test if you
have grammatical knowledge you'll be
able to score perfect scores in these
type of question
generally these questions revolve around
the fundamentals of grammar you should
check whether the given statement
follows the appropriate tense or not
check for errors in the usage of
articles conjunctions etc look into the
subject verb agreement and check if the
sentence says verb is singular or plural
depending on subject of a statement by
looking into these factors you'll be
able to fix possible errors in
statements lastly we have vocabulary
your vocabulary defines your ability to
present your views in an effective way
that is why it is one of the most vital
skills you need to have in working
environment maybe this is the reason why
these kind of questions are included in
every placement test
generally the questions for this section
fall into two categories the first one
is fill in the blanks using an
appropriate word from the given options
and another one is to choose the correct
synonym or antonym for a given word this
can be considered as a scoring area but
you'll need a really good vocabulary to
get the questions right that is why we
suggest you include reading in your
daily habits
moving forward we'll discuss section of
logical reasoning the capacity of a
candidate to grasp and rationally work
through the information given in the
form of diagrams text and numbers is
considered as logical reasoning this
section includes questions based on
series completion setting arrangement
direction sense encoding and decoding
etc we'll discuss each of these facets
one by one let's begin with series
completion in these questions the
applicant is interested with recognizing
a pattern in a given set of numbers or
letters then he'll have to pick an
option that follows the same pattern
otherwise he'll have to identify the
term that does not perfectly match the
logic of the given sequence hence the
main task in these questions is
identifying the logic encrypted in the
set of numbers or characters let's look
at a sample question to better
comprehend this the question says choose
the correct alternative that will
continue the same pattern and replace
the question mark in the given series
now if you are just going to stare at
these numbers then probably you will
skip this kind of question on the day of
examination but the right way to deal
with these questions is to take a closer
look at each of them if you take the
first term of the sequence and remove
the leftmost digit from it then you'll
see the second term of your sequence now
if you observe the second term and
remove the rightmost or unit digit from
it then you'll get the third number of
your sequence that means in this series
the rightmost and leftmost digits are
removed alternatively now moving ahead
if you take the third term and remove
the rightmost digit from it then you'll
get the fourth term of your sequence
similarly to obtain the fifth term
you'll remove the digit at unit place
from the fourth term doing this will
provide you with the correct answer that
is 96542
next up is sitting arrangement these
questions involve arranging the persons
or objects according to the conditions
given in a question you'll have to
understand the seating sequence
direction is the person facing inwards
or outwards etc to be able to conclude
an answer these sorts of questions
include straight line sitting
arrangements and complex arrangements
such as circular rectangular and
triangular seating arrangements we'll
look at one example of circular
arrangement to comprehend how questions
in this section can be primed the
question says p q r s t u v and w are
sitting around the circle and are facing
the center p is second to the right of t
who is neighbor of r and v s is not the
neighbor of p
v is neighbor of u and q is between s
and w and w is between u and s now this
is quite confusing right but it isn't if
you draw each statement on the paper one
by one
according to the introductory statement
eight people are sitting around the
circle so what we'll do is we'll draw
one circle and eight placeholders around
it now we'll take our first statement it
says p is second to the right of t who
is the neighbor of r and v so we'll
first assign any random location to p
and then t will be precisely to the
second left of p so we'll assign a
placeholder to t as well now we move
towards the second statement but from
this statement we cannot make any
inference at this instance so we'll move
to the next one it says v is neighbor of
u and if you remember the second part of
our first statement you'll be able to
figure out locations for r v and u and
those locations will be as shown in
these animations
now moving to the last statement the
statement state that q is not between s
and w and w is between u and s also the
second statement says that s is not the
neighbor of p by mixing these statement
the position of remaining characters can
be marked now we'll have to find out the
immediate right of v and by looking at
this circular arrangement you can say
that our answer is t
next we have direction sense there are
four main directions east west north and
south also there are four cardinal
directions such as northeast northwest
south east and southwest the question in
this section will test your
understanding of these eight directions
we will look at one sample question to
get an idea about these questions the
problem here states that suresh is
standing close to his house in such a
way that its shadow falls on the west
side at sunrise he walks for four
kilometer in same direction then he
turns to the right and goes three
kilometer what minimum distance will be
covered by him to come back to his house
and what direction his house is with
respect to his current location now
let's focus on the first statement of
this question it says that suresh is
standing in a such a way that its shadow
falls on the west side at the time of
sunrise now if you draw a conclusion
from this statement you'll understand
that suresh is actually facing towards
east side moving to the next statement
suresh walks for four kilometer towards
the east side and then turns right to
walk three kilometer more the right hand
side of suresh will be south direction
which means we'll add a line in the
downward direction now if you observe
the starting point ie house from the
current location then you can say that
it is in northwest direction next part
will be calculating the distance between
these two points there is a right angle
triangle formed due to moment of suresh
hence we can use the pythagoras theorem
to figure out an answer real quick and
the answer is 5 kilometers
finally we have encoding and decoding
coding is a process used to encrypt a
word or number in a particular code or
pattern based on some set of rules
whereas decoding is a process to decrypt
the pattern into its original form from
the given quotes in these questions you
will be provided with the logic of
encoding or decoding you'll just have to
interpret that in the problem statement
let's look into one sample question to
figure out how this kind of questions
work the problem statement states that
in a certain language monkey is written
as kmlicw
and then how orange will be written in
the same language the encoded example we
have is monkey which is written as
kmlicw now if you bring alphabetical
numbering to understand the encoded
pattern you'll see that the characters
of encoded text are two places lesser
than the illustrated example by
following the same logic you'll be able
to formulate the correct answer for this
question which will be m p y l e c the
next little tricky section of an
aptitude test is quantitative analysis
quantitative analysis is an inherent and
essential component of an aptitude test
it assesses the numerical and analytical
abilities of candidates by answering
these questions one may put their own
operational techniques and problem
solving skills to the test there are
numerous sub-topics in the cons section
the ones which are most common and hold
good footage are number theory time
speed and distance permutation and
combinations probability percentage
ratio time and work so we'll begin this
with number theory number theory deals
with the universal laws that numbers
follows in this section you'll get
questions about prime numbers rational
numbers mathematical operations such as
multiplication power computation square
root etc we'll also come across
questions based on theorem of reminder a
sum of n even or sum of n odd numbers
let's look at sample question to
comprehend how a question can be primed
for number theory the problem statement
asks us to evaluate the unit digit place
of the given equation how much time do
you think this equation will take can we
even compute the result in 10 minutes
for such a heavy calculation i think if
you solve it expanding each term you
might not be able to solve it within 10
minutes but what if i tell you the cheat
code to solve this question within 10
seconds well let me just get to it the
principle of cyclicity can help us
interpret the unit digit for our
equation let's try to understand what it
is and how it works now if you calculate
the power of number ending with 0 you
will get 0 as a result the same thing
holds true for 3 more numbers those are
1
5 and 6.
now let's discuss about number four
4 to the power 1 will be 4 4 to the
power 2 will be 16 4 to the power 3 will
be 64 and 4 to the power 4 will be 256
by looking at the unit places of these
numbers you can see that 4 to the power
odd number will always result in 4 and 4
to the power any even number will always
result in 6 so we'll just add it here so
4 to the power odd will be 4 and 4 to
the power even will be 6 this thing
holds true for 9 as well 9 to the power
odd number will always result in 9 at
unit place and 9 to the power even
number will always result in 1 at unit
place now we are only left with the last
four numbers and those are
2 3 7 and 8. 2 to the power 1 is always
going to be 2 2 to the power 2 will be 4
2 to the power 3 will be 8 and 2 to the
power 4 will be 16 but here we are just
concerned about unit place so we'll add
6 here this quadruple is what you can
call as force cyclicity next we have 3 3
to the power 1 is always going to be 3 3
to the power 2 is 9 3 to the power 3 is
27 and 3 to the power 4 is 81 but we'll
only consider unit places here so this
will be the cyclicity of 3
next we have 7 7 to the power 1 will be
7 7 to the power 2 will be 49 7 to the
power 3 will be 343 and 7 to the power 4
will result in 2 4 0 1 but we'll only
consider unit places and 7 9 3 1 will be
the quadruple which is going to be the
cyclicity of 7 next we have 8 so 8 to
the power 1 will be 8 8 to the power 2
will be 64 8 to the power 3 will be 512
and 8 to the power 4 is going to be 4096
so 8 4 2 and 6 will be the cyclicity for
8. now that we know all cyclicities
let's face the question we'll take unit
digits of each equation into
consideration now as discussed in the
concept of cyclicity 5 to the power
anything will always result in 5 at unit
place hence 5 to the power
7 will result in 5 next we have 9 to the
power 4 5 3 6 7 and as mentioned earlier
9 to the power any odd number will
always result in 9 at the unit place
hence the answer will be 9 in this case
next is 4 to the power 1 7 9 3 and we
know that 4 to the power odd will always
result in 4 at the unit place thus we'll
get 4 as an output here next it's 7 to
the power 4 9 1 what will be the
resultant for this term well to
determine that what we'll do is we'll
divide this power value 491 with the
cyclicity of number 7 which is 4 and the
remainder of this operation will give
you the order of cyclicity we should
choose and if you remember 7 to the
power 3 will always result in 3 so that
means our output will be 3 in this case
finally the only thing left is
multiplication 4 multiplied by 5 will
result in 20 which means at unit place
will get 0 and 0 into anything will
always result in 0 this means the output
of this equation will be remember the
only key to getting the correct answer
to these questions is plenty of practice
so make sure you do it also please go
through all the concepts definitions and
tricks to improve your speed next we
have time speed and distance the rate at
which an object is moving is also known
as its speed it is the distance traveled
per unit time for example an object is
moving at speed 20 meter per second
shows that an object covers a distance
of 20 meters every second and the
formula for this speed will be distance
upon time and distance will be equal to
speed into time using these formulas you
can solve questions such as time taken
to travel from a to b speed of an object
etc the advanced problems you'll face in
this section are relative speed problems
train and stream that is both problems
let's look at one sample question to
understand how questions will be framed
in this particular section the problem
statement here says that a train can
travel 50 faster than a car both start
from point a at the same time and reach
point b 75 kilometers away from a at the
same time on the way however the train
lost about 12.5 minutes while stopping
at the stations then what will be the
speed of car let's assume the speed of
car is x kilometers per hour and as per
the first line of our problem states the
speed of train is 50 percent faster than
that of car thus by converting this stat
into numbers we can say that speed of
the train is 150 by 100 x
now we know that both train and car are
traveling across path a to b having the
distance of 75 kilometers also both
vehicles start from point a at the same
time and reach point b at the same time
because the train has wasted 12.5
minutes at in between stations this
means time taken by car minus time taken
by train will be equal to 12.5 minutes
as this is the time lost by our train
now remember the formula of speed we
discussed earlier
from this formula we can say that time
equals distance upon speed let's fill
the values in this equation by using the
previous formula the time taken by car
will be 75 by x and the time taken by
train will be 75 upon 150 by 100 x we
also want to convert this time into an r
format so we'll divide 12.5 by 60 by
further simplification this equation
will get 75 by x minus 50 by x will be
125 upon 60 into 10 but further
simplification we'll get 25 by x will be
5 by 24 hence x will be equal to 25 into
24 divided by 5 which is nothing but 120
so the answer to a question is 120
kilometer per hour next we have is
permutations and combinations
permutation refers to the number of ways
a particular set can be arranged where
an order of an arrangement matters it is
the ways to represent a group of objects
by selecting them in a set and forming
subsets here you'll get questions based
on decor cards such as selecting king
out of two decor cards grouping people
to form a committee grouping color-coded
objects in the box etc practice is the
key to solve these pnc questions hence
solve multiple question banks available
online at indiabix.com or
hitbullside.com without looking at
solution and within a matter of time
you'll be able to answer all pnc
questions
next step is probability probability
means the likelihood that an event will
occur the ratio of number of favorable
cases to the total number of possible
cases is given by probability learn
about the decap cards number of queens
kings spades etc this will help you
formulate number of favorable cases in
no time for the questions based on deck
of cards let's look at one sample
question to understand how probability
works our problem statement says that
from a pack of 52 cards two cards are
drawn together at random what is the
probability of both the cards being
kings as mentioned previously the
probability is nothing but the ratio of
favourable cases by the sample space
hence the favorable case will be getting
king in a pick and there are only four
king cards in a pack hence the number of
favorable cases will be 4 c 2 also the
sample space will be 52 c 2 as we'll be
picking two cards out of total 52 cards
thus the probability will be 4 c 2 upon
52 c 2 which will be 4 into 3 upon 52
into 51 which will finally result into 1
by two to one after further
simplification the only key to getting
the right answer is practice so make
sure you go through the multiple online
questionnaires to gauge the command over
this concept next we have is percentage
and ratio the percentage can be divided
into percent age which means per every
100 whereas the ratio is comparison of
two or more numbers that indicate their
sizes in relation to each other here
you'll face multiple questions on
percentage increase and decrease mixture
and allegations substance formation when
the component ratio is given solve
problems from multiple levels of
difficulty to ensure that you get a good
hold of these concepts
lastly we have time and work work is
task or set of activities to achieve a
certain result and time is the duration
given to complete that work or activity
here you'll come across the questions
based on time taken by an individual or
a group of individuals to complete a
piece of work and the formula for that
work done will be equal to the time
taken to finish the work multiplied by
efficiency of a worker also the
efficiency factor is inversely
proportional to the time let's solve one
problem to gauge how this concept works
the problem statement says that a can
lay railway track between two given
stations in 16 days and b can do the
same job in 12 days with help of c they
did the job in 4 days that c alone can
do the job in how much time now you need
to recall the formula for efficiency
that we discussed before some time
efficiency is inversely proportional to
time taken hence the efficiency of abc
will be 1 by 4 efficiency of a alone
will be 1 by 16 and efficiency of b
alone will be 1 by 12. now we have three
known variables and one unknown so by
utilizing available data we can figure
out the efficiency of c the efficiency
of c will be e of abc
minus e of a plus e of b by filling up
the values our equation will look
something like this for further
simplification we can apply lcm to 1 by
12 plus 1 by 16 which will give us this
result and after this computation we'll
be able to reduce our expression to 1 by
4 minus 7 by 48 and computing further
we'll get 5 by 48 as an answer now we
have found the efficiency of c so the
next step will be calculating time
required to finish the task for c alone
and as we know time taken is also
inversely proportional to the efficiency
thus in this case 48 by 5 will be our
answers which reduces to 9 into 3 by 5
after further simplification moving
ahead we'll discuss how you should
approach the preparation for aptitude
exams aptitude preparation generally
takes 4 to 5 months however this time
may vary depending on your ability to
grasp things the first section that you
should take up for preparation is
quantitative analysis the best book for
that are activepedia by villa production
and quantitative aptitude by rs agarwal
you can use these books to learn
concepts and tricks to solve problems in
quick succession you'll also find
multiple problems there to test your
comprehension of each concept after that
go for online material start solving
problems available on indiabix.com
faceprep.com and hitbullside.com for the
logical and verbal section you will not
require any books you can study those
concepts through these well-equipped
aptitude preparation websites as well
with sufficient practice you'll be able
to increase your pace of problem solving
the pace is really important when it
comes to active test as you get only one
minute per question hence try to enhance
your speed of computation for the hard
skill section which we call technical
assessment you can visit websites such
as hackarrank.com hackers.com and
codeship.com for practicing your coding
skills that's all we have for today
