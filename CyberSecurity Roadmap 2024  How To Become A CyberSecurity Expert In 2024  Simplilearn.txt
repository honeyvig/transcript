comment section below so let's get
started so let's start with who is a
cyber security engineer so cyber
security engineer is a professional who
specializes in protecting Computer and
Network systems for digital attacks
these attacks can include hacking
breaches viruses and various forms of
cyber threats here's a breakdown of the
role and responsibilities of a cyber
security engineer let's see the roles
and respons
responsibilities so the first role comes
is system protection that is
implementing and managing Security
Solutions to protect systems networks
and data this includes firewalls
antivirus software and intrusion
detection systems and then comes threat
assessment continuously monitoring and
assessing the security of computer
systems and networks identifying
potential vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by hackers and then comes the
next role that is incident response
responding to an investigating security
breach or any type of cyber security
incident this involves not only
addressing the immediate threat but also
conducting postevent analysis to prevent
future incidents and then comes the next
role security planning developing and
implementing security policies and
protocols they assures that an
organization's data and infrastructure
are protected against potential attacks
keeping systems updated and ped against
non vulnerabilities which is crucial in
defending against rapidly evolving SE
threats this was the next role that
those regular updates and maintenance
and then comes the collaboration that is
working with other it professionals such
as Network administrators and software
developers to ensure that security
considerations are integrated into all
facets of Technology operations and then
comes Education and Training educating
staff and users about good security
practices like identifying fishing
attempts and security personal data so
these are the roles and responsibilities
of cyber security engineer now we will
have a look upon the essential skills
for cyber security engineer so let's
start with them number one on the list
is strong understanding of networking
cyber security Engineers need to have a
deep understanding of networking
protocols how data travels across
networks and the vulnerabilities
associated with different network
configurations then comes the
programming and scripting Proficiency in
programming languages like python C C++
and scripting languages is crucial for
writing custom exploits and tools and
then comes cyber security fundamentals a
solid grasp of basic cyber security
concept steps including threats
vulnerabilities risk management and
security principles is fundamental and
then comes the operating system
familiarity with various operating
systems including Windows Linux and Unix
is essential for understanding their
vulnerabilities and security
configurations and then we have web
application Security on the list that is
knowledge of web Technologies web
application vulnerability such as SQL
injection crite scripting and security
best practices for web development and
then we have penetration testing tools
Proficiency in tools like meta exploit
nmap wi Shar BB suit and other
penetration testing tools used to assess
system vulnerabilities now moving to the
next skill that is
cryptography in this we have an
understanding of encryption decryption
cryptographic algorithms and the role in
securing data and then we have wireless
security on the list that is expertise
in wireless network security including
Wi-Fi encryption protocols and
vulnerabilities so next comes the
security compliance and standards
knowledge of security standards and
compliance regulations such as PCI DSS
hiaa and gdpr and then comes incident
response so being prepared to handle
security incidents and breaches
effectively including forensics and
Analysis and then comes the social
engineering awareness skills
understanding of social engineering
tactics used by attackers to manipulate
individuals into revealing confidential
information and then there's the ethical
mindset a cyber security engineer must
adhere to a strong Cod of ethics and
prioritize responsible disclosure when
vulnerabilities are found so these are
