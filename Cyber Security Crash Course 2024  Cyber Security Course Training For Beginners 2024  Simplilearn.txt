get started let's do the basics first
and then we'll come to the point of
discussion right so let's move on to our
topic of the evening and our first
domain Enterprise infrastructure
security all right uh we'll be
discussing about risk management so
let's start the tonight's topic uh and
uh proceed right so we'll be discussing
about uh risk management in the
information security where you'll
understand the concepts of cyber
security the CIA tried uh we'll
enumerate various factors involving risk
management uh we'll be able to
understand the definition between
quantitative and qualitative risk
analysis and also categorize various
type of security control methods right
and uh normally uh we start with a
scenario all right we start with the
scenario and the scenario is you have
joined a major corporation as a cyber
security specialist in your new role as
a cyber security specialist you must
help in securing the organization's
Information Systems right that's your
job as a cyber security expert a
specialist now your job ental in
protecting systems from cyber risk
threats and vulnerabilities by
monitoring and detecting uh
investigating and analyzing and
responding to security events right
Insurance events so uh the task uh you
have been given are identify the
potential threats uh to the organization
particular assets identify one Liberties
to organiz assets determine risks uh and
for identify risk perform something
known as risk analysis and recommend
appropriate respones this is what you'll
be learning uh on the job as we proceed
the basics first uh what is cyber
security very simple every one of us
knows it refers to the process of
securing sensitive data and critical
systems from cyber threats right we'll
cover what is a threat what is sensitive
data what is vulnerabilities exploits as
we proceed in our discussions right uh
the goal is to protect the
confidentiality integrity and
avalability we'll cover CI tried that is
CI C stands for confidentiality I stands
for integrity a stands for availability
of a organizations critical Assets Now
the assets would be your networks your
computers your programs your data your
human being your facilities anything is
an asset for an organization you agree
with me all of you what is an asset in
an organization anything which is a
property of an organization anything
which gives uh helps boost the
organizations's
uh productivity per right understood
right right so
that is the goal of cyber secur to
protect the organization allow it to
flourish continue doing business right
so let's come to our Blackboard and I
will start
our topic discussions the first topic uh
we'll be discussing about
security and risk
management right would you want
everything in white or would you prefer
a red font how does it look white or red
font your choice white is
better okay great thank
you so I intend to share this with you
once uh every session is complete yeah
ju say F wonderful okay uh white
background is it or black background
with white font this is what I do I use
black background with white font but I
can always change it no problem you can
I have it like this also the white
background with black font good let's
start with that discussion so what I do
normally okay let's have the
introductory discussions yeah okay let's
start with security and risk management
so I'll give you the introduction then
we'll uh move on further uh uh on our
topics so let's have this discussion
completed okay what is the issue right
so information
security and risk management are
analogous with each
other
analogous with each other this is how I
will create notes share it with you at
the end of the day now as you see in uh
it is clear I we can increase the font a
bit more for all of us to see have a
better look right the security and risk
management domain forms the Baseline for
all information security Concepts and
practices now in this topic we'll be
focusing on
Concepts and key
areas such as the asset
protection confidentiality integrity and
availability security governance and
principles
compliance legal and Regulatory issues
that pertain to information security in
the global
context professional
ethics personal security
policies risk management
principles threat
modeling business continuity planning
security risk considerations in
acquisition strategy and
practice security education training and
awareness right at the primary this is
what we'll be covering throughout as we
proceed right so we'll be discussing all
of these one by one now uh this is
something uh which I covering through my
own notes uh through my understanding of
what I have learned throughout the years
right so uh remember this is the
Practical part of it which we are
discussing you'll have to go back and
understand it uh during the weekend or
week whenever you are let's start with
an
illustration so let's start with an
illustration let me get my pen activated
there is it uh please allow me a minute
so that I can set up my white pen and
writer and just give me a second I think
I missed the connect Su okay great so
let's start with a particular
illustration I think I will do one thing
I can't find my pen as of now so I can
create over here itself let's draw
shapes and type it there itself so uh
first thing I will cover the topics one
by one black yeah asset
insert so consider
this as
asset I'll have to I want to get this
box over here right yeah so consider an
asset in an organization right now uh we
will cover the definition let me
complete the diagram and I'll explain it
to you what do you mean by asset and why
we need to discuss on it right so
there's asset then uh when you have an
asset you need to protect the asset
right you need to protect so asset as I
said can be a human resource can be
computers can be your facilities can be
anything right
uh
let's understand an asset
basically
requires protection so let's copy this
get it over here okay I'm creating a
diagram for ease of
understanding oh here I think this
should be good
yeah so it needs
protection once the diagram is ready we
can talk about it in Greater
detail right now this protection will be
based on something and what is that
something what is that something
is okay the CIA Triad which we'll be
discussing in our topics ahead so the
protection has to be based on let's have
this thing again paste we need
requires
requires this thing requires
protection and this protection will be
based on shapes do I have a triangle
yeah will be based on the C Triad which
is C stands for
uh let's make it
bigger Okay C stands for confident
confidentiality right can I copy this uh
and the a stands for
availability uh yeah it would have been
easier I did find the find the pen but
connect to my yeah so a stands for
availability uh the there's an i over
here so let's
have an i which says it is
integrity we'll be covering all these
terminology so those who have are
confused not sure what is happening do
not worry we'll cover it right this is
your C Triad this is your C Tri so
understand we have a asset which
requires protection and this protection
will be based
on
the is based on the CI trial right so
important remember so let's have this
color coded for
ease and actually I'm beautifying it
nothing else so right so that's it make
this as green so that you can see it
better green right so you have an asset
it needs protection the protection will
be based on the CIA Triad right now what
is an asset at the onset what is an
asset asset is it's not straight let's
make it
straight an asset is nothing but let me
make it here we increase the arrows
length so that I can add here and what
is an
asset yeah uh asset is your Hardware
software information people personal let
me see how can I get it yeah oh
interesting okay so your physical
Hardware now this is creating trouble
for me I don't know uh it should have
worked normally it does but I normally
make these diagrams my and I never use
this so this is what is causing the
issue and if I type it is typing
somewhere
else yeah so like I said uh and uh I
assume we are out of the
initial issues right so let's start so
like I said uh the asset uh we were
discussing what is an asset his asset is
nothing but your Hardware so
your
software right then it could
be so it could be your uh people right
and information right all of them are
considered to be Assets Now this is yes
everything is an asset your facilities
also can be called an asset so assets
can be Hardware software people
information and as is the case over all
of them will
require will require excuse
me yeah all of them will require
protection all of them will require
protection okay so uh we need to
protected now we've already talked the
protection will be based on RC I
confidentiality integrity and
availability per se right so let's uh
this oh excuse me
is
misbehaving no interesting it is not
allowing me to delete this is the line
visible okay you are also able to see
this line which has come up
right okay yeah my apologies the you it
should not have happened like
that interesting it is a
glitch okay now let's move on further
and we'll discuss it if the issue comes
now this CIA will primarily be given uh
or will be decided based on certain
certain other aspects right and those
aspects would be your
security
security compliance we'll cover this so
uh you'll understand it better
compliance and policies all right so
this SE IIA will will be primar based on
security compliance and policies now
again this
also will be ensured through the CIA
will be ensured through let me move it a
bit like this can I just use it like
this yeah it will be ensured through
ensured
through security
governance
security
governance right
and through
compliance compliance this will be
demonstrated through compliance right
now uh
understand uh let's get these boxes in
place
so here it
is yeah just trying to get everything in
place um second blocks is the compliance
box over here we'll make it slightly
looking
right
yeah okay here it is excuse
me yeah coming back to our discussion
understand this security govern
governance will be driven through
compliance so this security governance
will be driven through
compliance
so
driven
to compliance okay so as of now most of
you must be feeling that this is Al Gish
but we'll cover it as we proceed so
don't worry right so uh this is a
diagram which will'll be referring
regularly hence I'm creating the the
diagram over here right now this
compliance will be
primarily based on certain aspects such
as so the compliance will be based on
certain things which will be covering
one by one that is legislations or
regulatory uh so let's say
legislative
leges
later then regulatory
regulatory
privacy related
issues right privacy related issues
right
uh
also uh it will be for example let's say
it will be based on PCI DSS now we'll
cover what is PCI DSS as we proceed
regulations Hippa or
gdpr
gdpr right so we'll cover this as we
proceed Now understand uh the most
important thing we need to understand is
an asset it is Hardware software people
information facility everything and all
of it right now this asset needs to be
protected right the asset needs to be
protected and this protection will be
based on confidentiality integrity and
availability right now this CIA will be
demonstrated using compliance which is
primarily based on legislative
regulatory privacy related issues and
regulations and uh the security
governance will ensure it right now what
is security governance it is nothing but
management practices right standards
policies
procedures that is security governance
so a few things to be remembered over
here here it is so remember security
governance is nothing
but management
practices right then it will be your
standards
policies and
procedures procedures we'll cover the
definition uh after this right you
should remember that security
governance can be ensured by proper
management practices standards policies
and procedure es right basically this
complete stuff will give you or will
provide
insights I need to slow down
insights into something known as
security controls the protection
mechanisms right your uh personal
security and
professional
ethics all
right okay now go all of this in is
interrelated hence we are covering it
like that now this particular aspect
of security controls excuse me I just
select yeah
all these aspect of security controls
personal security professional
ethics will
be controlled by or can be ad
using your
compliance right we'll be adhering this
using ading this using compliance right
now each term will be exping explaining
as we proceed ahead so don't
get confused right so this will
be
AED deared through right security
comp okay is the diagram clear right is
the diagram clear asset needs protection
asset is nothing but Hardware software
people information uh protection will be
done through the use of CIA uh
compliance in Integrity availability uh
okay uh this is primarily okay one more
box we'll create so that I can
differentiate otherwise my handwriting
is okay here it is so yeah now this comp
CIA will be basically based on security
compliance and policies right now you
can ensure the CIA by ensuring you have
proper security governance which is
management practices standards policies
and
procedures and this can be demonstrated
using compliance all right and
compliance can be added through security
controls personal security and
professional ethics right this is what
we are covering all in all in this
particular topic right so let's move on
with the explanation for each topic
mentioned over here any questions so far
anything you would like to understand
anything which you like to discuss right
now we can discuss if you have any any
questions we'll be covering
it
okay yeah anything you would like to
discuss now please go ahead no wonderful
wonderful so let's come back to our
primary
discussion and here we
begin uh yes I will share the topic
notes uh dpy with you I will share this
particular page
itself this particular page I will be
pairing with you so do not worry uh I'll
share this document you can ask you can
go through this document whenever you
want and now we have a few questions
we'll address the questions one by one
so normally what I do is uh good the get
the questions here itself so let's
say can
I just give me a second I am stting the
the question so all questions which will
be discussed will add it here itself so
that I can talk about it and give you uh
an Insight so now all those questions
which will be answered uh for the topic
will be here so the first question is
who does the rule uh the question is who
decides the question is from caution
right so let me
just paste it
text only right so the question is who
does uh who decides okay the spelling
okay that does not matter who decides
the rule of
compliance okay so here's the answer for
you uh let me
dictate so the rules of
compliance are typically determined by a
combination
of regulatory
bodies industry standards
organizations governmental agencies and
sometimes International
agreements yeah does that answer your
question
question information in asset means what
so the question
is what information asset means okay so
let me give you the answer on it right
now information asset typically refers
to data and knowledge that is contained
within an
organization right so let's talk about a
bit
more now this particular aspect of
information can be either
tangible or
intangible owned by individuals or or an
organization right now this information
can take various forms and is often
critical to the functioning of an
asset uh there
are various types of Assets in case of
information intellectual
property uh Financial assets
physical
assets digital
assets human
capital do you understand if you talk
about information all these can be
called as assets which are either
tangible or intangible what is tangible
or intangible tangible is something
which can touch intangible which cannot
be touched right like the air you know
it is there but you cannot touch it same
uh if you want to touch a tree it is
there both are
assets okay now how can we ensure that
the Integrity is maintained as per a CIA
now this is a uh topic which will be
discussing in our integrity uh
discussions per se but I can give you an
introduction on it right I can give you
an introduction on it and what is it
about now maintaining
Integrity maintaining
Integrity as a part of the CIA trial
in information security is crucial for
ensuring that the data remains accurate
trustworthy and
unaltered uh this can be achieved by
strategies such
as data
encryption Access
Control Data
validation audit
trials Version
Control uh security training and
awareness backup and
recovery so let's start with our topic
disc so we address questions now we'll
uh work on the
uh terminologies which we used over here
one by one now important things to
remember important
points to remember
here okay let's understand this one by
one the first point assets
require
protection right so this is me typing
now uh there too many typos happening
second
protection is based on the requirements
of
confidentiality
integrity and
availability right for the
asset uh
security is
ensured
through
security governance
that
compromises comprises rather
management
practices and
management and
management
oversight
right
security is demonstrated
through
compliance that
could be
legal or
regulatory in
nature let's try
this now compliance consists of
adherence to applicable legal and
regulat
requirements uh applicable
policies
standards procedures and
guidelines and personal Securities and
policies
also compliance can be affected by
security
issues now these are some of the
important points which we should
remember before we understand each topic
separately right before we understand
the complete terminologies which we saw
until now right so as you see over here
we talked about this diagram as an
introductory nature in this diagram we
need to understand these important
points and topics right this is
something which will allow you to better
understand what is happening and why are
we looking into this particular aspect
right in the diagram this is important
you should remember right so let's
proceed with our further
discussion right wherein we'll be
defining each of the topics one by one
over here so the first
thing let me just cover this question
for
you I will not number it I think
numbering would be difficult but let
let's have the question no State over
here so is Cia
tried company or organization specific I
should have asked you this question but
let's do it
this now the CIA
Triad uh is not specific to any
particular company or organization
instead it is a fundamental Concept in
information security
that applies universally across various
Industries sectors and
organizations also the CIA Tri basically
provides a framework for understanding
and addressing the core objectives of
information
security and these core objectives
are
confidentiality integr and
availability these will be discussed as
we proceed
ahead
yeah uh right so I think not many typos
this should work right so uhin doesn't
answer question it is not organization
specific at the ons wonderful your
question is addressed and put into the
notes for ease of understanding of
everyone now uh can you give an example
of security governance can you give an
example of security governance we
slightly jumping the gun but I can give
an example uh let's
say let's say let me think of an example
for you I will not type it I will just
explain it to you like this now let's
consider an example of a banking
industry yes you belong to which
industry are you working or are you a
student let's I'm just asking it so that
I can uh it'll be easy for me to
discuss yeah
working in which industry are you now
let's consider an example of uh security
governance in the banking industry per
or the sector now if you talk about
confidentiality or uh uh in case of the
banking industry ensuring
confidentiality would be Paramount for
protecting the customers in sensitive
information right because it is
financial now Banks Implement various
measures such as the encryption access
control and authentication mechanisms to
prevent
unauthorized access to customer accounts
and transaction data right so for
example online bank banking platform
will use uh secure web Comm uh
communication right secure connection
connection on https yeah so you'll be
using https connectivity and multiactor
authentication to ensure that only
authorized users can access this account
that is confidentiality if you talk
about integrity you're basically
maintaining the Integrity of financial
transactions by having check sums
digital signature right to basically
verify the electronic transactions and
availability would be ensuring that when
a customer wants to access the banking
platform the online banking platform it
is available whenever it is demanded
without interruption the that is the CIA
now in this example security governance
in the banking industry will incorporate
the principles of the CIA to protect the
customer data maintain the Integrity
ensure the availability by placing
requisite
processes mechanisms standard operating
processes your guidelines and policies
in place so you have to implement the
CIA protect the CIA having a certain set
of what what did we call processes
practices mechanism standards guidelines
in place and we'll cover those
definition as we yeah uh Zarin your
question is answered okay let's proceed
with the uh topic which we were
discussing let's start start with asset
what is an asset so we discussed about
asset but we need to CL clearly
understand what do we understand by the
asset and
uh what all does an asset compromise of
right so let's proceed does that okay
now this is something which always
happens I'm just checking it and it has
again
happen okay yeah here it
is now uh asset can be
tangible that is perceptible by
touch uh an example of a tangible asset
could be a desktop computer or a
laptop assets can be intangible
also uh which are basically not
physically present you cannot touch
it for example uh corporate image or
intellectual property such as the
patents are intangible
assets clear so far so T assets are
tangible and intangible tangible is
basically what you can touch what you
can uh uh perceive uh with a touch right
intangible is something which is
understood we cannot just touch it
right now as a are used by the
organization for business purposes or
business
processes every asset whether tangible
or intangible has a certain intrinsic
value to the
business the value can be
monetary or of
importance or of both
for
example a simple firewall that cost less
than1
$10,000 may be protecting important
business applications worth millions of
dollars is that understood so uh let's
take an example over here for example if
you have the Coca-Cola as an
organization right what is the most
unique selic Point wonderful see sh and
me are thinking of the same line so he's
given the same example of cocaa which
has
Coke as a primary uh what do you say uh
product which they sell right and it it
has a unique formula which is kept
secret for very very long now if your
server which is bought for say $1,000
$10,000 has this formula kept inside the
server server itself is 10,000 but the
formula is worth millions of dollars
right so what is the server is the
tangible asset what is the data which
has the formula is a intangible asset
right so every asset whether it is
tangible or intangible will have value
Associated to it and the value will be
based on either
monetary uh
or uh the intrinsic value of the uh
asset per right so it is important for
the organization that is what you should
understand the weather
is
right right I think that's the right
weather yeah okay understood why asset
and how asset is important how you
should understand uh an organization may
get affected now if this particular
Coca-Cola formula Coke formula is lost
as in it is available on the dark we
won't Coca-Cola lose its unique selling
point its competitive advantage in the
market will they will
right yeah they will right you agree
with me all of
you yeah so you should remember this is
what is an asset and when you have an
asset it needs to be protected if you
don't protect an asset you will lose it
and if you lose it that compromise may
get you out of the business you may file
for
bankruptcy the organization will file
for bankruptcy right so that is why we
need to protect the
asset so if an asset is
compromised for example stolen or
modified and that data or secret
information is
disclosed it will have an impact that
could lead to monetary loss customer
dissatisfaction and or legal and
Regulatory
non-compliance right so this is what is
a problem you may have loss of customers
uh uh loss of money you may loss uh
regulatory issues may come up you'll be
fined you'll be punished there'll be
penalties as an organization that is
something which will cause a lot of
issue question
says yeah I'll do that yeah thank you
can you please explain how people are an
asset now
uh see understand the people are the
most valuable assets within an
organization
because uh they have skills knowledge
experience creativity and relationship
that employee possesses which will
contribute significantly to the success
and competitiveness of the organization
now anything which contributes to the
organization success is considered as
a uh asset
so yeah so when you talk about uh human
beings right uh and how information and
skills of the workforce can be
considered it can be considered under
say intellectual Capital right where
that is collective knowledge expertise
skills of an employee
similarly Innovative Innovation and
creativity can be considered uh such
that when employees are able to innovate
generate ideas right uh customer
relationship uh again employees often
develop very very strong customer
relationship let me just put it in the
bullet points oh here itself so let's
talk one by one on these point so first
one is uh intellectual
Capital so this is where the collective
knowledge expertise and skills of the
employees will represent intellectual
cap
capital uh Innovation and
creativity where employees basically uh
the ability of an employee to innovate
generate new ideas and solve complex
problems again can be considered as a
critical asset for an organization
particularly where the industry are uh
or the industry have a rapid changing
scenario technology is changing
regularly right so that is where
employee can be considered or human
being can be considered as an
asset right so this is where you need to
understand why human being is considered
an asset right similarly uh you will
have customer relationship where a lot
of organizations have employees directly
in touch with the customers now
customers trust these employees uh they
prefer to talk to these employees this
is where customer relationship uh and
the this is where your employee becomes
a uh asset right you cannot let go the
asset because you may even lose the
customer and even your organization
culture comes into play and that culture
basically uh uh
significantly uh what do you
say prefers the employees to be trained
in a certain way to be addressed in a
certain way making them an asset which
is which becomes indispensable or at
least a big time uh have big time
importance to the organization yeah does
it answer your question
uh okay why do you consider them an
asset because there are a lot of things
which they handle and this is uh all
these things which they handle can be
considered
as something which allows the
organization to grow in long term right
okay until types let's proceed
now assets are basically uh grouped or
generally grouped in a certain uh
certain ways and so how are
assets
generally
grouped so let's have this one by one so
first one is physical assets so let me
uh tell you what are physical assets So
Physical assets again are Tang ible in
nature and our examples could be
say your
buildings
buildings
uh
Furniture
right uh HVAC systems
HVAC
systems right uh and so on so forth
right so these are considered as assets
which are physical in nature or physical
assets right so these are how you
can group Assets in various segments one
is physical let's move to the next one
which is Hardware
assets Hardware Assets Now when you talk
about Hardware assets these are in
information security per se if you talk
about examples
it would include your
servers desktops or desktop
computers
laptops
laptops
router network uh
cables and so on so forth yeah so these
are the hardware Assets in information
security per so you are you can
different iate your assets based on this
so we understanding what are the
different groupings of assets we talked
about physical we talk about Hardware
now the next one logically will come as
software
assets what are software assets okay
these are uh intangible assets if you
can refer to software as a intangible
assets right now uh these basically uh
can be utilized or are utilized
organization by having like licenses
right yeah licenses or your intellectual
property can be uh considered over here
uh uh let's example would
be your operating system OS your dbms
database management system right uh
office
applications you are procuring it you do
not have uh you do not have your own
syst system you're buying it under
license to be utilized then your web
servers web
servers uh server softwares as we call
it
softwares right and so on so forth can
be considered as software assets clear
so
far yeah ad says the same product may
cause loss to other company Coca-Cola
example very
true right so those are
software assets right now another group
or another classification of assets
could be
information
information
assets assets right so if you talk about
information assets again these are
intangible in nature and they are owed
by an organization now this is these are
not
owned but licensed right
licensed right in this case these are
owned by the
organization right so example could be
your business
processes
business processes organizations
business processes then uh
policies
procedures
procedures
um customer
information right uh personal
information then uh
agreements and
formulas which
are
developed inh
house in house right those
are so now uh developed inhouse or even
purchase so they are holding them after
purchasing right those are your
information assets clear so far physical
Hardware
information uh software and personal now
last one is
personal
assets now uh these are basically people
associated
with associated with the
organization right for
example your
employees
contractors uh maybe
vendors third party
Consultants right um what
else okay maybe these all few more will
come up here and there so these are your
personal
assets personal assets right got it so
you can group your assets into following
classifications physical Hardware
software information and personal all
these are important clear so far and
interestingly our
friend let's talk about asset now that
we know what is an asset let's talk
about asset protection right so now if
you remember in our diagram we made an
asset and we say it needs to be
protected because it is an asset so
asset protection
we talk about asset protection and what
is it
about in information security
domain asset protection involves
security management practices that are
subjected to business and compliance
requirements such practices for asset
protection are called security controls
various types of security controls would
be physical entry controls to an office
building that allow only authorized
persons monitoring controls such as CCTV
for surveillance of critical assets
right so you have various protection
mechanisms and those protection
protection mechanisms are we referring
to physically stopping someone
monitoring it using
CCTV uh controls such as locks for
Hardware asset for protection from
theft uh tamper proofing controls such
as hashing and encryption for software
and data assets
copyrights or patent for information
access to protect legal
rights identity management systems to
protect personal assets from identity
theft all these are various controls or
protection mechanisms in place right so
now when you have an asset we need to
prot protect that asset for protecting
asset there are various implementation
which can be done a few I have listed
over here yeah now we should understand
that these are not comprehensive list of
security controls it is now this list is
an adhoc list as of now so it will be
basically decided now this kind of asset
protection mechanism will basically be
decided on uh risk uh risk analysis your
evaluation of the risk assessment of the
risk right similarly controls will be
identified through risk mitigation
strategies risk assessment risk uh uh
what do you say uh decision of risk
based on Management's policy and this is
where your analysis of risk management
or risk management procedures will come
into play so asset protection requires
or has a requirement that it would be
based on risk risk in order to
understand the risk we will have to
understand risk assessment and select
the control based on the uh risk
analysis which is done over right so
we'll be discussing this based on the
confidentiality integrity and
availability concept so uh if you have a
software be it open source or whatever
and it is being utilized to uh say uh
create value for a business
okay anything which creates value will
be considered an asset remember that if
be offens Source right now when you talk
about offens Source you can categorize
it into say software assets right you're
not owning it but you can use it and
when you use it you are trying to look
for value does that is that understood
ad is saying open source software is not
included in the assets we can include it
I have not made it comprehensive you can
add a lot of things into it you just I
give you understanding of an asset
okay okay all right so where are we uh
since I'm talking a lot about risk
management let me give you a small
introduction of risk assess uh
management before we proceed for our
discussions on uh the CIA the
confidentiality integrity and
availability now what why am I referring
to it always let where's my
connection this is something which is
important understand uh when you sit for
interviews for your uh as uh say GRC
professional for cyber security what is
GRC stands for governance risk and
compliance
GRC right governance risk and compliance
you'll be asked such questions so you
have first job in Risk Management uh
would be to something known as
inventor
inventor assets so you will basically
make a list of assets held by an
organization these assets will be
prioritized
prioritized now these will be based on
what uh the prioriti will be done on
something known as business impact
analysis the
impact uh this asset will have if it's
compromised in fact if asset is
compromised do you understand it now
when shya said that Coca-Cola is an
asset you list out the asset now if the
Coca-Cola's asset Coca-Cola's formula is
lost then what will happen you'll have a
big impact on the organization now that
impact is what will decide the priority
of an asset for an organization once you
are assets are invented you will
understand the uh value of the assets uh
compromise based on something known
as
quantitative
and
qualitative analysis we'll cover this in
our future
discussions these analysis will allow us
to get something known as a dollar value
for your asset for asset asset right and
what will be the issue in case they are
compromised once we have these dollar
values with us then based on this value
uh we will be
based based on these
calculations we will select
controls we
will select
controls right controls controls are
what protective mechanisms now in case
Coca-Cola's formula you can say controls
can
be controls can
be
encryption yeah Access
Control Access Control right your say c
cctvs your uh guard
dogs right these are controls protective
mechanisms right and once the controls
are in place we cannot stop over there
we'll have to
review the
controls
periodically
periodically because it may so happen
after a certain time period these
controls may not be effective or the
data may not require that of
protection okay this is where your
complete structure of uh Asset
Management asset Security Management and
risk management comes into play now this
is a this is in incr the risk management
discussion which we are going to right
this is the introduction I have given
you so don't worry uh just take it as
I've shown you and I'll give you an
example let's say uh uh let's connect
all these steps as asked over here let's
say uh in the example let's take an
example of our friend Coca-Cola right
coca cocaa right Coca Cola and their
formula for Coca-Cola now if you
consider this formula as your
asset what would you do you will think
that first question in you when you sit
for analysis of a risk with respect to
uh this formula is that
uh who firstly
uh what is the
threat
associated with
this
asset right so now you tell me what
threat is associated with this formula
exactly
breach of uh data right breach of data
uh is a
threat uh now if this next question to
be addressed if you know what is the uh
threat
Associated if you know what is the
threat Associated which is breach of
data then you need to un answer next
question how much
loss how much loss will happen if this
is loss if this happens if this things
becomes successful or you can call it
as
if the
risk
materializes
materializes then what is the case right
so if you now know that the asset is
Coca-Cola's formula the threat is breach
of data then you will know the weakness
now what is this this is the weakness or
vulnerability vulnerability you know the
vulnerability you know the threat right
once you know the vulnerability the
weakness and the threat and you need to
understand the impact it will have on
the business find out the dollar value
so you'll have to calculate the dollar
value based on say what do you feel
about it what will happen to the
business we will say I feel I know that
the business will be out of uh I mean it
will it won't be able to function we
will lose competive advantage that is
known as
quanti or sorry that is known as
qualitative
analysis what you feel about it the
feeling of it yeah so impact is high
medium or low what is called the impact
would be
high
medium or low and at the same time you
can also use
another calculative method which is
known
as
quantitive analysis now you'll use
analysis this is where you'll use
mathematics and get something known as
dollar value so you know that there will
be a $10 million loss in case this
formula is loss I'm just giving you ad
hoc number what do you get you get the
understanding what is the impact on the
business business now you know that
based on this value
now
based on this
value we now
know
what will
happen if
this
asset is
lost right we know right understood
we'll know this right that if this asset
is loss we calculated it we understood
it now based on that you will select a
select
a
protective
mechanism to
protect this
asset asset understood is that
understood say we have the formula
coming up when we come to this is just a
generalized discussion we have we have
the formula coming up right so now we
know for example let's say when I said
uh when I said the
loss or the value of this compr asset is
said $10 million right $10 million now
you will put protect put a control put a
control which will not cost or which
will be l less than the loss of uh
compromise as in we want something which
is costing us or saving us from this
loss and does not cost itself uh $10
million and more the the cost of the
control as is the case over here right
so we select something which is saving
on the uh compromise and also not
costing us us that much so if by any
chance the cost of the control is higher
than the compr itself the management
will not approve you understand that
right if cost of
control is greater
than
loss
after compromise as in let's say if the
data is lost I lose $10 but in order to
protect the data I need $100 will the
management approve
it yes will the manager approve it
Senior Management will approve prove it
is a no right financially economically
does not make a sense that's the reason
you put a control if the control is
within now this is again with respect to
risk strategy this is where so you'll
think of risk strategy in this case so
you will either uh excuse me
strategy you will either
accept
risk mitigate risk
uh avoid
risk right accept miate avoid and what
is it another
one uh accept mitigate avoid what is the
fourth one anyone
knows transfer very nice transfer thank
you so what is accept I accept that this
is loss is going to happen I do not
intend to do anything mitigate I will
reduce the levels of the I will reduce
the impact aoid I'll just totally leave
it and transfer I'll basically do an
insurance something like that okay that
is where R strategy come into place okay
so the control in this case will be
placed will be
encryption uh of the
formula uh
guards
dogs
CCTV uh building with access control
everything yeah so on so forth and
understood is it I just ran through the
example to explain it but we'll be
covering it as we proceed in the session
what we understood last time was about
risk management we understood what is
the cyber security before we proceed uh
further uh how many of you are
proficient in Linux have been handling
Linux operating system uh wherein you
can do uh commands on the terminal uh
maybe run an application to uh scanning
and all through the ter terminal how
many of you are uh proficient in it
right so this is your K Linux machine
which you'll be using now that K is up
uh excuse me let me just complete a few
Theory things once the theory is
complete uh we'll be discussing uh Linux
today primarily uh the command line uh
of Linux terminal and how you navigate
around the Linux machines okay I'm
setting a small 15 questions lenux quiz
for all of you which we'll be running
now just to understand about Linux uh
comfort of your
people uh the class code just a sec I'll
share it uh we'll have this quiz running
right now
Linux
Basics plus uh create a login and then
we log in just use the uh the class code
is given on your url can you see the URL
if I just use your own uh if on the
screen can you see on this part of the
URL uh you have the class code mentioned
that you can
use uh at the answer just login Linux
basics
uh one
sec uh the class code ganga you're
already a part of the class right oh the
link expired no problem I'll share
it so uh we talked about CIA Triad uh
confidentiality integrity and
availability as such uh how it needs to
be
protected we understood the CIA tried we
understood what is confidentiality
Integrity availability and the attacks
on them uh basically uh each threat each
particular uh uh what do you say the
pillar of cyber security that is the
confidentiality integrity and
availability has various threats
Associated to it uh those will be
intentional attacks primarily the man in
the middle attacks the packet sniffing
attacks the hacking attacks there could
be accidental leakage through unread
employees right someone who is
misconfigured something right there
could be issues with authentication
authorization and failures okay because
there's lack of lease privilege need to
know they could be Hardware or software
failures that's a threat to the
confidentiality again how do you protect
yourself if there's an issue for uh if
there's a threat to the confidentiality
you encrypt you ensure there's Access
Control mechanisms in place you have
administrative controls now the biggest
example of administrative controls is
the documentation which is done the
various uh agreements which are done for
example when you join a new organization
normally you sign something known as uh
the acceptable use policy how many of
you have signed a acceptable use policy
and a non-disclosure policy in an
organization just say yes on the chat if
have right Sha has done it Niha everyone
has seen now what is this this is
basically a administrative control a
counter measure a protection mechanism
in order to protect the organization
against breach of confidentiality right
so that is a administrative control okay
uh rest all is very clear right then
comes Integrity as we all know Integrity
is something wherein we do not want
unauthorized changes to data by
unauthorized or authorized users now
remember one very interesting fact about
integrity Integrity is to be protected
at any given moment for either the data
at rest or the data in transit data at
rest which stored with you which has
which is archived with you or the
organization and data at uh Transit data
in motion is something where in data is
moving on the network that Network could
be internet that Network could be
intranet right and it has to be
protected anyone anyone uh doeses
anything as an if it's an authorized
user making unauthorized changes that is
not should not happen if it's an
unauthorized user obviously they should
not be uh allowed to do any changes to
the data that is integrity and the
protection required for it I've already
covered the threat there should not be
accidental modification uh there should
not be intentional
alteration uh another threat is system
malfunction now sometimes your system
just crashes and it causes uh what do
you call it your basically there's a
corruption in the data that is system
manfacturing issue and there could be
environmental factors now if you have a
uh hard disk which is a magnetic hard
disk with you and you place it on a uh
say a speaker on your at home which has
a magnet Building inside you will
realize that your data will get
corrupted right these are environmental
factor or if there's a strong uh em uh
environment electromagnetic environment
around the magnetic hardest your data
will get corrupted so that is what is
the threat to integrate yeah so with
covered this I'm just covering the
slides per se what is the production
mechanism you use cryptographic hash to
ensure that the data can be checked if
there's a Integrity breach or not it
cannot avoid uh a threat to Integrity
but it can tell you if the data has been
compromised or not right similarly check
some database Integrity referential
Integrity yeah so we are checking about
the Integrity right we are checking if
the data is being has been changed in
transit on or not for example let's say
you have an organization wherein the
data is backed up every few hours in a
backup facility away from the main
facility now this data uh will be
utilized whenever there's a situation
there's an incident where in the backup
is to be uh called upon for restoring
the systems now in order to the backup
in order that the backup should work we
also have to regularly check check if
the data is still relevant if the data
is still good the Integrity is not
compromised right that is where your
hashes will come into play we have
cryptographic discussions coming ahead
but understand what is a cryptographic
hash cryptographic hash is something
which is a oneway function uh by oneway
function I mean to say that uh any input
given to this algorithm the
cryptographic hash algorithm or hashing
algorithm
will make give you a fixed output of a
string of characters these string of
characters are nonreversible as in if
you have these string of characters you
cannot go to the input first thing
secondly a small change in the input
will have a corresponding large change
on the output that means if the data is
being sent on the uh data has been
compromis even by minutest of the bits
there'll be huge change in the hashing
value and that tells you that the data
has been tampered with the attack is on
the Integrity of the data you understood
cryptographic hash yeah at least the
concept you got it right we'll have a
greater discussion coming on it at least
the hash is clear uh the Integrity is
clear wonderful thank you Zarin ARA
let's move on okay uh then availability
now very simple if you go on amazon.com
and you try and order a particular
product
so an example it's very easy uh for
hashing algorithm uh for cryptographic
hash let's give you an example uh
hash calculator actually I wanted but
let's see yeah yeah it
is yeah which is the online hashing
algorithm right uh
now now let's say Amit is sending data
to S right and the data
says we will have a
secret
meeting at 22 100 hours tonight right so
this is your message with Amit is
sending sending to sayi you are working
and say the CIA or or any intelligence
agency and you're sending this data to
one another and uh we are we want to the
both of them want to ensure that the
data is not Chang in the transa so what
they do they decide that we will receive
the data irrespective but we will pred
decide an algorithm for hashing now that
algorithm as for them we can have
several algorithms as you see on the
screen over here let's say they recite
an hatching algorithm of md5 this is one
of the few hashing algorithm just an
example they decide that the Integrity
check will be done with md5 algorithm
right between both of them Sai and Amit
now this is the message which is sent
along with the message the hashing value
is also sent so what what does Amit do
he first creates the message then runs
the md5 algorithm and gets the hash
value so what does amid do let's say I
will send you uh on the chat also uh
this is your message and the hash value
I'll put it on the chat itself so this
is the hash value so what amid does he
sends the message encrypted unencrypted
however and a hash value along with the
message can you see on the chat Amit has
sent both the
details right so I've sent it on the
slack Channel too now what happens is
Avinash is an hacker who is standing in
between both of them there's a amit's
computer or the messaging system is
compromised what avash does he changes
this to say he just adds instead of 2200
R he makes it 2300 RS can you see Small
Change not much change right rest all
stays the same
and uh he sends this message to uh he
sends it ahead right now when uh our
friend uh Sai receives this message he
calculates the hashing value right now
ainash the hacker does not know what uh
algorithm is utilized for hashing just
uh assume that he does not know anything
so what s does when he receives the
message he sees the hash value right he
sees the hash value so this is the
message I'm sending on chat right now
and the hash value uh which our friend
Sai calculates is visible over here now
let's compare both the values let's
compare both the values so for this the
hashing value got too fast yeah so this
is the hashing value and the previous
example this is the hashing value can
you see does the hash value match
tell me do the hash values match his
team they don't what does it tell s when
he calculates the hash value see is that
the values do not match because he has
the previous value sent by Amit and he
has now calculate calculated his own md5
Ash algorithm value for this particular
data what does uh s know now SI says
that data has been tampered with it is
not a shity that it's a compromise
because uh sometimes when you send data
on the network it may so happen the data
gets corrupted right so there's a
possibility that either there's a
compromise or there's a system failure
but the data has compromised the data
has tampered right the data is changed
obviously the data cannot be relied on
do you get the concept uh yeah this is
how hash works this is how your
integrity check works so now this is
exactly what happens when the data flows
from the
internet when uh you send data from a
client to a server along with the data a
hash value is sent and this is exactly
what happens between the client and
server pre-calculated hash is sent and
post receipt of the data the server also
calculates the
hash yeah the server also calculates the
hash B that's the point uh when Sai
receives this message he knows the uh
that he has to meet at $2300
but he also knows the data is tampered
with obviously he will not follow the
instructions the data he says the
message has been tampered with that
means somebody has a malicious intent of
changing the data somebody has changed
it and when something is changed you
don't work on it and then there are
other channels to confirm what was the
message and all that is a different
thing all right just say yes if you do
yeah this receiver has absolutely no
idea what change has been done he just
knows knows the data is changed he has
absolutely no idea what has changed but
he knows the data is changed and once
you know the data is changed you just
drop the data simple right I will not
follow the instructions or you will ask
for retransmission in the network
language because the hash changed the
value changed yes the hash value is sent
by the sender to the receiver yes there
are ways and means to crack the hash
there are ways and means to protect the
hash we'll come to that we will yes yes
every time uh we receive a message we
will calculate the hash value compare it
this is exactly what happens on the
network also on internet also everything
depends on everything but hash will give
you the Integrity
check as in it confirm if the data has
been compromised tampered or changed or
not yeah there are enormous number of uh
algorithms attacker can keep on trying
however long he wants so she wants how
would uh tell me you have received a
message 10 times with different hash
values from the sender will you still
believe in the message you won't right
the hashes algorithm are pre decided
between the sender and receiver it's a
part of initial handshake I'll show you
a demo on that uh I can give you a demo
on that but we'll divert completely the
attacker can spoof ipce but change in
data the attacker cannot control the
hash value yeah I can show you in fact I
am going to show you uh uh internet
transaction how does Internet
transaction happens where how you start
the connectivity how hashes are uh how
algorithms are exchanged how data is
transmitted how everything is calculated
it will work yeah we uh it's a part of
uh my syllabus uh not just simply learns
an additional thing to tell which I will
show it to you if you want to understand
the name I'll be talking about TCP hand
check uh on the network I'll be talking
about TLS handshake uh do you understand
what is a TLS
hand do you know what is a TLS yes full
form please if you don't know it TLS is
yeah yeah tell me see when data is
transmitted over the Internet it is
known as transport layer security yeah
that is encrypted right when the data is
sent so the TLs is a transport layer
security approach and this is where your
data is encrypted along the net in the
network and for that the algorithms are
pred decided the handshake tells so um
now that we have jumped into it let me
tell you what happens is let's say I am
talking to mahavir so I cannot just talk
to mahavir right I will first seek his
permission I will say mahavir may I talk
to you mahavir will say yes let's talk
what am I doing I'm sending a
synchronous request to mahavir mahavir
is is sending me synchronous
acknowledgement as in mahavir is saying
yes we can talk I say yes that's good I
send an acknowledgement this synchronous
uh request sent from me to mahavir
synchronous acknowledgement sent from
mahavir to me and I sending yes final
yes acknowledgement is what is know as
sinak act T TCP handshake this is known
as TCP handshake once you have the TCP
hand check completed then we decide uh
mahavir I belong to Kat
I speak Canada uh I also know Hindi I
also know English which language do
would you prefer now what am I doing we
are deciding on a common communication
protocol uh so Mah will say I belong to
Rajasthan uh I know Rajasthani I know
English I know Hindi uh we can talk in
English what is it happening we are
deciding on protocols we are deciding on
the communication line we are deciding
on the encryption algorithms we are
deciding on hashing algorithm this is
known as a TLS and chick once you decide
on the language we also decide what code
to you do you use D nagri do you use
English do you use uh any other uh what
do you say uh script what is it we are
discussing the encryption
mechanism now when mahavir and me are
talking everything is pred decided what
codes will use for encryption English
right uh how frequently will we speak
now once we finish this approach
approach we when we finish everything
that now we have decided to talk we
decided our algorithms and we say now
let's we are done with talking we'll
close the connection that's a reset
right we'll cover that at the onset
understand what is this so this is
exactly what happens on the network a
lot of handshaking happens a lot of data
is exchanged uh within with each other
only then your communication happens now
everything happens with a blink of an
eyelid because the modern day
communication system so you won't know
about it but it happens and this will be
done I will show this on live example
I've given you a analogic analogous
example I will show you using wi Shar
how does it look on the network right I
love giving that example it's an awesome
example and I'll show you how it works
uh with time so we understand Linux
today uh if time permits we'll go
further ahead and we will also
understand the STS hand check in the
cryptography TLS TCP hand check in the
cryptography mod in Greater detail so
yeah so let's move to the threats I'm
glad you understood yeah so CIA Tri so
what is a threat to the availability I
was coming to Amazon when Amazon you're
trying to order a product and Amazon is
down what is happening an authorized
user is not able to place an order you
will get frustrated right and that is an
attack on availability Amazon will lose
business uh and reputation at the same
time right so that is what is so
uh it can be a denial of service attack
or a Dos dos stands for denial of uh
distributed denial of service attack
right that's a malicious intent for
stopping Services ofer service provider
simple as that right so this is there
can be a uh see if you have a Data
Center and there's a power failure what
is it it may also lead to denial of
service availability attack on the
network right if there's a power failure
similarly if your hwac system your AC
what do you call it hwac what's the full
form hwac I keep on forgetting it your
climate control system basically in the
uh uh yeah the full form is heating
ventilation and air conditioning HVAC
now when you have this climate control
system uh inside your data center it
fails that may also lead in server being
uh the server performance being hampered
so your availability is hampered that is
what is the point say I am attacked I am
an attacker and you are a web server
right uh I am I am sending you unlimited
number of request uh let's say uh Aruba
wants to uh get some service from the
web server but since I'm sending
unlimited number of requests the server
is not able to cater for request from
any authorized user yeah the server is
not able to cater for request because
there are too many request coming from a
attacker a single attacker that is
denial of service attack now if I tell
100 people I pay 10 10 Rupees to 100
people and all of them I tell them to
send continuous request to a particular
server that is distributed inal of
service as in I have distributed attack
to multiple locations okay this is an
analogous example we'll have a technical
example shown to you you can use a tool
by the name of hping 3 to send icmp
request now we will cover that as you
proceed icmp request that so many pings
are being sent to the server that server
is unable to service a authorized
request right that's a dos and dos
separation wonderful glad you understood
it let's move how do you Ensure High
availability okay you have a uh data
center you'll have a standby data center
backup system right which will work if
one goes down the other will take on
immediately you may have backups in
place archives in place which works
right so that helps at the same time you
have protection mechanisms the ipss the
inent prevention systems intent division
uh detection systems you may have uh
firewalls in place right you may have
raid five configs as Kell has given that
allows you to ensure that your data your
service is available at all given times
to the users right so that's
availability now we also discussed about
risk again we gave a formula right risk
was impact into likelihood basically
it's a combination of probability of or
a likelihood of an event
right now event can be positive and
negative but what what we are discussing
over here we're talking about a negative
incident event which is happened that is
a risk uh with reference to negative
incident let's say uh there's a data we
can have two different incidents talked
about let's say your power uh
connectivity to the data center goes
down it's an event right a negative
event and what is the risk because that
happens your server availability or net
system availability may go down right at
the same time there's a possibility that
there's a hardware damage which will
happen agree so that's a risk now what
is a risk it is the probability that
this power system will go down that is
risk do you understand risk as such it's
combination of likelihood that something
will happen of this sort that is risk
it's a probability yeah now in formula's
case you can say uh risk can be impact
into
likelihood impact multiplied by
likelihood what is the possibility of a
right we talked about data center now
what is the possibility your data in
this data center may be breached that's
a likelihood what is the probability
that it will help and once the data is
breached what would be impact on the
business as such how much will be the
damage that is the impact right this
damage can be calculated in terms of of
dollar values money right or reputation
as such so we discussed about
Coca-Cola's formula last time so what is
the risk associated to it it is the
likelihood that this CES formula is
breached right what is the likelihood it
is a percentage value and if this
formula is breached what would be the
impact with reference to the damage
potential and the dollar value and
reputation loss for the organizations I
right so the risk is high because impact
is higher likelihood is a possibility so
impact multiplied by likelihood will
give you risk do you understand risk now
likelihood a to impact that's risk with
me all of you risk
understood right so uh I gave this
example already the same thing which is
available on the screen uh a server is
an asset to the organization in This
Server I give this example during a last
discussion in this server about 25% of
the data is an unencrypted format
there's a 25% data which is an un
encrypted format and what uh if a
particular uh vulnerability that is a
weak rule in the firewall allows a
threat agent compromise this data okay
then this risk is materialized okay okay
I'm talking about the terminology risk
is materialized there is a loss of uh
data to the organization and what is the
counter measure you basically ensure
that the weak rule in the firewall
is replaced amended
reconfigured yeah got it okay okay
coming back to right so that is the
example over here right so examples of
the risk there could be a fire a threat
agent can be a fire a clueless user
uneducated un aware user can be a threat
agent malicious Insider now there's a
user there's a employee who's not
promoted due to whatever reason has may
have malicious intent for compromising
the organization right so that's a
malicious Insider hacker someone who has
uh alterior motives to gain Financial uh
benefits by compromising an organization
using his or her skills right that is a
hacker is that clear so a risk can be
associated with natural disasters uh can
be associated with unawareness of a
employee user vendor contractor human
being right and can be Associated a
malicious external entity and a
technical option also where in your
Power Systems HVAC systems May Fail your
understand those are the examples of
risk great okay we also discussed about
asset we are uh red discussing asset can
be tangible intangible tangible
something which you can touch intangible
something we understand but cannot touch
right tangible your server is a tangible
thing the data inside the server is an
intangible thing your reputation of an
organization is a intangible thing right
these this is an asset so anything which
has value to the organization can be
considered as an asset right okay uh in
connection with uh asset there are two
major terminologies we should understand
one is sensitivity one is criticality
now sensitivity is nothing but a unit of
impact that dis unauthorized disclosure
of information may have an organization
as in when a uh risk
materializes the amount of impact this
risk or unauthorized disclosure will
have on the organization is
sensitivity is sensitivity we talk about
criticality per se again it's a measure
of impact that failure of a system to
function as required will have will have
an organization so it will determine how
important an asset is to the business
will the business continue to work or
not will the business continue to
business or not will the business have a
repetition uh loss or not that's is
sensitivity and criticality yeah okay
asset classification now
we discussed about uh inventor various
Assets in organization right when we
inventor assets we also need to
priortize the assets right and this
prioritization of the assets have uh has
to be done in a certain using certain
processes so what do you do you
priortize the asset based on based on
the business value right now uh we've
already discussed this and I'm sure you
remember
that what what do you mean by the
business value you ask the question what
will be the impact on the business if
this asset is lost that will give you
the business value right so Coca-Cola's
formula big business value so high
priety asset maybe uh a CCTV camera
going faulty on the gate uh maybe lesser
uh business value lesser impact right so
that's asset classification
now this uh business value can be asside
based on combination of criticality and
the sensitivity this will also allow us
to understand if a particular asset is
of higher value what are the risk
associated with it how much is the asset
uh exposed to a risk what is the
likelihood what is the impact who all
would be interested in this particular
asset the competitors the malicious
insiders the hackers
yeah the misconfiguration so on you know
who's the threat agent what is the risk
what could be the impact and what is the
sensitivity and criticality so you get
an understanding when you know what is
your asset so once you know what is
important would be uh the threat to that
important thing uh which is important to
us right and based on that we can have
the classific classification level
assigned to an asset so uh the
classification can be secret top secret
confidential unclass yeah that kind of
uh classification once you know that a
particular data Coca-Cola's formula for
Coke is a top
secret uh has top secret data
classification we know that only only
certain people can should handle this
data and you should have requisite
protection mechanisms on this data right
very very strong protection mechanisms
one of them being encryptions now once
you know that uh what classification
level is it what production mechanisms
in place you will Define uh you can
allocate the resources to the asset
again remember I told you uh last time
also that these production mechanisms
should make uh business sense it should
be economically viable you cannot have a
data which is worth say 100 or asset
which is worth $100 having a prod ction
mechanism of $200 on it right it should
always be it should always make business
sense it should always make economical
sense right so this is how you will be
doing asset classification you will
understand why asset classification is
done and how does it help us right asset
classification great
great okay we already talked about
identification of asset you must first
identify something to protect uh then
manage the
risk think if the asset is tangible or
intangible right and ensure that there
are production mechanisms placed in
there understand the criticality and all
yeah that's asset identification now
with this we come to the basic Linux
command Linux commands which we are
supposed to discuss right a small
introduction to Linux okay so as you see
on the screen uh for all those who have
not seen Linux before uh
we are talking about K Linux right now
most of the Linux flavors will have
their own layout generally it will be
same uh like Windows has the start
button uh this particular dragon on the
left side left corner top we give you
the menu for all applications which are
installed on this particular machine uh
the browser is seen over here on the tab
on the uh what do you call it this
particular panel the top panel which has
a watch on the right side uh timer and
the calendar on the right side you can
shut down the machine using the button
uh given over here we are not going to
shut it down
cancel uh the connectivity is seen over
here you'll have data connectivity
reflected over here your mic speakers
everything will be reflected over here
you can also see the
browsers on the menu wherein if you look
at all
applications uh you'll find the browser
listed over here itself so there's a
Chromium browser installed there's a
Firefox installed we'll be primarily
using Firefox in our uh work over here
so let's open okay uh for the browser
for internet connectivity so similar to
Windows machine your Firefox on Linux
looks same so if you see this is how
your Firefox browser looks browser looks
so you can open any URL you want
here simple right so like Windows even
Linux uses a similar same browsers for
that matter uh the Internet Explorer or
the edge browser will not work on Linux
otherwise Firefox okay Safari for Mac
will not have option in Linux but
otherwise Firefox Chrome and several
other browsers are working uh
interoperable between various operating
systems right so you can use a browser
to surf the Internet now Linux is
primarily known to various uh people as
a uh what do you say it has an
availability of something known as a
terminal which allows you to run
commands which is very popular about
between Linux users which is very
popular between the Linux users and this
is what allows them to do a lot of tasks
without actually open any any
application running it by typing it on
the terminal now what you see on the
screen I clicked on the red uh box over
here which is the terminal for the K
Linux machine uh this allows you to run
various commands on the uh machine for
doing various task we need to do uh on
the dragon if you go you'll find other
terminals also available we'll be using
the Terminator terminal already
available in this particular machine
right similar layout will be there on on
our UB to machine also if you open that
right uh let me expose you to the
terminal a bit more okay what you see
over here is Kali Ander first thing
which comes over here is known as the
username the Kali over here is the
username username the user right uh and
the given Kali after this is the system
name if you can call it the system name
right so let's say if I make it if I
change
user can you see so the user from Kali
changed to root user so like Windows has
admin
user uh Linux has something known as a
root user we are a root user on a
Kali uh system yeah do you get
it and what you see over here is the
current
directory slome SL Cali Kali is the
current
directory
understood we just understanding layout
over
here now do you see the difference the
root user is the admin user in case of
Khali capable of running uh
administrative level privileges on a
Linux machine so this is the root
user I shifted to the root user by using
command pseudo Sue now uh we'll be
covering this when I do pseudo Su and
give a password uh the admin password
which I have already given hence you
don't see it you will find the user
changes from normal Khali user which is
a low privilege account to a high
privilege root admin
account yeah uh even Android is a Linux
based
system okay and what you see this the
second Khali is the system per say this
is the system name yeah this is the
system name after that what you see on
the slome Cali is known as the current
directory location there is a current
directory location in lenux everything
is known as a directory right everything
is known as a directory so understand
the terminology is as of uh when you
come to the Kali user you see this still
day it is known as still day right and
this is also the current directory
basically a short hand for users home
directory a short hand for users home
directory this still day this this and
this is
same okay users home
directory now let's talk about commands
which we can run on Linux now what is a
command understand command is nothing
but uh a software program so when
executed on a command line CLI command
line interface it performs the action on
the computer now again I'll say again
command uh is a software program when
executed on a CLI that is command line
interface it performs a action on the
computer so to execute a command the
first step is to type the name of the
command to execute a command the first
step is to type the name of the command
right so in this example the command I'm
typing is
LS what is it
LS and I
enter what do you see what is happening
on the screen right now what am I doing
in Alis all those who know Linux will
tell you that uh it is a command to list
the contents of the present directory
yeah this is a command which is listing
the contents of the present directory so
by itself the ls command is listing
files and directories in the current
working directory at this point you
shouldn't uh shouldn't worry too much
about the output of the command instead
focus on understanding how to format and
execute commands right so the Lis
command covered is incomplete uh we'll
be covering this as we proceed ahead
right this is listing details LS right
uh now many commands can be used by
themselves with no further input the way
we saw LS right some commands however
require additional input to run
correctly uh so those inputs will be
something looking something like this so
if you say clear the screen command this
will be a command then you'll give some
option and possibly some
arguments right so this is the general
structure of commands which will be
listed on the
terminal yeah so options are basically
used to modify the core behavior of the
command this options given over here
will be utilized to uh modify the core
behavior of a command while arguments
are used to provide additional
information what additional information
may be a file name or a username each
option and argument is normally
separated by a space
okay however you there are some options
wherein uh they could be combined also
so this is the general layout of command
command options and arguments now you
have to keep in mind that Linux unlike
Windows is case sensitive we have to
keep in mind that Linux un unlike
Windows is case
sensitive so whenever you use commands
and options and arguments and variables
and file names we have to exactly put
the uh case sensitive word word anything
wrong you will not list for example
let's say I want to move into the
downloads
directories downloads
directory I'm CD I'm changing directory
just understand what I'm telling right
now so immediately I move to the down
downloads can you see the directory
location has changed to downloads
visible all of you right now
just understand I used D capital and
spelling downloads however if I say
CD
downloads what error does it say it says
no such file or directory
exists for us human beings this and this
is same where even for Windows I think
uh case does not matter but in case of
Linux the case matters a big deal it
will not do the command if the case does
not matter okay so let's move
on with
arguments
so uh we talked about the command
options and arguments now when you type
uh when you see the format of say
command command
options
argument right
yeah so an argument can be used this
argument or arguments can be used to
specify something for command to act
upon so if Lis is the given command
which we saw before so let's say let's
delete
this if LS is a uh given command see
it's a class in it itself Linux has a
lot of things to do but I'll give you an
concept and then we'll after Linux we'll
have a good break
okay so like I said uh if the Lis
command is given uh the name of the
directory as an argument it will list
the contents of that directory so let's
say if I just use LS it will give me the
contents of the present directory if I
use LS and say uh give me contents of
say
documents it will give me the contents
of document directory as of now we have
nothing listed in the documents
directory
hence it is giving me a uh blank over
here let me see if I can find uh another
directory do I have this directory with
me yeah so if I say
lscp it will list out details on this T
now as of now don't worry what directory
I have gone into just understand I have
listed uh directory listings from
another location by giving an argument
of the directory name to the ls command
yeah this is how now you can also use
multiple arguments to list out details
for example uh we used one uh LS command
to list out a directory we can use the
same LS command by giving another space
to list out another directory say let's
say uh we
use to uh Slash HC
I can use what SSH let's say
SSH you see two different directory
listings can be visible this is the
below one is for directly SSS directory
the above one is for triple P directory
right so I can use uh LS command with
multiple arguments and list out contents
of two different directories right given
as ARG arents over there understood
that's in basic arguments which we have
there right now we have when we talked
about command options arguments we have
discussed about arguments let's talk
about options so what are the options we
talking about this is the one we are
talking command options
arguments this is where we discuss about
command discussed about arguments let's
discuss about options
let's discuss about
options Now options can be used with
commands to expand or modify the way a
command behaves again options can be
used with commands to expand or modify
the way a command behaves for
example uh if you use option Dash L
right uh for LS
command it will give long listing
providing additional information about
the files that are listed so if I just
do normal
LS this is the listing and if I do LS
and- L is long listing it will give me
additional details what are the
additional details over
here the size uh uh of the file the
permissions of the file right so on so
forth will be given over here right now
you have to note that uh we have used
small L small case L over here Dash L
right uh that is a lower CL L if you use
cap uh
uh what do you say a easy way to
remember this would be Dash L is a
pneumonic for long listing right this is
Dash L can be considered as a long
listing yeah okay yeah so we are
understand it is case sensitive
okay similarly if you want uh to look
into directories recursively you can use
R right ls-
R okay so now uh I'm sorry not
recursively I stand corrected this
prints the results in a reverse
alphabetical order so if you see if I
did just LS it is going in a
uh descending alphabetical order a Ab CD
e FG if you do Dash R it will do a
reverse way right it will reverse it
that ls- R similarly you can do long
listing long listing by using-
LR yeah so file permissions the file
size the date it was created and it is
done given in the reverse lineup moving
from n to D in this case right reverse
lineup so in most cases options can be
used in conjunction with other options
so what we have done we have combined
two options long listing and reverse uh
uh listing of the files together right
so we are given separate options
together the combination of these
options will result in Long listing
output in Reverse alphabetical order as
you seen over here right
now uh you have if you ask me will the
order matter no that is not important
that is not important in this
case yeah so coming back a few more
things I need to cover now when you do
ls- L this by default gives you the file
sizes in bytes H when you do ls- L It Is
by default giving you the sizes of the
file in bytes so these are the sizes the
4 496 496 1769 are sizes of the files
which are in bytes if you want to make
it human readable right as if you
understand uh the Lang make it easier
for a humans to understand you can
use ls-
LH right and this will give you the file
size in human rable format so 4 K 4K 4K
16 m 16 right so this is what is a human
readable
format right now options are generally
are single letters as you see Dash l h
and all however sometimes there are
words or phrases as well right uh
typically older commands use single
letters while the newer commands use
complete words for options right single
letter options uh are proceed Ed by
single Dash Okay like when you do ls- L
it's a single letter with single Dash
right however when you use full uh word
options you'll be using Double Dash so
let me just clear the screen right
you'll be using double hash for example
if you remember
ls-h H will give you human readable uh
we'll have to do long listing to make it
better
understanding so this will give you
human readable
uh format in a single letter the same
thing you can do by
using a complete word a full word option
just
human readable and just enter it will
give you the same output but you can use
these similar options so such options
also come up if you have a single letter
one dash if you have a word Double Dash
yeah so if you want to see directory
listing in human letter readable format
for any
directory uh let's say which one we have
SSS directory
uh it is if I say slash Etc SL
search it will give me human Ral format
the same format I can get it
using a word as an
option let
space human
readable enter same options will come up
nothing changes only thing options
sometimes the options will be like this
sometimes it will be like this right oh
excuse me okay
similarly uh so when a command is
executed in a terminal it is stored in a
location uh in a history list per se so
it is this is designed to make uh it
easy to execute same commands so later
eliminating the need to retype the
entire command so your commands are
basically saved somewhere in the history
to allow you to retype you can use your
up Arrow to go through the commands I'm
using my up Arrow right now to go
through all the commands Okay and now
the entire history of the commands is
run which are run in the current session
can be displayed using the up Arrow
repeatedly one by one
right now when you do the up arrow and
press enter the command will run again
simple so if I go go on doing this up
arrow and just press enter the command
will run again which is saved in the
history so you don't have to type your
commands right in case you want to edit
a command you can use the left and right
arrow to edit edit it so in case I want
to list out in in of SSH I want to list
out say the PPA directory I can change
it and enter it allows me so you can use
the history uh to move around uh to move
around the commands which are used prior
the left and right arrow to change the
positions and uh use for editing right
uh let's see in case you want to see all
the commands instead of using up Arrow
which were done today you can type
history oh excuse me
and it will list out all the commands so
that we have run a total of 35 commands
in the session has started right
everything will be listed over
here see this three command I gave a
wrong command also
visible yeah m is telling type the
command uh giving space before the
command it will not show in history
interesting let's try it out so if I
just give a space prior to the command
and say um let's use a new command
date right enter so it has given me the
date right now let's try history it's an
interesting uh thing we need to
discuss yeah it's not
showing interesting Mur thank you so
what Mur has told us if I use the see if
I use
date okay it's not doing it wonderful so
where do you use it mly this command how
does it
help so if I do date right now and do
history you will see the date is listed
at the 37th command over here however if
I add a space at the start of the
command and type uh let's use another
command uh what command should I use
let's use n map
enter and now check
history okay that end map command is not
there oh interesting that's interesting
great so
uh I'm using Google over here to
download the cheat sheet
so you can also use Google that is
easier but
uh
okay yeah this is a eight page document
for
Linux complete detail right so I'll
share this one too for
you cheat sheet
close yeah so the cheat sheet is
uploaded you can have a look not
everything can work out uh using these
cheat sheets but uh you need practice
excuse me right you need to find and do
practice okay now one more important
thing uh you should understand something
known as external commands now external
commands are basically binary executable
stored in the directories that are
searched by the shell so if a user types
LS command then the shell searches
through the directories that are listed
in the path variable right uh so if a
command does not behave as expected or
or if a command is not accessible that
uh it should have been accessible uh
then you can uh it will be extremely
tedious to find this file right manually
so you can use a command by the name of
which okay you can use which so if you
want to know more about a command
another important thing uh let's
complete this first which and you can
give the command name say which LS okay
oh okay
say which LS it should give you a
path actually this should give you this
should have given you a location of a
command where the ls is there if I just
say which python will it give
me which
python yeah so uh it did not give it for
Lis but let's see if I know where is
python uh variable or where is python if
if in in short in a generalized
understanding where is python installed
you can find it using which Command
right this helps you to understand if a
particular file is installed or not
available in the system only right so
that's your
python uh uh that's your wit command
what
else now uh we saw directory listing
right LS we have discussed the uh
initial command options arguments
similarly if you have to change the
directory you can use
CD and CD stands for change directory
and the directory name which is uh to be
changed to you can just select and you
will find the directory has been changed
can you see that you can use the CD
command to move within the directories
if you want to understand the present
working directory you can find use that
using
PWD present
working directory that will give you
present working directory got it so uh
now if you do not know something about a
command you can use the manual which is
in Linux
man command so if you want to get
details about any command just say man
and the command's name it will list out
the details about the command it will
give you what is this LS command it will
give you list directory contents how do
you use it synopsis is given it will
give you description about this file and
options which we can use about use this
with this right so this is how uh man
commands you in case you do not know
what is man you can find out details
using man Manual of the man itself can
you see I opened a manual for man
command itself so it is an interface to
system reference manuals what is it it
is an interface to system reference
manual and it will give you a
description of each thing which you can
do with this command uh the examples are
given C I give you this example right
man LS displays the manual page for the
item LS or the program
LS got it similarly if you say uh man
man. 7 it will give you the manual page
for macro page man in section seven so
you can find a section in a particular
manual using the number itself right so
that's your
manual okay uh what else let me see okay
in case you want to get help for a
command uh then you can use let's say
Dash H as help right if does not exist
you can use Double Dash and full word
either of it works can you see when I
said Dash L it did not work - L it did
not work when I said dash dash help it
gave me details about this command so
one way getting detail about a command
is using manual if you want a a small
descriptive uh understanding you can use
dash dash help as is the case over here
to find out details about the command
right all
options right uh okay now
we talked about LS we talked about CD we
talked about
PWD uh present working directory we
understood where are we with respects to
the location we could change the
directory now a bit about the directory
structure of Linux so Linux has a
particular directory systems structure
so now on a Windows system the top level
directory is called my computer all of
you are already aware of it right uh so
it is the top level directory on Windows
the physical devices such as the hard
drives USB drives the network drives
show up under the my computer uh option
and are each assigned a drive letter
right uh such as the C drive D drive
that is how Windows works the directory
structure which Linux has is slightly
different uh let me just show you
directory structure
so if I just
okay EXC
me so this is the directory structure of
Linux as you see on the
screen let me explain it to you now as
you see in the screen uh these uh the
directory
structure uh is an example over here as
a screen it it uh it is present within
the virtual environment right of the uh
lenux machine now like Windows Linux
directory structure typically is called
file system also has a uh a top level so
uh it is called the root directory the
one you see on the top is the root
directory and it's symbolized by slash
character the slash character over here
can you see yeah so and it this root
directory is the slash character
additional there are no drives in the
Linux remember each physical device is
accessible under a directory as opposed
to a drive letter in the windows it is
oppos understand as of now and you'll be
uh we'll be discussing it further when
we move inside so to view contents of a
directory you will be using LS as we
already know so if you want to
understand uh see the contents of a root
directory you can just say LS /l and
you'll get the contents of a root
directory can you see that we are
getting the contents of a root directory
by using ls- L same thing which is given
in the diagram over here right I'm
getting this boot Etc proc Dev mentioned
over here so can you see boot Etc yeah
all the directories which are in the
root directory can be seen over here
right where is it where we yeah so now
we can list out the contents of the
directory of the root directory as we
saw in the path over here right using
the ls command we've already done that
now we should notice that there are many
directories with descriptive names right
like the slash boot directory which will
which contains files to boot the
computer if you want to see the slash
boot you can just
CD FL
boot LS and you'll find the uh files to
boot the computer inside this directory
hence the name boot right so like
Windows uh this is the master directory
boot the my computer directory like like
my computer uh and you will have the
details over here the boot directories
right root directory will have boot
directory boot directory will have
computers files which allow the computer
to boot boot boot person right now the
term home directory often confuses of
various people right home directory
often is confused confused by various
people let me just come back here yeah
so to begin with on most Linux
distribution there is a directory called
home can you see this home directory
over
here right under the root directory
there's a home directory now under this
home directory there's a directory for
each user on the system so if I just go
to let's say I go back to my root
directory I say Lis you'll find the boot
directory I'll find the home directory
right inside the home
directory I will
find the directory for each user as of
now this computer has only one user
hence only one uh directory for user is
mentioned over wonderful what I can do
is let's create a
user let's create a user and I'll show
you if I create a user if I have to
create a user I can use command sudo
user ad uh user
ad and what name should we give let's
give a
enter so user is created now like I said
in the root directory there's a home
folder uh home folder will which has or
rather which has users of that
particular computer if I just say
home you will
oh T not good just a sec Why didn't it
show the
user where did we create
it it should have created the user in
the root
directory I created a user right it did
not give an error what I did I created a
user to be listed over here but somehow
that user is not available in this
directory that's interesting I will have
to look where did I go
wrong okay let's come back to that later
I actually wanted to show you but yeah
so now uh like I said if you go to the
home directory you will find the users
listed over there now the directory name
is same as the name of the user so when
I said Lis SLO
sorry LS
SLO since there's a Kali user I see the
kalii name as the directory name over
there right so if you have say a system
admin user you'll find the system admin
name given in the folder over here right
so we are the K user and the K user
folder is seen over here okay moving on
uh okay the home directory again
remember it's an important directory to
begin with when a user opens the cell it
automatically is placed in the home
directory right typically where you work
that's the uh importance of directory uh
like I said PWD will give you the
present working directory if you do
PWD it will give you the present working
directory if I use change the user to
sudo Sudo
Su
yeah and if I say PWD the present work
directory is still home right but the
user is root but the user is root
right so present working directory
basically points to the working
directory okay we have a few questions
let me address it one by
one uh balraj is saying is there any
difference in the folder color it seems
different colors of folders right so uh
okay in a typical Linux terminal the
color of the folders vary right uh
because of the configuration per se
now uh depending on the distribution uh
we'll have different colors uh so by
default directories are often displayed
in different colors to differentiate
there from the regular files uh so let's
say if I just say uh as you see just a
sec as you see over here this is a uh
tar file a compressed file which has a
different color a regular directory has
a different color if I make make a file
uh executable then the name will it will
become
green
yeah okay what is the difference between
sud sudo and
Sue
okay
basically I using the super user uh
Command right so Pudo and Sue again uh
in most Linux and operating uh Linux
systems or Unix systems
uh we uh let's say
um if you want to do something in
elevated privileges right if you want to
execute some command in elevated
privileges you will use the pseudo
command or in full form it is super user
do so let me just type it for you the
Pudo basically stands
for yeah see sud sudo stands for super
user do they've not given a full form oh
have they given it no now this is
basically to execute a
command uh in a super user and to
execute a command in a uh elevated
privilege they use pseudo so basically
pseudo allows you uh allows a user to
execute a command as another user
typically the root user what is it the
root user so when I say I'm running
let's say I'm ex exiting this to normal
user now if I say want to open a
particular application which requires
administrative privileges I may not be
able to run it so let's say I say net
discover so this is another command uh
disc discover we use it does not have
net discover is it net
discover
okay
see it is it says this is most like
caused by lack of administrative
privileges associated with your user
account so then the user account is not
allowed to run a command because there
are privilege resolution however if I
just use Pudo just pseudo and net
Discover it will allow me to run the
command can you see the command has
started working what is it I am
elevating privilege uh David just that
answer your question sudo allows a user
to execute a command uh typically as a
super user or a root user got it if you
say what is Sue just this so I can tell
you
man man sue does it give me yeah so what
is Sue run a command with substitute
user and group ID so now basically Su
stands for switch user if you can use
the full form Su stands for switch user
sudo stand for super user to right now
this Su allows a user to become another
user typically again you can change it
to administrator or some other user
person got
it yeah wonderful uh if it's about
Terminals and you're working uh on a
terminal on a Linux use manual command
or help command to get more details it
will be much more easier so if I say
nmap I can use Manual of nmap to give me
details nmap is a tool which is a
network scanner we'll be using wait for
it yeah so this is nmap I press Q I can
quit it
similarly yeah similarly I can use nmap
dash for
help yes all commands can be tested in
the lab I am doing it in the simply
learn lab
if I this n-h it will give me help
command so your help is available on the
terminal so you can get more
details can we change the password of
the user the lab using
commands uh maybe you will not have the
permission if the lab vendor is smart
enough which he is because I know him uh
he will not allow you to change the
password of the lab
user okay should not actually you can
try it out okay but there there's no
guarantee I would not recommend it uh
you can play around with your own
machines with respect to credentials
however it is not recommended that you
uh do it over here okay wonderful
um right where
we right so moving
on so as we saw we can change
directories using CD and you can move
within directories we saw what is the
home directory we saw
uh what is a root directory what is the
structure of the directory right uh if
you move to a particular directory use
CD if you say let's say if you're moving
uh into a CD documents directory right
there are multiple directories okay not
here CD if you have to move out of a
directory you can use CD dot dot and you
see you can revert back to the previous
directory you're moving One Directory up
using the CD dot dot now if you say move
to uh directory CD
downloads
downloads one
sec happened yeah let me clear the
screen when I is can we do any
installation launch any application
using Kali yes yes you can
uh if you want to let me just complete
this I'll show you that too so if I move
to the CD directory somehow my lab has
got
stuck okay I move to the download
directory if I move further into okay
there's no sub directory in the
downloads is
it where was a subd directory
available let's move to a subdirectory
somewhere but my lab is wait wait wait
yeah
scratched just a second let the terminal
open
up hm uh V is asking can we install
anything yes I'll show you that but let
the lab start give me a
minute okay here's the lab okay the
terminal is open I do not want another
one let's clear the
screen yeah so uh do I have any other
directory in downloads no let's see if
we have something in the
home
directory documents do not have anything
okay let's create one uh that will be
easy so if I move into a directory I
want to create a directory I can use
command make
di sorry mkd make Di and I can make a
folder a right so that's how I create a
directory inside a
directory right AAP I can move into the
directory like like this AAP as you see
I am inside the directory I can list out
the contents of the directory if it
anything is present over
there see nothing in the directory if I
want to create a file I can use a
command
touch to create a file a do uh
text do
text enter now what is that created it
has created a black blank
page blank document a. text as you see
the size of this page is zero because
nothing is inside right now there are
two three ways of uh creating the file
one is what I showed you other one is
you can use Nano which is an Editor to
create a file or change a file so we
create
a1. text using Nano enter
so this is a kind of structure so this
is
a test
document this is a test document right I
can say control X and Y for saving the
document and enter right crol X Y enter
now if I say I if I list out details ls-
L I will
find two files listed over
here one with 25 bytes of data one with
zero bytes one was created with touch
other was created with Nano similarly to
Nano there are other editors which can
be utilized one of the few famous one is
whim so you can use whim to just let's
to edit the a
file all right so I'm editing so this is
another editor which allows you to edit
the file but it is certain this is
particular
method in which you can edit the file if
I want to enter something in this wiim
command I say I for insert I have to
type insert as soon as I type insert
you'll see a insert prompt is given over
here now I can type over here this is
a test
file right and we can add
to uh how do I save it I say I type uh
press escape on the
keyboard right you see the insert prompt
is gone then do
colon uh just type colon W for right and
Q for
quit enter I will write the changes and
quit now if I
say LS
DOL enter you will find that the 22 bite
worth data is created in the previous
file the time of change and everything
is visible over here see all of you
clear with
me
yeah okay
great okay let's move on now once you
another way of uh can you repeat this
again which one the whim one okay arind
is telling me if you I use x it will uh
directly do everything okay we'll try
that so if I say whim
and the file name so uh Sor and I
enter this is the file I see I can make
changes to the file let's say I delete
this
two and type new
alphabet sorry I have to press I for
insert once I insert I can type anything
I want to
right now in order to save the file
there are two options one was Escape I
say
W for right Q for quit another option
our friend uh arind has given wherein I
can use colon and X to exit let's see if
it
works yeah I have exited let's look if
the change has been Incorporated in our
file so cat a.
text you see so Vim you open the Wim
file then you press
I for
insert make changes as for
requirement and then you can use colon
and X to save and exit I used to use
colon and WQ right both of them are same
yeah okay understood
say okay great uh we have a question
from David David is asking does Linux
have something like batch files in
Windows okay yes Linux has a similar
concept uh to Windows batch files uh
dobat files if you call it and they are
known as shell
scripts yeah David they are known as let
me just exit
this what is
it
yeah okay so there are shell scripts now
these shell Scripts are text files
containing commands that are interpreted
and executed by the shell interpreters
right so that's our shell scripts so
we'll be using shell script so if you
want to uh create a uh say a simple
shell script now that you have come to
this and we are using editors another
editor which will help us do is a gedit
so I'm we are create we talked about
Nano we talk about whim another textb
editor is gedit do we have gedit in this
well let's see we'll have to install
so in case G edit I say I don't have
this file I say enter Linux will tell me
that the file does not exist and we can
install it now this is the question when
somebody was asking that can I install
applications yes you can use sudo app
install and the application which is to
be installed G edit in this case let's
install this uh application and you can
install it can you see it's being
installed on my Khali so anything you
have to install you can use Pudo app
install and the name of the application
and you'll be able to install it as you
see on the screen it is happening right
now where in this application wasn't
there and we are installing
it yes
sure if you do not have a application
you can use Pudo app install and the
application name to install the
application
simple say sud sudo app install and the
application name in this case I have
installed gedit which is a textex based
editor for Linux machines where are you
yeah yes
okay great so now that we are uh we've
seen whim we've seen
Nano we've seen whm we've seen Nano
let's work on our options to use a a
text based
editor let's work on our options to use
a text based editor such as gedit so if
I say G edit and I say
a uh I give the file name right
enter a text base editor like uh Windows
has a notepad a similar thing will pop
up like this and I can change the file
as for my liking over here also can you
see I can change it
I'm changing the
file
yes now uh David was asking do we have
batch file so in Linux we have shell
scripts let's create a small script file
now this is Bash scripting uh not a part
of your course but an interesting thing
if you want to learn however it is not
compulsory you just need to understand
it okay so let's start uh I am creating
a bash file a simple script uh let's say
slash
bash and we are going to uh echo or
print out on the screen uh we want to
print
out say
um hello how are
you I'm doing it in the editor right and
I add a question mark a
quote right
also uh we will ask the bash script to
list out files in the current directory
like this right so uh in order to save
this document it is simple I just say
control s like we do in Windows and the
file is saved the file is saved we can
close
this okay control L I have cleared the
screen I say
Lis you will find the file is here ap.
text right the the file which we created
and the file size must have changed if
you remember it was 20 uh bytes now it
is 46
byes and
uh there is no execute this file is not
an executable in order to create this
file uh make this file executable you'll
use the command
change mod CH
mod right uh plus X for making making it
executable and the file
name right uh I should have saved it as
sh
actually okay let's use
it pH so yeah so now that we have a file
uh created over here we can also copy
the file or move the file in the same
location so if I just
say copy
AP do
text come
on yeah as AP Dosh in the present
location can I do
that yes all people who are who know
Linux can I copy change the name of the
file in the present
location yeah if there's an error Linux
will give you a War if the operation is
done the Linux will not give in warning
if you want to look at it sorry
l-l you see I created a file of same
size and name with a different extension
so ap. text was a file I have copied it
as a.sh which is a shell script file do
you understand I copied a file using CP
CP is copying a file now this a.ch can
be given uh execution uh executing uh
privileges that we can execute this file
by using CH
mode plus X and I say
AP
Dosh all right I'm making a shell file
enter you see it has given no error
erors that mean it has worked so if I
now do Alis
dasl can you see the file color has
changed can you see what was the file
color before it was a white color now it
has become green color that signifies
the file is now executable do you
understand that that signifies the file
is now executable yeah David your batch
file we have created a shell file over
here okay so in your uh Journey as a
penetra ethical hacker
uh as a penetration tester you may have
to make files executable you will be
doing it using such kind of commands
change mode CH mode commands got it now
if you want to run this file you can
just use do/ AAP so you have to run a
command just dot is present working
directory and you want to run the uh
this file in the present working
directory so dot dot is the present
working directory present directory
present location and the name of the
file to run and we have made it
executable as soon as I say enter it
should give us the command what did it
say hello how are you and it is listing
the contents of the present directory
can you see that what we've done so we
have progressively moved from creating a
directory to creating a file to creating
a shell using various editors then
making the shell exe shell file
executable a batch file executable
and then running the file on the
terminal getting an output on the screen
is that clear all of
you this is something you need to redo
when you practice it is important that
you redo
this
okay great so and thanks David for
getting it to my notice uh this is
something which is
uh should be known to us right thank you
so let's see a few questions yesod says
what is root terminal and
terminal okay is in context of Linux a
terminal is a program that provides text
based interface what you see on the
screen to interact with the operating
system okay it is giving you a text
based inter intercept uh in uh
correction text based interface to
interact with the operating system while
a root terminal is a terminal session
that runs with super user privileges now
do you understand terminal gives you
interface root terminal will give you
super user Privileges and same thing can
be done with your
privileges yeah okay
uh okay uh Zarin it will be the same the
commands will stay the same nothing
changes UB 2 is a Debian based operating
system K Linux is also a dean based
operating system so all these commands
in exact same format will work in one to
also yeah okay great okay so next
question so we have a question from Kell
which is from where the Linux find the
application now uh in case of Linux uh
there's something known as official
package repositories right so now most
Linux distributions have official
software repositories or storage
mechanisms uh where users can find and
install the application when we used uh
when you used just let me create the
screen when you use appt right that is
Advanced package tool what is it
Advanced package tool this allows you
this is a package manager which allows
you to download packages from the
repository of uh the Debian operating
system Linux operating system and so on
forth for Debian you use app
Dean sorry right use app for
uh for let's say red hat operating
system Fedora Cento I think Centos also
you use yum that is a uh I it is
possibly yellow updator modified or
something I forgot right so that's how
you do
it also uh there are other options where
in there are third party repositories
software we sites you can download like
you do in Windows similarly you can
download and install applications this
is one option I have given
right most cyber people prefer working
on Linux it's much more convenient
lesser uh issues come up at least I
prefer and I've seen 90% of people who I
work with u prefer using
Linux
yeah okay and
uh okay uh again another question from C
does the syntax matter while searching
the application yes if you know if you
remember I told you Linux is case
sensitive so you have to ensure that s
case is correct so if you if you're
looking for Firefox uh let's say this
machine has Firefox I want to open
Firefox I just type Firefox like this
and will open Firefox but if I don't get
the case correct it will not open the
application simple as that can you see
from the terminal without actually using
the
mouse I can open an application I just
say
Firefox I'll tell something interesting
I'm goinging over
here can you see I just changed the case
the first case f and Firefox did not
