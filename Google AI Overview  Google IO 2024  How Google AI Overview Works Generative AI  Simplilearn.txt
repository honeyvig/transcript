started let us now talk about what is
Google AI Overview at its score the
Google AI overview uses Advanced
artificial intelligence to analyze the
intent behind your search queries it
doesn't just look at the literal words
you type but tries to deeply understand
the actual question or task you need
help with it then Scouts the web
collecting Rel relevant information from
multiple high quality sources using
natural language processing it
summarizes and synthesizes all of this
data into a concise easy to digest
overview tailored specifically for your
needs instead of getting overwhelmed by
an endless list of websites and having
to piece everything together yourself AI
overview does this hard work for you it
presents the key insights right at the
top of the search results in a clear
organized manner let's dive deep into
how exactly this AI operates it all
starts with Google's cutting a Gemini AI
model let me show you the easiest way to
demonstrate how it works through this
video and here we have Liz read from
Google reviews Google does the work for
you instead of piecing together all the
information yourself you can ask your
question and as you see here you can get
an answer
instantly complete with a range of
perspectives and links to dive deeper
as Sunder shared AI overviews will begin
rolling out to everyone in the US
starting today with more countries soon
and by the end of the year AI overviews
will come to over a billion people in
Google
search but this is just the first
step we're making AI overviews even more
helpful for your most complex questions
the type that are really more like 10
questions in one you can ask your entire
question with with all its sub questions
and get an AI overview in seconds Gemini
is a large language model that has been
trained on a massive amount of data
using self-supervised learning
techniques this allow it to build a
comprehensive understanding of natural
language and develop strong reasoning
capabilities for search Google has
created a custom version of Gemini that
TS into the company's vast knowledge
base realtime information gathering
systems and the more most advanced
ranking algorithms by combining Gemini
smarts with Google data and search prows
they have unlocked entirely new
possibilities the AI overview system
breaks down complex search queries into
sub questions it can systematically
solve it weighs different perspective
analyzes relevance and even accounts for
contextual details like location or time
of the year the result a thorough
multi-dimensional summary that goes Way
Beyond just pulling excerpts from web
sites it's like having your own AI
research assistant with a clear picture
of the underlying technology it's time
to explore some of the AI overviews most
powerful and unique features that set it
apart let's discuss into some of the AI
overviews most powerful and unique
features at first we have the multi-step
reasoning one of the biggest strengths
of AI overview is its ability to handle
multi-step complex queries that requires
scening together multiple rounds of
reasoning for examp example if you want
to search for best yoga studios in India
with intro offers AI overview doesn't
just list some yoga studio websites it
understands you need information on
locations pricing working distance and
current deals it gathers all those
details from across the web into one
cohesive summary then we have the
personalized recommendations based on
your search history and the specific
query AI overview provides custom
recommendations to help you take the
next step let me show you an example
through an easy demo for example you
want to
search trip to
Goa you can see here uh Google will
provide you an personalized
recommendation according to your needs
suppose cost couple package plan open
our family if you want to visit with
your family what budget you want to
apply for going to trip and everything
here like uh we also have this option
more where you can also
shop whatever you want to shop and what
is available while going to go and
everything all
right you have many options your flight
tickets also so like if I want to go to
from Bangalore it will automatically
take my current location here and
suppose I want to go to Goa so you can
see every flights available you know
like just in a single search Google will
provide you all the recommendations
for your trip to Goa so isn't that
amazing okay let's move on let us now
talk about the visual search and
multimodel inputs in a truly futuristic
development Google is working on
allowing you to initiate AI overview
searches using images or video clips
rather than just a text proms you could
record a quick video of something you
need help with like fixing an appliance
or identifying a plant the AI will
analyze both the visuals and any audio
to understand the context then deliver a
rich multimodel some rulling from text
images videos and many more this opens
up AI overview to countless new use
cases and scenarios where typed queries
can just capture all the nuisance but
hold up let's pump the brakes here for a
second because the AI overview feature
hasn't been all rainbows and unicorns so
far some legitimate concerns are Brewing
around the accuracy and reliability of
the answers it's dishing out overview
search feature is facing backlash for
giving Incorrect and bizarre responses
this AI was designed to provide concise
summaries at the top of the search
results but it's struggling to separate
fact from fiction some bizarre examples
include recommending of glue for making
cheese sticks for pizza and suggesting
eating rocks as a part of balanced diet
it also incorrectly claimed that bar
Obama is a Muslim these issues raise
serious concerns about the reliability
of AI experts warn that AI trained on
internet data will always have some
inaccuracies due to the prance of
misinformation Google is working to
improve AI overview but the question
remains if big tech companies are moving
too quickly without proper safeguards
this situation highlights the need of
ethical scrutiny and thorough testing in
AI development let's talk about the
future of AI and how Google has got big
plans for this technology Google has got
huge Ambitions for how this technology
could evolve and expand in the coming
years at first we have contextual
adaptation and personalization one key
area of focus is continuing to improve
AI overviews ability to accurately
summarize information while adapting its
language to the specific context and
person of the user rather than just dry
generic summaries the AI would tailor
its voice tone and communication style
to resonate with you it would convey the
same subtle jokes analogy and turns of
phrase that a real human expert would
use based on your preference and
background instead of being bound by an
initial training data set the model
could dynamically ingest and learn from
new information across the internet in
real time this means AI overviews
understanding could rapidly deepen on
emerging topics events products and
rapidly evolving Fields like scientific
research or current affairs multimodel
generation while you can initiate visual
searches today the future could allow AI
overview to generate Rich multimodel
outputs as well it's not just text on a
page depending on the query it may
decide that rendering a 3D model
creating an animation or composing music
in the most effective way to
comprehensively answer your question the
expressiveness of AI will know No
Boundaries finally AI overview could
transition from one andone search
interaction to an ongoing conversational
experience rather than just typing a new
query every time you could have a free
flowing dialogue with the AI to explore
a topic in depth through follow-up
questions and prompts this seamless back
and forth conversation would more
closely mimic how we naturally engage
with experts to gather information and
gain insights and there you have it
folks a complete information on Google
AI overview such powerful AI
capabilities raise important questions
about ethics privacy misinformation and
AI governance and with this we have come
