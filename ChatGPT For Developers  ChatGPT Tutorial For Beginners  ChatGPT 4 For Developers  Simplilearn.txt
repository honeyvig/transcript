in the world of coding developers often
face tricky problems and need quick
answers that is where chat GPD comes in
it's like having a super smart friend
who knows a lot of about coding and can
help you out wherever you serve imagine
you are working on a project and you hit
a roadblock you can just ask jgpt for
advice and it will give you suggestion
tips or even explanation in place
language it's like having a virtual
Mentor who is available 24 into 7 not
only that but chat gbt can also help
with writing documentation summarizing
code and understanding complex Concepts
plus it's a grade for collaborating with
other developers because it can
understand natural language so whether
you are a beginner or a pro chjp is here
to make your coding Journey smoother and
more fun with its help you can solve
problem faster learn new things and
build awesome software with confidence
so before we jump into demo part here is
a quick info for you craving a career
upgrade subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back if you want to switch careers with
AI and ml then try giving simply Lars
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning from PR University in
collaboration with IBM this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP computer
vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat GPD and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box and
the pin comments so let's get started so
here are some ways chgb can help
developers a lot so first thing is code
generation so chj can help generate code
based on what developers want it
understand natural language and can turn
ideas into actual code this saves a
times and makes coding fast so let's
take an example so I will ask CH GPT
give give
me
login login page code using scml and
CSS okay so this is HTML code you have
within a second and this is CSS code you
have within a second so this is amazing
right so you can ask any sort of code so
let's check whether it's it is working
or not I will create one text
document okay paste
it sorry save
as coding. stml okay
save
now I will check
the CSS code let's copy the code and
okay I
will paste it now save
as style.
CSS so we have both the files let me
check one thing it's styles.
CSS styles. CSS
okay so as you can see here the login
page okay see username if you will over
why because as you can see here H H
function is here background color will
change so this is how you can use jgt
for coding for any sort of coding for
any languages JavaScript react Java C
C++ and for any coding you can use so
you can create these type of things
within a
minute so moving forward
let's see the second thing is debugging
so fixing mistakes in coding can take a
long time Char can help find errors in
thousands of line code quickly it can
also suggest ways to fix those error
making debugging faster and less
frustrating okay so I have one small
code HTML code okay you can use your own
code so I will write here
debug this code and find the error okay
now I will paste
here so as you can see the error in the
code is UL element the closing list tag
for three element for item three is
missing the forward SL causing HTML
syntax error here is the corrected code
see it gave us correct correct code so
as you can see here UL is starting here
but it is not closing but here you can
see UL is starting and it is closing
here and one more thing is item three
slash is missing see here slash right
and here you can see the slash backod
slash so the now code is f and UL
element is closed properly with all Alli
elements nested inside it correctly so
this is how you can use charge for
debugging the errors in any code or in
any language the third point is
documentation so writing explanation for
how code Works can be boring right so
chity can help by understanding the code
and writing explanation for it so it can
even adjust the explanation based on who
is reading them making them easier to
understand so I will copy this code and
I will paste it here
okay I will copy this code
uh write the
documentation
mation for this
code so as you can see HTML
documentation so this is title my
website structure purpose uses so you
can write your documentation for your
particular app software or website in
within a second by using chat GPT so
this is how you can use chat GPT for
documentation okay so moving forward
testing is another thing right writing
code is hard but finding mistakes in it
is even harder right this is similar to
debugging okay so chity can help by
testing the code as it's written it can
suggest things to check and make sure
everything works properly so this makes
fixing problem easier later on so this
is similar to testing right okay so so
moving forward let's see data
pre-processing okay so in machine
learning preparing data is important
right so chat gity can help clean up
messy data making it easier to use for
testing and training so it can handle
things like missing values and wrong
data formats making the data more useful
so I have one Excel sheet here what I
will do I will copy this full table and
I will write
here please help me to
clean this messy data okay I will paste
the table here okay so now you can see
here to clean up this messy data we can
format into a table structure it g table
structure using appropriate delimeter
and separating each row properly here is
a cleaner version okay see so you can
even clean the data your data like
thousand of lines you can clean it into
in 15 minutes or and within a seconds
within seconds you can clean okay so
this data now is presented in table
format which with each country's stats
organized into distinct columns making
it easier to read and Analysis okay and
the next thing is you can make test
cases for your particular programs okay
so what I will do I
will copy this
code and I will write
here create
sample
five test cases for this
code okay so here is the five test cases
for the the this particular code title
verification we can make okay header
content for the header content paragraph
content list items HTML structure so
this is how you can create your test
cases okay for the particular code right
to check whether the code is working
properly or not so with this we have
