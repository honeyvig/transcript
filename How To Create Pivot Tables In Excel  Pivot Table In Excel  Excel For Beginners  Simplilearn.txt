hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to create a pivot table
in excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is how to create a pivot table in excel
now let's get started with the practical
mode we are on our excel spreadsheet now
creating a pivot table is just away from
a few clicks trust me it's just a couple
of clicks and you'll have your pivot
table ready to operate now
click any cell or select any cell on
your spreadsheet which has the data and
navigate to insert menu on the toolbar
and select pivot table and that's how
simple it is
now automatically excel will choose your
data you can see the lines over here
dotted line that means the excel has
already selected the range of data that
you want to put into your pivot table
and you can either select the existing
worksheet or a new worksheet i'll select
a new worksheet over here and just press
on ok and there you go you have your
pivot table ready now here you can see
your pivot table is a little empty all
you need to do is drag and drop the data
elements that you want on your pivot
table
so here you can see on our spreadsheet
we have some
business data related to a store which
has furniture and states and sub
categories of the furniture and all the
you know in in category you have
furniture office supplies technology etc
right so those have some sub categories
as well and different states and the
regions as well and the quantity total
sales happen right so using this
business data we can find out some key
insights of this particular data using
our pivot table right so here we'll add
the data now let me drag the region into
rows
click and drag and let me drag
uh
categories into columns which are the
different categories which are involved
in sales data and values what other
sales happened
right and there you go you have
furnitures of a supplies technology as
the three different categories and those
are the sales happened in central is
south and west regions and this is the
grand total and incident of regions you
know you have all the regions over here
right so central east south west or
instead of uh
all the regions or instead of all the
categories you can you know
place a specific category in your pivot
table for example let me push the
category into the filters and here you
can see the total sales happen in those
particular regions now what if someone
asks you to find the sales of only
furniture right so your manager comes to
you and he'll ask you getting the sales
of only furnitures you can select that
and there you go you have the furniture
sales and all the regions right or you
can also do the vice versa
you can also drag regions into the
filters and if you wanted to find out
the region wise sales of furniture you
can also do that right
so here we have furniture and here you
have
all the regions and let us try to find
the sales of furniture in the central
region and there you go right so this is
how
the pivot table works and you can also
remove the regions for example if you
wanted to remove a certain element from
filters or anywhere if it is columns
rows anything you can just drag and drop
it right so that's how it works
and also you can increase the level of
detail or improve the granularity right
so here we have
categories on our
you know columns so you can also include
subcategories into the columns
right
and
and you have the region wise sales
so in the region filter select all
press ok
and in the category
select all
press okay
and you have the furniture here of a
supplies here and technology here and
also if you want to include the quantity
how much or how many number of uh you
know things got sold in those particular
categories and sub categories you can
also do that so here in the furniture
section books these are the sales and
this is the number of quantity or
elements sold in the in those particular
you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also include the
level of detail using pivot tables in
excel so that's how you use pivot tables
in excel and with that we have come to
an end of this tutorial on how to create
and use pivot tables in excel if you
