hello everyone and welcome to simply
learns youtube channel
caution this side and i hope you guys
are doing well today we are going to
discuss animations in javascript
we go through several websites and see
things like hovering over something and
it changes a bit
these are known as animations we see
that an image zooms out on hovering over
that in some websites like amazon
is it possible with javascript yes it is
we'll find out how in this particular
video so before we begin make sure that
you are subscribed to our youtube
channel and press that bell icon to
never miss any updates from simply learn
so without any further delay let's get
started
you can see we have an image slider over
here the images present inside this box
keep on changing we can also click on
these radio buttons to go over a
specific image if we click on this last
radio button you can see we are moving
to that particular image
now suppose you go through the home page
of any website like amazon or flipkart
you will notice that these websites
contain such image sliders at the top
for different type of sales and offers
going on right that looks quite nice so
we'll do something interesting in
today's video we'll go over some
specific animations like fading of an
image on several events we'll see how
easy it is to make those style changes
in javascript which we can't do with css
or html we are particularly talking
about style changes during events so
talking about style changes we have done
it in the past using css and html and
javascript of course so guys we
generally say that javascript is used to
make a webpage more interactive right to
make a webpage more interactive or
engaging we have to do something nice to
it so adding fade in and fade out
animations to a picture makes the
webpage more engaging to the user
so what we'll do today is we'll take an
image and use specific javascript
properties to make changes in that image
let's move on to the vs code and you
will understand it much better
now let's add an image to the webpage
first so we have a picture on our
computer and we'll add it
so what we'll do is we'll write here img
src source will be
html.png
and the next thing we'll be using the
alt attribute we'll write here
let's say javascript so we can take any
random image we are doing this for
experimental purpose only so what we'll
do next is we'll close this img tag
we'll save it and here you can see we
have an image over here will reduce the
size
and so this is the perfect size i guess
now what we'll do next is we'll use the
id attribute as well because we need to
access this particular image so let's
say the id is img fine
now here we have an image and we have
two possibilities to perform those
animations either we can add two buttons
and add functionality to them or we can
use the on mouse over and on mouse out
events so we'll use two buttons for now
and then we'll use the on mouse over and
on mouse out events to do the same task
now let's add two buttons here what
we'll do is we'll write here input
type is equals to button
and then we'll write here value value
will be let's say
fade in for
first button
and we'll use the on click event fine so
we'll write here on click and we'll call
a function on clicking this particular
button so this will be a function name
fade in
now we'll do similar thing again
we'll copy paste it and we'll change
certain
values here we'll write your fade out
and we'll call a different function so
we'll write here fade out fine
now save it and you can see we have two
buttons over here
faded and fade out so nothing is
happening on clicking over these buttons
we can change the size of this image
using css right so we'll use css here
only we'll write here
class is equals to
let's say size
and
we'll use the style tag here
we'll write here dot
size
and inside this will
write
width
is equals to
50 pixels let's say
and the height will be
50 pixels as well fine save it and you
can see the image is
pretty small right now so what we'll do
is we'll write here 250 instead of 50
save it now and you can see it's working
fine i guess
the size is decent
let's change it to 300
right
so we have to keep these things in mind
like what size we want for our image and
we can use css for that right that's
quite easy what we did is we defined a
class we use the class attribute here
inside the img tag and we have defined
it using the style tag over here we are
not using any separate css file for that
so save it and you can see we have a
image over here with decent size and
then we have two buttons fade in and
fade up now the next task for us is to
add functionality to these buttons we'll
move on to the javascript file and
creator functions there
so this is a javascript file we'll
create a function here let's say the
function name is fadein so this is the
first function and then we have the body
of this function now the next thing is
to use the style property to fade this
image let's talk about it in detail
we need to access this image right so
we'll use the
document.getelementbyid method to access
the image we have already used the id
attribute in the html file so what we'll
do here is we'll write here
document dot get element by id
and the id is
img fine
now we have to use the style property
the style property is used to add
styling to any particular element or
event with the help of javascript we can
do it with css but we want to add
styling as a functionality right this
means that we want to style element or
image by clicking a button for that we
have to use the style property here in
our javascript file
so we'll write here style now the next
and the last thing is fading the image
now we have a term named opacity in
programming opacity refers to the fact
of being opaque in programming if the
value of opacity is 1 then we can't see
through the image like making an image
transparent and if the value is zero we
can see through that image or we can say
that the image will totally disappear if
the value is zero so let's try it out
here
and you'll understand it so what we'll
do is we'll write here style dot opacity
is equals to
zero now save it
and click on this fade in button click
on this fade in button and you can see
the image disappears by clicking the
fade in but
now we'll add functionality to this fade
out button as well
for that what we have to do is we have
to create another function here so the
function name will be
fade
out and then we have the body of this
function the
working will remain the same we'll again
use the
document.getelementbyid method
we'll again use the img as id we'll
write here dot style dot
opacity now what we want is we want to
bring back our image right so we'll
write here 1
now here the values are 0 and 1
respectively for fade in and fade out
functions let's check the output here
save it
click on this fade in button and you can
see the image totally disappears and on
clicking the fade out button you can see
the image is here again now to actually
make the image a slight fade
let's say we don't want the image to be
disappeared completely what we want is a
slight fade in our image now what we
have to do is we have to choose a value
between 0 and 1. like for 0 it totally
disappears right if we write here 0.5
save it now and click on fade in you can
see the image fades slightly so this is
how we can use the fade in and fade out
animations in javascript and
it will be totally fine if we write here
0.1 as well save it
and if you click on this fade in button
you can see we have this image over here
still but we can say it's almost
transparent or disappearing you can see
it's over here maybe it's visible or
maybe not but if you write here 0.3 or
something like that and now click on
this fade in button you can see we can
see this image but the image is faded
right so this is how we can use the fade
in and fade out animations in javascript
now we can do the same thing using on
mouse over and on mouse out events in
javascript we have to make some more
minor changes in a html file only
instead of using these buttons we'll use
the on mouse over and on mouse out
events
inside the img tag so what we'll do is
let's do it as well
we'll move to our html file and we'll
comment these two lines so we are done
with it now the next thing we'll do is
we'll use the on mouse over and on mouse
out event right so we'll write here on
mouse
over first
and we'll call the fade in function on
taking the mouse cursor over the image
and the second event will be on mouse
out
so we'll write here on mouse out and
we'll call the fade out function fine on
taking the mouse cursor away from the
image save it and you can see we don't
have any buttons over here now now on
taking the mouse cursor over this image
you can see the image fades a bit and on
taking the mouse cursor away from the
image you can see we have the original
image here
so this is how we can make fade in and
fade out animations work in javascript
you might hear that browsers do not
support this method of using fade in and
fade out animations in javascript in my
case i have checked with three four
different browsers like microsoft edge
firefox chrome and internet explorer so
it is working totally fine i want you
guys to check if it is working or not
with the browsers you have on your
computer if not then do let us know in
the comments and we'll figure it out
make sure that you have the latest
version of whichever browser you are
using the fade in and fade out effect in
javascript was easy to use all we have
to do is to use the style property with
opacity in between 0 and 1. quite a
simple task right now in this video
we'll see another animation effect in
which we'll change the size of an image
by hovering over that
we see such animations in many
e-commerce websites where if we take the
mouse cursor over any product the size
increases so let's do it here it's a
simple task we'll add an image to our
html file first so
we'll write here
img and the source will be we have an
image named as coffee.png in a system
and then we have the id attribute the id
will be let's say img and then we'll use
the alt
attribute here we'll write here
coffee let's assume that this is a
product of any e-commerce website and we
want to increase the size of this
product on hovering over that
so the next thing we'll be doing here is
we'll be defining the width so let's say
the width will be
200 pixel for this particular image and
then we'll use
certain events here so we'll use the on
mouse over so on taking the mouse cursor
over we want to increase the size of
this image right and on taking the mouse
cursor away we want to decrease the size
right
so we have used these two functions
we'll define these functions in our
javascript file
so we are done with this img tag
save it and you can see we have an image
over here in a browser so we are done
with it we have the default size of this
image as 200 pixels we can change it
here we can make it 300 or 400
or any size we want so you can see the
image size change if we write here 300
instead of 200 so for now we'll be using
200 that's fine i guess
so what we want is we want to increase
the size of this image by taking the
mouse cursor over it right and the size
will be back to normal if we take the
cursor away from the image so for that
we have to define these two functions
increase and decrease so let's define
them in a javascript file
what we'll do is we'll first write here
function and we'll define function
increase
then we have the body of this function
and we'll write here
document dot get element by id the id is
img
and we'll write here dot style dot
width
is equals to we can't write here 400
pixels simply it will throw an error you
can see a red line over here so what we
have to do is we have to write this
inside single inverted commas
right
save it and on taking the mouse cursor
over the image you can see the image
size increases but it's not getting back
to its original size because we haven't
declared the decrease function yet let's
declare the decrease function as well so
what we'll do is we'll again use the
same logic we'll write here function
decrease
and inside the body we'll write
document dot get element by id
we'll write here img
dot style dot width
is equals to the width let's say will be
default so the width will be 200 pixels
we'll write here 200 pixels
and the decrease function will make the
picture get back to its original size
that is 200 pixels so save it and you
can see here on the browser that the
image is zooming in and out on specific
mouse events
that is one of the most easiest tasks to
do in javascript all we had to do is we
had to define two functions a function
increase and the other one for
decreasing the size so the function
increase will increase the size by 200
pixels and the function decrease will
get the image back to its original form
fine
now there is an older method of changing
the size of an image using the set
interval method
html5 documents no longer support this
method so suppose that we want the size
of the image to grow gradually like
after every 10 milliseconds the size
should increase up to a certain level
all we have to do is to use the set
interval method we are all aware of this
concept in javascript so let's take a
look at the html part so here's the html
part which is the same as we used for
the previous program not even a single
change here you can see we have the
image sources coffee.png then we have
the ids img one
then we have used two mouse over events
one to increase the size and the other
one to decrease the size and then we
have the width as hundred we have
changed the width here the initial width
will be hundred and we'll notice that
the initial image size is smaller than
the one we used in the previous program
now the javascript file will look
different let's move there first so here
is the javascript part and we have three
variables here width addition and
interval id
now the initial value of width is the
same as that of image
which is 100 and then we have the
variable addition which will be
responsible for the increment of the
size as we want the size to be increment
by 2 pixels after every 10 milliseconds
right the following variable is interval
id which we'll need later on while using
the set interval method
now we have two functions over here the
increase function and the decrease
function so these are the two functions
we have in a javascript file
inside the increase function we have
used the set interval method you can see
here we have the set interval method
and we have called the zoom in function
after every 10 milliseconds so it will
call the zoom in functions again and
again after 10 milliseconds so if we
want to make it one second we have to
write here 1000 right we are already
aware of this concept so we are using
milliseconds for now now if we remove
this clear interval method from here
then the zoom in and zoom out effect
will not work correctly in between we'll
try it later so same as the case for
decrease function as well and it will
call the zoom out function after every
10 milliseconds right so we have to
define these two functions as well so
here are the functions zoom in and zoom
out so let's take a look at the zoom in
function first the zoom in function is
actually responsible for the increment
in the size of the image
if the width is less than 200 let's
suppose the initial width is 100 which
is less than 200 right then what will
happen is
the value of width will be increased by
width plus addition it will be increased
by 2 so it will check if the width is
less than 100 the value will be 102 then
1046810
up to 200 and then the value will be
assigned to the style property to
increase the size so this statement is
we are using for a long time now so what
we are doing is we are assigning the
value of this width to this style
property and then we have used the
console.log to check the increase in
width
now the else statement will stop the set
interval function and the increment in
image size will be stopped as soon as it
reaches the 200 mark
for the value of width as 200 the set
interval function will stop
same as the case for zoom out function
which will decrease the size of the
image until the size reaches
0.
the size will be reduced by 2 after
every 10 milliseconds the logic remains
the same what we are doing is we are
using here minus instead of plus and we
are checking if the value of width is
greater than hundred fine let's check
the output of this program save it and
we'll open this file with live server
we'll click on live server
now
here we are on the browser and take the
mouse cursor over the image oh it's not
working the reason behind it is this
method is not supported by the current
version of html to make this program
work we have to put our browser in quark
mode
now for that we have to do a simple task
we have to go to a html file and we have
to remove this particular statement we
have to remove this doctype as html
remove it now this quirk mode is used to
make older websites compatible with the
browser if your program doesn't work
sometimes do check this out by removing
doctype from your html file sometimes it
happens that a particular method or a
particular type of program doesn't
supports in your browser so do check
this method out try running your program
in quirk mode and maybe it will work
so let's check the output now see on
taking the mouse cursor over here
the image size increases gradually and
on taking the mouse cursor away the size
decreases it looks nice right
now imagine you are working on an
ecommerce website and you want to make
your website more interactive
then you can put this effect over
products and it will look nicer right
so we have already mentioned it that
what if we remove this clear interval
method so we'll move to a javascript
file and we'll see what if we remove
this particular clear interval method
from it so we'll remove these clear
interval methods we'll remove this one
and
this one
save it now
and you can see there is something wrong
on taking the mouse cursor over this
image so you can see the image is
shaking slightly right now this is
because the clear interval method does
not stop the set interval method on
calling the increase and decrease
function every time
so this is how we can make our web pages
more beautiful and interactive in
javascript try doing something new by
yourself and let us know in the comments
