hi winners this is dr srikhan from team
mds conquer now i'm here in front of you
to discuss the plan of action for the
community
so before going in detail into the
things that what we have to do from
community point of view my clear-cut
solution for all of you okay because
most of us including me
okay so
in the preparation phase or during the
fa during the phase of the life
we regularly postponed things we
regularly take the emergency cases into
consideration
but not uh
the things which has to be given
importance now the outcome will be after
some time okay such things we regularly
postpone like okay task has to be done
okay today you have an event in the
family or you you want to watch a movie
or a web series what we do is we simply
say let's do tomorrow
let's do later let's do tomorrow let's
do the next week so this is what
the mindset of most of the asperances
they thought of starting the preparation
in this week
okay with a new subject
but due to some consequences they change
it
they keep on changing it okay so this is
what regularly i have seen in most of
the students
including me when i was preparing for
the entrance and i strongly suggest you
never postpone the things
at least in the preparation phase never
postpone the things
try to stick on to your schedule and try
to follow the schedule and try to give
the best
okay let's go into the community okay so
before uh going in in detail individual
topics like what you have to do uh my my
suggestion for most of you is community
okay community okay you can call it as
spm
uh you can call it as community
dentistry or community medicine
there are lots of terms given to this
okay it has a good decent wait is
either
in your inicit
or either in your need okay so both in
inict and need it is going to carry
somewhere around a score of
10 to 15 or 12 to 15 plus okay so this
subject has to be given at most waiters
because in majority of the situations
while mentioning in in the need
blueprint also integrated need blueprint
also
community was being mixed with the
preventive dentistry preventive
dentistry again is a part of all the
subjects prevent to part of all the
individual departments comes under
preventive industry so community is
going to be with the combination of
preventative dentistry in the case of
your integrated need so
need may have two or three more extra
marks from the community point of view
okay so
like shop and painter a particular book
what we have done in the final year is
exclusively related to the community
dentistry okay but if you see your neet
or inicit or any sort of examinations
okay including the latest covet 19
updates okay that can be asked as a
question in your inict okay
this community medicine has some sort of
importance and you need to do some sort
of stuff from community medicine point
of view also
so individually i want you to
go go with the topics okay so these are
the important topics which i have listed
out and i'm going to give a rating for
each of these topics because a few of
the students were asking me sir
okay i i i'm a mother of a kid i have a
two recently born i mean like one kid of
two years one kid of
15 days or 20 days i cannot follow all
the schedules and i cannot give 100 days
of time
for for the preparation but i want to
just clear the entrance and want to get
into some somewhere around like three
thousand already ranked below which may
fetch me a seat i'm not i'm not
targeting for targeting for gdc but i'm
targeting for this so can you help me
out what i can do for this so from now
every subject i will be splitting into
the five star topics which are mandatory
to be done okay right
so the first if i saw topic in this
subject is going to be
uh your your fluorides and the
preventive preventive dentistry part
which is covered in all the subjects but
fluorides i want you guys to cover right
away in this in this
in this schedule okay so red color i'm
going to keep it as a
five star okay so the next one is
kerry's activators carry saturated
and carries vaccine updates okay this
action updates we have only
two sources one is uh one or two pages
in the shop and waiter and one or two
pages in your
in your shoppers okay so these are the
two things that we have as of now but
carries vaccine updates and carries
carries related updates latest updates
which were covered
in various other subjects also these are
important again i want to drop it as
fire rating for this okay but it's not
going to take much of your time we have
a caries activity vaccines i want you
guys to carry security tests i want you
guys to cover it and pretend future
sealants okay peter fisher sealants is
again a fire rating topic which is not
going to eat away much of your time but
you can finish it as fast as possible
okay screening and epidemiology
okay is going to eat away your time for
sure and this is a fire rating topic
okay this is medical medical indices or
i just want to drop medical indices a
rating of
four whereas dental i want to drop it as
five
statistics in the examination were not
frequently asked so i want to go ahead
and drop four for it
school health programs four for it
finances four for it manpower four for
it
concepts four for it and health and
prevent to i mean like environment and
health three for it uh agencies i want
to drop
i want to drop uh
i i don't want to drop five for it okay
agencies nowadays most frequently asked
about the whole inicit uh sorry double h
o your unicef okay recently they have
asked questions related to dci okay so
it is it is mandatory that you have to
do this stuff directly from the textbook
shopenfield that is available for you
and kovit 19 updates community updates
they have not given until now but they
have given so many medical updates so as
kovit 19 is important i want to keep
kovit 19 a 5 star kovit 19 anywhere is
going to be a 5 star because this is
right away the most hot topic in the
in globally it is the hot topic so of
course definitely they are going to give
questions on this particular area
and
biomedical ways i want to keep a four
star and evidence based dentistry i want
to keep a five star okay so mandatory
things that you have to do is
okay
one is you have to do your
fluorides and prevent to part okay you
have to do caries activity test you have
to do pitted features you have to do
epidermology and screening both are
combined together indices of the dental
you have to do okay and health agencies
you have to do covet updates you have to
do and evidence-based dentistry you have
to do of course biostatistics is one of
the important topic i want you guys to
cover the biostatistics these are the
most important topics if your
time for the preparation is very limited
if not you have to cover each and
everything okay next one is vaccinations
and i want you guys to focus more on
covid19 vaccinations because they can
ask questions related to that of course
the recent questions
from all the examination this is going
to be
out of five i'm going to drop six for it
okay so this is at most important thing
so this is how you how to focus on
uh the topics and you have to plan
accordingly with the schedule
so the next one is
for a quality preparation
for a good quality preparation you need
60 hours
of reading of community community
dentistry plus medicine has to be done
from your side
with 60 hours plus revision schedule
covering these all topics i mean 60
hours means for example if you are
working 12 hours per day a quality 12
hours per day so you can finish the
community within 5 days if not a quality
of six hours per day you're going to
take 10 days for the community so you
decide okay how you're going to work
make sure if you work 60 hours of
quality time with the first reading then
you can do ample amount of mcqs when
you're going with the same subject in
the second reading so make sure you give
that quality of time roughly i'm going
to give how much amount that each
subject is going to carry for example
fluoride and fluoride mcqs
are going to like take a time of at
least like five hours a minimum time of
five hours
your caries activity tests are going to
take hardly like one hour
okay it's going to hardly take one hour
your pit and fissure hardly going to
take one hour
your epidemiology and screening may take
eight hours
your indices going to take four hours
biostatistics will take 10 hours
your
school health programs will take two
hours
your finance will take two hours
manpower will take two hours
health
concepts of health and disease may take
six hours
environment and help will take three
hours
health agencies will take
four hours
covet updates will take one to two hours
biomedical waste will take one to two
hours evidence based dentistry and
medicine will take one hour vaccination
will take two to three hours
okay so this is a rough uh rough rough
schedule uh
that you have to give importance
regarding the preparation the next
important thing i want to focus on is
the books that you need to keep it as a
reference source for community dentistry
the reference source should be shogun
peter and for the community medicine
that is the preventive medicine spm the
reference show should be park i don't
want i'm not stressing or i'm not
telling you to
read these books i'm just telling that
whenever you have a doubt whenever you
want a clarity
i want you guys to open this and work on
this
work with these books okay so of course
your pp books volume file has 54
pages of community
medicine plus dentistry which is
very very valid material refined valid
material which is very very important
from examination point of view now i'm
just going to give a brief idea that
which topic has to be done from where
okay so fluorides
you have a video
on the website which is of four parts
and i want you guys to
do the video simultaneously with the
power play books of florets
do the video simultaneously with the
power play books for the florets for the
florets so once you are done with this
you can go back and solve mcqs from any
of the book either dental pulse or
dentist anything is fine you have to
solve mcqs
i i hope this is clear first you have to
finish these word four videos with the
pp books pp books on one side four
videos on other side finish them then
you go solve some mcqs the second one
again goes with the same you have a
video one video on keri's activity test
i want you guys to go finish the video
along with the pp books
but make sure carries vaccines okay i
want you guys to open your shovel better
shop and painter
and do the carries vaccines open shogun
peter and do the karis vaccines textbook
reading is mandatory for keri's vaccines
okay the next one is pit and feature
sealants pit and fissure sealants you
have a video okay please do finish the
video we don't have any specific mcqs
related to the patent feature in the
community part of any of the mcq books
so i want you guys to finish the video
the video there is one video on the
website which is more than sufficient to
cover the maximum contents the next one
epidermology i want you guys to
go with the video content you have three
to four videos available on the website
related to the epidemiology and the
screening so i want you guys to finish
the video part along with the pp books
the material and the pp books has to be
done once you are done with that then i
want you guys to go with the mcqs part
so indices
indices medical indices
were covered in your pp book so pp books
is more than sufficient for the medical
indices and for the dental indices i
want you guys to go and cover sherburne
peter okay dental indices i want you
guys to go and cover
shauban
has to be done individually each and
every indices has to be done
individually because nowadays in need in
need and in as well as an inict you have
n number of questions that are moving
around indices
the next one i want to stress on the
next one the next one is biostatistics i
want you guys to do the pp books along
with the videos that are available on
the website please do it mcq source for
the biostatistics as well as
for for the for epidemiology and the
screening for the bio statistics
for the concepts of health and disease
and your health
schemes and agencies
okay and your vaccination i'm going to
provide you a pdf
if you want to solve more mcqs once
you're done with the basic content you
can do from that particular
pdf that will be posted on the group
okay so next is biostatistics you have
to do from pb books and the video
content simultaneously once you're done
with that i want you guys to drift
towards the mcq part that can be either
from the rental pulse or dentist or the
pdf what i'm going to share to you
the next one is school health programs
other school health programs i want you
uh we're going to prepare a video okay
so video will be available on the
website so i want you guys to cover the
school dental health program not much
important for examination point of view
but has to be done from your side don't
have any proper source of mcqs regarding
this you need to remember
a bit of like 10 or 15 lines related to
this school dental health program which
will be discussed on the video so i want
you guys to cover the video part for the
school health programs finance
it's going to be video
manpower it's going to be video if you
want along with the video you can keep
your uh shogun peter as a reference
source concepts of health i want you
guys to cover
along with the video and pp books
then after mcqs in the pdf what i'm
going to share environment and health
the same
video plus pp books followed by mcqs
health agencies and agencies okay we
don't have a proper video for this okay
it's going to be an even distribution
okay so you have to do
from the textbook source
textbook of shobhan peter i'll let you
know what to be done from the shogun
twitter what are the agencies should be
done from shop and peter and what are
the agencies that should be done from
the park i'll be posting on to the group
and you have to go for the textbook
reading for this particular
thing
and the next one is
the biomedical base okay so there are
few updates in the biomedical base
recently which were not properly covered
in the textbook okay biomedical based in
biomedical waste management because of
kovid 19 waste management is a different
game so we'll prepare a video and we'll
update you about that updates of kovit
19 or the rest biomedical ways according
to the
new act okay so you have to do
that video followed by some sort of mcqs
which will be discussed on our whatsapp
activity and followed by evidence-based
dentistry and evidence-based medicine
the terms are almost the same you have a
video already on the website i want you
guys to do the video content that is
available on the website vaccinations
okay most of the vaccinations will be
covered in the pdf what i'm going to
share i guess do but at most important
vaccination is going to be the covid19
okay the vaccines that are available
india okay uh and there uh i mean the
indications contraindications
and uh
the composition of the vaccine such
questions can be asked which will be
covered in a video okay right so this is
what you have to do a recent mcqs uh
basing up on the time available i try to
prepare as many videos and try to solve
as many mcqs so that
you can make your practice better
so this is a rough plan like how you
need to cover the syllabus where you
need to cover and how you need to
approach
make sure every day before you start the
preparation for a particular topic okay
go back to this and try to properly
analyze this okay so
what what the team is doing uh is very
simple like uh
enter community will be handled by me in
the video contents okay so i'll try to
cover as much stuff
as possible which is very very important
for examination the video content so my
open suggestion for all of you is okay
sit spend a quality time with the video
content because video content is going
to give you a strong base and a strong
knowledge over the subject once you get
a strong base and strong knowledge it is
not done it is halfway done okay this is
half the half away and the last half
away is practice you need to practice
mcqs then you will know where you are
where you are lower where you are not
able to like which way you are low at
which concepts you are lowered where you
are not able to understand things and
everything will be analyzed basing upon
your capability in solving an mcq okay
so take these things into consideration
and i want you guys to work hard okay uh
stay positive god bless you
take care
yes done for now signing off dr srikanth
