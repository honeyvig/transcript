yeah very good morning one and all I'm
just going with the paper discussion of
community and biochemistry I'll focus
more on the key Corrections and I mean I
got you request to explain a few
questions and all the requests for a
scripted and how we have uploaded this
explanations in the question bar itself
we can reach a cure question paper with
the explanations for the tricky
questions so coming to the third
question the third question is a key
correction you can see this is the third
question which is a key correction key
correction is already done and the next
one is okay the next one I feel like you
can see 17 question we have added
explanation for 18 question as for the
request we have our explanation the next
gross is the 28 question as per the
request we are the explanation and next
course is a 47 question we added
explanation 50 second question is
already explained in the recent YouTube
video please check it we have posted the
link and 53 correct question was a was
an error given so we have removed that
question so 50 third question is an ADD
score 53 is an ADD score going to the
sixty one sixty one is a key correction
okay the answer is C now
as for the request 90 the solution was
added explanation was added one or two
explanation was added one out eight
explanation was added sorry one 151
explanation was added 174 explanation
was added one eighty explanation was
added question number one I mean all the
questions of your immune system I mean
like immunology and your
hypersensitivity you have respect to
YouTube videos these questions are
directly taken from YouTube videos
please check the YouTube videos so that
you will get a better idea question
number one 92 is a geek is there is a
smaller okay in the in the initial I
mean in the in the initial day like all
when you're giving the examination the
standard deviation was given as hundred
but it is actually 10 so if it is turn
the key is right you can just make it as
a correction if you want you can add as
a as a as a add score so 194 I have
added explanation to 11 I have added
explanation directly from such an arena
to 14 I have added explanation to 15 I
have added explanation to 21 I have
added explanation to 24 I have added
explanation okay so this is how the
papper is you can reach a cure paper for
tricky questions we have added
explanation and the key Corrections and
the Corrections and the questions and
everything were done okay
I have already registered question
number three is a key correction the
answer is 253 question was removed
sixty-one question was a key correction
my 192 question there is a mistake in
the question there is a small mistake
where we have to give 10 but it was it
was there was a typological mistake
where it was typed as hundred okay this
is what the paper of biochemistry and
community the recent
sandesh weekend examination ISM and
coming to the rough analysis of this
paper I feel like this is not too tricky
paper because you can find so many
questions from the group discussion and
so many questions from the dental pals
and so many questions from your
power-play books if you have a good
command over the biochemistry and
community at least in your PP books and
your new dental pulse and people off off
learn if you are done with the peppers
and the online discussions and the video
discussions I feel like scoring 150 is
not a big task including key Corrections
okay because there is one add score
followed by two key Corrections and one
question mystic so you can make plus
four or five as an odd squad plus four
or five can be added so anything without
key Corrections 145 plus and bit key
Corrections 150 plus can be easily okay
so if it is 175 plus or 170 to 175 plus
with the key Corrections can be a good
score and I hope those people will
definitely give a tough competition to
the competitors who are racing towards
the GDC I feel like for GDC with the key
Corrections there should be at least one
seventy for this pattern and anything
above 145 without key Corrections and
150 with key Corrections can be a very
good score to get a good clinical seat
at least in the private college like end
or north preferable clinical seats and
almost there will be at the end of the
GDC Pro so this is what the rough
analysis of the paper and I hope you
guys like the pattern or the
modification of like adding these
explanations in a easier way to the
question paper itself once the question
that is four straight so please try to
solve more MCQs and so as we have
already discussed in a morning session
please go with the aims repeats please
sort try this all the MCQs many MCQs
which are present in the offline papers
so will be helping you out so that's
what the plan of action is like or else
if you want us to keep a time table for
the online purpose we are ready to do
that so that the explanation part can be
added in the explanations once you have
it out or once you feel like these are
the
corrections controversial questions okay
the same pattern will go in final exam
also there will be few key Corrections
there will be controversial questions
there will be incomplete questions so
get prepared for the same that's going
to happen in your final exam all the
best have a great day keep working hard
