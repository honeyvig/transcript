and description box below to find out
the data science and data analytic
program that fits your experience and
areas of interests so without further
delay let's get started with our topic
for today which is the differences
between having and where so first we
will understand what exactly is a where
clause in
SQL so where Clause is used along Ro
level filtering of data sets so before
we get started both where and having are
like filters let's say you are working
on an Excel spreadsheet and you have an
employee data set so there are various
departments maybe it development testing
Etc right so in the same way if you
wanted to filter out all the employees
from IT department alone you would apply
a filter on Excel right filter employees
which are working in or who are working
in IT department so similarly in SQL you
expect the IDE of or you expect the
database to give you a filter data via
your query so in such situations the
query will have where clause and having
Clause so the main difference between
where clause and having is so if you
wanted to group the data in terms of
categories right if you wanted to
segregate the data in term of categories
you will have to use having clause for
that when the data is segregated in
terms of categories and and you wanted
to extract a specific uh part then you
will be using having and you will also
use having in place of aggregate
functions let's say your SQL query has
some aggregate functions let's say count
the number of employees in particular
Department then having Clause will be
your choice not wear so wear works like
a roow level uh filter it checks each
and every filter in individual rules and
only gives you the
or only returns you the uh values in row
levels if you want to use count or any
other aggregate functions along with
where it might not work so that's the
fundamental difference similarly having
is also a filter which is used along
with aggregate functions and category
level filtering of data say justest as
we discussed before but to make things
clear let's check out a demo and uh that
might help you a little better so let's
get back to my SQL workbench so right
now we are on my SQL workbench and uh
you can create a new database and use
that database so I have created a
database called SLP and then I'm using
SLP database I've created a normal or
simple employee database just as the
example we discussed in the upd part so
I'm having employee ID name age
Department salary and uh here I'm
inserting some random values let's say
on 2025 values into the table
now here we have a clause with where
right I mean here we have a query with
work Clause so in rows wherever the
department is equals to it give me the
table so I'll run this particular query
so wherever the department is it it is
giving me a table of employees who are
working in IT department now if I want
to use count of let's say an aggregate
function count
Department the query will not work
although you can find that there are no
errors but when you try to run it the
workbench throws you an error right so
where Clause cannot execute aggregate
functions along with it now let's try to
not include any aggregate functions with
it
now here I have another query which does
have aggregate functions and we are
grouping it by department and in such
situations you can get the query done
because we have replaced where with
having now let's try to execute this
query there you go now the Departments
are being categorized and we want the
values which are only working in it
Department right so we are counting the
number of uh people in it and that's
where you got it so that's the
fundamental so where is like a row level
filter where it will select the values
from rows which have the given condition
satisfied and if you want to into
categories say Department wise categor
salary wise categories and yeah again if
you want to give a condition let's say
salary greater than certain value in
such situations you can use where but if
you want to extract the data along with
the categories and along with the given
condition of salaries greater than
certain value then having is your friend
so that's how you can work with where
and having so those are the fundamental
differences between where clause and a
having Clause so with that we have come
to the end of this session on the
differences between where and having if
