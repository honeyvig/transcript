hello everyone welcome to this video
tutorial on basics of goang by simply
learn in this session we will go through
a brief introduction to the goang
language after knowing the basics you
will get to know about variables data
types and operators in the language
further you will learn about loops
supported by the goang and you will know
how to declare the functions and
pointers in goang finally you'll learn
about the
packages so hey everyone I'm abisara
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video tutorial on the basics of goink
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update now we look into what is
goang go is a strong and statically
typed compiled language strong language
depicts that the type of variable cannot
change in a code it will remain the same
throughout the code here statically
typed means all the variables must be
declared at compile time and compile
language states that you only have to
compile the code and it will be
converted to machine code directly it is
same as C or
C++ go doesn't have a virtual machine
like Java language
which takes time to convert the script
into machine code moreover Co supports
concurrent programming that is it allows
running multiple processes
simultaneously this is achieved using
channels go routines Etc these features
help go to improve its performance
companies such as Google twitch and Uber
use go for their
microservices Technologies like toer
kubernetes are in the go
language we'll go to the official
website of go for that we'll move to
Google Chrome and search for go
lank this is the official website for go
that is
go.d here we can see the mascot of go
language this is the blue
mascot as you scroll down we can see the
companies using go language go is called
the min istic language as it has very
little
documentation it is easy to learn as it
has fewer features and less confusing
Parts as compared to
Java here you can run your first code
without any setup on the
playground we will run hello world here
you'll write
hello world and click on the Run button
it will send the code to the server for
compilation and we will get the output
that is hello
world we can download the
goang from here we will click on the
download
button and here we can see we have
download options for Microsoft Windows
Apple Mac OS Linux and we have the
source file Ive downloaded for the
windows as I have the windows
system from downloading go we also have
to download an idle to run the code for
that I have downloaded and installed vs
code it's up to you what ideally you
want to
choose now we will learn about variables
in go
lank a variable is a storage area
defined to store temporary data and
perform operations on them moreover
variable values can further be changed
according to program needs variables
declared without any corresponding value
are considered zero valued there are
mainly two ways to declare variables in
goang that is using where keyword and
using short variable declaration let's
move to vs code and see the Declarations
life now we will open a new file and see
how to declare variables in
goang and we'll use the inbuilt terminal
of vs
code here we'll select the language as
go and press enter the first thing we
will do is import
fmt for that we'll write
import and in invert is comma we will
write
fmt that is a formatting package and it
contains the print function everything
in goang is inside packages whether it
is a print function or any other
function
use packages by using import and writing
the package name in inverted commer that
is import inverted commas
fmt if someone wants to use your script
he can by importing your go file or your
go package so it becomes mandatory in
goang to put the code in a package here
we will put a code under the package
main so we will write
package
main we'll declare a main function in
which we will write a code we will write
Funk fnc and the name of the function is
mean round
brackets and we'll start the curly
braces and inside these curly braces
we'll write a
code we will declare a variable to
declare a variable first we need to
write the name of the variable second
type of the variable and then the data
assigned to the variable for that we
will
write where
keyword name of the variable we will
keep it as a and then the type of the
variable that would be int and we'll
assign the value
7 we will declare another variable that
is B where keyword name of the variable
as B and the data type int and we'll
assign the value
96 now we want to print these variables
for that we have imported the fmt
package for that we will write the
command fmt
dot print
Ln a
comma B
and for that first we'll save the
file we will name the file as
demo demo.
go and now we will run the command in
the terminal
go run demo. go and press
enter here we can see the the output
that is 7 and
996 that is we have successfully printed
both the variables that is a and
b we can also declare the variables in
different
form
like we can
write variable keyword and if we want to
declare two variables we can declare
them in the same line for that we will
write variable T comma e and the data
type that would be
int and in the next
line we will assign the values to them D
comma
e equal to 7 comma
21 now we will print these variables for
that we'll write the command
we'll save the
file and run the same command in the
terminal that is corun demo doco and
press
enter we can see the output that is
796 and
721 now we'll see another method that is
short variable declaration
method for that we'll just write the
name of the variable that is
V colon equal
to and the value that we want to assign
to this variable we will assign
76 it is same as the previous method
that is variable the name of the
variable data type and the assigned
value now we'll also get this variable
printed for that we will write the
command fmt
dot print
ton in circular brackets we will write
the name of the variable we will save
the file and then the same command in
the terminal that is go run demo.
go we'll Traverse to the next topic that
is data types in
goling data types specify the type and
space allotted to variables or functions
there are four categories of data types
in goang that is Bull type it represents
a Boolean value and is either true or
false the next is numeric type it
represents integer types plotting Point
values and complex types the next is
string it represents a string value and
we have the derived types it includes
pointer types array types structure
types and many more see some
demonstrations in the vs
code first we will see the float type we
have seen the integer type in the
previous example of
variables now we will add two fla
numbers and print the output for that
first we will declare the float
number that would
be
9628 and we will declare another Val
variable that is float
variable and assign a value that would
be 18
09
now we will declare another
variable as the output
variable and we'll store both the
variables by adding
them now
we'll print the C
variable that is the output
variable we'll save the
file and run the command in the terminal
that is cor and demo
doco we can see the output that is
11437 it shows that both the float
values have been
added now we'll see another data
type that would be
string first we'll clear all the code
that you have return now we will declare
a string
variable Str Str colon equal to and we
will write simply learn as a
string and we'll print this string fmt
dot print Len
St Str now we'll save the
file and run the command in the terminal
that is cor and demo do
go here we can see that the simply learn
string has been
printed now we will move to the Boolean
data types for that we will use the same
code
only and we will declare another
string that would be string one
and we will store string learn in
it and now we will compare both the
strings we'll declare another
variable that is
out and in this we will compare both the
strings and we'll print the variable out
we will save the file and run the same
command that is go andun Dem go in the
terminal here we can find that the
output is false because the string Str
Str it contains the string simply learn
and the string Str str1 it contains the
string learn so we are comparing both
the strings and they do not fall same so
it gives the output as
false now we will Traverse to the next
topic that is operators and
goang an operator is a specified
operation that is performed on the op
print the following list describe the
different operators used in goang first
is arithmetic
operators it includes addition
subtraction multiplication division and
modulus let's see some example in the vs
code
first we will erase all the previous
code and we will declare two variables
to perform operations on them we will
declare variable
a and assign the value 96 to8 and
another variable
sorry declare another variable that is
p colon equal to that is 18 and now
we'll perform different operations on
them first we'll perform
addition we will declare another
variable that is
out and we will store both the variables
by adding
them and print the out variable
we'll save the
file here we C the output as 114 that is
addition of both the
variables we will perform next operation
that is
subtraction for that we will declare
another variable that is out
one and perform the operation as a minus
B
and we'll print the variable out
one we'll save the
file and then the same
command go run demo do go and we can see
the output as 78 that is 96 - 18 now
we'll perform another operation that is
multiplication on both the variables for
that that will declare another variable
that is
out2 and print the variable out
to we'll save the
file and then the same command in the
terminal and we have find out that the
output we got is 1728 that is the
multiplication of both the numbers 96
and 18
I will perform another operation that is
division and for that we will declare
another variable that is out
three and we'll perform
a divide by
B and we'll print the variable fmt
dot print
Ln the variable is out three we'll save
the file
and the same command in the
terminal and we would find five that is
the output of the variable out three
that is we have divided 96 by
18 now we'll see the last operation in
the arithmetic
operators that is modulus operator for
that we'll declare another variable that
is out
for and we'll perform the operation a
modulus p
and
[Music]
we'll print the variable out
for we'll save the
file and run the command in the
terminal we got to our output
S6 now we'll see some relational
operators that would be equal to not
equal to greater than less than greater
than equal to or less than than equal
to for that first we will clear the
variable out and we'll perform an
operation that would be a is it equal to
equal to B we'll save the
file and run the command go run demo.
go what we find is false because both
the variables have been assigned
different values that is 96 and 18 so
they're not
equal we'll perform another
operation that would be
a not equal to B we save the
file and run the command in the
terminal here we got true as the output
because both the variables have been
assigned different values and they're
not
equal we will perform another operation
that is less
than for that we'll clear the previous
operation and we will write the
operation
whether a is less than b or not we'll
save the
file and run the same command go and Dem
go we have come across the output as
false as the operation is a less than b
but a holds the value 996 which is
greater than b so it gives the output as
false now we will move to logical
operators logical operators consist of
logical and logical or and logical not
we'll see the example of logical
and for
that we will write the
statement
if a is not equal to B logical and a is
greater than equal to
B and if the statement is true we would
print
out fmt do print
Ln
yes we'll save the
file run the command in the
terminal here you can see that we got
the output as yes it means
that a is not equal to B that is 96 is
not equal to 18 and 96 is greater than
equal to 18 so this is the logical and
operator now we will see bitwise
operators bitwise operators consist of
bitwise and bitwise or bitwise Z left
shift right shift and
note we'll see an example of bitwise and
for that we will declare a variable that
would be a r
o and we will perform bitwise
end on a and
b and we will print the result that is a
variable we'll save the file
and run the command go run demo. go here
we have find out that it gives the
output as zero so what does bitwise and
operator do it takes both the numbers 96
and 18 and perform and on every bit of
both the
numbers and the result of end is one
only if both bits are
one now we'll move to another operator
that is assignment operator it consists
of various operations that is single
assignment add assignment subtract
assignment multiply assignment division
assignment modulus assignment bitwise
end assignment bitwise exclusive or
bitwise inclusive or we will see an
example of simple assignment for that we
will just write the St
statement
a simple assignment that is equal
to
B and print the variable here we's save
the
file and run the command in the terminal
here we can see that the value of the
variable a has changed and it has turned
out to be 18 because we have used the
simple assignment
operator now we will Traverse to the
next topic that is Loops in
go a loop is the repetition of a block
of code that executes a control
statement specific number of times go
language works with a single Loop that
is for Loop and moreover go language
uses four Loop in various forms such as
infinite Loops four loop as y Loop and
using four Loops for Strings and
Maps we will see a simple example to
print simply L string seven times for
that we'll move to vs code and clear all
the previous
data and start with the for Loop
four and initializing the variable
I that is I equal to0
semicolon I less than
7 I ++ Curly
braces and now we will write the
statement to print simply
learn now we'll save this
code and run the
command the terminal go run demo. go
here we can see that we have printed
simply learn
seven
times we will Traverse to the next topic
that is function in
goaling a function is defined to execute
tasks by writing blocks of gold it
reduces the excessive use of memory with
the ReUse of the code in goang we
declare a function by Fun keyword
followed by the name of the function
with parenthesis and then a block
containing the
code now we'll see the syntax of the
function first we'll write the fun
keyword then we'll write the function
name and the parameters for the function
after that we'll write the return type
and in curly bra we'll write the
function
body goang also contains a special
feature that is anonymous
function we will see a simple example of
multiplication function that would be
defined by us and it would get two
arguments in that for that we'll move to
vs
code and we'll erase this for
Loop now we'll declare a multiplication
function outside the main
function
here first we'll write the funk keyword
then the name of the function
and that we will write
multi and then we'll pass the
arguments T comma e and assign the data
type and the return type of the
function and then we'll start with
the curly
braces and here we will declare a
variable that would be
out and it will perform the operation of
multiplication and we will
return the variable
out and inside the main
function we will
declare two
variables a = to
76 and B =
91 and now we'll declare another
variable that would be
D and in D we would call the function
that is
multi and pass both A and B as arguments
into
it and
print the variable D we will save the
file and run the command g demo. go we
have got the output as
6916 as the multiplication of 76 and
91 now we'll move to the next topic that
is pointers in
goang pointers are considered as special
variables in goang pointers are used to
store the memory address of another
variable the memory address is stored in
a hexadecimal format starting with 0x
like 0x FF a a f Etc now we'll see an
example of pointers in goang for that
we'll move to vs code and clear out the
previous code
now we will declare a variable
value and assign value 96 to
it and now we will declare another
variable mainly a pointer
variable and now in this
variable we will store the address of
variable
value now we will
print the
value that is stored in the variable
value and the next we would be
displaying is the address of value
that is
m% of
value and
now we will display the value stored in
variable a
now we will save the
program and run the command go run demo.
go in the terminal here we have got the
output value equal to 96 that is we have
printed the value stored in the variable
value and the next we have displayed is
the address of the variable value that
is m% value and we have stored the
address in variable a
also and that's also been
displayed in The Next
Step so now we will Traverse to the next
topic that is packages in
goang as we have already discussed
packages in the beginning now we'll
overview about it a bit packages are
directory containing various methods
functions and large number of programs
related to particular functionality it
makes these large programs easy to
maintain and understand and help in
distinguishing them of the other package
programs to import package in a go
program we can use import path as we
have seen in the examples we have done
so far with that we have come to the end
