yeah hi - so I'm back here to give some
mindmap yesterday we were discussing
about mind maps for almost all the type
of bacterial virus and the fungus right
so now I'm just going to give the mind
map of few bacteria like how you need to
identify the bacteria how you need to
identify the infection caused by the
bacteria and followed by how you need to
treat the diagnosis or the infection
okay so this is basically a combination
of few subjects like whatever we are
doing the anatomy of the bacteria will
be in your microbiology and whereas your
clinical features and everything comes
under your general medicine followed by
investigations everything again you will
come back to your microbiology and few
areas of your general path and followed
by the treatment plan is again your
pharmacology and general medicine so we
are going to deal few important things
so straightaway now I'm going to discuss
about the gram-negative cocaine so in
which the main one is the nei Syria
okay so the common points for this is
this is gram-negative non-sporting non
motile oxidase positive and mostly it
appears as diplococcus
you can see in the diagram say psst
block okay and the most two important
bacteria which are included in this is
one is meningitis and second one is
Canadian so the next important thing
that you have to make a note is the
difference between these two like how to
identify these two organisms it's very
simple you know meningitis meningococcus
so you know meninges which are
surrounding the brain so you can simply
remember it has capsulated means it has
a capsule around it
protection capsule similarly like your
brain has managers around it so the
meningococcus will have capsule second
one it is the lens-shaped
okay it is lens-shaped few people call
it as Halfmoon shape so easy to remember
it is something like Halfmoon shape you
can M you can remember it as m4 m m4
Halfmoon shaped and the third one it
vitamins both the glucose as well as the
maltose M again here an M it further
means both the glucose as well as the
Monroes
and it is present both inside the cell
and out sensor most commonly it is
inside the cell intracellular and
occasionally you can found it
extracellular also whereas coming to the
comparison of coral cocaine it is non
capsulated G G looks like kidney right
it looks like a kidney so it is a
kidney shaped it further meant only
Lucas whereas this both both the Lucas
as well as the maltose and it is mostly
99.99% of the cases it is intracellular
and most commonly associated with the
neutrals means I hope you remember the
structure of this WBC granulocytes
agranulocytes if you see the neutrophil
like this okay
and these cock-eyed diplococcus will be
present inside the inside the cell
inside the neutrophils okay so this is
mostly intracellular mostly most of the
times when compared to the meningococcal
which is both intra as well as extra
cylinder it is mostly it is an
intracellular thing so I am repeating
again it is capsulated
lens shaped or Halfmoon shaped pediments
both the glucose as well as maltose
present both the X intracellular as well
as extras in unit so we'll go and
detailee discuss both of them these two
are the most important things right now
okay so first we go with
go knock okay so coming to the
gonococcus apart from the things which I
hope we have already discussed one is it
is not non capsulated it means kid it is
non capsulated right and it is kidney
shaped G is kidney shaped it is only it
vitamins only the glucose it is mostly
the intracellular present in the neutral
present in the WBC that is neutrophils
okay so apart from this what we have to
know so there is one scientist who has
classified these gone up okay basing
upon their Tilden okay so basing upon
the fillet they have classified it into
four types that is type 1 type 2 type 3
and type 4 out of which type 1 and type
2 they have this feeling and they are
virulent means fillet is one other thing
which calls very lansing whereas type 3
and type 4
they don't have this period and they are
non virulent clear - type 2 they happily
and they're very learnt type 3 and type
4 they have no peel and they are not we
are not so apart from this you have
protein one protein 2 and protein 3 so
what are their main functions or
concerns so protein 1 and protein 3 the
protein 1 and protein 3 are called as
forums where as the protein to the
protein 2 which is present in this gonna
cocaine is an Associated molecule which
is called as opacity associated protein
so these are the three proteins and just
make a note about them so apart from
this the most important thing in both
meningococcus as well as Konak okay is
the presence of iga
proteus so I see a Proteus is present we
have already discussed about IgA
immunoglobin so I see a Proteus is
the is the one which is going to protect
these organisms these bacteria from the
mucosal surfaces because your mucosal
surface is mainly concerned with the
production of IgA immunoglobulins which
is going to kill these bacteria but
because of the presence of isay a
Proteus IC immunoglobin will get
licensed so this is how both the meaning
of coca as well as the corner okay the
product the bacteria from iga
immunoglobulins by presence of Isaiah
proteins so this is all about the
internal structure and their main
functions I was just concerning about
the main functions okay I hope you're
very very clear about this okay
so apart from this you have Lippo
oligosaccharide right here you have a
lip o oligosaccharide which acts as a
neurotoxin
so the lipo oligosaccharide which access
the endotoxin so apart from this we have
already discussed two days back when i'm
talking about the complement system so
the complement system the complement
proteins are divided into three types
one is early proteins second one is mid
proteins and third one is late proteins
or terminating complementary proteins
the terminating complementary proteins
are c phi 2 c 9 whenever there is
deficiency of terminating or late
complementary proteins that is c phi 2 c
9 there is a high chance of occurrence
of this particular gram-negative diplo
confections i have already discussed
when i was talking about the complement
system so i did note the host factor
that is going to control is the
deficiency of terminating complementary
proteins that is c phi 2 c 9 can lead to
high chances of infections of Gornick
okay as well as the meaning of cocaine
okay I hope you're very clear until now
so I'm moving to the next level
so I'm going to talk about the diseases
before talking about the diseases I'm
just going to give you important
statements one is two to eight days is
the incubation period of this and most
of the asymptomatic carriers okay the
asymptomatic carriers you can see most
of the asymptomatic carriers for this
disease are the main reservoirs for the
occurrence of the disease means most of
the times the disease occurs from the
asymptomatic carriers
okay the acts as a reservoir they store
the disease and they spread the disease
so these are the two important points
that you have to add so coming to the
diseases that are caused by this is so
in the main in the mail the most common
disease is your threads okay it is the
most common in the mail means apart from
this you can see the prostate infection
and many other infections but most
common is this because most of your
questions will move around most common
and this is a most common with the
female and most of the females they acts
as asymptomatic carriers for this
particular disease and coming to the
lining of your the vaginal lining okay
so in most of the in normal condition
your vaginal lining is lined by
non-keratinized
stratified epithelium okay so stratified
epithelia will be there
so whenever whenever I mean the manner
of the person is a than the state of PPO
Bertil pre-pubertal or post menopause so
this this lining is this lining will
become very thin and it dumps to the
basilar layer and these epithelium which
is of which is of very thin is more more
exposed or more chances of getting this
type of gonococcal infection okay so
these are the things to be make a knot
so one is the most common in males most
common in females
okay so apart from that you need to make
a note about the lining and how the
lining varies and how the lining is
related to occurrence of a particular
infection then the entire reproductive
system most of the reported system in
the female are affected by these
bacteria so the occurrence of this
infection can also be seen in neonates
basically the neonates get the infection
from the mother during the period of
delivery so during the delivery okay so
these the the BA the baby moves around
these organs where the infection is
there and the baby gets the infection
and most common infection in the baby is
ophthalmic
neonatal of Ptolemy's an item is the
most common disease that is most
commonly seen in the neonates
and it is transmitted from the mother
and the treatment okay I'm just going to
give a rough treatment the rough
treatment for this is the application of
one percentage of silver nitrate
eyedrops or you can use eye drops either
with the presence of antibodies like
antibiotics like Petra my sin and
tetracycline so they can give some
positive results in this particular
condition of ophthalmic ophthalmic
neonatal okay
so we're done with this so we'll go to
the next level so how you will do the
infection how you will do the
investigations and the most common a
specimen that is obtained is from
urethral discharge okay so the
reproductive discharges you are going to
take and you're going to go for the
microscopic examination and I'm going to
give you transport medium as well as few
culture medium which are very very
important in examination point of view
and both this transport medium and
culture medium are almost common for
both this gerak okay as well as
meningococcus so it is common the most
of the transport medium are common for
this both gone okay okay as well as many
if it is less than if it is less than
six hours
the transport medium if it's less than
six hours then you have to go for
Stewart medium or Ames medium if it is
more than six servers if it is more than
six servers then you need to think about
je m b ec medium or gone o park system
so this is about the transport medium so
when I'm talking back about the culture
mediums the culture mediums will be
different for acute cases and will be
different for chronic cases so in the
acute cases you can go with a simple
chocolate auger whereas in the chronic
cases you need to go for a selective
medium that is higher mountain medium
and make a note a modified tire mark
your medium is used for your
meningococcus for your gonna focus you
can go for a simple thing that is TM
medium whereas for your meningococcus
you have to go for a modified TM medium
and coming to the chronic cases okay so
coming to the chronic cases most of your
chronic cases or asymptomatic carriers
are very difficult to identify or it is
very difficult to isolate the bacteria
from the culture either in the chronic
cases or you can add a mode in the
metastatic cases means this meaning go
this gonna coca apart from present
presenting in the most common areas of
infection sometimes it may disseminate
okay means it may spread to avoid areas
a wide areas are other areas but in that
particular cases of the metastatic cases
or in the case of chronic cases it is
very difficult to isolate the organism
by using the culture mediums so in that
case you can go for Cyril logical test
and basically the easy way identifying
this particular organism with the Syria
logical test is just by targeting
so because they are the most virulence
and they are very important apart from
lipopolysaccharides
you can identify with most of the seer
logical test will base will targeting
this villain okay so I hope you're very
clear until now about the investigations
and coming to the treatment plan in the
drug of choice most treatment plan
mostly moves around the around the drug
of choice that is going to be a
pharmacology part so I'm not going to
touch anything related to the formal
quality part okay
so just just try to focus up to this
level of investigation so treatment is
very simple for every bacteria there
will be one drug of choice that is the
most commonly asked question followed by
you can keep a second drug as at the
second second option okay so most of
your questions will move in the form of
ecology related to this basing upon the
drug of choice because they are going to
give a description a female or a male of
this is recently has sexual intercourse
with a with a woman so they're going to
give some description about their about
the symptoms or anything and upon upon
the examination of this the vaginal
secretions from the particular woman
okay we got this particular slide and
they're going to give you some deep lock
okay on this or they can give you an
interim intracellular Diplo cocaine
means your diplococcus and inside the
inside the WBC so and they can ask you
what is the diagnosis for this case and
what is the treatment plan of the drug
of choice for this case as an
application based question okay I hope
you're clear so I'm going to the second
one that is meaning goq okay so first of
all I mean the most common points were
already discussed that it that this is
the capsulated one this is a line shaped
one this is a Halfmoon shaped one this
is present both in the intracellular as
well as extracellular this can freedom
in both the glucose as well as maltose
so apart from this we need to focus main
on the structural aspects
so what are the structure lies but the
most important structural aspects on
which it is it is divided into zero
types is the capsular polysaccharide so
capsular polysaccharide is the most
important thing and most virulence
effective so basing upon different types
of capsular polysaccharides these are
divided into 13-0 types ok 13-0 types
out of which we have to be very very
specific about a because a zero type is
most common in India and make a not a
point about B zero type there is no
vaccine for various B 0 time they are
divided into in two different types of
zero types the most important 0 types
are K type which is most common India
and that the leftover is the B 0 type
you have C 0 type you have y 0 type you
have w124 this is similarly you have 13
0 types the most important questions are
a sea row type is most common serotype
in India and B 0 x there is no
vaccination for it okay so this is about
the capsular polysaccharide capsular
polysaccharide is present outside so so
outside this is the outermost one right
so apart from this we need to learn
about the outer membrane proteins means
there are so many proteins which are
present outside the membrane they are
one is you need to learn about DNA which
is not that important and apart from
that I have already discussed a point to
you that is IG a Proteus I see as
Proteus is both present in both
Cornucopia as well as meningococcal and
it helps in protection from the mucosal
IgA immunoglobulins similar to that of
that other of the corner cocaine it has
Lippo oligosaccharide which is and
endotoxin so this is these are the few
important things that you have to make a
note about the structural things and
similarly allah in the lane in the in
the previous bacteria i was talking
about the host response post factors so
what host factors have
talking about stalking about the term
terminal complimentary system disorders
or deficiencies or the end complimentary
protein deficiencies that is C Phi 2 C 9
deficiencies whenever you have more C
Phi 2 c 9 deficiencies there are high
chances of occurrence of this type of
bacterial infection okay so apart from
this they they they can cause an
occurrence of deficiency of alternative
pathway where there is a deficiency of
either C 3 or factor D okay so whenever
you have a deficiency of these C 3 as
well as the factor D there are chances
that this particular infection can occur
c phi 2 c 9 has terminal complimentary
system deficiencies or deficiencies of
view of the alternative pathway proteins
also okay so that is about the factor
side that is about the host factor side
how it is causing the occurrence of this
particular infection so coming to the
next one is about the clinical futures
okay we have to make a note about the
the clinical futures so before talking
about this particular clinical feature
the most common area of reservoir for
this case for this case is NASA pharynx
because most of this things will go from
the nasal secretions or will go from the
respiratory secretions because the mode
of transmission of this particular
meaning of Hawkeye is from the
respiratory rooms and it is most
commonly seen in the case of children
that two A's of three months to five
years and the most common route is
respiratory the root okay so the most
common clinical futures as most of us
know the first important clinical
feature is meningococcal meningitis okay
very well-known term meningococcal
meningitis
apart from this most of your questions
will move around this particular
syndrome that is waterhouse
frederickson's syndrome okay which is
also called as hemorrhagic edenal itis
you can see hemorrhagic enterovirus so
how you can identify this particular
syndrome is the first important feature
for this syndrome is septic shock
the first important future is septic
shock for example if they are giving a
diagram based question this is the most
common diagram based question that you
can see humor Isak skin lesions okay
these are called as humanizing skin
lesions and you can see disseminated
intravascular coagulation in these
patients so this is most commonly
associated with meningococcal meaning
work on a Syria meningococcal and
meningitis and it leads to septic shock
it leads to due to the bleeding in the
adrenal glands its need to ship septic
shock okay so the important future is
you can see this type of hemorrhagic
skin lesions so this is very very
important term when we are talking about
meningococcal meningitis so the next
important aspect is the lab laboratory
investigations
okay so laboratory investigations has
already said your NASA fairings is the
most common area for the reservoir so
one important thing is the nasa
pharyngeal swaps so the mass of our
angle swabs are most commonly used in
the carriers and the second one is when
you see an active case so for an active
cases you have to isolate these factory
after cerebrospinal fluid and the best
way to remove the spirit pro spinal
fluid is by the lumbar puncture so for
the cases you need to go for the CSF
that is by lumbar puncture and further
carriers you need to go for the nests of
arranger
slap and when I'm talking about the
meningococcal okay when I'm talking so
these are the two important things that
you have to make it so apart from this
when I'm talking about the previous one
this particular syndrome the best way of
isolating the factory is from the blood
because it is shock related okay it is
shock related and you just mainly due to
the bleeding so you have to isolate from
the blood so three important points one
is for carriers you need to isolate from
the nasa pharyngeal swab and for the
normal cases you need to identify from
the cerebrospinal fluid by the lumbar
puncture and the third one is you need
to identify you need to remove it from
the blood okay so these are the
investigations point of view and they
can ask you the most sensitive
investigation method is pc r-- okay so
pcr is the most sensitive investigation
and the most common is all this the most
common is isolation isolation is the
isolation of the bacteria from the
culture is the most common whereas the
most sensitive is is the pcr okay i hope
you are clear with the investigations -
so next i was just talking about the
drug of choice drug of choice will learn
in the pharmacology part and is already
discussed about vaccinations this
particular organism that is
meningococcal has a vaccination okay so
it has different vaccinations it's
already discussed there is no vaccine
for the B type okay so points to be
added about the vaccination is there is
no accent so there is no vaccine for B
type B 0 type 0.1 the second important
point vaccine is not effective in
children
less than two years and vaccine is most
commonly given at the age of eleven to
twelve years so in the idea Rezendes the
vaccines are regularly given so drug of
choice and everything will learn there
so this is a slide of meningococcal you
can see the tip local you can see the
capsule okay you can see they can
identify the capsule also very clearly
so that is how you can differentiate the
both one is the non capsulated one is
the capsulated okay so Dan for now I'm
just going to have a quick recap if you
want this is how you need to prepare the
map
okay the map is going to give you the
diagnosis and everything it's makes it's
going to make your subject very very
simple so this is gram-negative or non
sporulating non motile oxidase positive
LOC okay these are the two coming to the
differences capsulated length shaped or
Halfmoon shape both both non capsulated
kidney shaped only glucose only
intracellular so I'm going to talk about
I'm going to talk more about the PNA
which are divided into type 1 type 2
type 3 and type 4 and 1 2 3 proteins and
lip was occupied as my only concern with
a neurotoxin so different types most
common in male most common in female
coming to the investigations I have
discussed about the culture mediums make
a note the next one is I'm more
concerned about your 0 types divided
into 13 out of which a is most common in
India and I have discussed about this ok
the peculiar feature is septic shock
hemorrhagic lesions and disseminated
intravascular coagulation NASA pharynx
is the most common area for the carriers
nasa pharyngeal swath normal cases you
have to take a lumbar puncture most
communists this year and isolation is
the most commonly used and most
sensitive is the pcr
so this is one no vaccination for your
be type not effective in the children
less than 12 years learnt always so is
most is most commonly given in the
of eleven to twelve years so thank you
all done for now signing off doctors
taken from team MDS concur stay positive
this is how you need to prepare the road
maps for the cases because need to zero
to zero is an updated paper is a
modified path
