Link in the description box and pin
comments so let's get started so first
up we have the software development life
cycle or
sdlc so the software development life
cycle is a process used by the software
developers to design develop and test
high quality software it consists of
several stages each stage helps ensure
the software is reliable functional and
meets user needs so understanding sdlc
is crucial because it gives you a
holistic view of software development
it's like knowing the recipe before you
start
cooking so the different phases of sdlc
are requirements Gathering understanding
what the stakeholders need design
planning the solutions architecture
implementation which is writing the
codee then comes testing which is
ensuring the code works as intended then
comes deployment which is releasing the
software to users and finally
maintenance which is updating and fixing
the software as needed so each phase has
its own importance and knowing these
phases helps you understand how devops
practices integrate to make the
development and deployment processes
more efficient and
reliable so next let's talk about Linux
Linux is a type of operating system
system like Windows or Mac OS that runs
on many servers computers and devices
around the world it's known for being
stable secure and free to use but why
Linux because it's the backbone of most
server environments you'll work with
here are the essentials you should focus
on which are command line operations
shell scripting learn bash to automate
repetitive tasks system administration
like understand how to manage users
permissions and processes and package
management so Linux is used everywhere
in the server world and knowing it well
will help you fix problems automate
tasks and manage servers easily now the
next one is learning a scripting or
programming language so knowing a
scripting language like python Ruby or
even bash is essential these languages
help you automate tasks write scripts
and manage infrastructure so here's why
you should learn scripting automation
write scripts to automate repetitive
tasks such as backups deployments and
monitoring
configuration management tools like
anible use Python for automation
infrastructure management use scripts to
manage Cloud resources databases and
more so choose a language and start
building small projects to get hands-on
experience I highly recommend python due
to its Simplicity and extensive
libraries now git is next on our
list git is the most popular version
control system out there it allows you
to track changes collaborate with others
and maintain a history of your code so
key Concepts to learn include
repositories how to create and manage
them commits recording changes to the
repository branches which is working on
different features simultaneously and
merging which is integrating changes
from different branches so familiarize
yourself with platforms like GitHub
gitlab and bitbucket these platforms
facilitate collaboration and quote
Management in a team
environment now networking and security
are critical components of a devops
engineer skill set you'll need to
understand how data flows through
networks how to set up firewalls and
secure your applications so focus on
these areas basic networking
understanding IP addresses DNS HTTP
https and TCP IP protocols network
security learn about firewalls VPN and
encryption techniques and application
security Implement security best
practices such as input validation
authentication and authorization so this
knowledge will help you build secure and
reliable systems ensuring data integrity
and
confidentiality now let's move on to
Cloud providers so AWS Azure and Google
Cloud platform are the big players here
so start with one and learn the
basics so number one compute services
like ec2 AWS VMware in Azure and comput
engine in
gcp then come storage services like S3
and AWS blob storage and aure and cloud
storage in
gcp and then database services like RDS
and ews SQL database in Azure and Cloud
SQL in gcp so understanding cloud
services is crucial as most modern
applications run on cloud infrastructure
so learn about I am which is identity
and access management for security and
explore Cloud specific services and
tools offered by these
providers now next you need
infrastructure as code or IAC which is a
game changer so infrastructure as code
is a way to set up and manage Computer
Resources like servers and networks
using Code instead of doing it by hand
so you write scripts that describe what
you need and then tools like terraform
or anible read these scripts and set
everything up for you
automatically so this makes it easy to
create update and keep everything
consistent every time this means you can
Version Control your infrastructure just
like your application code so the key
benefits include consistency which
ensure that environments are identical
then scalability it easily replicates
environments across multiple regions and
then Version Control with track changes
to your infrastructure over time so you
can start by writing simple terraform
scripts to provision resources or use
anible to automate configuration
management now next up we have
microservices and containers so
microservices architecture allows you to
break down your application into smaller
independent services so containers with
tools like docker package these services
and their dependencies ensuring they run
consistently across environments so you
should definitely focus on microservices
which is understand the principles of
Designing and building microservices
then Docker learn how to create Docker
files build images and run containers
and then container Registries so use
Docker Hub or private Registries to
store and share images so these Concepts
will help you build scalable and
efficient applications that are easy to
deploy and manage now following
containers we have container orchestr
so cuetes is the go-to tool here it
manages the deployment scaling and
operations of containerized applications
so the key components that you need to
learn of cuber needs are number one pods
the smallest Deployable units that can
contain one or more containers is called
po next Services networking components
that Define a set of parts and a policy
by which to access them and then
deployments which are controllers that
manage the desired state of ports so
learning cuber needs can be challenging
but it's incredibly powerful it Ates
many operational tasks allowing you to
focus on building great applications now
moving on to next continuous integration
and continuous deployment or cicd are at
the heart of devops so tools like genkin
Circle CI and gitlab CI help automate
the process of testing and deploying
code so here's why cicd is
crucial continuous integration
automatically tests your code to catch
issues earlier continuous deployment it
automatically deploy your code to
production reducing time to Market and
then pipelines it Define the steps to
build test and deploy your application
so mastering cicd will make your
development process more efficient and
reliable allowing for faster and more
frequent releases so next monitoring and
login so monitoring and logging are
essential for maintaining and
troubleshooting your applications so
tools like Prometheus grafana and Elk
stack which is elastic search lock stash
and kibana provide insights into your
systems performance and help you
diagnose issues
so you must focus on metrics which is
Track Performance metrics like CPU
memory and network usage logging collect
and analyze log data to troubleshoot
issues alerting set up alerts to notify
you of potential issues before they
become critical so by setting a proper
monitoring and logging you ensure your
systems run smoothly and can quickly
respond to any
problems so now devops is not just about
tools and Technologies it's also about
people so collaboration and
communication are crucial you'll be
working closely with developers
operations teams and other stakeholders
which mean you must definitely focus on
communication tools like start using
slack Microsoft teams or other tools for
effective communication then comes
project management so utilize tools like
jeta or Trello to manage tasks and
projects and then you must develop soft
skills so develop empathy active
listening and clear communication to
work effectively in a team so being able
to convey ideas clearly and work
effectively in a team is a key to your
success in develop
so finally let's talk about leadership
and strategy so as you grow in your
career you may take on more
responsibilities and Lead teams so
understanding the Strategic aspects of
devop such as implementing best
practices driving cultural change and
aligning devops initiatives with
business goals is crucial so focus on
best practices Implement and advocate
for devops Best Practices within your
team next cultural change Foster a
culture of collaboration continuous
Improvement and learning and then
strategic alignment ensure devops in
initiatives aligned with business
objectives and deliver value so
leadership skills will help you inspire
and guide your team towards success
making a significant impact on your
organization and there you have it the
