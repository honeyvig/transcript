how to manage your team on the business
Suite okay so let's get
going The Meta business Suite used to be
known as the Facebook business manager
in fact Facebook business manager is
still available um and I'll come back to
that in a minute the differences between
the meta business suite and the meta
business manager but as launched in
2014 it now is a all encompassing tool
for advertisers marketers business
owners um agencies to manage the
Facebook and Instagram business that
they are uh that they are running so
there's a lot of good stuff about the
business about the meta business Suite
there's some good advantages and some
good benefits that you can get from this
it makes handling your Facebook and
Instagram account very easy there
there's lots of functionality that you
find in the meta business Suite to
manage your account of Facebook and
Instagram it also allows you to manage
your team smoothly you can assign
responsibilities to team members making
the communication and getting things
done on Facebook and Instagram a lot
easier there's extensive analytics and
insights that gives you lots of
information about how you're performing
on uh on Facebook and Instagram helping
you to improve your activities there is
tight security with detailed control
over who can do what on um on Facebook
and Instagram there are tools like chat
and inbox that you can have to manage a
communication with your customers and
being part of the Meta Family it links
with other met meta platforms as well
yeah like audience management
advertising messaging tools and what
have you so it is your full package for
your digital and your social media
marketing game focused on Facebook and
on Instagram good so let's look at how
to set up your business manager account
I'm going to walk you through setting up
your business account and then we're
going to show you how that gives you
access to your advertising your pages
your teams how you can post Etc so if
you go on Facebook there are two places
there are is the Facebook business
manager and there is the meta business
suite and that is a bit confusing yeah
so let's talk about the difference
between the two so the Facebook business
manager and The Meta business suite are
two different applications and they
serve different purposes yeah though the
Facebook business manager is designed
for businesses that rely on Facebook for
their marketing and advertising efforts
while the meta business Suite is
designed for businesses that want to
manage their total online presence yeah
the meta business manager is free and it
helps you manage your Facebook page the
advertising and all your assets in one
place once you have a Facebook page bu
business page it is essential to have
met a business B manager as further
development of your Facebook and your
Instagram so the business manager allows
you to create and track your ad
campaigns that you are managing it helps
you access and control billing settings
and create custom audiences for your ads
and you have the the option to allocate
specific tasks across your team but it's
very much focused on um on Facebook and
the core functionality of managing your
Facebook page but the business um also
by the way the business manager gives
you the ability to manage your meta
pixels or your Facebook pixels that you
can use for retargeting so everything
you want to do with your Facebook page
you can do within the Facebook business
manager but Facebook learned or meta
learned that people wanted more people
wanted to manage their Instagram do
their posting do their content calendar
so they needed more functionality and
that's where Facebook came out with the
meta business Suite that is a
centralized area to manage your Facebook
your Instagram you're messaging in one
place so you can save time to manage
your business and to manage your
connections and develop relationships
with more people so cross functionality
is one of the business Suite most
appealing features so the ability to
view all your social activities at a
glance in One dashboard manage multiple
Facebook inboxes and making your
Community Management very simple to do
you can also create and schedule posts
and stories on both Facebook and
Instagram through the meta business uh
the business suite and it's also a great
tool for managing and tracking your page
insights and managing tracking trends
that can help you better understand your
audiences
so in summary meta business Suite is an
application that should be used if you
are looking for an easier way to post
engage with your communities across
Facebook and your Instagram business
accounts where the meta business manager
is a site to be used if you're looking
to run ad campaigns with a team in
control your business account settings
and manage your Facebook page so here
are the two introduction screens here's

crucial yeah understanding the layout
the tools and TS is like unlocking the
secrets for smoothly cruising through

where things are and how to use them to
make the most of this tool so let's

content through uh through
advertising and what else have we got
we're talking about advertising and here
are all your tools as we saw that the
tools are
about getting active in your Facebook

about creating posts and stories and ads
and go live yeah there is section about
engaging with your audience a section
about

your advertising are the
audiences there is about your Commerce

yep so that is in a nutshell and then
here you have search there's help and
here you have settings which is very
important tool as well because that's
where you can specify the settings in
using your meta business
with right so this is what the dashboard
is all about this is all about making
your life easier and your business
management game Stronger Yeah so let's
dig in there and let's go into a bit
more details there's dedicated areas for
advertising and for your pages okay so
if I click here on the all tools I show
that there is dedicated areas for
advertising on an ad level or even on an
ad manager level yeah and it's very
important that you understand how you

explore them it's where the advertising
magic happens so it gives you kind of
the backp pass entrance to all your ads
when you want to check on your ads want
to tweak them or see how they're
performing this is the place where you
want to go so it is a must to understand
how to use these ads yeah and and how to
use the ads manager we'll go later this
is a series of three videos in the third
video we're going to get more details on
accessing the ads manager and the ads
yeah there's also the section on the
pages these are like the shop window of
Facebook and Instagram presence manage

go to the page
settings yeah so it allows you to set
the pages the the details of your pages
it sets the Privacy for your pages it
sets the locations you can link accounts
videos branded content lots of elements
that you can set here for your pages so
go through that make sure that you
understand how to manage this okay so
it's opened a new window so I can just
close that window to go back to my
business manager to my business Suite I
have to say Okay so most important thing
here this dashboard gives you access to
all the functionality of your meta
business suite and a very important
button to close this section with is on
the settings and in the settings you can
set set up your language billing ad
account settings and you may have seen
this earlier when we've set up the um
the account in the business manager yeah
so if you want to revisit that if you
want to make changes then you can do
that here in the settings
area now that you understand the
dashboard let's dig a bit deeper into a
very important section in The Meta
business Suites which which are your
meta insights that is not just another
tool it is the data Hub of your Facebook
and Instagram presence where you can get
information about your audience about
how your pages are doing and whether
your advertising is achieving its
objectives it gives you kind of a cheat
sheet for making decisions you want to
know about who your audience is you want
to know where they are insights gives
you that data you're in curious about
your face Facebook page performance
check it out on the inside in on the
inside you want to know how your ads are
performing meta insights will give you
the detail so this is basically where
you go to become a strategic
thinker armed with real time information
about your Facebook and your Instagram
presence so let's have a look at this
let's go to the
insights yes so so heading over to the
meta page so let's go to the all
tools yep and there's two different ways
of going there you can access that
through your page or you can access it
here through your
insights and this is where you're going
to get a gold mine of
information about your presence on
Facebook yes so and it sorts it neatly
into sections like page views followers
engagement and um your content you want
to know how many views you got here you
can see how many you got you want to
know how your ads are running here you
can see how they are doing you want to
know your audience you want to know more
about your followers about your
Instagram followers here is where you
can find all that information and all
that knowledge now these aren't not just
numbers on the screen these numbers they
tell you what is happening and they can
help you refining your Facebook strategy
it helps you to tweak your Instagram and
your Facebook strategy and it can helps
you in checking how your audience is
responding yeah it is really good
information so take for instance
information about your audience yeah it
gives you the followers it gives you on
Facebook and Instagram you it also gives
you detail about age and gender of your
followers it gives them where are they
coming
from yeah the top cities or the top
countries so you can Benchmark this data
with
competitors yeah you can also look at
your content so the content is a very
important one this is probably in my
opinion one of the most important TAPS
in the uh meta insights section so this
dissects your posts and it shows you how
each of your post is
doing when it comes to number of people
reached number of people that have seen
the post number of people that have seen
the video you can watch uh split it by
post and by stories you can split it by
let's just do photo posts no photo post
mostly we're we video posts yep and you
can specify the columns here as well so
I want to see the type of
post yeah so I can then apply and it
gives you lots of information here you
see on the videos how many minutes
people viewed the post how many
Impressions that you got the reach of
the post post and the most important one
is the engagement on the post and that
is this button is the reactions likes
comments and share this is a critical
column in your Facebook in uh your
Facebook insights yeah if I order this
from top
down yeah so here then I see those posts
with the highest engagement over the
last 28 days and this is where you can
learn what posts work and what posts do
not work and that is golden information
because if you know this post works then
why not make more of those posts so
people can um so you can get in similar
engagement level and overall it can help
you in driving your engagement
levels so very useful reports you can
see what posts are stealing the shows
what posts need a bit of
tweaking and it can help you in making
sure that you hit the right content with
the right the right people with the
right content so think about this tab
the content tab as checking what posts
work and what those post don't work and
you can use that to optimize your posts
for um
future so there's a lot more in here you
can get audience information here as
well and we'll talk about that in a um
in a later demo on how to develop
audiences in your Facebook your your
meta
insights right let's move on let's go to
the fourth and final demo of this video
which is about collaboration and Team
Management let's go back to the meta
business Suite in this demo we'll dive
into the world of collaboration and Team
Management within your meta business
Suite so metab business Suite is not
just an act for you it's not a solo act
it is about getting your whole marketing
team on Facebook on the meta business
Suite yep and that can help you in kind
of supercharging your uh your management
of your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's break down how you can add team
members because teamwork is like the
secret source that can really make your
better meta business Suite come to life
so it is very useful to get your team
online so it helps you keep people in
the loop you can assign specific
roles yeah so everybody knows what
they're doing what they're supposed to
be doing when they get on the on the
meta business suite and very important
even if your page is across or if your
team is across multiple locations you
can still work as a team in managing
your um your Facebook and your Instagram
so let's go down to the basics the first
of this is building your team so what
you're going to do you're going to move
to the business settings and here you
see
people yeah already you here see an
overview of the people that
are available on this business
account that can use and there's
currently one that is me and I've done
another one which is me on another email
and the invite has been sent but I
haven't accepted it but let's go and
click an invite let's first look here on
the people button that is basically that
leads you to this scream if I click here
on invite people
you can then go through a number of
steps yeah so in this section you can
select
people once you've select those people
you can assign their access you can
assign business assets to those people
you can review the invitation and then
you can send it out so let's go through
this process so we're going to enter the
email again we're going to do just
myself
[Music]
uh yep and I can get temporary access or
for the advanced option I can remove but
I'm just doing it yeah so this is
actually quite useful temporary access
for instance if you want like an agency
you want them to have a quick look at
your Facebook insights for instance you
can just give them temporary access for
the day and then you want to switch it
off
yeah on uh that particular uh that
particular time frame we're not going to
do that I'm just going to click
next and then here you can specify the
access that you want to give to this
person yeah so you can give the person
partial access or you can give the
person full control so partial access is
the K they can only work on the tasks
and the business assets assigned to them
basic access yeah which was formerly the
employee role is the default access that
everyone gets when they are added okay
so that is what you can set you can
integrate with um with apps and
different in Integrations like the
Facebook pixel that people can view them
and manage them I'm not going to do this
in this case or you can give somebody
full control which is like an admin role
yeah so that would be the bu business
admin role and they can manage
everything including settings people
tools business asset they can delete a
business account yeah so does not
include the advanced options so you need
to be careful with this but once you
give somebody full
control yep then um they are basically
an admin for that so click shared then
there you can also look at the financial
information like transactions invoices
accounts
and payment method so that could be for
your finance manager for instance so I
am just going to be full
control yeah so I'm happy with that no
no let's not do this I am actually none
I'm just going to be a basic control and
I click next I can then assign business
assets so there is the Facebook page
there is the ad account I can assign
products I can assign the Instagram
account the Commerce account I can
assign pixels data sets so lots of stuff
that I can assign here okay so the
Facebook page and the Instagram account
that's what I want this person to be
assigned I can then review business
assets not assigned sign business assets
I then here need probably need to
specify can manage the content yeah so
Insight add oh select the business asset
so the r for Russia page yep I can then
assign content Community activity ads
insights and leads okay that's all I
want to get and then I'll click next and
then I'm going to send an
invitation to Mark markm man.com and as
soon as I accept the
invitation I will then show up on this
list as we saw here yeah and accepted
and I am then part of the team that
manages the um that manage the Facebook
or The Meta business suite for this
particular page right so that's a wrap

Suite let me summarize yeah the meta

to look at how do you create a post on
Facebook and on
Instagram how do you plan your content
and how do you use the content
calendar what are the
notifications uh that you need to work
on and that you can set up and where the
you set them up in the meta business
Suite we'll look at the inbox the
messages and comments and how you can
automate responses and then finally
we'll dig a bit deeper into the stories
how can you create stories using the
meta business
Suite there are many social media
posting and planning tools like Hood
Suite like Soho social buffer Sprout
social they all work really well and
they allow you to schedule and manage
posts on your social media channels on
Facebook on X on Instagram and many
other platforms however there are
various reasons why you want to choose
to meta business suite for your posting
over other
platforms first of all meta business
Suite is developed by meta ensuring a
seamless integration with Facebook and
Instagram and making sure that you can
leverage all the functionality in
Facebook and Instagram within your
posting in The Meta business Suite also
content published through the meta
business Suite may have slight advantage
in the algorithmic reach on Facebook and
Instagram basically Facebook will reward
you for using meta Business site to post
your content by giving you a wider reach
for your post it ALS also gives you
access to new features and updates
within Facebook yeah and Instagram
faster than other tools like
hotu they offer better security measures
and compliance with platform policies
within the meta business suite and
direct access to support is available
within the meta business Suite as well
so that will expedite your issues
resolution so Facebook the publishing
facilities within the meta business
manager they are designed specifically
for Facebook and Instagram so that makes
it much friendlier easier for you to use
than some of the other
platforms good so let's delve into the
posting and Publishing on Facebook and
Instagram
let me go to the real life dashboard so
here you see the
dashboard and let me first show you how
to um create a post there are various
roots that you can use to create a post
there is here the create Post Yeah you
can also go through the planner you can
go through the content so there are
various ways that you can get into but
let me show you the create post uh the
simple approach I'm clicking here create
post and I'm then getting to the basic
screen for creating a post yep so here
you see all the elements that you need
to do yep so first of all you're going
to specify the platform that you want to
post and I've selected here Facebook and
Instagram I can then add the photo I can
use a template and here I can use
specific text then here I see the
scheduling options I can set my privacy
settings and here you see the preview
either in the Facebook feed or in the
Instagram feed so I'm going to add a
photo I can actually upload from the
desktop or add from the file manager
we'll look into the file manager in a
bit but I'm clicking upload from desktop
and then here I can go to let's say for
Russia picking this photo the photo is
now being uploaded and here I see what
the post is going to look like then here
I can add a text and I can say
winter
promotion yeah in RI for Russia I see
here how the text is being added yes so
I can completely see how the post is
being set up I can add all the stuff
that I can add on Facebook as well yep I
see the Facebook feed preview I can go
for the Instagram feed
preview I can look at the desktop and
the mobile version so it's a fully
featured um posting platform within the
meta business piece yeah so now a few um
things of of course before finalizing
the post take advantage of this preview
feature in the business Suite yes so
make sure that your visuals and your
caption displays as intended and that
there are no formatting issues so making
sure that the post looks exactly like
you want it to look and then when you're
happy with the post you click either
publish or you can say finish
later
so I can also schedule the post yes so
I'm clicking here publish and then the
post will be published this may take a
moment or you can set here your
scheduling
options yeah so you see now that the
post is
published so but I actually I'm going to
delete it in a minute because I don't
want this post to go live yeah so if I
can want to create that post I can also
say the scheduling options and I can set
a date and a time for my post okay so
that gives it to you in a
nutshell and what we're going to do now
is let's look at this file manager in a
bit more detail the file manager is a
tool that meta business Suite um has put
together to allow you to add and
organize your assets for your business
account yeah assets like your photos
like your ads like videos Etc so with
file manager you can collaborate on
files and folders you can assign access
to creative assets and you can plan your
content more efficiently so you can
manage your image and video files for
use in your posts or your stories or
your videos you can upload multiple
assets at the same time for later use
you can create create albums to organize
and access your creative assets and you
can share your assets with other people
in your team so how do you access the um
file manager you can go here to all
tools and then within the old tools you
see here file manager so click on that
and that takes you to your file manager
where you can create folders and where
you can add sort of creatives in your
folder so if I go to this folder and I
can uh check the folder and here you see
one of the um the assets that I've added
into this file manager clicking here I
can straightly bring it into my creative
posts yep so I can use it to create a
story or I can delete it I can look at
my folder setting yeah here you can see
which people have access to to the
folders I can assign Partners to the
folders I can edit these folder
permissions so very useful tool and
particularly if you have lots of assets
for your products then this can be a
very helpful tool in managing those
assets so that that takes me then a step
deeper to the content Tab In The Meta
business Suite as well yeah that is
where you can find all your public
lished and drafts and scheduled posts
including your reals your video posts
your stories your photos and your live
videos you can see what is published
what is scheduled what is draft what is
expiring what is
expired yeah you can add your reals you
can even export the data and still still
access to your create post or your
create
real here you can see see the date
published of the post you can see the
status of the post if it has been
boosted or not yeah if it was the
distribution for the Post how many you
see then some some some statistics on
the posts as well and we'll dive deeper
into the insights later in the third
video but here you can already see The
Impressions the reach the players and
very important the reactions the
engagement that you had on the different
posts so very useful tool yes so you can
within this tool you can manage your
post you can create posts as well and
there's also access here to your ab test
if you want to test posts on their uh
their effectiveness you can also within
the content and I like that you can see
your feed and your grid yeah so here you
see your Facebook feed this one is that
I've just published although I've
deleted it as well but um yeah and here
you see your Instagram feed you can see
your mentions and your tags so it's
almost like managing your feed as well
and here you see your collections within
your file manager like Facebook photos
playlists and series that you've can
created very useful tool that um you can
use to manag your content together with
the file
manager right so that concludes the
posting element yeah let's now go into
the next level of managing your posts
and that is through the planner the
planner can be accessed by clicking the
planner button here on the menu in The
Meta business Suite dashboard so if I
click on the planner yeah you can access
your kind of your content dashboard and
within this dashboard you can have a
total overview of what you have posted
and what you're going to
post and you can see some basic
information about your different posts
as well yeah and it's a very useful
visual tool to plan your content and to
plan ahead of your content
so you click on the planner tab as I
mentioned yeah it also features this
calendar that helps you plan schedule
and visualize what count content you
want to share and when you want to share
it you can also use this calendar to
coordinate your content with holidays
and special events what is going on and
you can also use it to manage your
creative access your creative assets
yep so here you see the goals that you
can specify you can add goals yeah so
here for instance I want to increase
reach you can specify that for a
specific period and then here you see
how you fair against reaching the
objective of the goal that you've set
there's also the moments now
unfortunately moments does not work in
most of the markets currently it's only
working in the us so here you will see
what sort of events are coming up like
holidays National events or you can
specify your own events and that's
always good with your posting of your
content because you can then relate your
content to the events that are relevant
in your
market so you can look at your content
type yeah so you can have all your
content show showing in your calendar or
you can look at your stories your reals
or your ads and here you can specify set
it by week or by
month and it gives you as I said earlier
a fantastic overview of what you have
done and what you're going to do it also
and that's what I really like about it
gives you a um gives you kind of a a a
library of the posts that you have done
in the
past so the content calendar yeah is
very important it's also called an
editorial col calendar it's used by the
marketing team to plan and schedule your
content across your Facebook and your
Instagram so it serves as a road map for
your social media marketing strategy and
it make sure that you will be consistent
and
cohesive with your posting yeah and it's
a very important tool that marketing
teams are using some key elements of
your calendar yeah it outlines the type
of content you plan to share that's
number one yeah it helps you scheduling
it includes the specific dates and times
for when your posts will be or when for
when your content will be
published yeah so you can schedule it
forward as well what are the posts that
you are planning in the coming
months good content calendars have an
integration of your different social
media
channels yep so that is very useful
because then you can select and show the
post for each sort of um channel that
you're using the calendar often include
themes or topics for postings yeah so
you have a diverse range of content that
you're scheduling there's also alignment
with your campaigns in your content
calendar so it aligns with your broader
marketing campaigns or events so your
social media efforts they're really
contributing to to sort of achieving
your marketing objectives good content
calendars they have collaboration
features so multiple team members can
contribute or review so you can
coordinate your efforts across your
posting and by pling planning and
scheduling your content in advance yeah
it's just a matter of efficiency it
helps streamline your content creation
and your posting process and finally a
good content calendar helps with the
communication within your marketing team
so everybody is aware of what is being
scheduled what poats are coming and they
can plan their tasks according
L now that we looked at the publishing
and planning side of your content and
your posts let's look at the
notifications a very important part of
your Facebook and Instagram presence
unfortunately metab business Suite
allows you to receive
notifications related to your Facebook
and your Instagram business accounts
whether you get those on messaging or
whether you get them on your email so
what are notifications they are kind of
alerts or messages that inform
people yeah and it's mainly you of
course and your marketing team that are
working on the meta business Suite as
well about specific activities updates
or interactions with the meta business
weed
platform so what are the features of the
notifications in the meta business Suite
so here we go into the notifications
button that we can access through the
meta business Suite menu so click on
notifications yeah so first of all you
can customize your
notifications yeah so you can customize
the notification preferences based on
your settings and your priority
you can receive realtime updates on
relevant activities so that keeps you in
the loop and you can explore the
advanced notification settings and in
the advanced notification settings you
can tailor your notifications based on
specific activities so you're getting
prompt sort of um messages about events
that are critical to your
business so here's the overview do yes
so here there's no new notifications
here are the other notifications that
are coming in these are notifications
from within your um within your Facebook
or your Instagram here you can filter
your
notifications yeah so you can have uh
set for Action needed message reminders
comments
recommendations notifications only for
Facebook Facebook or Instagram or your
business account here you can set Market
read and here you have the settings of
your notification and here you can
specify what notifications you want to
have and most notifications that will go
within your team your marketing team
will go through
email yeah so you can set notifications
for Facebook for um yeah for your page
for messages for comments for
announcements for
suggestions other Communications like
tags likes shares and here are you can
set your business email notifications
for business permissions roles ad
accounts pixels and more yeah so that
goes um quite
deep so let me dig a bit deeper in the
type of notifications you can get via
your email
that could be activity alerts yeah so
they include alerts about activities on
your business Pages like new likes
comments or shares they can be page
insights so users may receive
notifications about insights and
analytics related to the performance of
the business page there could be alerts
on messenger
interactions yeah so if you use the
messenger for customer communication you
may receive notifications about new uh
customer messages could be um alerts or
notifications around ad campaign
updates so information about your ad
performance the budget charges or budget
changes or other AD campaign related
events there could be page management
alerts yeah important actions or changes
related to the management of your
business page there could be platform
form announcements from
meta yeah they may use the notifications
to in uh communicate important platform
announcements updates or
changes there could be notifications
related to security and finally
notifications around events and
reminders so very useful tool to use
important to make sure that you set the
right
preferences and make sure that you you
check it regularly yeah what the
notifications are that you are getting
in besides the
notifications another important area is
your
inbox and within your inbox you have
your messages you have your comments and
your automated
responses so you can access that by
clicking on the inbox in your menu
yeah and meta business Su they offer
several
features related to this communication
and engagement within your inbox they
enable your your business to effectively
manage your communication and your
engagement on Facebook and on Instagram
so a centralized inbox is very handy
that you can have that because it
streamlines your responses and it makes
sure you and you sort of you respond
timely and
consistently with your
audience so if you look at the menu your
centralized Hub as it were this is where
you can manage your entire inbox you can
look at just the messages messenger
Instagram yeah on WhatsApp Facebook
comments Instagram
comments yep so here you see all the
messages whether it's un red if it needs
follow up you can label it here is the
filters that you can specify here you
see the people that communicate with you
then here you see the community or the
sort of the communication that is being
done so really useful if I go here to
myself yeah what you see for the users
as well that have enabled that you can
see their profile details as well
and you can set a label could be like a
new customer or a prospect you can add
labels yeah so that can be like a mini
sort of CRM system to manage the
communication with your prospects for
instance yeah so that is the um the
inbox
so and that is sort of the um the the
dashboard that you have for your inbook
box so again we'll look at your
messenger yeah so that's all the private
messages that you received within your
Facebook an Instagram business account
the
comments yeah they focus on comments
that you get within your Facebook or
your Instagram business page so this is
where you can efficiently Monitor and
respond to comments so that can really
help you with developing your engagement
with your
audience so what I really like about the
inbox is that you can also set up
automations so you can set up automated
responses to messages messages that you
received within your um within your
inbox so they can be customized and
triggered based on specific keywords
based on Greetings or specific questions
that you get and they are very useful to
provide instant replies and managing
manage your customer inquiries
efficiently so they can be
configured yeah to acknowledge a receipt
of a message or provide basic
information or guide users to relevant
Source Sant relevant resources so let's
have a look if I click on the
alterations yeah then here you see there
is basically a um a library of
automations that you can set
up and some here you can see the ones
that you have already set up and that
you have activated so for instance I
have already activated an instant reply
or I've activated identify unanswered
messages yeah my away message is not on
or I can create an Automation and then
here you see the library of kind of
templates that you can choose from you
can greet people yeah share information
organize messages send a confirmation or
follow
up yes
so you start with templates so it is not
a huge library of templates that you
have but at least it allows you to to
use to look at specific um sort of
common
sort of scenarios that you can can face
and you can set sort of alterations for
those right let's go back and let's go
to the final demo in this video and that
is take a bit of a deeper look into
creating
stories so stories of a very Dynamic and
engaging format for content sharing
yeah because of their temporary nature
and their interactive features and Prime
placement don't forget that yeah it
makes them a very valuable tool for
businesses that want to enhance the
engagement on their social media
presence and connect with their
audiences and make the content more
authentic and
immediate stories also help increasing
the visibilities because they appear at
the top of a user's feed so that
provides Prime real estate for
visibility and it makes it more likely
that users will see your content and
engage with your
content yes so and there are lots of
Engagement opportunities as stories are
designed to be interactive with features
like polls questions quizzes swipe up um
links yeah and it connects with your
audience in a much more engaging
way
so let's have a look at the stories how
you create
them yeah so here we say create
story yeah what I like about stories is
that they provide the opportunity to
share kind of raw unfiltered content to
your users so you can give your your
followers a behind the scenes look at
your business or the personal life and
makes your posts a lot of a lot more
authentic yeah so you can build stronger
relations with your uh with your
audience there's also a thing like fomo
as we call it it's the fear of missing
out because of the temporary nature of
stories they typically last for 24 hours
it creates a sent of
urgencies yeah so you encourage users to
check your stories regularly because
they feel I don't want to miss anything
that you are um that you are posting in
your
stories it's kind of known that people
for instance on Instagram will spend
more time in the stories than in the
news
feeds yep and businesses use that they
businesses know that stories yeah their
algorithm they often prioritize stories
making them more likely to appear on the
users uh feed so and another big feature
of stories by the way is the highlights
feature particularly on Instagram so you
can create story highlights which are
collections of past stories that you can
feature on your profile permanently so
that is a fantastic way to Showcase
important information or key aspects of
your brand I always say it's like the
menu of your website yeah you can
actually have that in the highlights on
your
Instagram so and finally the power of
stories is also that they offer
advertising opportunities both in
Facebook and in Instagram so businesses
can use that to reach a broader audience
and promote products or
Services of course it's not as user
friendly as on the mobile but at least
you have some functionality on the um
that you can have on the mobile as well
so add photo video we're going to go
into the same photo here open
yep so here you see the photo and here
you see how the story is being
uploaded yep so you can then add your
text as well so you can click
edit yep so here you can see I can crop
I can text or I can add stickers so
let's add text so the text will be um
I'm going to put it here yeah
so uh winter
promotion yeah put that
here and then we have text is blue or
text is red let's make it
yellow here we go font I can
choose yep and then I can say let's
stick with that and here I can say I'm
going to add a sticker as well
yes so you have a whole library of
stickers it is again not as advanced as
you have on the mobile but at least you
can do a bit on the yeah so then I can
click apply I can add my multiple um
media of
course I can schedule it I can share it
straight away or I can schedule it and I
can set my privacy settings as well so
really good functionality within the
metab business Suite so create the
stories here or create them on Facebook
or Instagram itself on the mobile but at
least you have some functionality on
that here as well to Leverage The Power
of the
stories there are two additional items
in the old tools that you need to be
aware of that can help you with your
content creation and your content
planning if I click here on all tools
then in the menu you will see here sound
collection sound collection is a
fantastic tool to enhance your video and
audio content which with free music or
sound effects that you can use in your
posts and it's a hidden sort of Secret
In The Meta business Suite but it gives
you a great collection of hundreds of
sound files that you can add to your
videos or your um your photos or your
your stories and you can sort by genre
by Mood by duration by vocals by tempos
you can add it to favorites there is as
you can see here over 10,
13,28 to soundtracks in there that you
can can use and they're all free of
charge so there's tracks there's sound
effects and it is very very handy little
tool that you have in the meta business
manager so the other one that I want you
to be aware of if I go back home and
back into the old tools is the
collaboration
Center so here in the manage you see
your collaboration Center and that is
where you can sort of structure your
Partnerships with Brands and with
influencers so you can sort of assign uh
Brands and partners that you want to
collaborate with on your posts and with
the whole growth in the influencer
marketing uh area this is a very useful
part that you can um can you can set up
to manage those relationships we're

insights that you can get out of it

suite of tool with lots of valuable
insights like audience management
audience engagement metrics like ad

shop to manage everything you need to do
uh in managing your Facebook and your
Instagram now we've been through very um
areas of it like we looked at the
dashboard we looked at the um posting
scheduling managing your content we
found a treasure of tools and
functionalities and in today's session
we're going to look at three specific
areas we're going to dive into the
Commerce manager and we're going to be
talking about some very important
changes that meta has announced in 2023
about managing your shop we're going to
look at Facebook and Instagram ads I'm
going to show you the process of
creating an ad and how to manage your
your audiences and then we're going to
conclude the video
with demo about the Facebook and meta
insights that you can
get right let's kick off demo one the
Commerce
manager now it's important to understand
that meta has made some very important
announcements in managing your Facebook
shop in response to the current economic
downturn meta is investing heavily in Ai
and automation tools to boost campaign
performance through shop advertising and
The Meta Advantage Suite of ads and
we'll come back to that in a little bit
yeah what that uh that means but it mean
means that shops
are scaling down in
functionality but promoting your
products through advertising is kind of
scaling up in um in Facebook and
Instagram so the shop ads are going to
be Consolidated Under The Meta
advantage and they facilitate easier
shop setup with inapp check
out yeah so particularly for the markets
where you already have checkout
functionality within the Facebook app
yeah this is a very important
announcement that although the shop is
going to sort of deep be defocused the
advertising of your products is going to
get more center stage and thereby you
can promote more of your products to
your target
audiences Now new shop tools that are
coming out like ratings reviews they're
being tested and support for shops
without checkout and that's very
important to understand if you haven't
got a checkout functionality in your
shop yeah and that will be in most of
the countries except in the US and I
believe in India yeah they support for
the shops will be
discontinued with a focus on helping the
US businesses in adding the checkouts to
their existing shops basically what meta
is doing is to optimize the whole
shopping experience in the US market and
then rolling that out across other
markets which means that some of the
shop functionality and opening up a new
shop in Facebook in other Market like
Europe and like Asia is going to be
limited so this strategic change aims to
optimize the shopping experiences
support businesses and learn from the
experiences in the US before a global
roll out so remember as I said
discontinued support for shops without
checkouts in various markets like Europe
and Asia and um for those markets you
can start focusing and focus increase
your focus on personalized ads reals and
messaging and in the US the emphasis is
on aiding businesses in imp implementing
the checkout with support for shops
linking to a website until sort of first
quarter of 2024 so now this is clear
let's start with looking at the meta
Commerce manager yeah the Commerce
manager is the essential core of your
online store and it simplifies all your
store tasks with a userfriendly
interface so it enables you to manage
your products to process your orders and
deliver excellent customer service to
your customers who buy your products Now
by centralizing all e-commerce
activities meta business Commerce
manager helps you to focus on selling
your product through Facebook and
Instagram and that is of course a
fantastic opportunity that you have to
add an additional sales channel to your
um your current sales
operation so let's get into the
demo so here we see the meta business
Suite portal and to get into the
Commerce manager we go to um down here
we look at all the
tools and then we see here down here the
Commerce button we click on there and
this takes you to the Commerce manager
interface and here is your
dashboard yes so here you see the
overview but it gives you access to
activities like adding products to your
catalog like customizing your shop or
publishing your shop it gives you you
shop
insights it gives you things to do on
your catalog your shops offers that you
have it gives you your top products so
it gives you some basic insights it
gives you your top taged content and
there may be some questions you have
that you can get answers from through
the
FAQ so here you see the
important elements of managing your shop
there is your catalog
that's where you start of course yeah
there is the different shops you may
have and you can manage your shops here
you can run
promotions you can promote your product
through ads you can get insights you may
have a to-do list with things to
optimize your shop and here you go to
the
settings yeah of course always important
to start with the settings and you can
have a look at the details of your shop
there's the general settings of your
shop yeah like your account info like
your email there is your localization of
your shop but you can specify the
currency the language the product
details the shipping information you
have the settings for your catalog for
your business assets for your checkout
mid method permissions very important
you can assign permissions to different
users colleagues in your organization or
your agency yeah what they can do within
the Commerce manager and then there is
your customer support where you can uh
manage your claims your um charge back
email address details shop contact
information and what have you right so
that's important to understand all the
different items that you can go through
within your con cont your Commerce
manager so let's go and have a let's add
a product yeah so first you're going to
do here to your back to your home to
your overview yeah and there are various
ways that you can start adding products
to your catalog yes so you can here add
products to your catalog directly
here yep and then there is the catalog
menu here where you can set items have
product sets the data sources where are
your products coming from yeah and then
there's the um the events as well that
you can
specify okay so let's go quickly here at
one item is very important that is the
data
sources basically where are your
products coming from
yeah now here you get from your current
product catalog you see here what the
status is of your catalog yeah and
particularly when products come in from
a to um a Commerce site like Shopify
there may be issues with various
products that you need to have a look at
but here we can click on add an item or
add an item here yes so I'm just going
to click here in General add an item and
here you see the different ways that you
can add a product it can be done through
a data feed it can be done manually or
it can be done through a
pixel yeah that you can bring it in
through a pixel from another
website so look at the
manual yeah so if I'm just going to
click here on manual then here here you
see the
manual let's have a look here you see
the
manual process for adding a
product yep so you can just click a new
item well here is an item you can add an
image for your item you can add a title
the description a website link the price
for your product you can add a sales
price a Facebook product category
condition of the product a availability
the status yeah so lots of stuff that
you can add here for your product and
once you've done that yeah you then just
click upload
items so back in your dashboard you can
then click here on manage your catalog
and this is where you can see all the
products in your catalog and the status
and what the stock availability and the
price and of course if you have hundreds
of products you may want to set some
filters yeah check on attributes for
your
products have so that is how you can ma
add products to your catalog and how you
can manage your catalog as well so
another way to upload your items is
through a data feed and that's a very
important one yeah so you can actually
just enter a Google Sheets yep and you
can download in a template of the format
for the uh the Google Sheets that you
want to upload with your product
information but you can also enter a URL
from a server or a hosting website and
this URL is very important when you want
to work with external e-commerce stores
like for instance
Shopify the process there is that you
would um download kind of a a Facebook
app within your Shopify account and that
sets the connection with uh between
Shopify and the Facebook uh Commerce the
Facebook shop or there may be other
e-commerce platforms where they will
actually give you a
URL and that's where you can add that
URL and that sets a link and the good
thing often about these Sol uh these
these Solutions is that there will be a
live link between
your Ecommerce platform and your
Facebook shop that means when there is
changes in your product catalog in your
e-commerce platform it will
automatically be uploaded in your
Facebook Commerce data source or your
Facebook Commerce catalog right back to
the overview
so let's look at how you can edit your
shop now remember the the recent store
changes yeah so in most markets you can
no longer create a new shop but you can
edit an existing
shop and in some markers where there is
the inapp checkout functionality like in
the US you will still be able to create
new shops and manage your shops so let's
click here on shops and here you see the
shop that I have yep and it's um here I
can see the live
shop so here you see how the Sho the
shop looks like yep so um I can look at
the
products and I can look at the
categories I can search within the shop
here you see a version
history yep or I can close this and I
can here I can edit my shop I can edit
the layout of the shop and I can edit
the settings of the
shop so here you see the homepage I can
look at collections I can optimize the
layout I can add banners for offers I
can add a carousel of um of products or
collections to the Carousel and here I
can have suggestions for you yeah or a
dynamic and it serves the product that
is relevant for the customer yep but
remember this is going to scale down in
the future yeah you will no longer be
able to see a shop and actually on most
sort of Facebook pages you already see
that many Facebook pages have already
removed the shop because of the limited
functionalities that you have these
days
okay so that is the shop that you can um
edit in the layout and here in the
settings you can edit the visibility the
inventory the website content the
categories yep and um again lots of
stuff that you can uh can manage
here the final thing we want to do in
the Facebook Commerce is is to see how
we can do a promotion Y and if we go
back to the Commerce manager and the
uh the dashboard of the Commerce manager
we can click here on
promotions and here you see
offers and this is where we can create
offers and we can see an overview of our
active offers our scheduled offers and
offers that expired so let's have a look
at the create
offer functionality click on this and
here you can see your offer category so
I can have an amount of I can do a sale
I can do a free shipping I can do a buy
product X and get product y here's the
name of your offer and here you can see
the different if you want to use a promo
code if you don't want to use a promo
code then you take this or you can get a
CO a code that people have to enter and
here you see the summary of the offer so
we're going to give the name of the
offer is uh spring
promotion yeah no other changes it's an
automatic yes so no other details up
here to enter here we do the type are we
doing a percentage of or a flat amount
so let's say we're doing a
20% discount uh here you can select your
products we can say apply to the entire
shop or select some specific products
I'm going to do it for the entire shop
and then I can do include products that
already have a sales price or I cannot
include them the offer applies only once
per item or I can say let's do it per
order here you see what the offer would
look like yep and here you can set the
start date and the end date of your
offer if I'm happy with all these
settings I can then click here create
offer and then the offer will be live on
my
shop okay here is the summer uh sorry
here's the um the summary so the offer
has being created it gives you some some
tips so you can feature the offer in the
shop there's the offer
details yeah the discount ID the
visibility the start date we haven't
specified an end date yeah for all the
customers we can look at the customers
the product and then we see it's for all
products and then if we're happy with
this we'll just click cancel yeah so
that concludes the um the the promotion
and you see how simple it is to add a
promotion so now let's look at the last
section I want to cover in the Commerce
manager and that is the advertising that
you can schedule in the Commerce manager
now let's talk about Advantage Plus you
may have heard me talking about that
earlier in this video where it talks
about the um uh the changes that
Facebook announced in 2023 in the
Commerce manager so what are Advantage
Plus catalog ads they have been launched
on August the 15th in 2023 for
e-commerce and real retail advertisers
really helping them enhance the ad
efficiency so the Advantage Plus ads
they use Ai and machine learning where
they automatically sort of create up to
150 creative combinations of the ads so
it eliminates manual steps in the ad
creation allowing advertisers to learn
much more efficiently how which ads work
and which ads don't work and how to
maximize their budget efficiently so the
roll out of Advantage Plus provides
advertisers with new and innovative ways
to optimize campaigns and thereby you
can get fantastic new insites that can
help in developing your advertising
strategies small businesses will also be
able to use Advantage Plus creative and
Advantage Plus audience to create ads
through their Facebook page so it's not
just through the Commerce manager but
small businesses can take advantage of
it as well so it's about creating a
personalized audience based on your page
detail and automatically adjust over
time to help you reach more and relevant
customers for your um for your ads so
here you can see the what you can do so
if you want to get started with
Advantage catalog ads so you can add
your product you can set up tracking
through a pixel and then you can create
your ad and if by click on create ad you
want to know which ad account you would
like to advertise with and then you
select the in this case the Riad for
Russia and then that takes you to your
advertising setup and this basically is
a um a subset of the uh the Facebook or
The Meta advertising platform that we
will go through in a minute once we've
concluded the Commerce manager section
yep so that's um what I want to say
about the ads and then finally let's
look at the insights so here in the
insights you can get date details
knowledge information about your catalog
your performance your audiences your
tagged content you can get in details
about awareness and there is the
helicopter overie of your shop
performance as well well we had very
little activity in our shop because yeah
we have a very basically no real shop in
this Facebook account but here again you
will get all the details about your shop
if you have a full operating shop within
the Commerce
manager right that concludes the
Commerce manager so now let's look at
the advertising on Instagram and
Facebook that you can manage through the
meta business Suite
and we'll go there by various ways you
can go into the advertising yeah so
Facebook and or meta is very keen to get
you to advertise yeah so you see in your
feeds you see post that you can boost um
here on the um the the basic menu you go
into advertising here if you click on
the all tools you can go to ads and
these are all subsections of what uh you
can do in the advertising if you really
want to go to the full advertising
platform of meta you click here on ads
manager this is the dashboard of your um
account in The Meta business Suite when
it comes to advertising you can see if
there are problems with your advertising
account there is the payment message
that you can set you can even create a
Facebook page from here you can verify
your email address and um here you have
access to the ads manager menu as well
and this is where you can have an
overview of your campaigns there is your
ads reporting very important section is
the audiences that you can create within
your ads manager and Target various
audiences with your ads there is in uh
billing and payments and your ad account
setting and here is an overview to all
the tools in the ad manager yeah
business settings um the integration
with the Commerce Center and lots of
other stuff when it comes to your uh
your ads in Facebook and Instagram so
let's go to the
campaigns yeah what we want to do is to
show you the powerful features in this
demo
of the ads manager when it comes to
creating an ad in Facebook and in
Instagram yeah in this video to take you
through the entire ads manager that
would be um too long we'll do a separate
video on that but here I just want to
give you a quick highlight on how easy
it is to create a new campaign so here
you see the current campaigns that I
have yep so now I'm not running any
campaigns they're all in draft mode but
here you see the typical structure for a
payperclick advertising campaign you
have campaigns under campaigns you have
ad sets and under ad sets you have ads
and the ads they inherit the settings of
the adsets and the adsets inherit the
settings of the campaign so in the
campaigns you would set your budget in
the adsets you would set your targeting
and here are the specific ads so it's
it's all related to each other but it's
a multi-dimensional approach in updating
and managing your advertising campaigns
in um in meta so let's create a new
campaign and then you'll see how it
develops so we want first to look at the
campaign objective yeah so based on what
the objective is for your campaign meta
will come back to you with the ideal
settings for that particular objective
so it could be lead generation it could
be engagement it could be driving
traffic like sending people to a
destination like your website or an app
or your Instagram profile great for
getting link clicks landing page views
Etc so let's click on traffic and here
I'm going to continue so now it's going
to ask me a number of
questions yes so and I just have to go
through those questions when it comes
for the campaign when it comes to the ad
set and when it comes to the ad yeah so
we have the campaign name we have the
special ad categories if you want to do
yeah so there are special categories
that Facebook or meta wants to know
about whether it's related to credit
employment social issues elections
yeah because there may be different
requirements this was sort of set up
after the um I think it were the 2018
elections in the US and the brexit um El
sort of um uh poll uh on how advertising
was kind of abused to reach audiences
with kind of false information so now
when you do advertise for social issues
and elections or politics then there are
very specific
requirements yeah but we say they're not
applicable here we go to the campaign
details yeah I can edit this the buying
type is an auction so the highest bidder
with the best quality ad will get the
best position for the ad you can do you
can change this as well uh you can do by
auction or by reservation but that is
where you will have to pay more yep and
then here's the campaign objective that
we've set at the beginning of the
process which is objective of traffic
yeah you can then set do you want to do
testing for your
ad yep and you will let Facebook create
different versions of your ad and then
it will run the different versions and
it will look at what ad will give the
best performance and do you want to make
it an advanced campaign budget yes so it
will distribute your budget across
current currently delivering ad sets to
get more results yeah but I'm going to
leave that off and I'm going to click to
next so that's my campaign settings
we're then going to the ad set and in
the ad set you're going to look at your
conversion location would that be your
website or a landing page an app on
messenger or your Instagram profile so
let's send traffic to my
website yep and then here you see your
estimated daily results how many people
you will reach and how many link clicks
I'm going to set the performance goal I
want to maximize the number of
clicks yeah what would I want to do yeah
to spend what do I want to spend
basically I can say I'm going to spend
let's say um
one dollar or one pound in this case per
result call I can have more options here
I can say different bit strategies that
I can have yeah I can say what is the
maximum spend or what is the cost per
result call what am I prepared to spend
per kind of um click as it were yeah I'm
going to leave at that and here you have
Dynamic
creative yeah I can also leave this
blank by the way because I have my
budget setting further down below so
Dynamic cre creative I would just
provide creative elements such as images
and headlines and then meta will
automatically generate the perfect ads
for you a very interesting um process um
I'm going to leave it off for now
because I want to show you how an ad may
look like and how you can develop that
so my daily budget I'm setting it a 20
pounds a day yeah here's the start date
and I can set an end date yes so I'm
going to set the star date a bit further
yeah because I don't want it to start
and send the start date don't need to
send an end date yep and here is the
budget and scheduling you can now
schedule budget and greases on certain
days I'm not going to do that at the
start of the campaign because I want
Facebook or meta in this case decide
what works best for me yep so and then
add scheduling I can specify but again
I'm going to run all the ads at the same
time and then here you have your
audience controls so this is set
criteria for where ADS can be delivered
so this is we have sort of location we
have age we can look at existing custom
audiences that we have created over time
I can look at audience
suggestions yep so um so that is part of
the Advantage Plus audience that I
created that I discussed with you
earlier yep and here you have your
placements and there is let meta decide
for you where your ad is going to be
shown or you can decide for manual
placement yep and then is the more
placement you select the better it is
yeah but we let the Advance Plus yeah
show more options here there's brand
safety and suitability pro for instance
preventure ad from appearing near
content that's not conducive to your
brand for instance if you are a holiday
destination and you advertise on
Facebook you don't want to be shown um
next to an article or a post about um
about an airline disaster yes so we're
going to hide these options manual
placements I also want you to be aware
where you can select which platforms do
you want to advertise on Facebook
Facebook's Audience Network on Instagram
or on messenger shop is no longer
available we talked about that yep and
here you go then in your ad so this is
the placement of the ads where do you
want to show your ads in the feeds in
the stories in stream ads the search
results in messages but again we'll let
Facebook or meta decide on all of this
okay so I'm going back to Advantage Plus
placement where you use Facebook's
artificial intelligence and machine
learning to give you the best placement
based on meta's understanding of your um
your audience so click next yep and then
is um we're going to go to the ad yeah
so Facebook suggest make a carousel ad
yeah so here we go into the um the ad
creation so the Facebook page that we're
going to base this on is let me have a
look R for
usia yeah we're going to manually upload
creatives or we can get it from the
catalog yeah and here you see your
preview these are the products for my
catalog yeah so I'm just going to leave
it for this product for now yes so
you're going to look at the format I
want wanted a
carousel now I have two products in my
Carousel so they should probably come up
now yeah so um so here is the second
product no so but that's how it would
look like or you can do a collection you
can do multi- Advertiser ads so and I
can um have the catalog for the ad
creative as I said could be a product
set I have multiple products I can make
parel cards as well yeah I can turn it
in a slideshow lots and lots of
opportunities and here you have your
headline and your description yeah so
the headline is carpet I can take that
out I can say um spring
promotion sort of Atlas
Mountains
carpet yeah so that should now be added
here under the um the ad and here you
see shop now button I can add the
description that will show up at the uh
the top describe your link which would
be
fantastic handmade
carpets
from the
barbers in the Atlas
Mountains let's
see yeah on bigger ads you see that that
would show up here at the um the front
so yep and then you are um basically
having your primary text let me have a
look I think that is actually the text
that I wanted up
here let me have a look at
that there it is yeah so that is the
text that I wanted there and here the
call to action that would be shop now
but I have a whole range of call to
actions yeah so keep that as shop now
then where do I drive people to I drive
them to my shop and that is the website
do I want to build a URL par parameter
so I can track my campaign in the uh in
in
analytics yeah I'm not going to set it
up I can choose an app if I want to so
lots of stuff that I can do here I can
set up the tracking through the re pixel
I can select the pixel I'm not going to
go into those details and here is the
URL parameter that I want to build for
the tracking but here is the basic
version of my ad yep and now it's a
matter of pressing publish and then the
next thing that will happen that
Facebook will look at the ad they will
evaluate the ad and once they approve
the ad yeah then the campaign will go
live yep so here's the business location
and currency I'm just clicking next
that's the payment information they
still need my credit card details I
don't want to do that yeah so I'm not
going to give them the details so I want
to skip that so I'm not going to publish
this campaign for now but but at least
it gives you an overview of how to
create a campaign in the flow of
campaign ad set and ads there's a lot
more to it obviously but at least this
gives you a high level overview so if
that is on the campaign setting there
are two more important areas that is
your audience
creation so you can create separate
audiences that you can then
add as an audience for your ad campaign
yes so if you click create you can
create a custom audiences a lookalike
audience or what we say a saved audience
yeah if I click on Saved audience what
you're going to do you can specify the
audience with the name yeah and by the
location but you can then do a detailed
targeting based on demographics
interests or behaviors so I can just
click here let's say somebody who is
excited about travel yeah so could be
frequent
Travelers yeah and there's a whole range
of uh things that you can add here and
in your um your audience and you will
see that it will sort of impact your
audience size as well so you can do by
Behavior yeah or by uh by interest so um
and there's a whole sort of let's say I
want to do
California yeah so I can California
place people who are either interested
there yeah so I can Target by location
as well if I want so this is the really
powerful um aspect of paperclick
campaigns on meta and also on Google
yeah on the targeting so I'm going to
cancel this I can also create an
audience lob we say a custom audience
and this is these are audiences based on
people who have done a specific behavior
like visiting your website and this is
what we call the retargeting so Facebook
allows you to Target people who have
visited your website a particular page
which means the next day they could get
get an advert of your Facebook ad of the
the product that they saw on your
website so it's all to do with the
retargeting and the pixel marketing now
I'm not going to go into that because
that's beyond the scope of this video
but this is where you would set that all
up okay and then of course within your
advertising you have your ads reporting
section as
well where you can look at the account
name yeah for the um yeah you can look
at reach Impressions frequency amount
spent and attribution setting now I
haven't got any campaigns running so I
don't see any details here yeah also
because the period is but let's say if
we can
select um let me have a look let's say
no I haven't run any Facebook campaigns
on this campaign so I can't show you any
data but this is where you can create
your advertising reports where you can
select all these breakdowns and bring
them into your
report good that's it on the Facebook
and Instagram
ads and what we're going to do now is
move to the next demo the final demo of
this series which is everything to do
