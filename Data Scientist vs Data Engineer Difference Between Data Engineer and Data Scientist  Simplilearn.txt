hi everyone I am mang and welcome to
this fantastic video on data science
versus data engineering by simply learn
if you enjoy watching and find these
videos interesting subscribe to our
Channel as we bring you the best videos
daily also hit the Bell icon to never
miss any updates from Simply learn and
welcome to the world of data where two
key players data science and data
engineering collaborate to trans from
Pro information into valuable insights
data scientist act as digital detectives
unraveling patterns and making
predictions while data Engineers are The
Architects constructing the study
infrastructure that allows this
detective work to happen together they
form a Powerhouse turning data into
actionable knowledge for informed
decision making and just a quick info
for you if you want to upskill yourself
master data science and analytics skill
and learn your dream job or grow in your
career then you must explore simply
learns cohort of various data science
and analytics program simply learn
offers various certification and
post-graduate programs in collaboration
with some of the world's leading
universities like ctech Purdue it kpur
and many more through our courses you
will gain knowledge and work ready
expertise in skills like Advanced Excel
python machine learning data
visualization generative Ai and over a
dozen others and that's not all you also
get the opportunity to work on multiple
projects and learn from industry experts
working in and top tide data and product
companies and academicians from top
universities after completing these
courses thousands of Learners have
transitioned into a data science or
analytics role as a fresher or moved on
to a higher paying job and profile if
you are passionate about making your
career in this field then check out the
link in the pin comment and description
box below to find a data science and
analytics program that fits your
experience and areas of interest and
without any further Ado let's start with
who is a data scientist so a data
scientist and employs Advanced Data
techniques such as clustering neural
networks decision trees and the like for
deriving business insights in this role
you will be the senior most in a team
and Should have deep expertise in
machine learning statistics and data
handling and you will be responsible for
developing actionable business insights
and they get inputs from data analyst
and data Engineers you should have the
skill set of both data analyst and data
engineer and now moving to who is a data
engineer
so data Engineers are the intermediary
between data analyst and data scientist
as a data engineer you will be
responsible for the pairing and
preparation of data for operational or
analytical purposes a lot of experience
in the construction development and
maintenance of the data architecture
will be demanded from you for this role
usually in this role you will get to
work on Big Data compile reports on it
and send it to data scientist for
analysis and now moving to the skills
set of data scientist and data engineer
so coding skills are Central to each of
these job roles data scientist need to
have Mastery over programming languages
like Java python SQL R SAS and to name a
few Additionally you need a working
knowledge of Big Data Frameworks like
Hado spark and pig understanding the
basics of Technologies such as deep
learning machine learning and the like
also can Propel your career in this role
and the role of a data engineer requires
you to have a deep understanding of
programming languages such as Java SQL
SAS Python and the like you should also
be adapt at handling Frameworks such as
hadu map reduce Pig hi Apaches spark no
SQL and data streaming at naming a few
so these are the skill set and now
moving to the data scientist and data
engineer salary you can earn as much as
do
$137,000 a year as a data scientist at
the other end of the spectrum data
Engineers can command a salary upwards
of $116,000 a year and these salaries
are sourced from the glass door and data
scientist and data engineer roles and
responsibilities that will be discussed
now so the responsibility is you have to
shoulder as a data scientist includes
manage M and clean unstructured data to
prepare it for practical use develop
models that can operate on Big Data
understand and interpret Big Data
analysis deliver results that have an
impact on business outcomes and now
coming to the roles and responsibilities
for data Engineers so data mining for
getting insights from data conversion of
erroneous data into a usable form for
data analysis writing queries on data
maintenance of the data design and
architecture so regardless of which data
science career path you choose may be
data scientist data engineer data roles
are highly lucrative and only stand to
gain from the impact of emerging
Technologies like Ai and machine
learning in the future so this was all
for this tutorial and with that we have
come to the end of this video if you
have any queries please feel free to ask
