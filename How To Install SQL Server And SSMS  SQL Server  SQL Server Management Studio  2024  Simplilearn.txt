below so without further delay let's get
started so how to install ssmb or SQL
Server management system in Windows 11
now we already have that ssnv in my
system so why don't we just quickly
uninstall it and try to reinstall that
right so why don't we just search for
all the Microsoft uh SQL Server files in
our system and uninstall all those and
then try to download the files we
require and install them this might take
a little
while so the uninstallation has been
started slowly we will remove all the
files related to Microsoft SQL server
and
ssms so that's our SQL management studio
so uh let me remind you we will be
needing two different files for this the
first one will be the Microsoft SQL
Server then the Microsoft SQL Server
management Studio which will act as an
IDE for us uh where we can write our
queries we'll uninstall this
quickly there you go all these specified
components have been uninstalled
successfully now let's check for a few
more other files if there are any and
try to remove them as well so we have
SQL Server let's quickly uninstall that
as
well so we need to choose the remove
option
here there you go just go with the next
here and select all or you can just
select everything what you have there go
to next
again so just select remove so we are
removing all those files related to SQL
Server
2022 this might take a while so it's
okay
there you go we have successfully
removed all the relevant files to ssms
now let's close this and try to check if
there are any other files so let's
recheck I think it's yeah it's already
gone so no not to worry anything now
let's quickly open a new tab on Google
before that let's quickly cross verify
if we have any relevant files related to
that so that we don't have any uh
problems after installing and setting up
the file so I think there are no more
files related to ssms now let's quickly
open a new tab on Google and try to
fetch the required
files your window now you can quickly
write down SQL Server
management system or SQL Server download
yeah just click on that and and select
the first link SQL Server
downloads there you go so you have SQL
serure Edge and on promises and there
you go you have the two options
developer option and express option
since we are learning and we want some
extra features we'll go with the express
version which is for free and uh it has
some more features more than the
developer so there you go that's our
file now let's quickly go to the
downloads and install it so uh before we
go to the downloads let's check the PPD
back once again so as I said we will be
needing two different files the first
one Microsoft SQL server and the next
one SQL Server management system so we
have downloaded the Microsoft SQL Server
so as we begin with the installation at
the end of the process and last step
will be downloading SQL Server
management system right so let's proceed
with the first installation that is the
Microsoft SQL Server so we have uh
reached the downloads so let's uh open
the file which is
SQL right so I think we have downloaded
it twice so you can choose anyone so
we'll go with SQL 2022 Express one yeah
so the express Edition is getting
installed so we have three versions
basic custom and download Media let's go
with basic
let's just read all the uh agreements
you can just accept those so this is the
location of your SQL Server if you want
something else just browse and select so
uh make sure you have minimum free space
and download size it's 278 and we just
go to install so this might take again a
little more time let's wait
so the download is successful and the
file is getting installed now anyway uh
this might take a while it's
okay so there you go the installation
process has been successfully finished
that's the connection string that's the
SQL install log folder where you'll find
all the log files FES and installation
media file installation resource folder
so you can now just click on install
ssms which will be our next step choose
the third option and it should redirect
to Microsoft Edge where we will have the
location of the file just scroll down a
little
bit and uh we must have the file L yes
just click on that and slowly the file
will be
downloaded it's about 473 MP so it might
take a while you can minimize the 2002
SQ server installation you know uh page
you can just go to Microsoft Edge yeah
that's the one and once the download is
finished I think all we need is just to
run the exe file and our ssms will be
set up
there you go the file has been
successfully downloaded all you have to
do is just run it you can click on open
file or just U go to the location think
that should start the installation
process yeah there you go just click on
the Run
button so that's the default file
location and in case if you want to
change you can change so I want to
continue with the same location just
install and this might take a
while there you go the setup is
completed so just close it and uh we can
go to Windows and uh type SS SMB to find
the application and then start a new
file SS SMB no SMS so uh that's our
application just run it that's the
studio IDE that we require to write the
SQL
queries there you go so we have started
the Microsoft SQL Server management
system so you can have some setups so
I'll go with the ddb engine as default
and uh server name will be my official
name here and we will be going with the
windows authentication you can go with
your choice and you can just start by
selecting the connect option I am
expecting some errors here because we
already have we had some files so maybe
we should be getting yeah that was the
error so maybe we have to change some BO
numbers here and readdress few port
numbers so for now we can just use a the
U Microsoft SQL Server management studio
in the offline mode we can quickly start
uh a new file and write some queries if
required and you can just take a trial
so this is the actual procedure of
installing your Microsoft SQL Server
management Studio successfully since we
already had uh the old version and we
tried to uninstall a few files so one or
two might be missed so that might be the
reason why we couldn't establish a
successful connection not to worry so
let's now cancel the connection we can
let's try to open a new file
project and uh that's how okay so it's
showing that it's still not connected
but we can use it in offline mod not to
worry so that's how you can successfully
install the Microsoft SQL Server
management system in your windows 11
operating system with that we have come
to an end of this session on how to
install the ssmb in your Microsoft
Windows 11 operating system and if you

topics covered in the session or if you
