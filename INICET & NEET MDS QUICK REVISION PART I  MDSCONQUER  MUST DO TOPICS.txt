yeah hi Vanessa this is Dr srikanth from
Team MDS conquer so as we are
approaching towards the examination
there is a short quick revision video on
some of the important contents of inict
as well as neat MDS
so let's start
so in this particular uh session I'll be
talking one about
the angles in different types of teeth
that are used in the complete denture
okay and followed by I'll be talking
about C Factor
I'll be talking about
[Music]
cemento blastoma
I'll be talking about the ligaments
of liver
I'll be talking about the
cutaneous
supply of
like
followed by I'll be talking about the
cartilages
and the diagram based content
over different types of cartilages
I'll be talking about the trigeminal
nerves
and I'll be talking about
few histological
histology slides okay so let's start
first and foremost important thing okay
so I mean I'll be mainly consent my main
concern is about the questions which are
frequently or the topics which are
frequently asked or the topics which are
covered in the last two to three years
of both in ICT as well as read so coming
to the angles of teeth different types
of teeth that are used in a complete
denture
one is anatomical teeth which you are
familiar with
sanatomical teeth the angle is 33
degrees
and semi anatomical teeth the angle is
20 degrees
and non-anatomical teeth
the angle is zero degrees
but if you want you can make a note
about the
Silverman's
closest
peaking space
so normal value is one to two
millimeters
whereas in the case of Class 2 it's
going to be more that is three to six
millimeters whereas in the case of class
3 it will be less there is 0.51
millimeter
so to make a note
topics were repeated in the last few
years of the neet examination
so then comes the second topic that is C
Factor
I'm just going to give a brief glance
because
well defined content were already
covered in your regular smart videos
which are available on your respective
fault was on your website
coming to the C Factor first Formula is
bonded by unbonded bonded surfaces by
unbounded surfaces and C factor is
related to polymerization string case
which is one of the most
problematic problem associated with uh
Composites and we have already discussed
how to reduce C Factor there are
different methods of reducing C Factor
one is incremental layering technique
second one is you have a different types
of new Advanced
Composites that though those are coming
under smart materials which helps in
reducing the polymerization shrinkage
and you have a curing methods different
curing methods different curing lights
which helps in reducing the
polymerization shrinkage okay so we have
discussed this all this and you have
many questions on this how to reduce the
polymerization shrinkage and the most
common complaint due to polymerization
shrink is the post operator complaint is
Dental hypersensitivity with the
composite registrations so coming to the
C factor C Factor will be same for class
1 as well as class 5 that is going to be
five bonded surfaces by one one unbonded
surface whereas Class 2 it's going to be
4 by 2
class 3 it is going to be 3 by 3 and
class 4 it is going to be 2 by 4 okay
right so you can stick onto this values
so a few books telling uh embody embody
is going to be uh
right three by three
it's going to be 1 okay and what is
going to be 1 and of course once the
question was asked but the C factor of
root canal filling material so C factor
of a root canal filling material doesn't
have any unbonded so C factor of root
filling material is going to be more
than 1000 so a few textbooks mentioning
it's more than two thousand means among
all the values of c factors what we have
learned the highest is going to be for
root filling material which is going to
be more than 100 or more than thousand
according to many reference books okay
so this is all about C Factor so now
we'll be talking about the
next important topic so this question
was uh given in the recent ini CET so we
need to have a quick glance over these
uh these questions right so this is
cementoplastoma okay so
cement blastoma
cementoplastoma other name of cementa
blastoma is also called as true
cementoma okay true cementum it is also
called as true
cementoma
and you can see a cementum like material
like hypersensitivity uh similar
hypersensitive cementum also you will
see it a similar type of radiographic
features but it is not well defined it
is more of an irregular and this
cementoplastomers are most common in the
mandible when compared with the maxilla
and it's going to be around three times
more in the max in the mandible and the
most common area that is affected of
course it is given in the diagram so the
most common area affected is going to be
the mandibular
first molar area so the mandibular first
molar area is going to get affected and
it is most commonly associated with a
vital pulp okay it's most commonly
associated with and slow growing slow
growing tumor and radiographically you
can see an attached Mass radiopic
well-defined attached Mass present
around the root okay and you can see a
thin surrounding uh uniform radiolucent
lime okay so you can see a radiolucent
line surrounding the radio opaque Mass
radio opaque Mass with a
radiolucent line around it okay so these
are the important things that you have
to make a note about this particular
cemento blastoma or true cementum okay
so the radiographic based diagram based
question was given in the previous uh
ini CET so you have to make a note about
these few important points cementumas
through cement cemento blastoma most
common in the case of mandible most
common in the mandibular first smaller
area always associated with a vital pulp
radial radio opaque Mass surrounded by a
thin layer of radiolucent line okay
right so next one this is a question
that is given in the one of the ini CET
so you need to make a note about so they
have asked you to identify this okay so
they have given a
B and C D so please make a note about B
and D so one is dorsal uh missentry
and second one is mental uh ventral me
Center okay so the question given in ini
CET is uh they have asked which of the
following structure is derivative or
which of the following ligament is
derived from the rental mesentry the
main important ligament that is derived
from the
ventral masonry is falciform falciform
ligament okay fanciform ligament so
valency form ligament is basically a
ligament of liver okay so again this
question was repeated a similar type of
ligament based question was given in
ligament of ligaments of liver were
given in the case of your neat
examination too so just to make a note
so when I'm talking about the ligaments
of the liver okay so the ligament so the
liver are one is falciferum which is
derived from the
ventral masonry okay the second one is
left triangular ligament
write a triangular ligament
coronary ligament okay so so falciferm
left and right and current elements all
these four ligaments are derived from
the ventral Masonry
except the round ligament okay except
the round ligament all the ligaments are
derived from the ventral masonry so I
don't want to go very deep into this
because this is less often related to
embryology which we are mainly concerned
about embryology of head and neck
followed by thyroid tongue a few other
areas are important but embryology of
liver and all these are not so important
but anyway it is given so as it repeats
we need to have a glance over this and
this is more than sufficient so make
sure how to identify the rental
missionary and make sure the ligament
names or the ligaments which are derived
from the ventral mesentery are very very
important as of now okay right so I am
jumping to the next important content so
that is your cutaneous
no Supply so so jumping into a cuteness
nerve Supply the main concentr from a
general surgery point of view is we are
well familiar with the varicose veins
okay so varicose veins are which we are
well familiar and you have uh many
aspects related to the varicose veins
and the surgery is related to the
varicose veins so whenever we are going
for the varicose vein surgery there is a
high chance that we can damage uh
syphilis okay we can damage syphilis
nerve okay the cephalus nerve is
basically the longest and the largest
cutaneous branch of femoral now okay so
this is the branch of
largest and longest
cutaneous branch of the femorrunner
so there is a high chance that we are
going to damage this okay we are going
to damage this that is L3 L4 of cephalus
okay so what happens whenever you're
going to damage this so the clinical
scenario that they are going to give is
sensory
sensory loss
over
the medial
aspect of
leg and foot
so after varicose vein surgery if they
are giving a clinical scenario of
loss of sense on the medial aspect of
the leg so this is the medial aspect
okay now the leg and the foot so your
answer is going to be
the surface now okay so apart from this
I I want you to make a note about the
sutral nerve also
so whenever there is a damage to this
particular now they are going to give an
information in the question as a sensory
loss
on the lateral aspect
lateral aspect
of the distal one third of the leg and
the lateral side of the foot and the
foot and the fifth toe okay so this is a
lateral aspect of the foot okay so
whenever they're giving lateral aspect
or digital one-third so this is digital
one third okay so whenever they are
giving loss of sensory Supply or the
posterior and the lateral aspect of the
distal one third of the foot this is
distal one third of the foot or whenever
they are giving okay lateral side of the
foot and the fifth row so lateral side
of the foot and the fifth row okay so so
in this descriptive part you have to go
for sutral now as an answer okay so you
should be familiar with these two
statements and the descriptive part
where the sensory loss will be there
okay so this is all that you need to
make and what about uh this application
based question over your uh general
surgery topic may know I mean like uh
whenever the papacet is want to give a
question they will be more focused on
aspects of head and neck followed by the
brain maximum ear and eyes they may
Focus okay anatomy of thyroid is also
important okay this is the limitation
they have okay so whenever they want to
come for lower limb they may they may
it to a clinical scenario which is very
very important so varicose veins
treatment plants and everything are very
important so indirectly they can ask a
corrected based integrated based
questions so which you should be
familiar with this uh things what I have
discussed now
so next comes they can ask you identify
this particular nerve and you you can
see three beautiful branches so whenever
you see three beautiful branches your
answer is
trisominal
no okay right so your answer is and
you're familiar with most of these uh
things of trigeminal loss I don't want
to discuss much about trigeminal law but
trigeminal is basically it contains V1
V2 and V3 V1 is
opthalamic V2 is
maxillary V3 is mandibular so I want you
to open your smart notes is available on
the website and check out the cranial
nerves notes written notes which is very
very important right so maybe they may
they may focus on few of the clinical
scenarios if they ask a case-based
question so they can tell about
photophobia
photophobia or I mean the skin of your
forehead scalp eyelids nose uh your
mucous membrane of the paraff nasal
sinuses nasal Captain everything are
supplied by ophthalamic and coming to
the maxillary which you are very
familiar okay so it comes out as from
the foramen rotandrum and it's going to
supply now Supply to that of aperja and
the skin of the face over the maxilla
mucous membrane of the nose maxillary
sinus and palate
the next comes is a mandible mandible is
basically associated with the uh I mean
like
skin of the cheek mandible side of the
head and of course there will be lots of
Motor Supply which supplies to the
muscles of mastication anterior ability
of digastric myelohyde tensor tympanis
so I hope you are very familiar with all
these things and do make a note uh
foramens from which foramen things are
going to come from and rotundum
mandibular Branch comes out from where
I'm in oval okay right so you're you're
familiar with you're familiar with all
these things so if you just have a
glance over the trigeminal law and they
can ask you to identify the foramens
foramen-based diagram based question can
be given as well as the now based now
okay so for example identify this yellow
color cranial now the answer is going to
be your trigeminal now
so next comes is uh this question was
given for the medical inicet okay so
they have asked they have pointed and
asked to identify the uh
pancreatic eyelids okay eyelids of
langerhans the pancreatic highlights of
lying your hands so I don't want to go
much they can ask you the excretory duct
and similar pattern of question can be
asked in the histology of your salivary
glands also so I just want to give a
very very important uh landmarks that
you need to make a note so regularly
these highlights are the secretory cells
which are surrounded by the reticular or
secretive cells which are surrounded by
the reticular fibers
okay so and of course you're well
familiar with this fibers these
reticular fibers are made up of type 3
collisions so types of collagens are
very very important and examples and
everything right so these are the
reticular fibers and these highlights
are surrounded by a delicate capsule
okay so make a note these are eyelids
are surrounded by a delicate capsule and
of course you can identify this
exocrine duct which is available and
coming to the bank here's the other
important area we need to focus about
the different types of cells so Alpha
cell or ASL right so which are familiar
these are most commonly located on the
peripheral okay they are located on the
periphery and the secret what they
secrete
okay so next comes okay the most
favorite for all of us beta cells or B
cells so these beta cells are B cells
are located in the center so these are
present in the periphery and these are
present in the center okay so so what
what they produce yes perfectly right
they produce the insulin and next comes
is the Delta cells okay so Delta cells
are are scattered between the beta cells
okay they're present between the beta
cells
data cells that present in in and around
the beta cells and they secrete
stomatostatinum
next comes the pp cells PP cells these
PP cells are basically uh they're
present in the eyelids and they're
present in the exocrine glands what we
have discussed in the diagram based
question right and the main purpose is
the secret PP or nothing but pancreatic
polypeptide okay so there are other
minor cells which are present here okay
there are two types of minor cells one
is D1 these are major four are major
cells and two minor cells one is D1 and
second one is
intro
chromophene cells
okay so this is the integroma fin cells
they are going to secrete certain one in
whereas D1 cells they are going to
secrete VIP which we have discussed in
the physiology that is Vasa active
intestinal peptide which is basically a
hormone which is basically a hormone
that is going to induce hyperglycemia
okay right so these are the important
cells and their contents which are going
to be released and they are very very
important from examination point of view
okay
so last but not the least is the types
of cartilages okay so type of cartilages
were already well covered in your smart
notes so I just want you to go back
trying to cover the types of cartilages
stable that is available okay and make
sure try to cover all the diagram based
questions related to the types of
cartilages okay and examples okay
hyaline cartilage where does hiring
normal question is type of collagen in
the cartilage is type two car two layers
type 2 we have already discussed so
similarly you have three types of
cartilages that are available okay so I
want you to go back and check all the
three types of cartilages their
histological features histological
feature is very very commonly asked
question the question was repeated both
in ini CET recent one as well as in the
neat recent one so they're going to give
you simple histological histological
diagram directly from indervel singing
and they are going to give all the three
options and identify it's very simple or
they can give it a histological diagram
based question and they can ask you to
identify the example where do you find
in which are the following uh areas are
in which are the following places you
can find this type of cartilage which is
being given in your histological section
okay so histology is very important
already covered so I don't want to
discuss in this particular video okay so
I'm done for now I covered eight
important topics uh and of course this
is a quick revision video not a depth
oriented video so depth oriented videos
are already already available on the
website and make sure you use it
okay so before going into the session so
if you are interested in any of the
crash course of MDS conquer so these are
the four crash courses available and you
can ping us at any time okay on these
numbers so we are ready to help you out
and in the crash course uh we worked so
hard to provide as many question papers
as possible as many contents as possible
as many quick revision videos as
possible all these are going to increase
your scores okay so 25 mock examinations
of need plus 10 mock examinations of
insidy so we are going to cover a huge
content here and the main goal is to
improve your accuracy and marks and end
up with a better rank okay so signing
