hello everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to convert rows to
columns but before we begin let me tell

multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our

now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is how to convert rows to columns in
excel
so for that we might want to get started
with our practical mode now you can see
i'm on my excel worksheet and i have
one table on my worksheet right now
so
you can you know transposing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task i'll explain you in two
different ways
so the first way select all the cells
that you have on your sheet and
press on ctrl c so it will give you the
copy option
and then you can also paste in the same
sheet or if you want you can go to a
whole new sheet and
select the paste option over here but
before selecting the actual paste option
you can see a small drop down icon click
on that
and navigate to paste special and in
this you can see transpose option
click on that or you know make sure that
it's checked and press ok now you can
see all your columns have been converted
into rows and all your rows are
converted into columns so this was the
first way and
what as the second way you asked me so
it's really simple
select one cell somewhere
and you know you can or let's create a
new sheet as well so here you can you
know write down the formula as transpose
and select the array which you want to
transpose
so this is the array
so transpose is basically an array
function in excel so once you are done
with your selecting your data
press enter there you go so all your
rows are now columns and all your
columns are now the rows so that's how
you convert rows to columns in excel and
with that we have come to an end of this
