hey everyone i am pepper khandelwal and
i welcome you all to simplylands youtube
channel in this session we will talk
about linked list
we shall begin our session by
introducing doubly linked list
then we will try to implement it in the
code editor after that we will try
various operations on them like
insertion and deletion
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction to double a
link list
a w link list is a linear data structure
made up of nodes
this linked list is a bi-directional
linked list that is we can traverse it
in both direction
these nodes consist of three parts first
up data
reference to the next node
and reference to the previous node
now let's try to implement the wa link
list in the code editor
as you know a linked list is made up of
nodes so we will start by creating a
node to create a node we need a class
node
its members should be defined as public
data
node pointer
next
and note pointer
rev
now we will write a function to insert a
node at the beginning of the doubly
linked list
void
push
argument will be a node pointer to
pointer
add
and end q data
now let's allocate a node
node star
new node
pulse
new
node
now let's put in the data into a new
node
since we are adding at the beginning its
previous is always null
now we will link the old list of the
nuno
now we will change the previous of the
head node to the new node
we will check if head is not null
then heads previous
is equals to
new node
now let's move the head to the point to
the new node
now let's write a function to print the
given way link list
its argument will be a node
we will iterate it until the node is not
null
layout
node data
and
and
node
equals to
node next
now let's write a code for the main
block
we will start with the empty list
now we will use a push function to push
values in the function
another push function
add
comma
3
push function
ampersand
head
comma
5
push function
add
comma 7
now
layout
doubly
interesting
then we will call the print list
function
in the double linked list
let's execute this program
as you can see we have successfully
created our first doubly linked list
let's get back to our slides
we have now introduced doubly linked
list
now let's discuss some of the operations
we can perform on a doubly linked list
we can perform three operations on a
doubly linked list
first traversal
insertion
and deletion
we can perform a traversal in two ways a
normal traversal and reverse traversal
and we can perform insertion and
deletion in three different situations
at the beginning at the last and at a
specific position after a node
let's discuss these in detail
first of normal traversal
we can traverse a doubly linked list
using a next pointer starting from head
to all the way up to tail node
reverse traversal similar to the normal
traversal we will use previous pointer
we will start from the tail node to go
all the way up to head node
now let's try to traverse the doubly
linked list in the code editor
let's start by creating a class node
we will define its members as public
print data
node pointer
next
and node pointer
prep
now we will write a function to insert a
node at the beginning of the doubly
linked list
right push
its argument will be a note pointer to
pointer head
and integer new data
now we will allocate a node
new node
new
node paranthesis
now we will put in the data
since we are adding at the beginning so
its pref is always null
now we will link the old node to the new
node
now we will change the previous of the
head node to the new node
now we will move the head to the point
to the new node
now we will write a function to traverse
the linked list normally
voip
traverse
node pointer
while loop
node
is not null
therefore
t out
node
data
node
equals to node next
now we will write a function to reverse
traverse it
its argument will be a node pointer to
pointer
head
we will create a note tail
equals to head
while
next
is not null
this loop is enabling us to reach to the
tail node so that we can traverse it
from back side
now
while loop
until tail
is not equals to
head
c out
tail
here
data
handle
this last c out statement is only
because we are not traversing till the
head pointer
now let's go to the main block
let's start with an empty list
note star
add
equals to
null
now let us create a linked list to test
the function
so we will use push function
another push function
ampersand head
comma three
comma
7
since we are inserting at the beginning
so the actual linked list looks like
7
5.
3
now we will print the original linked
list first
see how
original
traverse
and
reverse traversal
first traverse
linked list
now let's try and execute this program
as you can see we have traversed it in
the
normal way as well as the reversed way
let's get back to our slides
next up in session at the beginning
we will create a node with the previous
pointer pointing to a null and the next
pointer pointing to the head node then
we will change the head node's previous
pointer to the new node and we will
change the new node to the head node
next up insertion at the end
we have to give the new nodes address to
the last node's next pointer and change
the new node's previous pointer to the
last node
next up insertion at a specific position
we will change the previous node's next
pointer to the new node and the new
node's previous pointer to the previous
node and the next pointer to the next
node and vice versa
now let's try these operations in a code
editor
we will start by creating a class
node
public
pointer
now we will write a function push
insert a note at the beginning of the
list
its argument is node pointer to pointer
head
into new data
we will first allocate a new node
node star
new node
equals new
node paranthesis
now we will put in the data
node
arrow
data
is equals to new data
now we will make the next of the new
node as head
and previous as null
and new node
previous
is equals to null
now we will change the previous of the
head node to the new node
first we will check if the head node is
null
and
star head
previous
is equals to
new node
now i will move the head to the point to
the new node
now let's write another function to
insert a node after a specific position
void
insert after
argument will be
node pointer
rev
rev node
and
if we first check if the given previous
node is null
yes then we will give it c out
given node
b
and we will return to the function
or else we will allocate a new node
let's do new
now we will put in the data
now we will make the next of the new
node as the next of the previous node
equals to
ref
node
now i will make the next of the prep
node as new node
and make the prep node as the previous
of the new node
now i will change the previous of the
new nodes next node
if
new node
next
is not null
then
new node
next
rev
is equals to newnode
now let's write another function
insert a node at the end of the list
void
append
its argument will be
a node pointer to pointer
and
new data
first we will allocate a new node
equals to
new
parenthesis
now we will create another nodes last
equals to head
now
we will put in the data
node
data
new data
now since this new node will be the last
node so its next will be null
is
equals to new node
return
or else we will traverse till the last
node
i'll
last
next
is not null
last
equals to
last next
now we will make the last node as the
previous of the new node
return
now we will write a print list function
to print this list
the argument is
a node pointer node
while
load
is not null
out
load data
4 is equals to node
next
now
let's write the main block
we will start with an empty list
we will start by inserting 6 so the
linked list becomes 6 null
and
ampersand head
comma 6
now we will insert 7 at the beginning
push
percent head
comma seven
now we will insert one at the beginning
also
now we will insert four at the end
till now the linked list looks like
one
seven
six
4
now we will insert 8 after 7
so insert
after
head
next
comma
8
now
let's print
this linked list
let's try and execute this
as you can see we have created our
linked list in the correct order
let's get back to our slide
next up deletion
first up deletion at the beginning
we have to change the first nodes next
to null and second nodes previous to
null
next up deletion at the end
we have to change the second last node's
next pointer to null and delete the
previous node to free up the space
next up deletion at a specific position
we will change the previous node's next
pointer to the next node
and next node's previous pointer to the
previous node
now let's try these operations in a code
editor
we will start by creating a class node
public print data
node pointer
next
note pointer
f
now we will write a function to delete a
node in a doubly linked list
void
delete
node
its argument as pointer the head
repeat its argument as pointer to the
head node pointer
and pointer the node to be deleted
now we will check the base case
condition
that is if
add
is
or
note to be deleted is null
and return
now
if
the node to be deleted is a head node
then
is equals to
now
if
next node of the dell
is not null
that is
if
the node to be deleted is not the last
node
then
else next
previous
equals to
that's
previous
now we will change prev only if not to
be related is not the first node
so if
the
not equals to
null
then
delve
next
equals to
del's next
finally
we will free the memory occupied by the
dell
free
now let's write a function to insert a
node at the beginning of the doubly
linked list
void
pointer to the head node pointer
and enter new data
we will allocate the node
now we will put in the data
since we are adding at the beginning so
prev is always null
now we will link the old list of the new
node
now we will change the preview of the
head node to the new node
now we will move the head to the point
to the new node
now let's write print list function
note pointer node
while
node
is not equals to null
layout
node
data
node
equals to node
next
now let's get started with the main
block
we will start with the empty list
now we will create new nodes
push
push
ampersand
add
comma four
push
ampersand
head
comma 6
push
now let's print this list
see out
original list
original list
now we will call the print list function
add
now we will delete the node from the w
link list
here we are deleting the first node
next let's delete the last node
now the modified list
should look like
4
8
let's try and print this
see out
modified
list
add
let's try and execute this
as you can see we have deleted all the
nodes except for 6 and 4.
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have learnt
in this session
first up we have recognized doubly
linked list as dynamic data structures
next the doubly linked list offers
faster insertion and deletion operation
next up doubly linked lists are
bi-directional link list
that is we can traverse it in both
direction
finally a doubly linked list is faster
at reverse traversal
