imagine you are juggling multiple task
at work meeting deadlines keeping track
of Team responsibilities and remembering
client preferences now piter having a
virtual assistant that not only
remembers important dates but also
nudges you about them right when you
need it this is the magic of Chad gpd's
memory feature for example you are
leading a marketing campaign due on June
30th by simply telling J gbt remember my
marketing campaign deadline is is on
June 30th it's go your back now chj can
remind you about this deadline in future
chats help you plan steps to meet this
deadline or update it if things change
Chad gbt acts almost like a coworker
who's on top of the details allowing you
to focus on the bigger picture this
feature transforms how you manage task
making sure you are always a step ahead
and before we commence guys just a quick
info for you if you're one of the
aspiring a ml Enthusiast looking for
online training and graduate from the
best universities or a professional who
elicits to switch career in a ml by
learning from the experts then try
giving a show to Simply learns
postgraduate program in a ml in
collaboration with perd University and
IBM you can enroll in this course with
the link in the description box below
and pin comment so let's get started so
guys let's see so meming chat gbd allows
the AI to keep track of information
shared in past conversations and this
capability enhances the way chat gbt
interacts with users by using previously
mentioned mention details to provide
more tailored and relevant responses
think of it as a having a digital
assistant that remembers your
preferences and past discussions to make
each conversation smoother and more
personalized I will show you guys from
where you can turn this memory feature
on you just have to go to your username
click on that then go to settings and
then click on personalization here's the
memory feature you just have to turn it
on and you can go to manage to check it
has stored any memory regarding you or
not and you can clear the chat jip's
memory also so it's up to you whether
you want to keep the memory or you want
to delete it or what memory you want him
to keep or what memory you want it to
delete so this feature is handled by you
only and you could see that this memory
feature is accessible for the chat gyt 4
plus users and the Enterprise users and
they have a description here that chat
Gip will become more helpful as you chat
picking up on details and preferences is
tailor it responses to you and you can
click here learn more and get a handson
what it will show as this is the
official website for open and they have
memory and new controls for chat GB and
here you could see that this is the
manage memory section that I showed you
this is the manage memory section as
currently I don't have any memory store
in the chat GPT they have some memory
store that is has a 2-year-old Auto
named Lena daughter Lena loves jellyfish
so these are the kinds of memories that
has been stored and you could see they
have mentioned how memory works so as
you with chat gbt you can ask it to
remember something specific or let it
pick up and these details can be used in
the further chats I will provide you
some examples and I will show you some
prompts that how could you use this
memory feature and how this will help
you in prioritizing your task or if you
are dedicated to your fitness journey or
you are like working on any project so
how could this feature help you so let's
move and see you are in control so what
they're doing here is I I think they
will be showing how you can use the
memory and delete the memory accordingly
and viewing and managing memory that's
in the manage section you can view and
there's a temporary chat section that if
you want to conversate without storing
the memory so I will show you guys where
this option is so when you click on chat
G4 there's a temporary chat section if
you just turn it on like you you could
see here that it won't store any history
no model training and the memory is off
here if you click on continue so you
would start conversation in the chat jpt
with the temporary chat section and he
won't store any memory regarding this
conversation so we will close this
template chat as we will be using the
memory section here and you could use
the custom instructions also that chat
GPT and that would be more helpful so
the custom instructions they are here
you could just use customized charity
and you could provide some custom
instructions but they are generated so
what we want is we want the memory to be
stored and the chat gyy should use the
memory for further chats so you could
see that so they have also mentioned
evolving our privacy and safety
standards here and then they have shown
that team and Enterprise customers can
work more efficiently as they have got
this feature so for Enterprise and team
users memory can be useful when using
chat GT for work and chat GT can
remember your tone voice and format
preferences like how you want so you
could use chat JP to remember your tone
voice and format preferences and he can
write in your own tone like how you
write how you use some keywords how your
English is like how fluent and what's
your tone Chad gyy can deduce it from
its memory and use that and provide the
same output as you want so this is about
the Jad gyy memory thing so gpds will
also have memory they have mentioned it
so I will show you guys what are gpts so
here's the explore gbt section and there
are many that are provided by open only
like these are featured ones these are
trending ones that is image generator
logo generator and you can create your
own GPT also that's here here's the
create section and these are by chat GPD
by open Team only data analyst D Port
modes creative writing so they will also
have the feature of storing memory so
let's see an example like they have
provided it like the books GPD helps you
find your next street with memory
enabled it remembers your preferences
such as favorite genres or top books and
tailor recommend ations accordingly
without needing repeated inputs so it
will make your task easier as you don't
have to input all the prompts they will
have their memory they will just refind
it retune it get the memory get your
joners your preferences and they will
suggest you so now moving on we will
have some or we will discuss some
applications where you could use it so
let's start with applications so if you
are managing some project
or a project manager you could use use
the chat Gip memory feature like you can
keep track of ongoing projects deadlines
and responsibilities or if you are a
student and you are learning something
so the chat GT can remember the users
learning goals that I want to learn some
language and dedicated to these weeks so
provide me a road map and the daily when
you will be learning with Chad jpd he
will remind you that today is this day
and you should accomplish all these
codes or the task that are provided to
learn that language so similarly if you
have personalized recommendations for
that application also that could be
recall preferences in books movies or
restaurants to offer customized
recommendations and in your health and
fitness journey also you could ask him
to track fitness goals dietary
restrictions and exercise preferences to
provide tailored advice so let's see an
example prompt phone memory storage so
let's see the example for project
management let's start it so we will ask
him to
remember that my project
deadline for
the marketing
campaign and we can name it like any
marketing campaign
Riser marketing campaign named rise up
okay
uh is June
30th okay so you could see here that
he's updating the memory memory updated
so project titand for the market
campaign Nam rise up is June 30th you
can go to settings personalization and
the manage memory you could see here
that it has stored this memory that
project headline for the marketing
campaign name dries up is June 30th so
similarly he remembers the things and
will help you that this deadline is on
June 30th and how you would be
proceeding with your chats he will help
you to like meet the deadline so you
won't miss the deadline and he will
guide you with all the
outputs and if we see another prompt
that could be if you are interested in
learning something so you can ask him
that keep that in mind and if we discuss
something provide those output also that
you could ask him that I am interested
in learning about renewable energy that
I
am interested in
learning about renewable
energy so keep that in
mind for our discussion
you could see that he's updating the
memory when you will see or write these
prompts now that keep that in mind or
remember so he will store that in in the
memory and he will guide you accordingly
so you have written there that keep that
in mind like this a spell mistake but
yes updated the memory so these kind of
prompts allow chity to store relevant
details which it can recall in future
conversations to make the interaction
more personalized and context aware so
let's focus on the application of
project management using chat jip's
memory feature so we'll write some of
the prompts and we'll see how he will
guide us for the project management so
we'll start here and ask him that
remember that
the next review
meeting for the rise up
project is
scheduled for May
20th at 3
p.m. so we have provided this
information to him and he will store
this into the memory as you could see
that he is updating the memory memory
updated you could go back click on
settings personalization and check
whether it has done that or not and if
you want to clear that you could do that
and if you want a specific memory to be
cleared you could delete from here or
you could just ask him by writing the
prom that I mentioned you to keep the
track of review meeting for the rise up
project you can delete that memory I
that meeting is rescheduled or that
meeting is cancelled so he will delete
that memory so you could use that
feature also and and similarly you could
see that it has provided us the output
that quoted your next review meeting for
the RIS of project is scheduled for May
28th at 3 p.m. if there's anything you
would like to prepare or discussion
before then let's just let me know so
you could start the conversation here or
we will ask him some other prompts that
keep in mind that Sara is the lead
designer on the on this project and make
sure to include her in relevant updates
so we will provide this prompt also
charity to store in memory that keep in
mind so these kind of prompts that keep
in mind this will allow Chad G to store
that into the memory that Sara is the
lead
designer uh on this project that is we
will mention the project only on the
rise up
project and make
sure to include
her in
relevant
updates okay and after this you could
ask ask him that you need some reports
so can you draft me reports you could
just provide him the xlsx file or Excel
file or what prompt you can write here
is I need to submit the budget report
for the sustainability initiative by the
end of next month for this project so
keep that in mind and the deadline for
this budget report will be like it's May
20th you could prepare it before May
19th so he will help you with that so
I will write the promt so you guys can
understand how it
will that I need to submit the budget
report for the
sustainability initiative and for this
project
only for this project and that
two at the deadline was May 20th so and
that to at May 15th so that's up to you
like what you want to tell him to
remember so ask him that we
should
discuss this in the upcoming
chats and you can also ask him that I
will provide you the Excel file and
after that we can start preparing the
report or just let me remember these
things so you could see that it has
provided that understood you need to
submit the budget report for the
sustainability Initiative for the rise
of project by May 15th so we can discuss
this in our upcoming chats to make sure
you are fully prepared if there's any
specific you want to start with let me
know okay so here we will start with the
budget report only so let's start
with budget
report and have a road map to complete
it till the
deadline so let's see what it will
respond so you could see that it has
started generating the response that you
have the deadline on May 15th so first
is gather the data then structure the
report draft the content review and
revise finalize the report submission
preparation and submit the report so the
number one is GA data we have the xlx
file so you could provide it here and as
this is the hypothetical example so
really I don't have the file what I'm
telling you is if you have the file just
provide to him and he will start
structuring the report and what you want
to show in the report like if you want
to create the dashboard or you want to
create the graphs or you want to analyze
the data he will do that for you just
ask him that these are the functions and
these are the dashboards or these are
the graphs I need so he will start
drafting that so this is how the memory
is used and how you can store it and how
you can use it for any purpose so
similarly we can use another example
that could be we'll create a new chat
for that that I want some recipes or
healthy
recipes
uh as I have started working
out and
remember I
am allergic to
peanuts okay so this is the point that
what recipes he will provide he should
keep in mind that I'm allergic to
peanuts so he won't include peanuts in
that so you could see that it has SP the
response and it has updated the memory
here so that's great to hear that you're
focusing on Fitness on hand and the
first recipe is kuna and black bean
salad and then we have chicken and
avocado wraps Veges Ste fry with tofu so
similarly you could keep your journey
accordingly that now he knows that you
are allergic to peanuts if you want any
recipe without being the specific to
healthy thing so he will keep that in
mind and won't include peanuts in your
recipes so this is how you could use the
memory feature and the team and
Enterprise customers can work more
efficiently with this chipy feature and
you can learn your style and preferences
and build upon past interactions Chad j
will help you provide all the outcomes
and you also knew that it has memory
section for the gpds also so I think we
have covered all the things for this new
feature that is chj memory and if you
want you could go to settings
personalization if you want you can turn
off the memory if you don't want CH to
store the memory just click turn off
click on the section turn off and if you
want anything to delete it you can
delete it from here or you could just
type The Prompt that what I have told
you about the allergy to peanuts just
delete that prompt or delete that memory
as now I am fit for the peanuts so
getting back and the thing that we have
the temporary chat section also that
won't store any memory so this is the
section that is temporary chat if you
have conversation here it won't be
storing any memory for you and you could
just go on and write all the prompts
here so with that guys we have have come
to the end of this session and we have
discussed about the CH memory feature
and how it can be useful for upcoming
