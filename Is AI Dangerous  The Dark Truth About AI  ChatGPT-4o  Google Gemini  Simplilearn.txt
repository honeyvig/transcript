I think the danger of AI is much greater
than the the the danger of nuclear
warheads by a
[Music]
lot mark my words AI is far more
dangerous than
nukes I try to convince people to slow
down slow down AI to regulate
AI th was
futile I tried for
years the biggest issue I see with
so-called AI experts is that they they
think they know more than they do um and
they think they're smarter than they
actually are by 2030 AI is far more
dangerous than the nuclear bombs these
alarming words were uttered by none
other than Visionary entrepreneur Elon
Musk at the 2023 AI safety Summit
The Man Behind Tesla and SpaceX known
for his futuristic Visions wasn't
optimistic about our AI driven future
instead he was sounding a dire alarm but
musk isn't alone in his grave concerns
in a shocking Move That Sent ripples
through the tech World Jeffrey Hinton
dubed The Godfather of AI recently
resigned from his position at Google his
reason to warn us about the very
technology he helped create let let me
show you so you left your job with
Google in part because you say you want
to focus solely on your concerns about
AI you've spoken out saying that AI
could manipulate or possibly figure out
a way to kill humans H H how could it
kill
humans well event if it gets to be much
smarter than us it'll be very good at
manipulation because it will have
learned that from us and are very few
examples of a more intelligent thing
being controlled by a less intelligent
thing and it knows how to program so
it'll figure out ways of getting round
um restrictions we put on it it'll
figure out ways of manipulating people
to do what it wants hey there Tech
Enthusiast welcome to another ey
openening video by simply learn today we
are talking about an important question
that's on everyone's mind is AI
dangerous now you might be thinking
dangerous but AI helps me pick my best
Netflix show and you're right AI does
that but it's also doing so much more at
a pace that's left even its creator
standun imagine a technology so powerful
it could be more devastating than
nuclear weapons a digital brain that
could solve our greatest challenges or
become our greatest threat this isn't a
science fiction folks this is the
reality we are hurtling towards the
Breakneck speed now you might be
wondering what exactly is AI that has
these Brilliant Minds so worried picture
this you know how how our brains work
right we take an information process it
and then make decisions or solve
problems well AI is like giving the
ability to computers it's as if you're
teaching machines to think like us but
with a supercharged twist these Hightech
computers can crunch through mountains
of data and second spotting patterns and
coming up with Solutions way faster than
we could ever let's take Char gp4 for
example this AI which Powers many chart
bards you might have played with perform
better than 90% of human test takers on
the uniform bar exam that's right it
could out lawyer most lawyers gp4 has
shown remarkable Improvement in dozens
of standardized tests many measuring
reasoning skills we are talking about
machines that can think not just process
data this rapid Improvement is exactly
what got experts worried the big concern
is that we are racing towards what's
called artificial IAL general
intelligence AGI this is the point where
AI can improve itself without human
intervention imagine an AI that can
learn and evolve as quickly as Alpha
zero learn chess beating the best
players in the world after just 9 hours
of self pay now imagine that kind of
learning applied to well
everything now some of you might be
thinking super smart AI could solve all
our problems and you're not wrong to be
excited about the potential AI is
already doing amazing in the healthcare
helping doctors diagnose diseases more
accurately it's changing entertainment
with those thinking of accurate Netflix
recommendations it's even in our cars
helping us to navigate traffic and in
some cases even drive the car itself so
let's discuss whether AI is dangerous
for risk associated with AI but before
that let's hear to what Elon must said
on this government oversight uh because
it affects the it's a danger to the
public and so when you when you have
things that are a danger to the public
uh you know like let's say um so Food
Food and Drugs That's why we have the
Food and Drug Administration and the uh
Federal Aviation Administration uh the
FCC uh we have we have these agencies to
oversee things that uh affect the public
where there could be public harm um and
you don't want companies cutting Corners
uh on safety um and then having people
suffer as a result so uh that that's why
I've actually for a long time been a
strong advocate of uh AI uh regulation
um so that I think regulation
is uh you know it's it's not fun to be
regulated it's it's sort of somewhat of
a some aous to be to be regulated now
let's dive into the risky business
businesses of AI and trust me we are not
talking about a little game of chance
here we are looking at some serious
potential pitfalls that have even the
smartest folks in the tech deeply
concerned first up we have the security
we often worry about hackers accessing
our Facebook accounts but imagine the
potential consequences if they could
infiltrate a super intelligent AI system
next let's discuss about governance we
are already facing challenges in
figuring out how to to control AI now
picture the complexity of establishing
rules for an entity far more intelligent
than us then there's the issue of
transparency just as we sometimes
struggle to understand why our phones
behave strangely comprehending the
workings of a super intelligent AI Which
is far more daunting this is known as
the blackbox problem inputs and outputs
are visible but the internal processes
remain opaque ACH to understanding the
thoughts of being that processes
information
exponentially faster than we do finally
we have the bias AI learns from data but
if the data is biased then the AI can
adopt these prejudices we have already
witnessed AI systems reflecting human
biases which is concerning imagine a
super intelligent AI making critical
decision based on flawed biased
reasoning it would be aen to given a
biased judgment extraordinary powers and
allowing them to impact the world on a
massive scale then we have the control
control problem it is what experts call
the control or the alignment problem
once AI becomes super intelligent we may
not be able to control it all it could
manipulate humans act in both virtual
and physical world and potentially cause
harm on an unprecedented scale think
about this way why would we expect to be
able to control something that's vastly
more intelligent than us it's like an
ant trying to control a human any
defenses or protections we try to build
into these AI systems could potentially
be undone in seconds by a super
intelligent AI now I know what you're
thinking can't we just unplug if it goes
wrong well a super intelligent AI would
likely anticipate this and take steps to
prevent it it's like trying to outsmart
someone who's a million times smarter
than you let's hear from this video more
than 1300 tech industry leaders
researchers and others are now asking
for a pause in the development of
artificial intelligence to consider the
risks Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
and apple co-founder Steve wnc are among
those who signed a letter calling for a
six-month break in the race to develop
more powerful AI musk and others say
Advanced AI which allows computers to
perform tasks that normally require
human intelligence could pose quote
profound risk to society and Humanity so
what are we doing about this well nearly
20 8,000 people including Tech bigwicks
like Steve bnak and Elon Musk have
signed an open letter calling for a six
Monon pause on Advanced AI development
but not everyone agrees on the best path
forward some argue that these AI models
are in conscious so they are less likely
to break free from their programming
however as many experts point out
Consciousness isn't necessary for
something to be dangerous a nuclear
bombb isn't required but it can still
cause massive harm in the same way an AI
doesn't need to be conscious to
potentially pose a threat if it's not
properly controlled so where does this
leave us well it's clear that AI
development is moving at a Breakneck
speed and the potential risk are serious
but it's not all doom and gloom many
companies and researchers are working
hard to address these issues and make a
is safer and more trustworthy they are
setting up ethical guidelines for AI
development and use it's like creating a
rulebook for how to play nice with our
new AI friends they are also pointing AI
oversight teams making sure that the AI
behaves and doesn't color Outside the
Lines companies are also getting smarter
about who they work with they carefully
wetting AI vendors to make sure they're
not just labeling AI on the subar tech
and they are staying on the top of the
regulations too because let's face it
the law is still trying to catch up with
all this new technology but here's the
thing we need more people working on
these issues as we navigate this Brave
New World of AI we need people who
understand both its potential and the
pitfalls craving a career upgrade
