link in the description box should
navigate to the hom page where you can
find a complete overview of the program
being offered all right so this is our
visual studio now now we can do the
coding thing for creating the CHD all
right so first of all you'll have to
create the react app first of all you'll
have to write the command npx create
react app then my app as you can see
then after that you can CD to your drive
and then you can do the command that mpm
start and that's what we did at Local
Host 31 as we can see it is running now
next thing what we'll have to do is
we'll have to in install some
dependencies so let's do that all right
so here what we'll do is we'll install
npm install open AI two dependencies are
there you can install that all right so
I think it's done the other one is npm
install xos so npm install xos is for
like simplifying the network and making
the API requests so that's why we'll
have to install this as well npm
installed xus all right all right now we
will start by creating a component so
let's create a new file let's name it as
header. GSX first of all we'll work on
the header component so here we can
import react
from
react all
right const
header so here we are creating this
component
function so first I'll write some part
of the code then I'll explain to you
guys so first of all we'll create a div
here also
div all right now let's name this
div last name
header
all right now inside this div we'll
create another
div class name let's
say
header let's keep it short only let not
complicated all right header let's say
say
subd all right so these are the two
Dives the outer div is header and the
inside div is header subd all
right let's do this now inside both of
these div let's give some space because
we are going to create
something all right after giving some
space
all right now we'll create a P tag
inside this P
tag let's name it class name
is header
sub
text all right inside this P that is the
paragraph tag we'll write what we want
to display above the on the heading
basically so let's write something let's
say I am
chat
GPT and
AI
language
model
developed
by open a
all right after writing this this is the
outer div this is the inner div then we
are going to use this bracket thing this
is for the space only all right so this
is what we'll have to write in the div
let's put enter in it so that it is
visible all right so this is it now I'm
going to explain to you guys what we did
in this one now here inside the nested D
we will create an H1 element and we will
write something like chat GPT or chat
GPT clone something like that so we'll
write H1 so we want it to like display
at the header so let's do
that CH GPT will write all right so we
can also give a class name
all right so after that there's a br tag
and then there is a header subtext class
name that is p so inside this P that is
paragraph tag we have written something
that will also display at the header
only then we have closed this div bars
and yeah we we have to export it as well
so we'll
write
export
default header we haven't really done
much in this
one all
right so this is our header also we can
also add an logo image or something like
that near this chat
gbt all right
so let's do that so this is the image
source so this is the image you can
select your own image from Google or
from elsewhere so this is the alternate
this is the name of that that is the
logo image so now we'll have to import
it as
well you can just download the image
from Google and paste it in the folder
of this GPT and then you can use it all
right so import then the name of
the image the name of the image is chat
GPT logo all right from right do
slash do SVG right so we are done with
this header but we forgot one thing
we'll have to import it in app as well
so for that let's go to app which is our
main thing so you can just remove this
remove this as well all right so here
the name of the component header is the
name of the component so as you can see
this is I am a chat GPT and AI language
model developed by open AI it is visible
but let's say now we want to make a text
area and a button as well so we'll
create another component for that so
let's go to SRC and create a new file
and let's name that file as
chat
form. Js X make sure if you're are
making a component start with a capital
letter all right so this is Chad form.
jsx all right now in this one again we
will import react from react that is the
react Library I've
done import react
from react all right now again
const chat form
that is the name of the
component all right so this is one all
right now here we'll write div first of
all let's name this class name as form
div as we have to create that now inside
this div we'll create a text area so
right WR text area in
text now inside this text area that is
the first tag we'll write rows I'll
explain you why we are writing this
first let's write it row five then there
is last name let's name this class
as form
control
all right then there is
placeholder
and in the placeholder let's write ask
me all right so this is it now after
this text area we'll create a button as
well now inside this button we'll put
like
generate response we'll also add the
functionality afterwards but let's write
this first of all and let's name it
we'll name
it what should we name it form button
let's write it form
button all right form button now the div
is closed all right now this is another
the component that we'll have to export
so let's write
export
default chat
form all
right now here in
app.js will again go and include this
component the name of the component is
chat form so when we'll add the
component this import statement will
automatically get get imported but
sometimes it doesn't so if in your PC it
is not happening then you'll manually
have to type this import chat from like
the name of the component from do/
wherever it is in your folder you can
like do so you might have to do write
this manually all right now let's see if
it is working or not so as you can see
here ask me and this is the generate
response so this is the text area and
this is the button that we want to
generate
all right now let's get back to the code
now we will create some other components
and we'll add the functionality one by
one but before we proceed to the next
component let's first understand this
chat form. GSX all right so the rest of
the part is pretty understandable as we
can see but the thing here that is the
text area the text area is bit confusing
I can understand so the line starts so
let me uh make you understand from the
beginning a little bit so this line
starts from the jsx blogs that describes
the component structure so it's a div
element with a class name form d as we
can see form D so this div will be the
root element of this component wrapping
everything that the component returns so
inside the jsx copy code like the text
area as we can see we have Rose five
class name form control placeholder ask
me we have written and then we have
closed this tag so inside the div
there's a text area element as you can
see now this text area is where users
can input text it has several attributes
rows class name so rows Define sets the
visible number of lines in the text area
so we have limited to five then class
name so class name is form control it's
it is basically for CSS then placeholder
it is that is ask me that we want it to
display so it provides basically a
placeholder on the text that appears in
the text area as we have just saw so
yeah after that uh there's normal div
tag that we have closed so this is what
Chad form. JS is now we will create a
answers. jsx component which will handle
the question and answer that will be
displayed on the screen all right so
let's proceed with that for that we will
create another
component and we will name it
answers.
JX all right let's
start answer
SEC now we'll write return in the return
we'll create divs multiple divs
actually
D class name
let's say answer
D all right then there is another
div class name answer
subd
all right so two Dives there
are now after answer subd there is right
then we'll name it HR
line so this is basically an En closing
tag all right I'll explain it to you
what we are
doing first just let's observe
it
all right here's another
div so this div is
answer
container all
right then one more day we'll
create and we'll name it answer
section all right now we'll use a P
tag p and class
name question close it for now let's
write who are the who are your
Founders right then another P tag so
here would be the
answer
I'll explain it to you step by step so
you don't have to worry first let's just
observe it so let's just copy something
open let's write something random here
open AI was founded by a
group
of
prominent
individuals
all right so after that there's a P tag
and then we can create another
div so for this day we will name it
let's say copy
icon now inside this
div okay
fa
solid
fa
copy
all right and then there's divs that are
being closed all right so there are a
lot of spaces let's just eliminate these
spaces all right
now exp sport default answer SEC all
right so now let's understand this code
first of all so basically this react
component named answer SEC is designed
to display a list of messages each with
an input question and its corresponding
answer so first of all we have to import
react from react that we forgot so we'll
write import
react from
react all right so this line will import
the react
library after that so after that there
are multiple divs that we will be using
further in this project so first is
answer div that is the class name of the
first div so this line starts the GSX
structure with the div element that has
the class name of answer div and this
div serves as the root element of the
component then another div that's within
the root div that is answer subd so this
is the nested structure might be used
for styling it will be used for
organizational purposes then this HR
line where it is yeah HR line the name
of the class is HR line so HR tag it is
so I want to let you know guys that this
line places a horizontal rule element in
the component used as a separator
basically all right so yeah the rest of
the go all right so we have exported
this now let's
imported all right so so as you can see
where the founders this is being written
so what we wanted is being written now
let's move on to the next steps all
right so the next step is getting an API
from openai that is the official
openai so
open.com we can go so here you can log
in all right so now we'll click on API
because we want the API only now you can
go to here and here we can see API keys
so from here we can generate an API key
if you don't have an premium account
that is you haven't taken the
subscription then you can just login and
pay the enter the credential details as
well and then also you can get the apis
for that we can cre this create new
secret key we'll click on that and then
we'll come over here and we can name
anything we want my key chat gbt key
whatsoever you want after naming it we
just have to click on create a secret
key so
once the secret key is created Creed
that is the API is created you here is
the option of copy just copy it and save
it into you can save it to notpad or
anywhere else because once it is
generated then it it get vanishes so you
just have to save it and then you can
use it all right so this is how you can
use the API Keys make sure that it is
not expired you can check that by going
to usage and check then only the API
will work if it is not expired and you
have have the credits all right so all
right we are back to the code and now we
will go to the chat form. jsx here we'll
have to add some use State because we'll
have to manage some State over here so
for that let's do one thing we'll have
to import first of all we'll write
import so to use use State you'll have
to import it first of all this is how
you will import it import used State
from
react all right as we can see now we'll
have to do some use of state so what
we'll do is first of all there's a chat
form as we can see and const input text
so this is what we are writing that we
want to manage over here so input text
let's name it set input text we
write
all
right
so commas over
here all right next we will assign the
value of text area field to the state
and establish an on change event to keep
the state updated Whenever there are
changes to the input value so for that
this is the text area
so this is that we have written
previously now here we we'll also have
to include some more things like after
placeholder we can include
this value so all right so we'll write
inside the GSX we'll write input text
this is the input text that we are
adding all right so this is the initial
value basically and this is the initial
value that is is here so basically this
is the initial value and this is what
that is being displayed and this is the
basically set input text is the updator
so this will update this and this is
what that will display so the initial
value is this and this is what is going
to display so this is value and value is
going to display now we'll have to set
the value that means we'll have to
update it as well so for that we will
include some on change event so that
that's what we're going to do we'll
write
on change FYI if you are not
understanding this part you'll have to
have a look at react hooks so using
inside react hooks there is a use State
just g go through it you'll have a clear
idea what I'm going to teach you and
what I was explaining all right so on
change so now inside this jsx what we'll
do is that is an event then set input
text that is the updator basically event
that is e do. Target
do
value all right so this is how we're
going to update it so on change this
event will Target the value so this is
the updator so this is updating this
value basically that is being displayed
here all right now we will create an
onclick event so let's give a br first
of all let's give some space all right
so as we know this button on click we'll
create so let's do
that so in this on click what we'll do
is inside the
jsx let's do a function let's write a
function response
generate input text comma set input text
all right so what we are doing is we are
creating an on click event to load a
function whenever the submit button is
clicked this method will create in the
app.js and passed as a props into chat
form. jsx component with the input text
and the set input text values as
arguments so we will pass this to the
chat form. jsx basically so
here
[Music]
response
generate you can see now next we will
create an environment variable in a
newly created EnV file and store the
open AI key inside it then you can make
the file in the root folder of your
application and store the key to the
variable let's name the variable you can
name anything
and let's
create
all right
Dov all right now here I will paste my
API key so here I have pasted the API
key and stored into the variable now
I'll use this variable all right now we
will come to the
app.js here we will import the
configuration openi classes from the
openi package so these classes are
necessary to configure and interact with
open API so we'll write import I've
started doing this in chat form
component so we'll go to the app.js yes
here we will do here we will import
those classes we'll write import
configurations open AI
API
from
open
a so yeah so this is the thing that
we'll have to import now we will proceed
with creating a method within the app.js
itself to handle the complete process of
interaction with the openi API so we'll
start now here we will create a
configuration object using the
configuration class then the API key
property of the configuration object is
set using process. e NV dot the variable
that is being assigned to the API key so
this allows the API key to be stored
securely in an environment variable also
we'll have to make sure to set the
environment variable with your actual
open AI API so let's just do that all
right so we'll start with it first of
all uh inside before this uh return
we'll have to do all right so con
[Music]
configuration new configuration this is
from this library that we have included
right AP
key
underscore
[Music]
open react _ appcore open AI key all
right all right I'll explain to you guys
what I'm doing all right so this
response generate function that I just
wrote I'll explain to you so here we
have defined a function named response
generate which takes two parameters that
is input text and set input text so
inside this function we Define an object
named options with various properties as
you can see prompt model max tokens Etc
so basically options is the object and
these are the properties so first is
prompt so prompt property contains a
string template with the text complete
this sentence input text so this input
will use that that input text it's a
prompt to be sent to the open API for
generating a response basically then
this model so this model is basically
the spec I repeat so this model
specifies the version of GPT to be used
that is the GPT model version to be used
in this case it's GPT 3.5 turbo all
right then there is Max tokens so max
tokens is 50 it specifies the maximum
number of tokens that is words in the
generated response then n n specifies
the number of responses to generate here
it is set to one then there is stop then
this stop specifies the stopping
condition for the generated response all
right now after that we can see uh there
is let complete options object so this
object we have used a spread operator
over here here we have created complete
option object by spreading the
properties of the options object and
override in the prompt property with the
input text parameter so this is the
prompt and this is the input text
parameter so the complete options object
is what will be passed to the open AI
API for generating the response in
summary the code defines function
response generate that prepares options
for sending a request to the open AI API
for generating response based on the
provided input text the functional I
repeat the function dynamically adjust
the prompt in the options based on the
input text received as a parameter now
we will create messages and set messages
with an initial value of an Mt array
we'll create basically a state named
messages and set messages with an
initial value of Mt so for that let's
create it all right so
const
new
state empty all right now the array that
is this array will serve as a container
for storing questions and answers so
this array will be then passed as a prop
to the answer section component that we
have created all right so the next thing
that I wrote is const till this so now
I'm going to explain you what I wrote so
basically this con response await open
a. completions do create complete
options so this line of code will
synchronously send a request to open AI
to generate a response based on the
provided complete options so the AIT
keyword indicates that the code will
wait for the response from API before
proceeding further once the once I
repeat once the response is received it
will be stored in the variable response
so this is what this line means
all right so now I'll make you
understand the other half of the code as
well so for that we have a conditional
check if we can see as you can see if is
there so if is the conditional check so
we have written if response. choices.
length which verifies if there's at
least one choice that is response
received from the open AI API so we have
written response. choices. length so it
is checking if there's at least one
choice response received from the open
AI API if there is at least one choice
response that is if there is at least
one choice available we update the state
of messages and use I repeat we update
the state of messages using set
messages so this is the set messages so
we will update the message using the set
set messages function we add a new
object to the existing array of messages
so this object contains two properties
questions which hold holds the input
text and answer which holds the
generated response obtained from the
response.
choices. text all right this is the this
is what I'm talking about this will hold
the input text and answers which holds
the generated response obtained from
this this is uh this will uh hold the
answer basically so we use the spread
operator as we can see messages to
include previous messages in the array
so this ensures that previous mess
messages are not lost when updating the
streate after updating messages we clear
the input text basically by setting it
to an empty string using the set input
text
and empty so this will clear up the
input text all right along with it we
forgot to do one thing we'll have to
pass the props to these components as
well so let's write response
generate
and here we'll write response
generate we'll pass this to chat form
and here we'll have to pass the sorry
and here we'll have to pass the messages
all right so as we have passed the prop
now we'll have to go to the answer SEC
component so that we'll make sure that
it will receive the props value from
app.js and then we'll use the map
function of the JavaScript so let's do
that so as we can see over here we use
the jsx brackets and
then messages all right now here we will
use the map function so in the map
function now the question is where
should we use that so so we'll use under
the answer section so we'll use the GSX
bracket first of all remove
this all right
so so inside these brackets we'll
use all right
so messages do map so messages that we
have received as a prop we'll map this
and how to do that like this
only inside the function this function
Arrow function value we are passing and
index we are
passing all right
now here we'll
write div class
name
class name
let's name it
answer no let's not do
that let's do one
thing
from here we will include
it so I wrote the code now inside this
key we'll write index I'll explain it to
you what we are doing over here then
here we'll pass value dot
input then value dot
answer
all right so this is we are doing is
mapping basically so this part of the
code is a jsx expression that iterates
over an array of messages that we have
received this is the
messages all right and generates GSX
elements dynamically based on each
message so messages. map and index is
there so it will generate the messages
on each message
so first as we can see messages. map
value index so we use the map method on
the messages array to iterate over each
message for each message we execute a
function that takes two parameters value
that is the current message object and
the index the index of the current
message in the array basically then as
we can see div class name is there so as
we can see div class name answer section
as you can see first class name is
answer section so as you can see key
index is there so now I'll explain this
part for each message we generate div
element within the class name answer
section we assign a unique key prop to
each div element using the index to
ensure efficient rendering and updating
of the elements all right after that we
can see there is question so inside each
div we include a p element so with with
class name question so this P that is a
paragraph element displays the input
text of the message it will display that
so value. input representing the
questions asked so whatever we will put
whatever we will input that will display
so the paragraph tag element displays
the generated I repeat so the paragraph
tag element displays the input text of
the message that representing the
questions asked all right now this is
the answer class name paragraph tag so
this paragraph element displays the
generated answer value. answer as we can
see so this will uh generate the display
the generated answer corresponding to
the input question all right so that's
why we have used the map method to
iterate over each question and answer we
are done but there are some errors that
we need to figure out right so uh make
sure to include this U state that is the
hooks hooks use State make to include it
in app.js and also this import open a
from open
AI so the previous uh configuration that
we have uh imported is not working so we
have tried this one import open AI from
open Ai and instead of writing this code
we will be writing some other code so
now let's just have a look at it because
this code seems to be not working this
is showing some error so let's try some
other code let me just write it down and
then I'll explain to you
guys open
AI all
right
[Music]
env.
react _ app that is the variable where
our key is stored so basically we'll
have to write it open
AI underscore I key all right so this is
the name of that variable
now
dangerous allow
browser
true right so
yeah so basically this code initializes
an instance of an open API I repeat of
open ai's API with an API key allowing
access to open AI services such as
generating responses using AI models the
option dangerously allow browser equ
equals true enables the
users I repeat enables the usage of API
in a browser environment despite
potential security risks so this is what
this code means now we have have
corrected the all the errors and all as
we have included the right libraries and
we've also included the CSS you can do
CSS on your own like it's specific I
repeat like it is very specific person
