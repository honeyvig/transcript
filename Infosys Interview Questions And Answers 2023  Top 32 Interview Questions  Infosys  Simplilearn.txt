welcome back to another video by simply
learn in this video session we will be
discussing about Infosys interview
questions these interview questions will
help you understand the process and
procedure for Infosys so let's go ahead
and understand something about Infosys
and then we will discuss enforces
recruitment process after that interview
questions for freshers and experience
then the technical interview questions
on Java following that we will learn
interview questions on database and at
last we will address some questions
asked by learners but before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our YouTube
channel and press the Bell icon to never
miss an update from Simply learn
so before we start let us test your
existing knowledge of Infosys
so who is the current CEO of Infosys one
Theory teleport to salil parekh 3 Rajesh
gopinathan or Julie sweet
do leave your answers in the comment
section below
now let's start with about Infosys
Infosys India's second largest software
exporter is a public limited Corporation
founded in 1989 by Mr n.r narayana
Murthy in 1981 narayana Murthy borrowed
rupees 10 000 from his wife to launch
Infosys with his six former colleagues
in 1992 Infosys became a public limited
company and in 1999 it was first Indian
company to be listed on the NASDAQ
also did you know that Infosys didn't
have a computer until 1983. narayana
Murthy had to wait nearly two years to
receive his preferred PC
today the company has more than 90 000
crude in Revenue with presence in 46
countries and having 40 years of
experience
so this was about Infosys now let's go
ahead and discuss the recruitment
process of Infosys
Infosys recruitment process
now to apply for Infosys you must meet
their requirements which are in class
10th and class 12th and graduation a
minimum of 60 percent is necessary
after that qualified candidates must go
through three steps of Infosys hiring
process which include the online
assessment test technical interview and
the HR interview in the online
assessment test the questions are from
three different section which are
quantitative aptitude logical analytical
reasoning and verbal ability
the quantitative aptitude test consists
of permutations and combinations time
and speed probability percentage ratio
and proportion and other related topics
in The Logical analytical reasoning
there are data sufficiency visual
reasoning coding decoding and analogy
after that comes the verbal ability
section in this section there are
paragraphs completion synonyms antonyms
para symbols sentences completion Etc
candidates have to finish one section
first in order to move to the next
section
after that comes the technical interview
round
so candidates are asked questions based
on the resume is and the post they have
applied for during the technical
interview round
you are required to be well versed in
algorithms and data structures
at least one programming language you
have to prepare oops dbms computer
networks operating systems coding and
problem solving puzzles aptitude based
questions emerging Technologies in your
areas of Interest also expect questions
on past and professional internship
experiences and your role and
contribution to them
once both of these rounds are clear then
comes the final round that is HR
interview round
so this interview round evaluates your
entire personality as well as your
suitability for the Post you should
expect inquiries on your talents hobbies
reasons for applying reinforces
educational background and job
expectations
now let's move on to the interview
questions that are often asked during
the interview process so let's start
with the first question
which is what is an object in oops so an
object is an instance or subject of the
class it is a real word entity it
occupies space in the memory and has
member functions defined in a class
now moving on to the next question which
is what are basic oops principles
so there are some principle of oops
Concepts like abstractions encapsulation
inheritance polymorphism so here we have
to explain those like abstraction
abstraction refers to the representation
of essential properties without
revealing the entire framework
problems are sold at the abstract or
interface level
then comes the encapsulation data and
the corresponding code are encapsulated
that is combined in a single unit called
a class
and then there is inheritance the
existing class properties are inherited
by new child class for example if there
are two separate child classes such as
dog and cat they can inherit properties
such as mammals and pets from the parent
animal class
after that polymorphism
it allows cross movement between parent
and child classes it is implemented
using overriding and overloading
so these were some basic oops Concepts
now let's understand the difference
between method overloading and method
overriding
so overloading two or more methods in
the same class have the same name but
different parameters is called method
overloading whereas the name and the
parameters are same in superclass and
the child class is known as overriding
so overloading comes under compile time
polymorphism
overriding comes under runtime
polymorphism if overloading breaks the
error will be highlighted during the
compile time and can be easily fixed in
case of overriding
overriding causes serious problems on
breaking as the error will be visible
during the runtime
so now the next question in our list is
mention some limitations of oops yes
there are some limitations of oops
Concepts also so the limitations of oops
are more prominent than other
programming language in terms of size
it was a labor intensive to create and
it ran slower than other programs
next is for some problems it is improper
and the last one is it needs some
adjustment
so these were some of the limitations of
Concepts
you can read about them in detail to
understand them in a better way now
let's understand some interview
questions on C and C plus plus
so what is the difference between C plus
plus and Java which one do you think is
better and why
so C plus plus was introduced for
systems and application programming
while Java is used as an interpreter of
printing systems and supports networking
computing
Java is platform independent which makes
it easier for beginners to grasp
C plus plus is platform dependent both
are extremely relevant to their fields
of application and one cannot
necessarily be said to be better than
the other all right so these were some
of the differences that we can figure
out between C plus plus and Java next up
we have explained some important
differences between C and C plus plus
so C is a procedural language and does
not have concepts of classes objects and
other principles related to oops whereas
C plus plus is an object-oriented
language and contains all its
characteristics and principles such as
inheritance encapsulation and
polymorphism
C cannot run C plus plus code whereas C
plus plus can rest I repeat C plus plus
can run almost every C code
C programming language does not support
operator and function overloading
whereas operator and function
overloading are easily implemented on C
plus plus
in c main function can be called from
any other function whereas in C plus
plus main function cannot be called from
any other function so these were some of
the differences between C and C plus
plus
no
coming to the next question what
different forms of data are there in C
plus plus
the four C plus plus data types are
listed as basic data type under basic
data type character short end float long
double Boolean Etc are some examples of
it
data type that was derived under this
examples like include pointers arrays
Etc these are derived data types
enumeration instance also known as enum
it is also a data type
now data kinds that are user defined
that are class structure Etc are
instances
so these were some of the different
forms of data that are there in C plus
all right now moving on to the next
question
Define class and object in C plus
so a user defined data type called a
class has member functions and data
members the data variables are known as
data members and the methods used to
manipulate these variables are known as
member functions
a class instance are objects a class
instance are objects an object can
alternatively be referred to as in
parameter of a course because a class is
a user-defined data type all right now
moving on to the next question
what various SQL subsets are there
ddl DML and DCL
so ddl stands for data definition
language it allows you to create modify
and remove objects in the database among
other activities
in DML you can access and manipulate
data using the DML that is data
manipulation language technique you can
use it to access update remove and put
data into the database
now TCL that is data control language
you can manage database and access using
DCL example permission to Grant and
revoke access
so these were some operations that you
can done using these subsets of SQL
next question on our list is
what distinguishes between SQL and MySQL
from one another
so the structured query language also
known as SQL is a common English
language based language
now the MySQL a database management
system is called MySQL
so the heart of relational databases
which are utilized for databases access
and management is called SQL whereas
like SQL Server informix Etc MySQL is an
rdbms that is relational database
management system
so these were the two differences
between SQL and MySQL
now coming to the next question which is
what is the difference between session
and a socket so a session is a logical
connection established between the
source and the destination
a socket is the physical apparatus used
to implement a session
so this is the difference between a
session and a socket
next is what is the difference between
TCP and UDP
so UDP is a protocol without connection
whereas the TCP is a connection oriented
UDP is much simpler faster and more
efficient than TCP
next up we have what is sdlc that is
software development lifecycle
an sdlc presents the life cycle of
software in the diagrammatic form
it displays the software's methods for
its complete development maintenance
requirement analysis Etc
moving on to the next question which is
what are the disadvantages of the
waterfall model
so the waterfall model is not a user
friendly as it does not consider the end
product from the end user end
it is not flexible in terms of
accommodating changing
also it disallows testing until after
the finishing of the project
so these were some of the disadvantages
of the waterfall model
now explain a network and node
so network is a collection of gadgets
linked together via a physical
transmission
node is another word for a device that
is connected to a network
with two pieces two machines and a web
server are all linked to a network we
may say that there are five nodes within
the network
now our following question is what are
the various testing techniques
the following are the three different
types of software testing that is black
box testing white box testing and gray
box testing
so the Black Box testing
this is a testing approach that only
relies on specifications and
requirements this approach does not call
for any understanding of the internal
structures routes or implementations of
the software being examined
whereas white box texting is a testing
method that examines the internal code
execution and integration routes of the
software under test
white box testing typically calls for
in-depth programming abilities when
using the gray box testing
to debug a software the tester has a
little access to the program's internal
workings
so these are the three different types
of software testings
next question is
what do a software testing verification
and validation entail
so confirmation
first of all it is a typically
analytical method without running the
code testing is done in this case
reviews inspections and walkthroughs are
a few examples
testing is performed by running the code
in a dynamical analysis process called
validation
techniques used in testing that are
functional and non-functional examples
the development and QA processes are
carried out simultaneously under the V
model
testing does not have a separate face of
its own instead it begins with the
requirement phase
the actions of validation and
verifications are complementary
coming to the next question what
varieties of networks are there
briefly describe each networks come in
four main categories pan Lan man and
when
so pen the smallest and most basic
Network form a personal area network is
frequently used at home it is a link
between a computer and a different
Gadget such as telephone printer
Broadband iPad Etc
then there is land that is local area
network
local area network links a few computers
together in office spaces and coffee
shops they are typically used to play
games or transfer files via Network
then comes man
a more robust network type than Lan is
the metropolitan area network which is
the full form of man the man service
area includes a small City Town Etc
a massive server is utilized to cover
such a vast area of connection
then comes van that is wide area network
the wide area network is more intricate
than LAN and generally spans a
considerable physical distance the
largest van that is globally distributed
is the internet it has a distributed
ownership rather than single ownership
by an organization
so these were some varieties of networks
now coming to Infosys technical
interview questions on Java
so let's start with these questions
how is polymorphism implemented in Java
so polymorphism can be implemented
either through overloading at a compile
time or overriding at runtime after this
you can continue by elaborating on
differences between that overloading and
overriding
so this is how you can Define this
polymorphism implemented in Java
next is what is the difference between
stack and Heap
so Java Heap space is leveraged
throughout the application while stack
space is used for the method or methods
running currently
heapsface uses dynamic memory allocation
while the stack is used for storing
local variables during the runtime
now coming to enforces interview
questions on database
so let's start with the question
what is database schema
so the database schema represents the
overall logical framework over database
it is an abstract structure made in one
of the formal languages accepted by the
database
next question is what are clustered
indexes
a cluster index is used to define the
order in which the data will be tangibly
stored in the table
if you add a primary key to a table it
automatically becomes a clustered index
moving on to the next question which is
what are SQL triggers
so an SQL trigger is an object that
raises an alarm when something happens
in a database for example a trigger can
be set to record the deletion of an
entry from the database
so these were some interview questions
now let's understand some questions that
are asked by learners
so let's move on to the questions that
are asked by Learners first we have what
is the salary of a fresher in Infosys
very interesting question
so freshers get a starting salary of
three to four lakhs per annum the
salaries increase after the probation
period of one year
second is
does enforces require a degree yes you
must be a graduate with ve or B Tech
degree to be eligible for the selection
process at Infosys
next question is how should I prepare
for Infosys technical interview
questions
so you are expected to have a thorough
knowledge of at least one programming
language data structures operating
systems and other computer related
terminology
practice the most probable questions
beforehand especially those related to
your areas of interest and academic
achievements
coming to the next question which is
the interview process of Infosys easy
so most reviewers on online forms
describe the interview experience as
easy to moderate as long as you can
control your nerves you have the
conceptual Clarity on your fundamentals
you can be short of your selection
the following question is why should we
hire you in Infosys how to answer this
question
detail what value you can be expected to
add to the organization you can use your
past experiences and achievements to
make a case for why you will be a great
asset to the company
next question is
how is the work culture in in forces
so the work culture at Infosys is very
inclusive and encourages individual
growth the infrastructure is sharp and
high quality
Innovation and exploration are
appreciated and valued
coming to the following question how is
Infosys interviewing experience
candidates
so experienced candidates are expected
to have a more in-depth understanding of
the Technologies used in the industry
they should also have informed opinions
and knowledge on technical aspects such
as waterfall model the most popular sdlc
model and other similar questions
you will also be asked about your role
and the contribution in your previous
job and your reasons for switching
salary expectations Etc
so this was the answer for this question
next we have
why do you want to join Infosys so
delineate how you think you can
contribute constructively to the company
also Express the positive points in the
popular perception of the company that
makes you hold it in the high esteem
coming to the last question which is
what is special about Infosys
first is Infosys is employee friendly
organization
then it has the leading capabilities in
AI cyber security automation iot data
analytics and cloud computing
it is rooted in Indian values Infosys
has the inspiring stories of Founders it
also has a world-class infrastructure
and training capabilities which makes it
very special organization so these are
some of the enforces interview questions
if you have any doubts you can put them
in the comment sections and with that we
have come to the end of this video
