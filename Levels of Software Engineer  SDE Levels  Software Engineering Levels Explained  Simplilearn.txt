moving on let me ask you a quick
question so which of the following is
not a common software development
methodology a agile B waterfall C spiral
or D linear you can write your answers
in the comment section below now let's
move on to the first stop what a
software engineer is so a software
engineer is a professional who uses
engineering principles and programming
skills to design develop test and
maintain software applications they are
responsible for creating high quality
software products that meets the needs
of their clients or users software
Engineers typically work as a part of
team collaborating with designers
project managers and other professionals
to create software products that meet
specific requirements they may
specialize in different areas of
software development such as front-end
or back-end development did database
management app development or security
the average salary of a software
developer in the United States is 113
000 according to glassdo to become a
software engineer one typically needs to
have a degree in computer science
software engineering or a related field
as well as strong programming skills
