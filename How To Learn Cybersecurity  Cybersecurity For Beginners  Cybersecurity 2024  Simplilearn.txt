let's start with the session so here
first we'll start with the essential
skills for an ethical hacker or when you
will learn cyber security what skills
you will need so here we'll see the list
and the number one is strong
understanding of networking so ethical
hackers or cyber security professional
need to have understanding of networking
protocols how data travels across
networks and the vulnerabilities
associated with different network
configurations then comes programming
and scripting so Proficiency in
programming languages like python C C++
and scripting languages is crucial for
writing custom exploits and tools and
then comes cyber security fundamentals a
solid grasp of basic cyber security
Concepts including threats
vulnerabilities risk management and
security principles is fundamental and
then comes operating system familiarity
with various operating systems including
Windows Linux and Unix is essential for
understanding the vulnerabilities and
security configurations and then comes
web application security so knowledge of
web technologies that is web application
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection
crite scripting and security best
practices for web development and then
comes penetration testing tools so the
proficiency tools like Metasploit and
map wire Shar bub suit and other
penetration testing tools used to assess
system vulnerabilities so these tools
you should have handson and these are
the skills that a cyber security
professional must possess and then comes
cryptography so understanding of
encryption decryption cryptographic
algorithms and their role in securing
data and then comes wireless security
expertise in wireless network security
including Wi-Fi encryption protocols and
vulnerabilities and then comes security
compliance and standards knowledge of
security standards and compliance
regulations such as PCI DSS HIPAA and
gdpr and then comes incident response so
being prepared to handle security
incidents and breaches effectively
including forensics and Analysis and
then comes social engineering awareness
so understanding of social engineering
tactics used by attackers to manipulate
individuals into revealing confidential
information and then we have the last
that is ethical mindset as a skill so an
ethical hacker or a cyber security
professional must adhere to a strong
code of ethics and prioritize
responsible disclosure when
vulnerabilities are there and now we'll
start with how to learn cyber security
and we'll see the road map so the number
one thing you should have is Educational
Foundation so ethical hacking is all
about using your skills for good that is
helping to protect systems and data from
cyber threats and let's start from the
very beginning and build a strong
Foundation together number one is basic
education so first things first you need
to finish high school and during High
School try to focus on subjects like
mathematics computer science and it and
these subjects are essential because
they teach you how computers work and
how to think logically imagine you are
building a house and math and computer
science are likee the bricks and mortar
you will need to construct a strong
stury structure and then comes higher
education so After High School consider
pursuing a degree in computer science
information technology or cyber security
now you might be wondering do I really
need a degree well a degree can
definitely help it gives you a solid
foundation and is often preferred by
employers
however it's not the way to become an
ethical hacker and if you're passionate
and committed you can learn the
necessary skills on your own and many
successful hackers or cyber Security
Professionals have taken this selftaught
truth and remember it's not just about
the degree it's about the skills and
knowledge you gain along the way and
employers are looking for people who can
solve problems and think creatively
whether they have a degree or not now
that you have covered the educational
Basics let's move on to the exciting
part that is developing the essential
technical skills you will need and this
is where you will start to build your
hacker toolkit with essential skills and
ready to gear up with some serious
learning so let's dive in and here
you'll see developing essential skills
number one is programming and if I tell
you why it's important so programming is
like learning a new language but for
communicating with computers so why it's
important and now we'll see what to
learn so start with python because it's
beginner friendly and Powerful then pick
up C and C++ for understanding low level
operations and JavaScript for web based
hacking and then we'll see how to
practice so write small scripts automate
task and eventually build your own
hacking tools and after that comes
networking so let's see why it's
important so networks are like the Roads
connecting all computers and
understanding networking is crucial
because it's where most hacking happens
and what to learn for this so learn
about IP addresses subnets protocols
like tcpip and how data travels across
networks and how to practice so set up
your own Network Lab at home using
virtual machines and experiment with
different networking setups now coming
to operating systems with the essential
skills only and the first thing we'll
see is why it's important so most teing
tools are designed for specific
operating systems especially Linux and
then comes what to learn so get
comfortable with Linux that is dros like
Kali Linux that are designed for
security task and understand the basics
of Windows and Mac OS and then comes how
to practice so use Linux as your main OS
and play around with ter commands and
understand file system structures and
then we have security Concepts and we'll
see the first thing that is quite
important so security concepts are like
the rules of the game knowing them helps
you understand how to break and fix
things and then we have what to learn so
focus on encryption that is how data is
protected fire volts how to defend
networks VPN how to secure connections
and IDs how to detect intrusions and
let's see how to practice them so
Implement these security measures in
your own system and try to bypass them
to see how they work so these are the
core skills that form the backbone of an
ethical hacker knowledge or a cyber
security Professional Knowledge and it's
not just about learning them but
practicing and applying them in the real
world scenarios great you have buil a
solid Educational Foundation if you
following this and developed essential
skills now let's talk about
certifications and certifications are
like Badges of Honor that show you have
got the Knowledge and Skills to be an
ethical hacker and they can open doors
to job opportunities and valid your
expertise so now we'll talk about some
of the key certifications that you can
consider so number one is CH that is
certified ethical hacker and talking
about why it's important so the CH is
one of the most recognized
certifications in the ethical hacking
World it coveres the fundamentals of
ethical hacking and teaches you the
mindset and tools hackers use and now
we'll see what it demonstrates so by
earning this certification you show that
you understand the core principles of
ethical hacking including how to scan
test and hack systems and how to get it
or achieve it so you can study the CH
curriculum which includes topics like
foot printing scanning enumeration and
system hacking then pass the CH exams to
get certified now coming to the next
certification that is coma Security Plus
and first we'll see why it's important
so Security Plus is a great starting
point for a career in cyber security it
covers a wide range of security topics
from network security to risk management
and if I tell you what it demonstrates
so this certification proves you have
the foundational knowledge required for
any cyber security role and it's often a
stepping stone to more advanced
certifications and how to get it so
prepare by studying the compta Security
Plus material focusing on key areas like
threats attacks vulnerabilities and
security architecture you can pass the
Security Plus exam to earn new
certification now coming to the next
certification that is ocp or offensive
security certified professional first
thing we'll note about it is why it's
important so OSP is known for its
Hands-On practical approach and it's
highly respected in the industry
because it requires you to actually
perform hacking techniques in a control
environment and if I tell you what it
demonstrates so earning the OSP shows
you you can identify exploit and
document vulnerabilities in various
systems and it's proof of your practical
hacking skills and if I tell you how to
get it so you can complete the offensive
Securities penetration testing with K
Linux course and then pass the rigorous
oscp exam which involves a 24hour
hacking challenge so this is all about
OSP now moving to the next certification
that is cissp so first thing is why it's
important so cissp is an advanced
certification aimed to those looking to
move into higher level security roles
like management or architecture and if I
tell you what it demonstrates it shows
you how to have a deep understanding of
cyber security principles and you can
design Implement and manage a
best-in-class cyber security program and
how to get it you can study the eight
domains of the cissp that is common body
of knowledge which includes security and
risk management asset security and
security engineering you can pass the
cissp exam and meet the work experience
requirements to get certified and these
certifications not only validate your
knowledge but also make you stand out in
the job market they are a testament to
your dedication and expertise in the
field of ethical hacking so next we will
explore how to gain practical experience
and this is where you will put your
knowledge to the test and hor your
skills in real world scenarios so ready
to dive into some handson action so
let's move on so the next part is number
fourth that is gain practical experience
so I will say that's awesome that you
have got your education developed
essential skills and earned some
certifications now we are coming to this
part that is now it's time to get
handson and gain practical experience
this is where the real fun begins
applying what you have learned in real
world scenarios number one is labs and
simulations so labs and simulations
provide a safe environment to practice
hacking skills without the risk of
breaking any laws they allow you to
expand ment and learn from your mistakes
so you could use the platforms like hack
the Box try hack me and cyber SEC laabs
that are fantastic resources and these
resources offer a variety of challenges
and scenarios that may make real world
systems and networks so internships and
entry-level positions provide Real World
experience and a chance to apply your
skills in a professional setting they
also help you build a network on Fitness
St contexts you can seek out internships
or jobs in it Network Administration or
cyber security so these roles will give
you hand handson experience with the
systems and Technologies you will be
protecting as an ethical hacker you can
check job boards company websites and
Linkedin for openings and don't be
afraid to reach out to companies
directly to inquire about internship
opportunities you can tailor your resume
to highlight your skills and
certifications and be prepared to
discuss your hands-on experience from
labs and simulations and after that
comes the bug Bounty programs so bug
Bounty programs are an essential or
excellent way to test your skills in the
real world scenario companies offer
these programs to identify security
vulnerabilities in their systems and
they reward you for finding and
Reporting these issues so platforms like
hacker one and Bug Crow connect ethical
hackers with companies offering bug
bounties and these platforms provide a
legal and structured way to test your
skills and you can create profiles on
hacker one and bu rout and you can start
by reading through the rules and scope
of each program to understand what's
allowed and you can begin with lower
risk programs and gradually move to more
complex ones as you find and Report
vulnerabilities you will gain
recognition and potentially earn money
for your findings and after that we have
practical experience that is invaluable
and it's where Theory meets reality and
by practicing in Labs gaining Real World
Experience through internships and
participating in bug Bounty programs you
will hone your skills and build a strong
portfolio and after that comes stay
