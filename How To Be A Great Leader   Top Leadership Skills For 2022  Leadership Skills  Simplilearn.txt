a few years back leaders entrepreneurs
and innovators formed companies whereas
managers were hired to run their
operations but nowadays you will notice
that our educational system is
increasingly focusing on management
education while downplaying the value of
leadership also there is a perspective
change that treats both management and
leadership as the same which is not a
mere reality so today in this video
we're going to take a deep dive into the
most commonly used words in the business
environment leadership and management
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn an organization is led
by two people a leader who sets the
vision or goals and a manager who paves
the path to reach those objectives with
the assistance of his subordinates
to put it another way management is an
ability to climb the ladder of success
whereas leadership is the capacity to
make sure that the ladder is against the
right wall moving forward let's first
understand what leadership is all about
leadership is the process of driving
constructive non-incremental change
through meticulous planning vision and
strategy
Workforce empowerment and adaptive
decision making also add up to the
crucial attributes of leadership
to become a leader you are not required
to hold an authoritative figure in the
organization a leader is someone who
always takes the initiative and invests
a great effort to accomplish the
company's Vision that is the only reason
why people around start following them
leaders in general are those who
question the status quo they are
incredibly adaptive change Savvy
Visionary agile and creative we have a
dedicated video on leadership skills
here's a video linked to that
now let us understand what management is
management is all about completing
pre-planned tasks with the support of
subordinates on a recurring basis
a manager is completely responsible to
carry out the four important functions
of management planning organizing
leading and controlling
managers can become leaders if they
adequately carry out leadership
responsibilities which include
communication of good and bad providing
inspiration and guidance and encouraging
employees to rise to a higher level of
productivity
but unfortunately not all managers can
achieve that managerial responsibilities
are often outlined in a job description
with subordinates following because of
the professional title or classification
a manager's primary focus is meeting
organizational goals they often do not
take much else into consideration
with the title comes the authority and
the privilege to promote higher or
reward employees based on their
performance and behavior
moving ahead we will look into the
differences between leadership and
management
the first area of difference is Vision
leaders are considered as visioners they
set the path to excel the organizational
growth they always examine where the
organization stands where they want to
go and how they can reach there by
involving the team in Paving a future
path in comparison managers set out to
achieve organizational goals by
implementing processes such as budgeting
organizational structuring and Staffing
manager's vision is bound to the
implementation strategies planning and
organizing tasks to reach the objectives
set out by leaders however both of these
roles are equally important in the
context of business environments and
necessitate associative efforts
the next field of differentiation is
organizing versus aligning managers
pursue objectives through coordinated
actions and tactical processes they
unfold targeted Vision into small stages
and organize available resources to
achieve the desired result
leaders on the other hand are less
focused on how to organize people and
more on finding ways to align and
influence them they accomplish this by
helping individuals Envision their role
in a larger context and the future
growth potential their efforts can
provide
the third distinction between a manager
and a leader is that a leader asks the
questions what and why whereas a manager
focuses on the questions how and when
to do justice to their duties as a
leader one might question and challenge
the authority to reverse decisions that
may not be in the better interests of
the team
if a firm has a stumbling block a leader
will be the one to step up and ask what
did we learn from this and why has this
happened
managers on the other hand are not
compelled to evaluate and analyze
failures their job description stresses
asking how and when which helps them
ensure that plans are carried out
appropriately
they prefer to accept the status quo as
it is and do not strive to change it
the final Factor on our list is position
versus quality a manager is a role that
frequently refers to a specific job
within a organization structure whereas
the term leader has a more ambiguous
definition
leadership emerges as a result of your
actions if you are a leader and act in a
way that inspires others to do their
best it makes no difference what your
title or position is
a manager on the other hand is a job
title that comes up with a predefined
set of obligations leadership is a great
quality that can make a significant
difference in your respective careers
and with passing time you can shape it
by developing emotional intelligence and
learning how to influence others leading
and managing are two contrasting ways of
making the employees work together more
efficiently leadership is a spearhead
for the new vision and initiatives
whereas management controls the
resources effectively to bring those

description to know more there is a
common belief that true leaders are born
and they are naturally charismatic
influential people destined to make a
mark while we acknowledge that this fact
might hold true for some people we also
strongly believe that with dedicated
efforts it is absolutely possible to
cultivate the traits and talents
required to become a leader so whether
you were born with the authoritative
abilities of Captain America or not if
you want to be a leader you have to work
hard to develop the characteristics of
the grapes what do you think leadership
is all about does it have anything to do
with seniority or one's position in a
company's hierarchy
yes then you're on the wrong track of
understanding what leadership is
leadership has nothing to do with titles
management or one's personal agendas
it's also not restricted to personality
traits such as a better Vision or
charismatic personality it's more like a
process of social influence which
maximizes the efforts of others towards
the achievement of a common goal it
stems from social influence and requires
human resources to achieve the intended
outcomes
business is a never-ending game the only
way to succeed is to focus on future
growth and how you can get there and
with the help of your human resources
and simply put leadership is the ability
to make that happen
moving ahead let's understand the skills
that you must hone to become a
successful leader the first skill that
you should emphasize is your ability to
listen
ing is an active process and it's the
best way to understand what is happening
in an organization we frequently find
ourselves dwelling on some other
thoughts while having a conversation as
a result we miss out on critical
information or even create a negative
impression at the communicator's end so
you must enhance your ability to listen
to others
should develop Avenues and channels for
voices to be heard
specifically for those who would not
otherwise have the guts to speak up
you don't always come across solutions
to oral problems therefore you must
brainstorm and listen to your team to
bring something unique with each
conversation
next up on our list is clear
communication communication and Trust go
hand in hand no matter how great your
ideology and Visions are they will go in
vain if you cannot communicate them to
your team correctly with the proper
amount of trust and confidence that is
why transparency is considered the
foundation of effective communication a
leader should always be open and honest
about what is known and unknown you
should also ensure that every listener
feels the depth of his vision with the
same level of confidence the third skill
is modeling positive behavior
when you do what you say you generate
trust and credibility among the people
around you they will instantly start
following and emulating your actions you
can think of this as an element of
leading by example
the ability of a leader to inspire
others through his course of action is
known as role modeling a leader should
also always assist his followers in
staying on the path of growth to do this
we strongly advise that you keep track
of your team's performance
you should appreciate those who are
doing a good job in order to help them
strive for better performance on the
other hand those that are
underperforming should be did in the
right direction next up is resilience
and selflessness resiliency is an
important skill in today's fast-paced
and extremely competitive business world
this personality trait is defined as an
ability to get up faster to bounce back
and reshape after going through a
significant loss or failure being a
leader you should be able to remain
confident and poised in difficult
situations allow yourself some leeway in
dealing with disappointments this will
help you deal with your failures fast
and learn what else you could have done
better
selflessness is also a critical
leadership personality trait a leader
never elevates himself above his team if
something does not go right the leader
will always take full responsibility for
it
in contrast if success shows up he will
throw away the credits to his teammates
on that note can you all mention one of
your skills that you think can make you
an effective leader make sure to drop
your answer in the comments section
below let's see how many of us have what
it takes to become a Graves leader the
last on our list is effective decision
making leaders in general are those who
question the status quo they are
incredible Visionaries change Savvy and
agile every decision they make is not
rudimental and risk-free they take risks
knowing that they'll need to hold
themselves accountable if things don't
work out that's why to become an
effective leader we advise you to
develop the skill of quantitative
decision making
thanks to technology we can now use data
to predict future
and make sound data-driven decisions
that can take a business to levels of
success
being a leader you should be sincerely
enthusiastic and passionate about your
decisions and actions to fulfill them
this will encourage your team to work
hard towards a common goal with the same
level of dedication and enthusiasm
