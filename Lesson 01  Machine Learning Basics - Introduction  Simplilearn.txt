machine learning can change your life
provided you know how to implement the
right models with the right algorithms
hi guys welcome to this complete machine
learning course by simply learn now
let's have a look at what we'll be
covering today two of our industry
experts Richard and moan each with over
10 years of experience in data science
and machine learning will teach you the
various concepts of machine learning
including algorithms and how you can
practically Implement them first we will
understand what is machine learning and
then we will go through various
algorithms like linear regression
logistic regression K means clustering
decision tree random Forest KNN
algorithm svm and naive based classifier
you will not only learn how each of
these algorithms work but also Implement
them using python once you're done with
this you will have a firm grasp on the
concepts of machine learning after this
comprehensive machine learning training
we will also go through some popular
applications of machine learning and
then we will guide you on how you can be
a machine learning engineer and finally
we have collected 30 of the most
important questions that you might face
in a machine learning interview before
we move ahead with the full course let
us look at a short animated video we
have made so that you can understand the
basics of machine learning we know
humans learn from their past experiences
and machines follow instructions given
by
humans but what if humans can train the
machines to learn from the past data and
do what humans can do and much faster
well that's called machine learning but
it's a lot more than just learning it's
also about understanding and reasoning
so today we will learn about the basics
of machine learning so that's Paul he
loves listening to new
songs he either likes them or dislikes
them Paul decides this on the basis of
the song's Tempo genre intensity and the
gender of voice for Simplicity let's
just use Tempo and intensity for now so
here Tempo is on the x-axis ranging from
relax to fast whereas intensity is on
the y- AIS ranging from light to Soaring
we see that Paul likes the song with
fast tempo and soaring intensity while
he dislikes the song with relaxed Tempo
and light intensity so now we know
Paul's choices let's say Paul listens to
a new song Let's name it a song a song a
has fast tempo and a soaring intensity
so it lies somewhere here looking at the
data can you guess whether Paul will
like the song or not correct so Paul
likes this song by looking at Paul's
past choices we were able to classify
the unknown song very easily right let's
say now Paul listens to a new song Let's
label it as song b so song b lies
somewhere here with medium Tempo and
medium intensity neither relax maxed nor
fast neither light nor soaring now can
you guess whether Paul likes it or not
not able to guess whether Paul will like
it or dislike it are the choices unclear
correct we could easily classify song A
but when the choice became complicated
as in the case of song b yes and that's
where machine learning comes in let's
see how in the same example for song b
if you draw a circle around the song b
we see that there are four votes for
like whereas one vot for dislike if we
go for the majority wots we can say that
Paul will definitely like the song
that's all this was a basic machine
learning algorithm also it's called K
nearest neighbors so this is just a
small example in one of the many machine
learning algorithms quite easy right
believe me it is but what happens when
the choices become complicated as in the
case of song b that's when machine
learning comes in it learns the data
builds the prediction model and when the
new data point comes in it can easily
predict for it more the data better the
model higher will be the accuracy there
are many ways in which the machine
learns it could be either supervised
learning unsupervised learning or
reinforcement learning let's first
quickly understand supervised learning
suppose your friend gives you 1 million
coins of three different currencies say
one rupe 1 euro and 1 dirham each coin
has different weights for example a coin
of 1 rupee weighs 3 g 1 EO weighs 7 G
and 1 Dam weighs is 4 G your model will
predict the currency of the coin here
your weight becomes the feature of coins
while currency becomes the label when
you feed this data to the machine
learning model it learns which feature
is associated with which label for
example it will learn that if a coin is
of 3 G it will be a 1 rupee coin let's
give a new coin to the machine on the
basis of the weight of the new coin your
model will predict the currency hence
supervised learning uses labeled data to
train the the model here the machine
knew the features of the object and also
the labels associated with those
features on this note let's move to
unsup wise learning and see the
difference suppose you have Cricket data
set of various players with their
respective scores and the wickets taken
when you feed this data set to the
machine the machine identifies the
pattern of player performance so it
plots this data with the respective
wickets on the xaxis while runs on the Y
AIS while looking at the data you'll
clearly see that there are two clusters
the one cluster are the players who
scored High runs and took less wickets
while the other cluster is of the
players who scored less runs but took
many wickets so here we interpret these
two clusters as batsman and Bowlers the
important point to note here is that
they were no labels of batsmen and
Bowlers hence the learning with
unlabeled data is unsupervised learning
so we saw supervised learning where the
data was labeled and the unsupervised
learning where the data was unlabeled
and then there is reinforcement learning
which is a reward-based learning or we
can say that it works on the principle
of feedback here let's say you provide
the system with an image of a dog and
ask it to identify it the system
identifies it as a cat so you give a
negative feedback to the machine saying
that it's a dog's image the machine will
learn from the feedback and finally if
it comes across any other image of a dog
it'll be able to classify it correctly
that is reinforcement learning to
generalize machine learning model let's
see a flowchart input is given to a
machine learning model which then gives
the output according to the algorithm
applied if it's right we take the output
as a final result else we provide
feedback to the training model and ask
it to predict until it learns I hope
you've understood supervised and
unsupervised learning so let's have a
quick quiz you have to determine whether
the given scenarios uses supervised or
unsupervised learning simple right
scenario one Facebook recognizes your
friend in a picture from an album of
tagged
photographs scenario two Netflix
recommends new movies based on someone's
Past movie
choices scenario three analyzing Bank
data for suspicious transactions and
flagging the fraud transactions think
wisely and comment below your answers
moving on don't you sometimes wonder how
is machine learning possible in today's
era well that's because today we have
humongous data available everybody's
online either making a transaction or
just surfing the internet and that's
generating a huge amount of data every
minute and that data my friend is the
key to analysis also the memory handling
capabilities of computers have largely
increased which helps them to process
such huge amount of data at hand without
any delay and yes computers now have
great computational Powers so there are
a lot of applications of machine
learning out there to name a few machine
learning is used in healthcare where
Diagnostics are predicted for doctor's
review the sentiment analysis that the
tech Giants are doing on social media is
another interesting application of
machine learning fraud detection in the
finance sector and also to predict
customer turn in the e-commerce sector
while booking a capab you must have
encountered searge pricing often where
it says the fair of your trip has been
updated continue booking yes please I'm
getting late for office well that's an
interesting machine learning model which
is used by Global Taxi giant Uber and
others where they have differential
pricing in real time based on demand the
number of cars available bad weather
Rush R Etc so they use the searge
pricing model to ensure that those who
need a cab can get one also it uses
predictive modeling to predict where the
demand will be high with a goal that
drivers can take care of the demand and
search pricing can be minimized great
hey Siri can you remind me to book a cab
at 6:00 p.m. today okay I'll remind you
thanks no problem I hope that has got
you all interested to learn machine
