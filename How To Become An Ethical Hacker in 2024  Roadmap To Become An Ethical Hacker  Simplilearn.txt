let's get
started so let's get started now how to
become ethical hacker in
20124 the first one is basic Foundation
you need to understand what ethical
hacking is all about so basically
ethical hacking is all about using your
skills for good and helping to protect
systems and data from cyber threats the
first thing is basic education first
things first you need to finish high
school and during High School try to
focus on subjects like mathematics
computer science and it next is your
higher education okay so after high
school try to go for the higher
education so as we all know that After
High School consider pursuing a degree
in computer science information
technology or cyber security now you
might be wondering do I really need a
degree well a degree can definitely help
it gives you a solid foundation and is
often preferred by employers however
it's not the only way to become an
ethical hacker if you're are passionate
and committed you can learn the
necessary skills on your own many
successful hackers have taken this
self-taught route but remember it's just
not about the degree it's about the
skills and knowledge you gain along the
way employers are looking for people who
can solve problems and think creatively
whether they have a degree or not so I
hope so so guys you would have got a
brief idea regarding this now let's move
on the second part that is developing
the essential skills the first one is
programming so guys why it's important
look guys programming is like learning a
new language but for communicating with
the computers so what to learn first so
start with python because it is beginner
friendly and Powerful then pick up C and
C++ for understanding lowlevel
operations and JavaScript for webbased
hacking how to practice write small
scripts automate task and eventually
build your own hacking tools the next
one is networking so guys networking is
very very important networks are like
the Roads connecting all the computers
understanding networking is very very
crucial because it's where most hacking
happens so what to learn learn about IP
addresses subnets protocols like tcpip
and how data travels across the networks
now how you can practice you can set up
your own network Lab at your home using
virtual machines and experiment with
different networking setups now let's
move on to the next part that is
operating system so guys why it's
important because most hacking tools are
designed for a specific operation
especially Linux get comfortable with
Linux like dros C Linux and understand
the basics of Windows and Mac OS how to
practice use Linux as your main
operating systems play around with the
terminal commands and and understand
file structures now the next part is
security Concepts so guys why it's
important security concepts are like the
rules of the game knowing them helps you
understand how to break and fix things
so what to learn focus on encryption how
data is protected firewalls how to
defend networks VPN how to secure
connection and ideas how to detect
intrusions how you can practice
Implement these security measures in
your own systems and try to bypass them
to see how they work so these are the
core skills that form the backbone of an
ethical Hacker's knowledge it's just not
learning about them but practicing and
applying them in real world scenarios
