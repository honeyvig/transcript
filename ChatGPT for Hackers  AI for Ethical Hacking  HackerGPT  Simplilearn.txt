if you are an aspiring cyber security
professional looking for online training
and certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learn postgraduate program in cyber
security from University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
right choice for more details you can
use the link in the description box and
mid command so let's get started so guys
this is Chad GPT and this is the paid
version of Chad GPT 40 and what I was
telling you is this is the explore GPT
section so here you can find all the
gpts that are created by Chad GPT open a
all the individuals or you can find the
companies who have created gbts so you
can found these are the recently used
and this is the most used hacker GPT you
can find other gpts also that is hacker
GPT and you could see that and they have
been used by 5,000 plus users and this
have been used by 10,000 plus users so
you can just search for ethical hacker
gbt here and it has been rated 4.5 Stars
10,000 plus conversations and these are
the conversation Stars if you need any
assistance and the capabilities you can
see here and the ratings given by users
and more by the Creator who has created
this so we'll start with this we'll
start the chat here and I want to tell
you guys that chity doesn't answer non
ethical questions so if you try to
extract that information from chat GPT
that won't be possible but we can do a
bit like we can cross a bit line with
ethical hacker GPT but that should be
used for ethical purposes only so I will
show you guys how you can utilize this
GPT and one more thing guys if you want
to create your own GPT you can also
create that also you can go to explore
GPT section and here's the create option
click on Create and here you can start
creating your GPT if you click on
configure you can write the name of your
gbd description instructions and the
conversation starters as you just saw
with the hacker gbt ethical hacker gvt
and the capabilities what do you want to
be enabled you can do that and here in
the create section you could write the
prompts here and it will take that
information and use it for more purposes
and here you could attach more files
that could help create your GPD okay
guys so here you could see the
configuration and the preview of your
GPT and you can finalize that so moving
back we will get back to ethical hacker
GB and start with our conversation with
him so starting with the first thing we
can do is we can ask him like how can I
perform a basic security assessment on a
web application so if I tell you guys
performing a basic security assessment
on a web application is crucial for
identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring
the application is secure and this
process involves using various tools and
techniques to test the application for
common security issues so you could ask
him that how can I
perform a basic secur
it assessment on a web
application and just wait for a few
seconds and you could have the response
from ethical hacker gbd so you could see
that performing a basic security
assessment on a web application involves
several key steps and these are the key
steps number one is preparation and
information gathering and how you can do
that these are the steps identify the
scope gather information is the Second
Step that is reconnaissance and you can
use the tools BB suit ncto and others
similarly you could see all the steps
here so I won't be guiding or I won't be
reading what responses are generated by
ethical he gbt I have used that and he
provides very accurate like I would say
around 95 to 96% accurate results here I
want to show you guys how you can
utilize it so I will show you prompts
and what things you you can ask him so
this was all about repeat so this was
about the general security thing now
we'll move to ethical hacking and we can
ask him how we can perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment so these are the prompts
that you can write that would be how do
I perform a SQL
injection attack and that to ethically
if you write this that would be good on
a test
environment and if I tell you guys so
SQL injection is one of the most common
web application vulnerabilities and
understanding how to perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment can help you identify and
mitigate this risk in your own
applications and you could see he has
responded and he has provided you the
steps that you can set up a control test
environment first thing
then preparation and you could use these
tools then you have the manual SQL
injection testing so these are the
methods that you could use that is or
or1 equal to 1 for the database and
automated SQL injection testing so this
is the command for that and you could
verify vulnerability documentation
reporting so you could see that this GPD
is capable of answering the basic
questions as we have discussed the
basics question till now now we'll move
to scripting and automation so here you
could see how he respond to this so
we'll ask him can you provide a python
script to scan open ports on a
network so let's see what he
provides provide a python
script and that to to scan
ports on a
network so scanning open ports on
network is a fundamental step in
identifying potential vulnerabilities
and a py script that can automate this
process making it easier to regularly
check for open ports and secure them so
this is the python script you can use
any ID and run on that and you could see
that he's explaining the code also yeah
you can ask him like can you explain the
code line by line and this hacker gbt
will do that for you and how to run the
script that also he has provided you and
similarly we can also ask him that how
we can write a bash script to Monitor
and log unauthorized login attempts and
if you want I can also run this prompt
how do I write a bash
script and that do to
Monitor and log unauthorized
access unauthorized login
attempts so we we can monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and that
would be essential for maintaining the
security of your system so as you can
see he has written A bash script and
that can help you automate this process
and this will provide realtime alerts
and logs for further analysis and you
could see that he's providing the
explanation and how you can run the
script and he's writing the not also
like you can write more prompts if you
have any doubts in any of the script or
any of the responses that hacker GPT has
responded and he will definitely provide
you with good responses so now moving on
now we'll ask this ethical hacker GPT
about some specific security tools and
we could ask him about BB suit and so
let's write a prompt can you
explain how to
configure and use BB suit
or we can write for web application
testing so if I sum you up so BB suit is
a powerful tool for web application
security testing and understanding how
to configure and use it effectively can
help you identify and address a wide
range of security vulnerabilities in
your applications so you could see he
has provided the initial steps that that
would be downloading and installing BB
suit configuring your browser to use BB
suit as a proxy and then intercept and
inspect traffic and then you can use it
for testing purpose logging and
Reporting and tips for Effective testing
so this is the response for the security
tools and if we talk about incident
response we can ask him to write a
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so collecting system
logs is a critical part of incident
response and forensic analysis
and this script can automate processes
that can ensure that you have all the
necessary data to investigate security
incidents effectively so if I write here
we can ask this hacker gbt and I'm sure
he will provide the response for that
and write the script
so can you provide a
script to collect system
logs for forensic
is so as I told you this is the critical
part of incident response and we have
covered about the tools that is BB suit
we have asked him about the automation
process General cyber security question
ethical hacking that would be SQL
injection attack and the python script
tools can open ports on a network so he
can write scripts also automation task
and he could response with the general
cyber security question questions also
and if you see here for the incident
response he has writed the script to
collect system logs for forensic
analysis so I won't be explaining this
code as we're just looking for the
prompts that we can give to ethical
hacker gbt if you want you could just
ask him also that explain this code line
by line and here he has mentioned also
the explanation that is directories and
files to collect and after that he is
collecting the logs and that would be
copied in the directory that is he has
mentioned it a variable that is output
directory archiving logs cleanup and how
to run the script so this was about the
incident response Now we move to some
Advanced topics and in advanced topics
what we can ask him is ke how to perform
a man in the-middle attack in a
controlled environment and remember this
that you have to mention some of the
keywords that would be in a controlled
environment and for that thing only he
will response or provide the response to
you so I will start here that how do I
perform a man in
the middle
attack in a control
environment so if you understand man in
the middle attack that works in a
controlled environment this can help you
develop better defenses against such
attacks and it's important to learn and
practice these techniques ethically so
you can see here that he's providing the
prerequisites and the step by-step guide
how you can conduct a man in the middle
attack so first is set up the control
environment then install necessary tools
enable IP forwarding perform ARP
spoofing and then capture and analyze
traffic clean up and restore the network
and conclusion so you could just follow
with more prompts that I want more
information about setting up the control
environment just write this prompt and
this ethical hacker GPT will provide
more responses to you so he will provide
you how you can set up the control
environment so now moving on we will ask
some more prompts and that could be
about the reverse engineering so we
could ask him that can you explain the
processes of reverse engineering a
malware sample or we can also ask about
honey port to detect malicious activity
that could be how can I Implement a
honey port to detect malicious activity
or what are the techniques for securing
a Docker container so we'll ask him one
prompt here let's see what he responds
to that so how can
I Implement
a honey port to detect malicious
activity
so you could see that he has started
responding to that and if I tell you the
sum so a hyport is a security mechanism
set to detect deflect or in mechanism to
some Manner and it counteract attempts
at unauthorized use of Information
Systems implementing a honey Port can
help you Monitor and understand attack
patterns and this is the step-by-step
guide to implement a honey Port you can
choose the type of Honey Port prepare
your environment install and configure
the honey Port software and these are
all the commands how you can configure
it then you can monitor and analyze the
honey and regular maintenance and
updates and this is the simple handport
using honey you could install that and
run these commands so with that guys and
in the last we will also cover cyber
security policies and compliance so he
could also answer to those prompts also
that you can ask him that what should be
included in a company's cyber security
policy and you could mention which type
of company you are running so I will ask
him that so you could ask him that what
should be
included in a uh at tech
companies cyber security policy
so let's
see so you could see here that creating
comprehensive security policy for an
atte company involves adding various
aspects and that would be introduction
first is the purpose for cyber security
policy scope roles and responsibilities
data protection and privacy Network
Security application security user
security awareness and training incident
response and management compliance and
legal requirements physical security
device and endpoint security so
similarly you could ask him that draft
me the company's cyber security policy
and start with the introduction so he
will provide you all the introduction
points and then you can ask him that
draft roles and responsibilities he will
draft that also so you could like break
it into parts and ask the ethical hacker
gbt and he will respond to you as it has
some limitations of some words and some
of the responses so you could ask him in
the breaking parts and he will respond
to you so with that guys we have come to
