hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel and in this session we
will be learning how to calculate
standard deviation using excel but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological friends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with how to calculate
standard deviation in excel
so first we will understand what exactly
is standard deviation so standard
deviation is a calculated square of
variance
now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is variance
now the next part variance so what is
variance variance is a measure of
variability
it is calculated by taking the average
of squared deviations from the mean
now what are deviations
so slowly you can understand that we're
getting into the topic of statistics and
graphs so uh before getting deep into it
let's understand what is deviation so
the deviation is a measure that is used
to find the difference between the
observed value and the expected value of
a variable in simple terms deviation is
the distance from the center point so
for example when you are going through a
graph so you will be expecting some
value right and if you get some
difference that is above or below the
expected point that is called the
division what is the difference between
the expected point and the obtained
point so that is the deviation
now
next is the observed value so the
observed value is the value that you get
in real time unlike the predicted value
so now you might be thinking to
calculate standard deviation we might
need a few more parameters and you're
exactly right so to calculate standard
deviation in excel you need variance and
then you need a deviation and then you
need mean
right so all these parameters are
supposed to be calculated first and then
you will be having the final formula to
calculate standard tv now that we
understood the theoretical and
formula based explanation about standard
deviation it's time we calculate the
standard deviation using one of the most
popular business intelligence tool that
is microsoft excel so let's get back to
the practical mode
so now we are on the practical mode and
we have some sample data on my screen
right now let me expand it a little bit
yeah there you go
so
as discussed before to calculate
standard deviation we might require the
mean variance deviation and deviation
squared and then we can calculate the
standard deviation so let's go step by
step so the first one is calculating sum
right so to calculate average we might
need a sum of all the scores so we have
the index values that is 1 to 10 and
scores of each index value that is 1 to
10 right now let's calculate the sum of
all values here press tab to select the
function
select and drag these cells press enter
and then you have this course
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them
see you ent tab space to select and
select the number of sales press enter
and you have count
now what's the main so mean is simply
the average of all the numbers right so
you can either divide the sum by count
or you can simply use the average
function so let's try to use the average
function so that we also have an idea of
how the average function works press tab
to select it and select all the cells
and press enter now you have the average
or mean value
now we have the mean value and now after
finding the mean value we are supposed
to find out the deviation so remember
the deviation that is the difference
between the obtained value and the
predicted value right so the obtained
value is this one which is here in c2
and the predicted value is this one
that is 82.6 that's our mean right
according to formula we are supposed to
eliminate the value of obtained minus
the mean right so select uh the cell
equals to c2
minus the obtained value that is mean
now press f4 to freeze the value and now
press enter
so that you can freeze the value and
drag the formula across all the cells
now you have the deviation
right
now the next step is to find the sum of
all the deviation numbers so i either
you can apply the sum formula to all
these numbers or you can just drag this
cell over here and the formula will be
automatically copied now similarly the
count function to count all the values
that doesn't drag it and you'll have it
over here right now the next step is to
find out the square deviations or the
square of the deviations which is really
simple all you have to do is equals to
select the cell and
see that small hat kind of logo on the
number six use that
now into two press enter
you have this query
similarly drag the same formula across
all the cells and you'll have your
squared numbers similarly drag this
summation function over here so you'll
have the sum of this
and the count number as well
now
comes the final formula
now we have the mean value that is over
here let's color it
and we have
the variation square
now
that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape
and we have deviation as well let's
color it in a different shape
now we need to find the variance and
after we find the variance the last step
is to count the standard division or to
calculate the standard deviation so what
is the formula to calculate the variance
so for variance
you need the
sum of deviation square
divided by
total number of values
minus
1
the center and that's your variance
now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to calculate
the
variance to the power of
0.5
and that's your standard deviation
so that's how you calculate standard
deviation in excel i hope all the
formulas and the explanation was clear
if you have any queries regarding any of
the topics covered in the session or the
formulas used in the session or you
require the data set that we used during
this session then please do let us know
in the comment section below and our
team of experts will be more than happy
to resolve all your queries at the
earliest until next time thank you stay
