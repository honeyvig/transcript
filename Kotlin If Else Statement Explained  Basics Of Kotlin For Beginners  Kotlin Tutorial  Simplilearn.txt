hey everyone welcome back to another
video tutorial by simply learn in this
video session we will be learning about
if else in kotlin
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we will be covering today
so we'll start with conditionals in
kotlin then we'll understand different
types of effects expressions like if
expressions if else expression
if else if ladder expression and
courtlin nested if expression
but before we begin

now let's move on to the first topic
which is
conditionals in kotlin
conditional expression refers to a
situation that may happen or exist if a
specific condition is met
for example there's a statement like
we can sit on the front benches if we
reached before the given time
now here the conditional statement is
if we reached before the given time
and the main clause is
we can sit on the front benches
so here sitting on the front bench which
is a main clause is dependent on
if they reach before the time
so now
there are some conditionals in kotlin
like if else and else if
so let's have a look at that first is if
statement
if is used when a block of code must be
executed based on the condition to be
true
second is else statement
else is used when a block of code must
be executed if the same condition is
false
third is else if statement
elsif is used to specify a new condition
if the previous condition is false
we will understand them in detail
now moving on to different types of if
else expressions
first is if expression
second is if else expression third is
if else if ladder expression and fourth
is nested if expression
now let's understand the if expression
first
if expression is a conditional statement
which checks if a particular condition
is satisfied
the condition is specified inside the if
brackets and it checks if it met the
condition or not
if they met the condition then the block
will execute otherwise not
as we can see there is a statement then
there is if condition
if the condition is satisfied that is if
it is true
then only the if code will execute
otherwise
if
it is false then control will exit
now moving on to if else expression
the if else expression has two blocks of
statements the if block executes if the
condition is true and if the condition
is false then the else block executes
the if else is similar to if expression
the only difference is
it has one extra block known as else
block
a simple example of if else is a
conversation between a father and a son
the father says if you scored more than
85 percent then i will buy you a car
but if you scored between 75-25 percent
then i will buy you a bike
here i will buy you a car is the code
written inside the if block
and i will buy you a bike
is a code written inside the else block
so when
the son
scores 85 percent then his father
buy him a car
but if he scores between 75-25 range
then he will get the bike
now
moving on to if else if ladder
expression
kotlin if else if condition is used when
there are multiple conditions to be
checked
in this expression first the if
expression is checked if it's true
then it executes the if block otherwise
it moves to the other else if conditions
if none of the condition turns out to be
true then it executes the last final
else expression
to understand it let's have a look at
this example
according to this example if a student
scores marks between 80 and 105
then the cutoff is not cleared but he or
she can sit for the second examination
if the marks code is between 105 and 130
then the cutoff is cleared
if the marks scored between 130 and 180
then the cutoff is cleared and also
there will be no feet
and else cut off not cleared so by this
example we understood
that there are multiple conditions
and each condition has a specific
criteria
if the marks of the student is fit in
that criteria then that specific block
gets executed
now
moving on to the nested if expression
in kotlin nested if expression there are
if statements inside another if
statement
first the if statement is checked
if it is true then the nested if
condition is checked
if the conditions turns out to be false
then it will move to the else expression
in this example it checks for true in
condition 1
then checks for true in condition 2.
if condition 2 evaluates to true
statement 1 that is even number is
executed
otherwise statement 2 that is odd number
is executed
similarly if condition 1 evaluates to
false then else block executes and the
statements
negative number is printed
so as we have understood all of these
expressions
so now let's do its practical
implementation

so this is our code editor that is
intellij idea
so here we will be doing some examples
of kotlin if else
so let's start with the first example of
if else expression
so we'll write
function main
and inside this function we'll create
a
marks let's say the marks of the test
so we have named it test marks
now
let's say
he is code 78 he or she scored 78 now
we'll use if condition
and we'll write the condition
that if text marks
is let's say less than 75
then we will print you didn't qualify
the test
so we'll write
deland
and
qualified the test
so basically to qualify a test you have
to score more than 75
so in else block
we'll write
print ln
will write you qualified the test
basically if you have scored less than
75 marks you are not qualified but if
you have scored more than 75
then you have qualified the test here we
have used the basic effects expression
here the test marks is the variable that
we have set let's say 78
and if we have changed it like
less than 75 let's say 70 then it will
get printed you didn't qualify the test
but as we have set the value of test
marks as 78 so it means
you qualified the test will
print
it's a simple example let's try to run
this
so as you can see you qualified the test
is printed
so as we know that the marks is 78 so it
is printing you qualified the test
and if we have let's say
max is 70 now again let's try to print
it
now it will print
you didn't qualify the test
as you can see it is printing you didn't
qualify the test
now
let's have a look at an example of
nested if
so now create a new file
okay we have to change the name of this
file
all right
so in this example again we'll write
function main
inside this function will create a
variable
let's say the name of the variable is
num
and we'll assign it 50.
now we'll set a condition if the value
of num
is let's say less than 100
then we'll print number is less than 100
first of all we'll print that
now if num
is equal to 50
so this is the if condition inside the
first if condition this is the first if
condition this is the if condition
inside this if condition so it's a
nested if
now here we'll print
that
number equal to 50.
now inside this if condition again we'll
write an if condition saying that if
number is let's say greater than
40
then we'll print number is greater than
40.
basically we are printing
the condition
all right so this is the code
now
first if condition then there is nested
if condition then there is another
nested if condition first condition says
if the number is less than 100 then it
will print number is less than 100 if it
is equal to 50 then it will print number
equal to 50 if it is greater than 40
then we'll print the number is greater
than 40.
so now let's try to run this program
so as we can see number is less than 100
first it is printing
after that number equal to 50
then the number is greater than 40.
so as we know the number is 50 that is
why all the three
statements are printed
now let's say if we change this number
like let's say the number is 45.
if the number is 45 then number is less
than 100 is printed
and this sentence that is the number is
greater than 100 is printed and not
number equal to 50 because to print this
number equal to 50 sentence the number
must be equal to 50.
now let's try to run this again
so as you can see number is less than
100 is only getting printed because as
we can see here
to
get inside this if condition the number
must be 50
as the number is not 50 but 45 so it is
not getting inside this if condition
so that is why this condition is also
not getting checked so that is why only
number is less than 100 is getting
printed
so this is an example of nested if
expression
now let's do an example of
if else if letter expression
let's name it if else three
all right so now
here we will do an example of if else if
ladder expression where we will
give grades to the student based on
their marks
so let's start
function main
inside this we'll create a variable
let's say well score
and assign it a value
so this value is the marks of the score
or you can say
the score is 76
now
we'll create a variable
whose type is string
now
after that
we will have to assign this grade
so basically we are assigning the value
of effective letter expression to this
variable grade
so this is how we do it if
score variable
is greater than equal to 90
that is if the score is greater than 90
then we'll simply print your grade is a
plus
so yeah
i will do it
it is a plus
now
if a student
scores more than 90 then his grade is a
plus
now
he will write
else if
so inside the elsif there is a condition
we can write the condition inside the
else if as we know
4 is greater than equal to let's say
80
then we'll print
your grade is a plus
your grade is a not a plus now after
that
another else if
if the score is greater than equal to
70.
then the grade is
will write your grade
is
b plus
let's see if the score is greater than
60 similarly
write your grade is
e
you can do same for all of these we can
just copy paste it
this one is 60 then let's make here 50
and the grade would be
c
e plus
now here would be let's say 40
we'll do it 40 and the gate would be
c
now after that 35
let's make it 35
your grade is
[Music]
or a d
now
in else block will simply write
that is your grade is f that is if you
scored below 35
your grade is f that is your fail
so you must score more than 35 to pass
the exam
right now after that we can print
this great variable
and let's try to run this
so as you can see your grade is b plus
it's getting printed and i think
by mistake
there is n in between
here it is
that is why it is printing in here so
our score was 76 so that is why it is
again taking printed your grade is b
plus
so this expression is used when there is
a need of multiple conditions like in
this case we have
we had the need of multiple expressions
like
one condition is score must be greater
than 90 then only the score will be a
plus then score must be greater than 70
score must be greater than 60 similarly
for every statement that is to be
printed there must be a specific
condition
and in this type of case we use if else
if letter expression
so these were few examples of if else
expressions
you can try this on your own
and with that we have come to the end of
this session
