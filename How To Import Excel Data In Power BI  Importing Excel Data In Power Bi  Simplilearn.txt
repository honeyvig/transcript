Interest now without further delay let's
get started with how to import Excel
data into Power Pi okay let's switch to
powerp first let's deal with the type of
sources and then switch to excel so now
uh we have landed to the power VI
desktop so here we have a wide variety
of options Excel workbook you can get
the data from hubs you can get data from
SQL servers and you can also enter the
data manually we have another option
called Data verse it's it's another
story for another day and you can also
customize your inputs here you can get
some data from web page just you can do
some data you know website crawling and
get the data so apart from that coming
back to today's uh subject which is
about importing data from an Excel sheet
so Excel can be a little tricky
sometimes so here we can see an Excel
data file so here we have sales data for
four years 2020 21 22 23 and uh let's
say we wanted to import all these four
files into one desktop powerbi desktop
can you do that yes we can do that and
another way here we have is Excel data
sets and a combined Excel sheet where we
have multiple tabs the same four years
of data which looks something like this
2020 21 22 and 23 correct so four years
of uh data separated by four different
tabs so can you combine this yes can
also combine that so we will check out
two possibilities so let's quickly go
back to powerbi window and go to get
data and here we'll try the first one so
going to more and here select uh the
folder option so
file and uh open Connect Now browse the
folder so we have the browse option here
go to downloads where we have that
folder go to excel select that and press
okay and another okay and we should be
getting the data shortly now now uh here
we have combine load and transform you
can just go with combine and load but we
don't want to have any errors in our
data sets so for saf as side we will go
to transform data and we will shape our
data manually and for more tutorials on
explanation on transform data we have a
exclusive video on transform data in P
you can check out that so here go to the
first one you know the binary one where
you have the binary just right click it
and make sure that you remove any other
columns than binary we don't want them
right so uh an extra column is the
custom column and uh here you go and let
the name be custom name need the name
for that so Excel we need a function
where we can import Excel workbook so
this is the one Excel workbook and open
a bracket then just double click on this
content or you can use insert close the
bracket and just press okay there you go
now you have the table over here you can
just expand
it this prefix
okay now again just select the name of
the sheet and of the sheet rest
everything you can delete we don't need
any of
those you have it now expand the
data you can use the original columns as
prefix or not you will not choose to do
that press okay and your data should be
loaded shortly you can see we don't have
the names of the columns as the column
headers you find them in the First
Column I in the first row you can okay
let's remove this column we don't need
the name column we need the row ID first
there you go now you can click on this
option over here where you can find a
small table and second option use first
R headers and that's how you get the dat
data imported from all the different
sheets into your data set you can once
check the filters just make just to make
sure that we don't have any of the
column headers from four different dat
sets as one of the element right so we
don't have it so okay now this is one
way of importing data and another one
let's say go back to home and we wanted
to import few more data sets uh like the
other one where we had the combined one
right so you have the applied steps
right you can just go on eliminating
them just for demo purposes so that we
go back to the homepage where we didn't
have any of the data set right now let's
go back to the source level we can also
run the source level over have so you
can even close the source
level close the query
settings data or you can completely C
close the power query editor yes now
let's import the Excel so this might
take a little while worry
not go to excel Excel workbook and here
just select the Excel data sets and here
we have the combined data set remember
where we had four different tabs so
press
okay automatically it will give us the
power
a query option where we can load or
transform the data now you have four
different tabs now powerbi or power
query will give you an option of
choosing which particular years you want
to work with let's say I want to work
with only the latest two years that is
2022 and 2023 then I can directly go to
load or transform let's go with
transform as we did previously and here
you can combine the data sets all
together you can just uh use the
data merging option and combine these
two data sets so here we have the merge
queries option and you can just
merge here we have the first table which
is 2023 here you just have to select
2022 from the
dropdown the data here and just press on
okay and you will have the data sets
March for more explanation on how to
March data in powerbi we have a

data to PBI and with that we have come
