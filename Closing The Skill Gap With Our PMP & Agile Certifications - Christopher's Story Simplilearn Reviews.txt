my journey started in 1982
in the financial services industry
i worked in computer operations and in
networking
but in 2019 after 26 years i was laid
off on my job
here i was
in my late 50s
and i noticed there was gaps in my
resume
i needed to upskill myself hi i am
christopher palucci i have taken pmp
agile scrum master and idle
certifications from simplylearn i could
find another job because of new skills i
have gained
i chose to upskill myself because it was
essential compete for a new job in these
times and to become updated with new
skills because the market absolutely
demanded it i wanted to have project
management skills as well as take up
bigger projects i went on the internet
i did searches for
project management
courses
to see what could make me succeed what
what what's the best skill for me to
take up i tried to look at different
courses and different companies that
offered
programs but let me say this to you i
came upon simply learn and wow simply
learn offer the best value
i love to play piano
i also
work out a lot
and so
simply learn gave me the opportunity to
learn on the go
and learn whenever i wanted their
on-demand classes their mobile app made
learning so much more accessible and
enjoyable the instructors were very
knowledgeable and they were very helpful
so
it really helped me to
nail down what i needed to learn
the certificates helped me because when
i was looking for work
i noticed that i had deficiencies in my
resume there was gaps that needed to be
filled and the certificates definitely
helped i used them on my linkedin
profile and when i went for an interview
and i went on many
i definitely
mentioned my
certificates and the fact that i
completed them so i'm sure that helped
me
after all the searching i finally was
given the opportunity to work at a
company
that does cloud faxing cloud email and
cloud edi
i help customers on a daily basis
achieve their goals
i really love the job and i have to say
because we

company that uses agile
on a daily basis

is continue to upskill yourself continue
to update yourself
