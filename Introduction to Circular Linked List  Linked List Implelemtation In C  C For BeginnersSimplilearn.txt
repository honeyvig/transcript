welcome to yet another interesting and
informative video by simply learn
today's video will teach us all about
circular simply linked list in C but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
this session will help you understand
what a circular single linked list is in
C after that let's understand the memory
representation of a circular singly
linked list later let's look at the
syntax and finally operations performed
on a circular singly linked list
so before we get started I have a simple
question to you guys
please try to answer in the comment
section below and we will update you
with the correct answer in the chat
section
and the question is the 10 nodes address
is pointing towards the head node of the
linked list what is the name of the
linked list that means the last notes
address is pointing towards the first
node of the linked list and guess the
name of the linked list
and the options are singly linked list
doubly linked list
circular linked list or both singly and
doubly linked list
please try to answer in the comment
section below
all right
now let's begin by understanding what a
circular singly linked list is in C
in a circular linked list we can perform
a circular single linked list and
circular doubly linked list so this
session is on a circular singly linked
list
in the circular singly linked list there
is no null in any of the notes instead
the last note's next pointer holds the
address of the first node so basically
there is only one pointer variable in
the circular linked list
and a traversal of a circular linked
list is until we reach the same node we
started in a list
moving ahead let's have a look at the
circular singly linked list memory
representation
so first let's consider four elements to
be inserted into the list and for that
we have four nodes where each node
consists of data part and address part
stored at some address 2000 2016 2022
and 3000.
in the singly linked list the last node
points to null but when we compare a
circular linked list to which singly
linked list we don't find a null which
means in a circular linked list the last
note's next pointer holds the address of
the first node in other words we can say
that the tail loads address is pointing
towards the head node of the linked list
and as I discussed before every node in
a linked list is connected with the
other through a pointer that points to
the address of the next node
and that is represented by the arrows in
this diagram
for example
so later elements to be inserted be 10
20 30 and 40. as you all can see the
last node next is holding the edges of
the first node that is 2000.
and the next part of the first node is
holding the edges of its next node that
is 2016. similarly the second node is
holding the address of its third node
that is
2022 and the third node is holding the
address of its next node that is 3000.
and the last node is holding the address
of the first node and in this way they
are linked together
up next we have a syntax of a circular
singly linked list
the syntax of a circle single linked
list is similar to that of a single
linked list so we have a stuck keyword
followed by a structure name called node
then we have a variables declaration
that is data and struct node asterisk
next a pointer variable pointing to an
element of a structure node so with this
let's try to execute a simple circular
single linked list program to understand
in a better way
so in this program we have a pointer
variable called next
and inside the main function we are
creating nodes and they are first second
third and fourth so for every node we
need to allocate memory for it so using
mL of function we are creating memory
or we are allocating memory for it and
once allocating memory we are inserting
values into it and the elements are 10
20 30 and 40.
and once inserting value we need to link
each and every node so for that first
next is holding the address of second
node second next is holding the address
of third node and third next is holding
the address of fourth node and the last
node that is fourth note next is holding
the address of its first node
and last is equal to Fourth
and display function will display all
the elements in a circular singly linked
list so it first check the condition if
the last node is equal equal to null
then the list is empty
pointer is equal to last notes next do
so it checks the condition
it prints the values that is pointers
data it prints the data of every node
and then checks the condition while
pointer not equal to last notes next so
now let's try to execute
and here we got the output
the elements are 10 20 30 14 inserted
into a circular skin cleaning list
okay so now let us move on to the
operations on a circular singly linked
list
first we have the insertion operation
next the deletion operation and finally
the traversal operation
let's understand them in detail
under insertion operation we have
insertion at beginning so basically we
insert the elements at the beginning of
the element list next insertion at the
end that means it inserts the element at
the end of the element list and lastly
insertion after a specified node that
means it inserts the element of this
unspecified node
now let's run the program and understand
these insertion operations practically
so in this program we are going to
perform insertion operation so first
let's start with insert to empty list
so we are going to insert a new node
into an AMT list so if head is not equal
to null then return head create a new
node and allocate memory for it
and once creating memory
assign a data
and now the new node is equal to head
and head next that means creating a link
to itself head next is equal to head and
return head
and next we are going to perform
insertion at beginning so insert a new
node at the beginning of a linked list
so if head is equal equal to null then
return to insert to empty list function
create a new node and allocate memory
for it and then assign a value for a new
node so new data is equal to data
Now new next is equal to head next
so the new is the head node return head
late next we are inserting an element at
the end of a linked list so for that it
checks the condition if last is equal
equal to null return to insert to empty
list function
and create a new node allocate memory
and assign a data
and now link the address so new next is
equal to last next
now the new node is the last next
and written last
next we have insertion of the node so it
checks the condition last is equal equal
to null then return none
else we have we are creating here the
new and a pointer variable pointer is
equal to last next so do if pointer data
is equal equal to element that means if
we find the element then allocate memory
for the new node and assign a data
and now new next is assigned to pointer
next
and now the pointer is assigned to the
pointers next and if pointer is equal
equal to last
then assign new to last and return last
pointer is equal to pointers next so
while pointer not equal to last next the
given node is not present in the list
and written last
we have display function where it
displays all the linked list elements
so for that it check the condition if
head is equal equal to null then the
list is empty
s it will print all the elements of a
node
so now coming to the main function here
we have inserting values there are 20 25
10 15. so first insert to empty list so
we are inserting the 20 to the empty
list that is the first element is 20 and
then coming to insert at end after 20 it
will print 25
and insert a beginning so before 20 and
25 it will insert element 10. and insert
often node that means after 10 it will
print 15. so now let's execute and see
the output
as you all can see it is printed in a
order 10 15 20 and 25.
followed by that we have a deletion
operation to delete from the beginning
delete from the end and delete after a
specific node
so now let's run a program
so in this program we are going to
perform a deletion operation so we are
basically deleting a node
so for that we have a delete note
function it first checks the condition
if last is equal equal to none that
means if the linked list contain no
elements then it returns
else it will check whether the list
contain a single element so if last data
is equal equal to Keynote and last next
is equal equal to last then free the
last and assign last is equal to null
and return
next creating a temp variable is equal
to last and delete note
so here it will delete a last node so
for that if last data is equal to equal
to Keynote
and why temp next is not equal to last
and assign temp next to temp
so here
the last next is assigned to Temp next
and free the last
and temp next is assigned to last
then we are traveling to the node or we
are finding the node to be deleted so
for that we have y then next is not
equal to last and temp next data is not
equal to Keynote then assign temp next
to Temp and
if the temp next data is equal equal to
Keynote that means if you find the node
to be deleted then assign the temp next
to delete node and delete note next to
Temp next and free up the delete note
space
and then coming to the main function
it prints after deletion the linked list
elements so we are going to delete the
element 15 from the list and it displays
the element so now let's execute it
so as you can see
here the linked list elements were 10 15
20 and 25 so after deletion that means
we deleted the element 15. so after
deletion the linked list elements are 10
20 and 25.
and finally we have traversal operation
in this operation we visit each and
every node at least once maybe to
display all the data elements or to
perform operations on it so let's
understand it practically
so in this program the display function
works as a traversal so it travels the
every node in a linked list so basically
it first checks the condition if head is
equal equal to none then the list is
empty it prints the list is empty if it
does not find any node in a linked list
then it returns now assign the head next
to pointer
so that it prints the
data of every node
and checks the condition well pointer
not equal to head next
coming to the main function here we have
it prints the elements of a linked list
that means after the insertion and
deletion operations it will print all
the elements present in a linked list so
now let's try to execute it
so here linked list elements are 10 15
20 and 25 so after deletion the linked
list elements were 10 20 and 25 then it
displayed the elements after deletion
and insertion the elements are 10 20 and
25 so the final linked list elements are
10 20 and 25.
