today's discussion is about advanced
radiographic techniques
the first one is auto paint tomography
also contest panoramic image ok I'll be
covering just the basic mechanisms to do
these videos see in orthopedic Rafi as
we can see in the image first on the
right side you can see there is a tube
head that is the x-ray source on the
left side of the oh there is a receptor
with secondary collimator okay the blue
part the entire thing is the receptor
with a localized collimator that is the
gray box okay now both of these things
are moving okay first we can see the
tube head is the direction of x-ray
source around the patient and in the
similar direction the receptor is also
moving in this diagram in the anti
clockwise direction
okay so see in this picture the first
picture first one is the position of the
tube head at this time okay and I hope
everybody can see the black tea bag with
the number one written on it and the
image is formed on the receptor on the
opposite side okay here with the arrows
we can see the starting point is number
one the image is form just opposite to
it then again the tube head and the
receptor Cassatt the receptor is also
moving okay so now the tube has the head
comes to position two then position
three then in this next diagram position
four five and six in this way it is
completing that entire rotation okay and
simultaneously at the same time the
image is formed see on the image on the
right side first a partial the most
posterior part of the right left side is
formed then a little bit more a more
from position three than from position
four five six and entire image is formed
in six steps here for for the ease of
understanding only six steps are shown
but actually there are very millimeter
steps when actually the
she moves it's continuous in multiple
steps not only six steps okay so in also
in this the previous picture salt only
you can see that the tube is never going
to the most anterior part okay it is
moving in the like the most interior or
midline interior part it is not covered
by the tube and at the same time the
receptor never goes to the most
posterior right okay it has a
significance we'll see further now in
this diagram we can see that in between
there is a center of rotation
okay the center of rotation is the black
dotted line in the center which is a
continuous center of rotation when tube
head moves as shows the center of
rotation also shifts continuously and
follows this arc okay so here comes the
real image really there are three types
of images are formed real images double
images and ghost images okay first one
this is the real image it is formed
between a real image is formed of the
objects which are placed between
receptor and center of rotation okay
since the receptor never comes to the
most posterior part the most posterior
part is left okay next is the ghost
image it is formed of the objects which
are between source and center of
rotation so the source that is the qubit
is never going to the N most anterior
part so anterior participate okay it is
between center of rotation and source
the ghost image now comes the double
image it is formed between the objects
which are posterior to the center of
rotation and have the image twiced
okay so it comes in this diamond shape
of area only these objects will be
imaged double and that posterior to the
center of rotation
coming to computed tomography and cone
beam computed tomography this is the
picture showing computed tomography in
which Delta x-ray source and if
fan-shaped beam of x-rays is coming and
falling on the detector so x-ray source
is the leg is like the tube ID from
their x-rays coming and detectors are
the receptors or the detectors which
detect the x-ray which is coming out of
the patient okay so after activation the
x-rays will fall on that detector okay
this picture shows that prejean third
generation first a diagram is the third
generation how earlier CT machines were
in that the tube head is moving in the
same way detectors is also moving
because there are not a complete circle
of detectors only an arc of detectors so
it is also moving then B diagram B shows
the fourth generation of city in which
detectors are a complete circle so
detectors doesn't have to move every
place has a detector
only that the overhead is moving okay
then can see this is the fifth
generation which is mostly used now here
the patient is moving inside the gantry
see the big black arrows is showing the
movement of the patient at the same time
x-ray source and detectors everything is
moving the detectors are also moving
within the gantry an x-ray source is
also moving within the gantry and the
image form each slice is imaged so each
slice is stored in the form of pixel
this cross diagram we can see has 512 by
512 pixels in more advanced machines
this is double of this that is 1024
pixels by 1024 pixels this each square
is called a pixel when we assess the
volume also okay that is the third
dimension of this
each square it becomes a box and each of
this square each pixel has been given a
Hounsfield unit okay meets each pixel
will have a grey skills based on the
animation okay
so bone has more activation means less
of the x-rays will pass through it less
or none actually will pass through bone
so the Hounsfield unit will be high that
is from 400 to 1000 and for air every
all the x-rays will pass through air
nothing will be attenuated or very less
will be activated so for air CT number
or household number is very less that is
- thousand
