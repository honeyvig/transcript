yeah hi friends I think it's less than
four weeks in fact less than four weeks
and yeah there is some sort of fear some
sort of frustration stress levels
increasing don't know where we are going
to end up don't know exactly what we are
doing
so like apart from all of these issues
still we are working hard still we are
planning to do something better still we
are trying to give our best right so
even with a doubtful heart I think many
of us are going for the bed so I mean a
little more focus is required for at
least these 28 days that's the only
statement I can do for you forever
so coming to all the things what we have
done this video is specifically for MDS
conquer students so we are left off with
like by this weekend we will be left
over with few subjects that is perio
which is going to carry 14 marks
community dentistry is going to carry 14
marks we are left out with these two
subjects then after implants which is
very important I have seen like three to
four questions in every sessions of NEET
related to the implant so there is some
sort of important should be given to
implants either in the prosthetic point
of view or in the surgical point of view
or in the barrier point of view so so
followed by the big compo which includes
this oral medicine oral pathology
general pathology general medicine
general surgery a part of physiology and
few topics of pharma so this big combo
is left over so these are the things we
are left over and preferably two days
for this period two days for the
community medicine
Sarika community dentistry and one day
for the implants and probably ten more
days
for this combo so exactly by 15 days we
are going to complete the leftover stuff
that is leftover stuff is approximately
I feel like this is going to carry in
and around 80 marks in our examination
h-how'd of these these are only is going
to carry around 30 and left how this
combo is going to carry in and around 50
to 60 so we are left off with 80 marks
and we are done with more than two
thirds of the preparation until now by
today right so of course we need to
increase the duration of preparation at
least like one hour per day possible
try to conserve as much as time as
possible so in this 15 days we are going
to complete these topics discussed
pareo community dentistry implants few
topics of pharmacology oral medicine and
oral path as a combo general pathology
general medicine general surgery right
so we are going to cover all these
things so apart from that I want you
guys to give apart from these 15 days so
will be left over with 13 or 12 or days
more further for like probably we are
going to solve few mock exams and get
ourselves prepared so that's what the
plan of action for this upcoming 27
orders for your need examination and
probably in the last week I don't want
you guys to give any sort of
examinations and lose your confidence
level so probably we could close the
things by December 31st met so December
31st night and probably December 31st or
1st Jan he is going to be your last mock
examination that this is what my plan of
action is you can modify accordingly the
purpose will be available on your site
whenever you want to give you can give
probably I want you guys to finish off
the things by or stop analyzing yourself
by at least like Jan 1st Jan --this is
the red line so after that I don't want
you guys to get much disturbed means
so once you're done with this 15 days
mode of preparation with the left or
subjects another 5 or 6 days you are
going to give mock examinations that's
going to you're hit you're going to hit
Jan first so once your Jan first is
reached I don't want you guys to give
any sort of examinations you just try to
revise recap we are going to take few
fast-track discussions in the group and
a motivation self confidence self
improvement these are the things that if
we are going to focus in the last week
of examination right so this is what the
plan of action for upcoming 27 or days
so the the few things that you have to
do it at any cost
one is a PC from 2001 to till date 2015
and 2016 and 2017 will be discussed in
group we already started the discussion
my majority of the stuff what we are
discussing are relevant to the NEET
topics which were given in the last year
examinations and before last year
examinations we are just focusing on
such stuff so please don't neglect that
so these are the things that you have to
do at must mock exams must followed by
pp books must and group stuff so these
are the four mandatory things that you
have to do apart from this Plus what you
have learn previously if it is a dental
pulse you can go with dental pulse if it
is a dentist dentist or with any XY jet
book what you have done until now you
need to do that at any cost and probably
this 2001 to 2015 AAPC I'm Secours if
you have time or if you have already
done with the synopsis of these MCQs I
want you guys to go ahead and let's like
try to brush up the synopsis where you
feel like you are in doubt or in dilemma
or else you can just stick on to the
question and answer format or just read
question follows answer maybe
predictably we may expect some repeats
from these sessions and apart from that
mock exams are mandatory and few things
that I am going to post the group post
in the group that you need to go for
must okay few things where and be people
loud to give em seekers so such things
we will revise recap and if not I'll
post on the site so that you can
practice so these are the mandatory
things that you have to do that is a PG
2001 to 2015
all mock exams of MDS conquer quick
recap of power plebs not wasting much of
your time revising the group stuff that
is being posted from last one month
which is completely need focused and the
previous stuff what you have done and
the stuff what I am imposing you to you
as an examination on our online site so
these are the mandatory things that you
have to do and the personal things what
you need to change one is about your
sleep patterns you need to change
because there was a shift in the time of
examination if you compared with the
previous examination generally the
examination used to be 10 to 1 o'clock
previously now they have shifted to 3 to
6 o clock that is a vague change by the
end be people I don't know what is the
reason why they have taken this move but
the adèle levels what you used to
maintain a 10 o clock is totally
different from what you are going to
maintain at 3 o clock because 3 o'clock
is something like after mealtime right
where majority of the aspirants used to
take a nap for one hour of two hours and
then it they used to come back and work
so this is what the strategy of a
aspirant while they're preparing but due
to the shift in the time there's going
to be lots of influence on the level of
Adrenaline's in your body because these
adrenals are going to play a very vital
role in an examination making your brain
to function for more than four hours
send apart from that your naps are going
to make you inactive in the examination
at any cost it's going to happen so
fascination is
you need to change your sleep patterns
probably you need to go back early so
that you may not feel sleepy in the
afternoon sessions after the meal second
one is shifting your lunch
it should happen at least for these 28
days I want you guys to how either
little in the afternoon session or
either shift in your lunch
timings like probably we used to have at
one at one like twelve to one twelve to
two o'clock in the range varies from
individual to individual but I want you
guys to finish your lunch by eleven
o'clock so that by three o'clock your
levels will be normal or else I want you
guys to take a little lunch
at your regular times followed by a
decent amount of snacks at four o'clock
but probably after six o'clock so this
pattern should not hurt you or disturb
you while you are giving the examination
right so these are the two things the
sleep patterns i altered sleep patterns
for these 28 days and the amount or the
time of your meal in the afternoon
session you need to change because it's
going to have a fuse effect on your
examination day so third one physically
should be fine and I want you guys to go
for a proper food and preferably the
food for these 20 a day should be at
home don't take any food outside okay
there is no other more if you can go
ahead because even a small cold or a
viral flavor is going to disturb two or
three days and out of these 20 days
disturbed for two or three days is more
than 10 percent of your loss of your
time in the preparation so it's it's
it's obvious that you need to take a
good food and preferably the food at
home please try to avoid food outside
please try to avoid oily food preferably
to take more vitamins preferably in
antioxidants and I want you guys to go
with multivitamin capsules
probably to decrease your stress out and
better to how good music at preferable
time well now you feel like frustrated
or you're out of focus just have a good
music and stand the things off so please
try to avoid your Facebook try to avoid
multiple charts on whatsapp insta all
social medium should be blocked for
these 28 days after 28 days it's
completely over I'm not asking you to do
this forever
okay nothing wrong you can go ahead
because I feel like being happy it's
more important like fun entertainment
are the things that we should give some
sort of importance but as this 28 days
are going to affect your future career
and your lifestyle so it is mandatory
that you guys has to quit all these
Facebook whatsapp and whatever it may be
things which are deviating you so next
is emotionally because like I feel like
more than 90 percentage of failures in
the examination or during the
preparation is due to emotional
emotional loss or emotional imbalance so
I want you guys to be emotionally more
strong for these 28 days if you have
emotional disturbance for these 28 days
first thing you can do is like this keep
a pause and just tell to yourself that
okay these emotions will be forever for
us just keep a pause I'll think about
this emotion after 28 days because your
career is more important than this
emotion because emotion can be carried
to the next level or not we don't know
but the carrier is going to be carried
for the next level what you are going to
be is what you are doing right now
emotion yes it can be carried to the
next level but we are not sure that this
emotion is going to be forever or not so
probably I want you guys to give a pause
don't break the emotions but Cuba passe
once you are done with this 28 days
after John 7 you can recap and restart
your emotions in a magnified way no no
no issues with emotions but keep it boss
10 to yourself okay these 20 ideas are
important for me and I will be focusing
more on the preparation I'll just keep
it pause once I'm done with this 28 days
any sort of disturbance in your
relationships any sort of disturbance in
your family affairs any sort of
disturbance anywhere emotionally you
just turn to the person on the other
side guys please wait for this John 7
ones answer on this done we are going to
be solved renegotiate whatever can be
done will do for this please leave me
for these 28 days because these 28 days
are going to be very very very important
part of my life right that's true maybe
you can you can tell this word any
individual on earth because I feel like
we are more important than anything all
that at present at least so the next
thing is doubt how the things are going
ahead right because you said like there
was a ping from one of two of my
students like you said to do a busy
purpose you said to do mock exams you
are keeping some practice exams you
asked me to do dental pulse you asked me
to do pp books you are asking me to do
group stuff I'm not able to manage all
these things in the limited amount of
time or my brain is not that huge enough
to feed all this stuff so this is one of
the comment that is thrown to me by one
of my dear student yes he's very
important right so she she asked me like
I'll stick either to dental pulse AAPC
and marks or an optional for me I'll go
with this practice papers people books
and group discussion what should I go
you select me one of these generally
Pappa setter he is to give four options
and ask us to select one but my student
has given two options and asked me to
select one always focusing smart
preparation
is more important right smartness is
more important in the preparation and
for exams like need a balanced
preparation is more important these are
the two two things that are going to
play an a very important role in your
exam because I know basics or else like
a random statement given by the aspirant
is I know of clinicals so I will study
more basics because I want to score more
in basics but revising the clinicals is
more important so neat is a balanced
preparation where each and every subject
is given some sort of importance
according to the blueprint so you need
to have a balanced preparation right so
that's what this is yeah go do MCQs just
200 or MCQs per every day from now it's
very easy to complete all the 17-years
papers just question and answer question
answered
I feel like hardly it's going to take
one hour because you guys have really
working hard from past one year and
majority of them seek you software out
of this 200 but well-known I think that
probably 180 160 or MCQs are clearly
known to you you'd you can directly go
and you can directly pick the right
answer that's not an issue it's going to
exist one hour more examinations on the
weekend so that's not an issue in the
week practice papers every day one
practice paper so it's going to take one
hour PP books every day one our dental
pulse try to give your best time group
discussion I think like if you have time
it's better to participate in the group
discussion if you don't have time you
can just have a look at the group
discussion I feel like group discussion
is going to take one hour like if you're
not able to manage time divide your
schedule one two three four five six
okay let me get as seven eight nine ten
so I feel like majority of you guys have
working to 12 to 14 hours per day so you
have around 10 tasks so you are given
one hour and 20 minutes so one hour 10
minutes for each task or one hour 20
minutes for each task let's let's make
it as one an hour so you divide
accordingly
AAPG one over try to finish it off as
fast as possible can extend to one to
one and half hour so once that one and
half hour is done at whatever point you
are leave it and start the next task
practice paper that is a must given try
to finish it in one and one and half
hour if it is not extended leave that at
that point just more PP books one and
half hour
don't don't keep it ask one other favor
you are going to spend with the PP books
let it be whatever extent it is done
okay done let's say you start with the
next pace pulse yes today you have to do
10 dental materials that's the task
given but if you can't you try to leave
it at that point
make a note ok dental pulse dental
materials I have done up to this point
in the in the time of duration like more
loss 10 to 15 days you have time so at
that time if you want to start dental
pulse you start with the left over thing
once you're done with the left other
thing just have a quick recap our the
things which are already done so this is
what you should not choose like I'll go
with this I'll go with that I'll you
have to do everything but make a note up
to what extent you are doing the things
and once you have time like we'll have
like 12 to 13 days extra time in the
last 13 days where you will focus on
mock exams apart from that you are going
to have a quick recap right so at that
point you just go with the leftover
thing and just try to recap the thing
which is already done so this is this is
what being smart this is how you need to
balance all the mandatory things this is
how you are going in a multi-directional
way preparation okay multi-directional
everywhere you are trying to prepare
coming back to the same point again
recapping things coming back to the same
point recapping things coming back
recapping coming back so you're doing a
good job so guys being smart is more
important means you need to finish off
the things fast right smartness is
nothing but foreign aspirants Martin is
nothing but dude I'm going to give one
day time please try to revise ortho yes
sir I'm ready Duda I am going to give 12
first time please try to recap Arthur
I'm ready
six hours or the ready two hours or Thor
ID one hour or 30 30 minutes Arthur at
it so this is what smart preparation as
time is going off you should identify
where what are the things that you need
to focus on for example if it is an
endodontic s' if you asked me to revise
in 30 minutes you know where I'm going
to focus on I'm going to focus on the
new miracles I'm going to focus on the
scientist names I'm going to focus on
the rotary files dimensions color
codings of files few classifications
where I would confuse where I will be
confused much so these are the things
where I am going to focus on if the same
stuff is given for me to go ahead with
an autumn II half an hour preparation
I'll be focusing more on the four amines
more on the nose more on the muzzles
I'll try to recap the things which are
present at the end of the rental
synopsis I'll try to finish as much as
you notice as possible because majority
of stuff branches nose muscles for
amines everything will be covered so
this is what smartness will require
right now because covering each and
everything right now
may be difficult may be possible for few
individuals or super super humans but
may be difficult for majority of us so
we need to identify okay this is the
babe where this is where I I just go
along I feel like I'm in confident
memory based stuff I'll go recap the
things and come back so same goes with
like once you're done with the mock exam
we are going to have an equal
distribution you can just think or okay
this is the way place I'm just confused
okay I'm confused in the pedo part there
are few questions on the reflexes where
I went wrong just go back have a look
quickly recover the reflex
other related reflexes questions in the
dental bells or the ordering of pp books
or in your note says just go back and
have it okay community dentistry is the
place where I lost majority of my MCQs
result when most probable questions
where I was lost his indexes just go
back half an hour time indexes this have
a quick recap try to solve the indexes
that is present in the pulse or your PP
books or your wherever you like just
identify the topic because 240 marks
examination is going to cover more than
22 to 24 art subjects right so apart
from this it's going to cover 240 areas
where you need to focus on you you have
to catch the thing like okay this is the
way I lost and I'm secure I'm not
perfect with this topic go back look or
the topic that is a balance preparation
like okay out of 14 I'm sick use of
general a not I went wrong in 6m seekers
and focusing of 6m seekers like majority
of mcq say I went wrong is embryology so
just go back see the landmarks of
embryology see the questions of
embryology try to have a good recap
spent half an hour to one hour time just
come back this is how you need to manage
the things like once you're going with
the maquis examinations identify the
topic where you are not perfect spend at
least like 1/2 an hour 30 minutes with
half an hour to one hour with the topic
and just go means for example if you are
doing embryology during the last 15 days
of the preparation means a few topics of
embryology means it's not embryology
because embryology out of these 14
questions you went wrong in three
questions so means it is general anatomy
you are trying to complete general and
not to me unknown stuff or your web
stuff where you're in confident means
you're doing all general path or general
an automation sorry in general anatomy
in a deal so this is how you need to
plan and this is how you need to manage
your brain smartly by saying like rest
all the things I'm a bit good I feel
like I'm having low scores in this
general
embryologists so I'm just focusing on it
biochemistry out of seven March she went
wrong in two MCQs and probably the two
MCQs are related to the carbohydrate
metabolism just go back have a cute
recap of carbohydrate metabolism for at
least like one hour so you're done with
biochem so you're moving to the next
subject so this is how you need to plan
guys telling yourself that okay I am
just you're just focusing for example
for example if your pulse or the whole
material complete material what you are
doing from the day one of MDS conquer
till date material you have condensed
and someone God has came and given a
word to you guys I have underlined all
the things where you are in confident
where these stuff are memory-based
you just both these stuff and your
preparation is done so that's what we
are doing right that's what we are doing
we are just focusing on the thing where
we are in confident where we are not
perfect then we went wrong so we're just
seeing that there's a confidence thing
what we can do right now and that's the
best thing what we have right now in our
hand guys so 27 days it's your life and
you need to think
don't-don't-don't come out with an
answer like whether I can make this
whether I can do this or not
okay every person who is preparing right
now is just a human trying to manage the
things in a smarter way
trying to work hard and trying to give
their best everyone is doing this if you
are not if you are lazy enough if you
are not confident enough that's not
right we have started this journey
exactly
more than one year I can see many
interns like when when we are when we
used to be an internship I know that we
used to enjoy a lot but I know many
conkers many interns many repeaters I
know guys we have faced so many issues
financially we are not perfect so we are
not affecting to go to metropolitan
cities to have a - often coaching center
and majority of us are girls and our
parents may not allow you to move far to
have a decent preparation majority of us
are housewives taking care of children
taking care of a loss taking care of
many other things and trying to balance
the preparation majority of your
clinicians managing the patients in the
morning hours finding of time and
preparing majority of you are odd
batching terms for struggling hard hard
to get through the entrance measure - a
few has many financial issues and many
questions thrown by the society family
relatives whether you can make this
whether you have to make this why you're
doing this why you're wasting your time
you can't do this
majority of questions majority of
questions and of course people who
always drag us from the success maybe
few people they call as enemies and few
people they are not happy with the
success and they will always try to pull
you back from the success humilate you
make you in confident insecure and many
things happen you are not capable enough
to get into GDC you are not capable
enough to qualify this entrance while
you're preparing you have not cleared
your periods in the stimulate in the
stipulated time while you're preparing
for this entrance you are incapable
you're imperfect many humiliating words
that going to pull you from success and
many many such things thrown by the
society relators why are doing these
girls some lots of idiotic questions the
answer is your result the answer is your
capability the answer is your work the
answer is in this 28 days do you decide
Society is going to throw so many things
on you and I want you guys to prepare
the best answer for the society for your
relatives for your family for your
friends for your enemies the best answer
should be on John 31st and you have to
give your best on Jan 7th for that you
need to take out your best decide what
you are going to you so Jan 7th
is your dead day so your second life is
going to jail start after Johnson so
makers should make sure that your life
should turn before Jan 7th and after Jan
7th so I don't know what you are going
to plan I don't know what you are going
to give best out of you I don't know how
much time you are going to work I don't
know whether you're sleep or whether you
are awake or whether you do whatever
nonsense you want but your life should
be before Jan 7th and after Jan 7th 2018
make note this success is just for you
and MDS conquer is going to be a part of
this all the best
just rock it and the strategy plan of
action or the suggestions or anything
probably this is for MDS conquer
students if any XY jet people want to
follow you can take a move love you all
all the best
keep working hard because hard work in a
smarter direction with MDS conquer is
going to pay you back our first year GDC
count is 64
sorry 26 and the second year it moves to
48 and now it's all in your hand thank
you take care bye signing off
you
