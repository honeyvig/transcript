ethical hacking is all about using your
skills for good and helping to protect
systems and data from cyber threats the
first thing is basic education first
things first you need to finish high
school and during High School try to
focus on subjects like mathematics
computer science and it next is your
higher education okay so after high
school try to go for the higher
education
so as we all know that After High School
consider pursuing a degree in computer
science information technology or cyber
security now you might be wondering do I
really need a degree well a degree can
definitely help it gives you a solid
foundation and is often preferred by
employers however it's not the only way
to become an ethical hacker if you're
passionate and committed you can learn
the necessary skills on your own many
successful hackers have taken this
self-taught route but remember it's just
not not about the degree it's about the
skills and knowledge you gain along the
way employers are looking for people who
can solve problems and think creatively
whether they have a degree or not so I
