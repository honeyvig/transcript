hi I'm good anyone at all so now I'm
going to discuss about one of the most
complicated system that is complementary
system so this video can be used not
only in the exam point of view yeah hi
everyone so now I'm going to discuss
about one of the most important topic in
microbiology most of you feel it is a
complicated system okay
so let's talk about the details in the
complementary system so this video is is
going to be very useful for all the
students particularly the second-year
birria students for the university exams
and followed by the first year
MDS students for their basics example
there are few departments in which this
question is again a most commonly asked
question and of course it is very very
important in a need or aims or any of
these pzn transport of it so basically
the first important aspect that we have
to know
about this is what is the use of this
okay what is the use so regularly a
body's contains this complimentary
system in an inactive form and this
complementary system will get activated
whenever an antigen that is entering
into the body for example there is an
infection so there will be an entrance
of this antigen into the body so it's
going to react with antibody so this
antigen-antibody reaction gives rise to
the formation of antigen-antibody
complex so to protect the body from the
infection this complementary system is
going to come and add and it's going to
lyse the antigen that is that has
already entered into the body okay so
this is what the basic idea of
complement system means you eye
everyone has complement system so when
it's going to ACTU means whenever an
antigen that entered into the body this
system is going to get activated okay so
what happens so what happens in this is
is very simple and coming to the
activation of this complement system
okay there are three complement systems
according to the textbook the first one
is called as classical the second one is
alternative and the next one that is the
last one is lectin pathway so we have
three pathways of complement system one
is classical second one is alternative
and third one is LinkedIn mediated
pathways so what is the advantage of
classical why it is called as classical
means because it is first identified I
think the classical is the one which is
first identified and it is more recently
with lots of modifications lots of
modifications are done in the classic
pathway and the classic pathway is
mainly concerned with specific active
immunity whereas your alternate and
lectin mediated are more primitive ones
means mold old ones no modifications
were done and most of these are dealing
with nonspecific initate immunities so
your classic is mainly concerned with
specific active immunity whereas your
lectin and alternative are mainly
concerned with a nonspecific initate
immunity so this is what first basics
that you have to learn about the classic
alternative and the letter so the next
one is what is classic
so this presentation was made as simple
as possible first to understand the
basics okay then you can go for the
deeper levels if it is required
okay so first is classic what classic
seems to be very cool okay so classic is
mainly concerned with the most commonly
asked question is classic complement
system pathway is mainly concerned with
which other immunoglobulins okay the
answer is IgG and IgM you can remember
it as GM okay my my code for this is
general manager is classic so classic
system is mainly concerned with IgG and
IgM out of these two the most important
one is IgM if you have both the options
go for ICM as the better option IgM is
more oriented to the classic both as
well as IgG and Isaiah are mainly
concerned if you want you can add two
important MC cues or two important
points here
IgM is the largest largest among all the
immunoglobulins and IgG is the it
occupies the maximum concentration in
the list of immunoglobulins at maximum
is IG G and size is larger and IgM so
both this IgG IgM that is general
manager is classic are mainly concerned
with the classic complementary system
pathway so what happens in the classic
complement system pathway is already
discussed for a complement system to get
activated there should be someone should
enter into the body that someone is
called as antigen so antigen once enters
into the body our body will produce
antibodies so antigen antibody leads to
the formation of antigen-antibody
complex so body has is ready with the
antigen antibody conflicts so
antigen-antibody complex is going to
converts evil okay convert c12 activated
Sivan scientist and antibody complex has
converted c12 activated Siva
so activated Siwon is going to add to c4
whenever the c4 is activated c4 is going
to split into C for a and c4 be okay
C for a and C for B in which the c4a a
far away simply to remember a far away
it goes away
C for a it goes away and the c-4 B is
moving to the next level to get
activation of C two eigen C 2 is going
to split into C to a and C to B okay
where this c4 b c 4b is going to combine
with c to a okay it's going to combine
with C to a and it forms c4 B and C to a
complex you can call it simple as a
binary complex because it has two
molecules in it so this C for a this C
for a is going to activate C 3 again C 3
is going to split into c3a and c3b hope
you are clear with the classical one
classical one is mainly concerned with
IgA sorry IgG and IgM mainly concerned
with IgM whenever the antigen antibody
enters it reacts to form a complex which
is going to activate c1 c1 is going to
activate c4 c4 is going to split it into
a and B a goes away whereas B is going
to activate C 2 and C 2 is going to
split into C 2 AC to be therefore c4 B
and C to a combines to form a complex
called as a binary complex which is
going
to activate the Sebring okay the main
purpose of the classical one is to
activate seated so the second one we are
done with a first one so we are going
with the second one the second one is
alternate the second one is alternate
pathway so in this alternate pathway the
activation is mainly done by the either
endotoxin so endotoxin is going to help
in the activation or your IG okay so
either endotoxin or Isaiah because we
have already discussed that classical is
mainly concerned with IGM and igg
whereas your alternate is mainly
concerned with immunoglobin IgA or the
endotoxin so this endotoxin is going to
activate your c3 and the factor B so
it's going to activate c3 and factor B
so once this endotoxin IgA are going to
activate these two components these two
components has already said they are
going to split factor B is going to
split into factor B a and factor B B
similarly C 3 is going to split into c3a
and c3b so what's going to happen so the
molecules c3b and factor B B they
combine to form a binary molecule called
as C 3 b and b b so this C 3 B and BB
leads to the
breakage of c3 because the ultimate goal
of any complement system any type of
complement system lead to the breakdown
of c3 we have already discussed the
classical one then product of the
classical one is the breakdown of cedar
the end product of alternate is also the
breakdown of c3
so the next one is the third one what is
the third one so we have already
discussed the classical we have
discussed the alternate pathway and the
third one is LinkedIn mediated or
LinkedIn pasta okay so what is this a
one-point about you need to learn about
one point related to the lectin pathway
lectin is the one that's going to
activate the complement system binding
to Manos
residuals okay there binds to Manos
procedures these Manos residuals will
present on the surface of bacteria so
whenever the bacteria enters it's going
to detect that manners residuals which
are present on the surface of the the
bacterial cell wall and this is going to
come into action so that's the reason
why it is called as MB liquid so it is
called as MB liquid so this MB lectin is
going to bind to the bacterial cell
surface so you have your bacteria the
bacteria has the cell surface on the
cell surface you're going to have this
manners residuals
so this MB lectin is going to bond or
attach to the manners residuals which
are present on the surface of bacteria
if you want you can write down the names
of these bacteria that is the bacteria
Salmonella typhi na Syria Listeria
Cryptococcus and you can add a note
about the fungus also that is canidius
okay so all these they contain this
manners residuals on the surface so
whenever these going to come into action
the am BL is going to activate so once
this activation is done this MBL is
going to lead to the activation of a
specific protein
okay there are a few specific proteases
like ma SP one and two which are present
in the body so these are going to get
activated these are specific proteases
so this is in turn going to activate the
Siva this is already discussed the c1 is
going to activate in the classical
system the first one similar to that the
c1 is going to get activated once c1 is
going to get activated similar like your
classical one the c1 is going to
activate c4 which is going to release
into the sea for a and C for B the c-4
is going to activate the next one that
is C to the C 2 is going to activate the
C 2 a and C 2 B so overall there will be
formation of one binary complex that is
c4 B 2 a which leads to the breakdown of
C 3 the target of us is breakdown of C 3
so the first classical system the target
is breakdown of C 3 alternate system the
target is breakdown of C 3 and last one
is the lectin pathway even the end
product of lectin pathway is the
breakdown of C 3 so now we are going to
learn the common complement system means
this is common for everything what we
have learned is the difference between 1
2 & 3 but now it is combined means all
the classical one the alternate one and
lectin one then product of all is C 3 C
3 C 3 now we have C 3 in all this so we
are going to learn what is going to
happen to see three so we are with an
end product of C 3 or activation of C 3
or breakdown or C 3 and C 3 is going to
break into c3a and c3b so we got the end
product the end product is leading to
the breakdown of
c3a and c3b so c3b
a goes away simply to remember you can
remember a will go up in so the next one
is the c3 B is going to activate the
breakdown of c5 so similarly the sefa is
going to break into C Phi a and C Phi B
so as already discussed a goes away so
what is the job of C Phi B C Phi B is
going to activate C Phi B is going to
call all the friends okay so until now
the c1 has activated c4 c4 has activated
c2 c2 has activated c3 c3 has activated
c5 so they have discussed all the
complement components as discussed yeah
we are getting bored one activating
other other activating other so the time
is running off so c5 let's call everyone
okay so see if I has called everyone
whoever are there whoever are involved
to help the body please do come so the
c5 now has called c6 called c7 called c8
and called c9 okay all these people that
combine to form a beautiful complex
called as it is called as c5 b 9 complex
okay this is called as c5 b 9 complex or
you can simply write down it as c5 b 6 7
8 9 complex so this complex is given a
beautiful terminology called as ma si
MEAC is nothing but memory n attack
complex so what do you have so you have
your antigen now the complement system
has given MSE so a Macy's memory and
attack complex so it's going to convert
the antigen into something like this
it's going to split or it's going to
break the membrane and finally this MEAC
is going to help in lysis so this is
what basically the complement system
okay so you have classical which is
mediated by IgG sorry IgG IgM
an alternate which is mediated by IgA
and endotoxins and the last one is
leaking mediated the target of all these
three complement system is origin of c3
so what c3 is going to do c3 is going to
activate c5 c phi is going to call all
the friends and form a complex the
complex is called as MEAC complex MHC
complex leads to the breakdown of
antigen that is the lysis of antigen ok
so this is what the complement system is
all about ok so what happens like we
have so many proteins that we have
discussed in the complement system that
is the C 1 C 2 C 4 C 5 C 3 6 7 CH c 9
and everything so these are called as
complement proteins proteins which helps
in the sequence of occurrence of the
complement system so there is something
like there few diseases which are caused
due to the deficiency of the proteins so
it's better we split the proteins first
of all before we are talking about the
deficiencies it's better we split the
proteins we speed the proteins into
early proteins mid proteins late
protease early proteins are the first
one what are they
c1 activated c2 c4 the mid protein is
the goal of all the complement system is
to activate the c3 and the last one is
the late proteins are c5 c6 c7 and c8
clear so what is going to happen if
there is a deficiency of early proteins
so whenever there is a deficiency of
early proteins these early proteins are
nothing but C 1 C 2 and C 4 there will
be high chances of occurrence of
autoimmune diseases so there is high
chances of occurrence of autoimmune
diseases and the best example is SLE
many autoimmune diseases are mainly
concerned with the activation or the
deficiency of the
we produce that is c1 c2 and c4 so next
one is the mid proteins so whenever
there is a deficiency of mid protein the
mid protein is nothing but C 3 so
whenever there is a deficiency of mid
protein there is high chances of
occurrence of a bacterial acute
bacterial infections or pyogenic
infections okay the next one is the
deficiency of the late proteins what are
these late proteins the late proteins up
5 6 7 8
yes of course 9 also right so whenever
there is a deficiency of recurrence of
late proteins and most commonly it may
lead to the infections of gram-negative
bacteria mostly gram-negative
diplococcus and it may cause an
infection with toxoplasmosis okay right
so these are the mainly concerned
whenever you have a deficiency of any of
any of these for example C is v is
activated v is going to call 6 7 8 and 9
so when you calling the left over people
few of you may be option like for
example 6 may be absent
6 may not be interested or 7 may not be
interested ok 6 may not be interested or
7 may not be interested alright may not
be interested or 9 may not be interested
even if one of these complement system
is absent for example if there is an
absence of C 9 part c 8 only c 9 or only
see it even then there is no problem
because the rest of the people can form
the complex and this complex is going to
act as an AC and this M AC is going to
break or lead to the lysis of your
particular antigen that has entered I
hope you are clear I'm just going to
recap it again and again you need to
practice this again and again okay so we
are clear with the classical one the
classical one is basically is associated
with GM general manager and mainly
concerned with M the goal is to activate
C 3 and the alternate
okay so the alternate one starts with a
neurotoxin and IGA so endotoxin
and IgA are going to activate or
activate the c3 and factor B so form a
binary complex which is going to lead to
the breakdown of c3 and the last one
pathways lectin pathway which is mainly
concerned with MB Lipton so it's going
to bind onto the surface of few bacteria
and it's going to activate mas p1 and p2
further it's going to activate c1 c1 is
going to activate c4 c4 is going to
activate see to see through lead to the
breakdown of c3 so you got c3 in all the
systems that is classical alternate and
lick them so c3 is going to break down
into C 3 a B it's going to activate C
Phi C Phi is going to call all the
friends and form Mac so Mac is going to
cause the lysis and your proteins are
divided into three types early mid and
late early autoimmune diseases mid
bacterial or pyogenic infections late is
gram-negative bacteria toxoplasmosis
even if there is a deficiency of any of
these late late okay that is the end end
part like 7c 9 or c8 there is no problem
the rest of the people are going to form
this MEAC and that mes is going to break
the protein so they break this antigen
and chords the lysis is done for now all
the best
study well guys signing off dr. Shrikant
