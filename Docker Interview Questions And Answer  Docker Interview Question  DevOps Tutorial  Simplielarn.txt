link is mentioned in the description box
so guys let's start with Docker
interview questions and answers so guys
let's start with our first question that
is what is
Docker so guys Docker is a conization
platform that allows developers to
package applications and their
dependencies into standardized units
called as containers very basic question
and I hope so you would be aware of this
one now let's move on to our second
question that is how does Docker differs
from virtual machines kind of tricky but
still you should have an idea of this
and the answer to the same question is
like what happens unlike virtual
machines which require a hypervisor to
run multiple operating systems into
single physical machine the docker
containers shares the host of its
operating system kernel and only contain
the application and its dependencies and
that's how it differs from virtual
machine I hope so you would have got an
idea regarding the same now let us move
to our third question the third question
is explain the difference between Docker
image and Docker container so guys very
basic question and the answer to the
same is a Docker image is a template for
creating Docker containers it's a red
only temp temp plate with instructions
for creating Docker container Docker
container is a runnable instance of
Docker image so guys our next question
is how do you create a Docker image so
guys Docker images are typically created
using a Docker file which contains a set
of instructions for building the image
the docker build command is then used to
build the image from Docker file so in
this way you create a docka image so
we'll move to the next question which is
related to the next one and and that is
what is a Docker file so guys a Docker
file is a text file that contains
instructions for building a Docker image
it includes commands such as from run
copy Expose and CMD I hope so you would
have got an idea regarding the same now
let us move on to the next question that
is explain the docker run command and
what it is so guys if we talk about the
docker run command it is basically used
to create and start a Docker container
based on the docker image it can also be
used to specify runtime options such as
environment variables network settings
and volume mounts I hope so you would
have got an idea regarding it now let us
move to the next question that is what
is Docker Hub so guys if we talk about
Docker Hub Docker Hub is a cloud-based
registry service that basically allows
users to store and share Docker images
it provides public and private
repositories for storing images as well
as an integration with other services
such as GitHub and bid bucket very basic
question now let us move on to the next
question that is how do you publish a
Docker image from Docker her so guys if
we talk about it to publish a Docker
image to a Docker Hub you first need to
tag that image with your Docker Hub
username and the repository name using
the docker tag command it's very
important and remember this and then you
have to push the image to the docker hub
using the docker push command so it was
pretty simple now let us move on to the
next question that is what are Docker
volumes so guys if we talk about what
are Docker volumes so Docker volumes are
a way to persist data generated and used
by Docker containers the basically allow
data to be stored outside the containers
writable layer making it possible to
share the data between containers and
purist data even if the container is
stopped or deleted very simple these are
some of the basic concepts that you will
find on Docker documentation so whenever
you are preparing for your interview
I'll advise you to go thoroughly to the
official documentation of the docker it
really helps most of the questions like
scenario based questions coding based
questions are generally asked from there
now let us move to the next question
it's a pretty interesting one so it is
basically asked from the architecture
and the question is what is Docker demon
so guys Docker demon often referred to
as Docker is a background service that
manages Docker objects such as images
containers networks and volumes it runs
on the host operating systems and
handles request from Docker engine CLI
or the other Docker client via do Docker
API that is so in this command can you
explain the significance of I flag T
flag and Docker run it12 /bin/bash so
this is our Command and the interviewer
is asking you to explain the
significance of I andt flag okay so
basically the I flag stands for
interactive so whenever you use this
Flags it keeps the standard input open
even if not attached essentially it
allows you to interact with the
containers process enables you to
provide input to the commands running
inside the container and with respect to
the T flag if we talk about then T
stands for pseudo TTY T flag stands for
pseudo TTY it basically allocates a suro
terminal for the container allowing you
to see the command prompt and providing
a more shell-like interface for
interaction so without a t flag uh you
basically wouldn't get a nicely form
terminal prompt and your interaction
with a container might also not feel as
natural so this is a significance of I
flag and T flag now let us move on to
the next question what is the difference
between ADD and copy in a Docker file
very basic question so guys if we talk
about add and copy they basically both
are used to copy files into the docker
image but add additional functionality
okay so what does add do it can
basically copy files from remote URLs
decompress the files and automatically
set the file
permissions very easy now let us move on
to the next question that
is what is the difference between CMD
and entry point in a Docker file so guys
if we talk about CMD CMD specifies the
default command to run when a container
is started while entry point specifies
the command to run when the container is
started and also additional arguments to
be passed to the commands so this was
all about CMD and entry point so guys
our next question is what is Docker
compose so guys Docker compose is
basically a tool for defining and
running multi-container Docker
applications it allows basically
developers to use the yml file to define
the services and also networks and
volumes so that's a very basic
definition of Docker compos so let us
move to our next question that's is so
when a container exist is it possible
for you to lose a data like very basic
question but the answer to the same is
no it's not possible to lose any data as
long as the container exist like if you
delete then all the data will be lost so
that's the overall scenario for this
question it's a very kind of a tricky
question so just remember it now let us
move to the next question so next
question is what is the difference
between logging and D demon logging so
very frequently Asked question guys so
container logging and Demon logging
refer to the different aspects of login
within the docker ecosystem if I talk
about the container logging container
logging refers to the logging performed
by applications running inside Docker
containers whereas each container has
its own isolated environment and it can
generate its own logs just like any
other applications whereas container
login captures the output which is SD
out standard output and STD D of the
process running inside the container by
default this output is captured by
Docker and can be accessed using
commands like Docker logs so this was
related to container loging now if we
talk about demon loging guys so guys
demon login refers to the login
performed by Docker demon itself the
docker demon is responsible for managing
containers images networks and volumes
on the host system demon login captures
the events related to docker's
operations such as container creation
container start stop image pull push
Network creation and so on and so forth
so that's what the basic difference
between container logging and Demon
logging now let us move to the next
question does Docker Provide support for
IPv6 very interesting question guys so
if you are aware with the documentation
you will definitely answer this question
yes Docker does have some support for
IPv6 but uh like as per as my knowledge
uh it has become quite comprehensive and
it's maturing as its support for ipv4 so
that's what in the process right now let
us move to the next question and this is
related to scaling so the question is
how do you scale Docker horizontally so
guys horizontally scaling in Docker
involves running multiple instances of a
service across multiple Docker
containers to distribute the workload
and improve performance availability and
fall tolerance and here you can
basically uh scale it so first one is
using Docker swarm and kubernetes so
what happens uh using Docker Sor and
cuetes it happens a process of container
orchestration so these platforms provide
a built-in support for horizontal
scaling they allow you to Define desired
replica counts for the services and also
the orchestration platform manages the
deployment and scaling of the containers
automatically like what kubernetes does
in this scenario
so this is one way uh there can be
multiple way so have an open eye
regarding this question it can be asked
in the interview so guys our next
question is how does CMD and entry point
differs in a Docker file so guys it's a
very interesting question and kind of
frequently asked so guys use entry point
instructions when building an executable
Docker image using commands that always
need to be executed and you are going to
use CMD instructions when you need an
additional set of arguments that can act
as a default instructions until there is
explicit command line usage when Docker
containers run so that's what the basic
difference between entry point and CMD
now let us move to the next question
that is what is the purpose of volumes
in Docker with a theoretical question so
guys in Docker volumes provide a way to
persist and share data between
containers and the docker host they have
several purposes like if I talk about
first is a persistent data storage then
sharing data between the containers
performing optimization performance
optimization integration with external
storage systems and many more so this is
a purpose of volumes in Docker now let
us move to the next question that is
what is the difference between Docker
restart policies no on failure and
always very interesting question so guys
if I talk about no no means no automatic
restart containers remain stopped after
exit like if I talk about on failure
here automatically restarts the
container if it exist with a non-zero
exist status like there will be a
specified number of attempts and in the
case of always it automatically restarts
a container regardless of the exit
status so that's what the difference
between all of these policies are no on
failure and always please take a note of
this question this is kind of very
important now let us move to the next
question that is what is a difference
between Docker container and kubernetes
spt so guys Docker container is a
lightweight Standalone and executable
package that contains everything needed
to run a piece of software including
code runtime system tools and libraries
it runs a single Docker host in a
managed using Docker engine if I talk
about kubernetes sports it is a higher
level abstraction that can contain one
or more darker containers along with
shared storage network resources and
configuration settings it represents the
smallest Deployable unit in the
kubernetes and it also provides an
environment for running containers so
that's what the difference between the
docker container and kubernetes B is now
let us move to the next question that is
how do you secure Docker containers very
interesting question and kind of a
practical question so guys securing a
docka containers involves several steps
so it's a combination of best practices
and security measur
to protect the containerized
applications and underlying
infrastructure here are some of the key
strategies first use the official images
utilize official Docker images from
trusted sources as they are regularly
updated and maintained within the
security patches the next one is
container image scanning employ
container image scanning tools to
identify vulnerabilities and malware in
Docker image before deployment third one
you can reduce attack surface minimize
the attack surface by removing
unnecessary components limiting
Privileges and using minimal base images
next one is container isolation you're
going to utilize container isolation
mechanisms like name spaces c groups to
restrict container access to the host
system you can also use secure
configuration like configure Docker
demon and containers with the best
security practices such as using least
privilege disabling unnecessary features
and also enabling Security Options like
CMP and app AR SLS Linux so these were
some of the ways in which you can secure
Docker containers now let us move to the
next one that is can you tell me some of
the best practices for using Docker in
the production environment so this is
one of the Practical questions that has
been asked most frequently so guys the
answer for this question is like using
Docker in a production environment
requires careful planning and adherence
to the best practices to ensure
reliability scalability and security the
first practice would be use official
images utilize official Docker images
from trusted sources as they are
regularly updated and maintained with
security batches next one is optimize
container images minimize image size by
removing unnecessary dependencies using
multi-stage builds optimize layer
caching to improve deployment speed and
reduce resource consumption third one is
Implement container orchestration use
container orchestration platforms like
like cuberes or Docker SW to manage
containerized applications automate
deployments and Achieve High
availability and scalability fourth one
you can automate builds and deployments
Implement cicd pipelines to automate the
build testing and deployment of Docker
images ensuring consistency and
reliability in production environment
and finally you can monitor
containerized applications so these were
some of the best practices that you can
follow while using docker in a
production environment now let us move
to the next question that is how do you
automate deployments of Docker
containers so guys automating the
deployment of Docker container involves
using cicd means continuous integration
and continuous deployment pipelines to
streamline the process of building
testing and deploying containerized
applications so first one is you can use
Version Control Store the application
code and Docker configuration in Version
Control Systems like git uh have a cicd
pipeline setup set up a cicd pipeline
using platforms like genkins klab or
GitHub actions configure the pipelines
to trigger on code commits or pull
request to the Version Control
repository third one is build Docker
images use Docker files to define the
container images for your application
configure the cicd pipelines to build
Docker images automatically whenever
changes are pushed to the repository use
tools like Docker build kit or canico
for building Docker images in cicd
environment so in this way you can
automate the deployment of Docker
containers now let us move to the next
question that is how do you perform
rolling updates in doas so guys
performing rolling updates in doas SW
involves updating services in a swarm
cluster without causing downtime or
service disruption the first one is you
have to update service definition modify
the service definition to specify the
updated Docker image version or any
other configuration changes which you
are going through you can update the
service definition using the docker
service update command or by modifying
the docker compos file used to deploy
the service second one is rolling update
strategy specify the rolling update
strategy to control how swamp performs
and the update the rolling update
strategy defines parameters such as
number of parallel tasks and the delay
between the updates common rolling
update strategies include parallelism
delay failure action for example guys
you can specify a rolling update
strategy within parallelism of Two And
Delay of 10 seconds using the update
parallelism and update delay Flags very
easy so this was all about how you can
perform rolling updates now let us move
to the next question so guys our next
question is what is Docker content trust
so guys Docker content trust is a
security feature of Docker that provides
cryptographic verification of image
integrity and authenticity it ensures
that only verified and signed Docker
images are pulled and run on Docker host
so guys let's move to the next question
that is how do you configure automatic
container restarts in Docker so guys
answer to the same is to configure
automatic container it starts in Docker
use the double start flag when running
the container is specifying the desired
restart policy your option can include
no for automatic starts on failure to
restart container and that exit with a
non-zero status and you can also use
always to restart the containers
regardless of the exit status for
example there's a command like Docker
run/ restart equals to always and your
container name which can be my container
so in this command it sets a container
to automatically and it restarts always
so this was the answer to this question
now let us move on to the next question
that is how do you configure custom log
driver in Docker very very good question
so guys to configure a custom loging
driver in Docker you can follow the
steps first one is choose a login driver
select the custom login driver
compatible with Docker like uh you can
use plunk and CIS log next one is update
Docker demon configuration edit or
create the docker demon configuration
file then add a log driver key with the
value set to the name of the custom
logging driver you can optionally
configure the Ed additional logging
driver Options under the log Ops key so
in this way you can do it now let us
move on to the next question that is how
do you manage secrets in dockerized
application so guys to manage secrets in
dockerized applications use Docker
built-in secret management or external
tools like Hashi cor VA so in this way
you can basically manage secrets in
dockerized applications these were some
of the theoretical questions that I've
asked you guys uh mostly were kind of
basic and now we'll move to the second
part of the question now in this series
what we are going to see mostly we are
going to figure out some of the scenario
and some of the file based questions so
guys as you can see I am using vs code
as my text editor so let us see what we
have all over here okay so guys as you
can see in this question uh it says Uh
there's a certain code written all over
here this is basically a Docker file so
it says use the official nodejs image as
a base image from node 14 uh then you
are setting up your directory all over
here you are copying the Json and you
are installing the uh npm package then
you are copying the rest of the
application you are exposing the port
3,000 and in order to run the nodejs
application this command is written now
some of the basic question I'm going to
start with this Docker file so your
interviewer can ask you questions like
explain the each line of the docker file
and its purpose so you can see I have
added the comments all over here and it
defines the purpose so like from note 14
uh this means that I'm using the
official note 14 version this image and
similarly all the other lines I have
added the code okay now let us move to
the second question uh what is the
purpose of workdir user slsrc /a so
basically as you can see all over here
it is setting up the directory in this
folder
now let us move to the third question
which it says why do we copy star Json
file separately from the rest of the
application code now this is a pretty
interesting question and your
interviewer can ask you something like
this based on your Docker file so guys
the answer for this question is we copy
package star. Json files separately to
take advantage of the dockal layers
caching mechanism so this basically
ensures that all the dependencies are
only re installed when the dependencies
change rather than on every code change
so that's why we are copying package
star. Json files so this is one of the
interesting question and it can be asked
so now it's a very basic question run
npm install uh why do we expose for 3000
in the docker file now let us see this
question so guys exposing 3,000 informs
Docker that a container listens on the
port 3,000 which allows Docker basically
to map that port to the host machine
when we are running the container and
finally uh it says what is the
significance of command node app.js so
as I've told you it basically is a
command to run the nodejs application so
these are some of the basic question
that can be asked with respect to your
Docker file so you can have a check on
these one now let us move to the next
question now you can get an assignment
certain like this that write a Docker
file for a simple python flask
application and you have to ensure that
Docker file installs python copies the
application code into the Container
installs dependencies using pip and
exposes the port for flask application
to run on say Port 3000 so basically you
have just seen a template Docker file
now we want to write a python flask
application so guys let me show you the
answer for the same so similarly you're
going to start so from Python 3 .9 this
uh is your latest python which you want
use next process would be setting up
your directory so work di/ app then you
need to copy the current directory copy
do/ apppp install the flask and other
dependencies so you're going to install
it using pip so run pip install SL no
cache directory flask okay and then you
are going to expose your Port like to
5,000 to allow this communication to the
flask app and finally you going to run
this application it is very simple just
a template I have used earlier and in
this way your interviewer can give you
some Hands-On task to code a Docker file
now let us move to the next question I
hope so you would have got a brief idea
regarding this now similarly it says
write a Docker file that builds a custom
engine X image with SSL support now okay
let me do this now it says ensure that
docka file copies custom engine X
configuration files and SSL certificates
into the image and exposes ports 0 and
443 so what is this guys if I talk about
this basically it is asking for you to
build a custom engine X image okay and
it should have an SSL support now it
should copy the custom engine X
configuration files and also the SSL
certificates into the image and it has
given the specified ports to expose now
how would you T this so the answer to
the same is very basic start from from
enginex the latest version now you have
to copy the enginex configuration files
so say copyin x.f SLC engin xinx KF okay
then you would do copy default KF ETC
engine X kfd and default con so
basically you are writing this code to
copy the custom engine X configuration
files okay but these are the twostep
process and next was to copy the SSL
certificates so copy the SSL certificate
in the same fashion so there will be a
key and certificate now you have to
expose the port ET and 443 so for the
HTTP this would be an HTTP traffic and
this would be for https traffic so this
is how you are going to use it uh it's a
bit little bit tricky and complicated
but it's a template for you like if you
are getting certain question regarding
to use and engine X or you know to
expose two ports uh you can use this
template it works perfectly well now let
us move to the next question that is
implementing a multi-stage Docker build
for Java application so guys it says you
have to write a Docker file that
compiles the Java application using
Marvin in the first stage and then
copies the compiled jar file into a
lightweight runtime image in the second
stage so this is a two-stage process and
so let's start with the first one let's
figure out what is there in stage one so
it says that in stage one you have to
write a Docker file okay where it copies
the compiled jar file into the
lightweight image this is in the second
and in the first one it compiles a Java
application using the M okay very basic
so let me show you the template for this
one so there's a command for stage one
so you have to use mavin so I have
selected from mavin 3o this is a current
version and uh for open jdk 11 as
Builder so I'm building a Java
application using the Marvin I'm setting
up the directory all over here then I'm
copying the Marvin project descriptor
file so that will be a palm. XML file
involved here you're going to copy the
source code finally and you're going to
build the Java application so there is
mvn command for the same run nvn package
so this is your stage one process it's
very important for you to see this uh
it's also kind of a little bit tempting
question now in the second stage you
have to build the Java application with
Marvin run MN package so here you have
to create a lightweight runtime image so
I have used from open jdk 11 J slim set
up the working directory copy SL from
Builder slapp Target my applications.
jar so you have to copy the jar files
then you have to expose the given Port
so 880 is a port for the server and
finally run it to CMD Java jar and my
application. jar file so this is how we
approach to a problem in a multi-stage
process that are told to write in a
Docker file so as you practice more and
more questions like this guys I am
definitely sure that it will boost your
confidence to tackle questions like
these now let us move to the next
question which are scenario based
questions so guys uh first scenario
based question is like suppose there's a
Docker container which is unable to
communicate with another container on
the same Docker Network
but how would you diagnose and
troubleshoot network connectivity issues
between the containers it's a very
practical questions and there's a high
probability that your interviewer can
ask this so guys to troubleshoot and
resolve a Docker container start a
failure related to Containers entry
point script uh you should follow these
steps first one is check the container
logs okay so start checking by container
logs to see if there are any error
messages or any exceptions related to
the entry point script
you can use commands such as dockal logs
commands to view the containers logs
next one is inspect the container
configuration use Docker inspect command
to conspect the container's
configuration and verify the entry point
script specified in the docker file
third one is you can verify the
entrypoint script permissions uh here
you have to ensure that the entry point
script has the correct permissions to
set the executable within the container
uh fourth one is to test the entry point
script locally you have to copy the
entry point script from the container to
your local machine and test it to see if
it executes successfully outside the
container environment so this basically
can help to isolate any issues with the
script itself so these are some of the
process in which you can follow up uh to
check if one of the container is not
able to communicate with the other on
the same network now let us move to the
next question that is it says you are
trying to build a Docker image for a
pyth Pyon application using a Docker
file okay however the build process
fails with an error indicating that a
required python package cannot be
installed how would you modify the
docker file to ensure the package is
installed successfully wow what a great
question let us try to tackle this
question so guys any issues related to
diagnosing and troubleshooting network
connectivity invols like between Docker
containers there can be a varing steps
that one can go but I'll approach this
problem something like this uh first of
all I would check the docker network
configuration okay I'll start by
verifying both of the containers are
they connected to the same Docker
Network okay and for this I can use
Docker Network inspect command uh next
one is I can verify the containers IP
addresses check for the IP addresses
assigned to the containers within the
docker Network for this purpose also you
can use a Docker inspect command third
one is you can test the connectivity
using ping you can use a ping command to
test the connectivity between the
containers by pinging one container from
other using its IP address next one is
check the firewall rules ensure that
there are no firewall rules blocking the
traffic between two containers within
the network then inspect the containers
processes and ports check if the
required services or processes are
running inside the containers and
listing on the correct ports and finally
check for Docker logs for errors inspect
the docker container logs for any errors
or warning related to network
connectivity
for this purpose you can use dockal logs
command so in this way you can
troubleshoot your program so guys here
is the next question and it's a pretty
interesting one and it says something
like this suppose you have a Docker
compos file that defines multiple
services for a microservice architecture
okay and then each service runs a
different application component such as
front end backend and a database however
you notice that the front-end service
intermittently loses connectivity to the
backend service how would you
troubleshoot and fix this issue this is
a very practical problem and when you
are deploying your application on Docker
you might face these issues so your
interviewer can ask you this type of
question also so how would you approach
this question so the answer to the same
is like uh so guys whenever you have a
problem related to troubleshooting the
intermittent connectivity issues between
services in a Docker compos setup so it
can be a little bit of complex issue but
if you go through a systematic approach
like which I'm going to tell you uh you
might find an easy way to resolve this
issue so first of all what I would like
you to do is you have to check your
Docker compost configuration where you
have to ensure that your Docker compost
configuration in the docker compost. yml
file is correctly defined the network
settings for the services you have to
pay attention to the services names like
the ports network mode and many more
then you have to inspect the the logs
check for the logs of both front end and
backend services for any error messages
or Warnings that might indicate the
network related issues for this purpose
used Docker compos logs to view logs for
a specific Services third one is you
have to check for the container H check
you have to verify that the health of
the containers running in the front end
and the back end services use Docker pi
to list all the running containers and
check their status if any container is
restarting frequently or has exited
unexpectedly investigate the cause
fourth one is network connectivity check
if the front-end service can be resolved
the host name of the backend service you
can do this by executing a command
within the front- end container or ping
resolve the host name of the backend
service for example you can type this
command
like
Docker
compose then exec then suppose your
front end is a given directory so write
front end and try to look up NS
lookup back end so you can type this
command all over here and it's going to
check a given issue so guys you can type
this command to troubleshoot this issue
next thing is you can also try for
service dependencies so you have to also
ensure that the front end service waits
for the backend service to be fully
initialized before attempting to connect
sometimes intermittent connectivity
issues occur because of the front-end
service starts before the backend
service so you can add a delay or retri
mechanism in the front-end service
initialization script now finally you
have to check also the docker networking
where you have to review the docker's
networking modes like Bridge host
overlay Etc and you have to ensure that
the choosen mode is appropriate for your
setup please uh make it sure that this
is a very important point and also you
have to look for Docker built-in
networking features like userdefined
networks for better isolation and
control over communication between the
services so this is one thing now let us
move to the next part that is the next
question so it says you are attempting
to optimize a Docker build process for
large Java application but however you
are encountering a challenge where the
final image size is larger than expected
so how would you prefer to refactor the
docker file to reduce the size of the
final Docker image without sacrificing
the functionality very practical
question guys so how would you approach
this question take a time as you have
read the documentation or did some
projects so you can pause this video for
a while and try to think of approach
which can resolve this issue so I would
approach this question something like
this so in order to reduce the final
Docker image size for the Java
application using multi-stage builds
first I would check the base image
selection you have to choose a minimal
base image for the final stage such as
an Alpine Linux or distes Java to reduce
the size of the image next one you have
to minimize the dependencies in the
final image excluding unnecessary
packages and libraries utilize tools
like Marvin or Gradle to exclude
dependencies which are not required for
the runtime third one is optimize copy
operations you have to optimize copy
operations by copying only necessary
files and directories from the build
stage to the final stage utilize Docker
ignore to exclude all the irrelevant
files and directories from the build
context next one is layer optimization
guys combine multiple run commands into
single run instruction to reduce a
number of layers in the final image you
have to utilize Docker build cache
efficiently by ordering commands from
the least frequently changed to the most
frequently changed and finally you have
to look for static cont compression
compress static content like HTML CSS
JavaScript file using techniques like
broadly or gzip before copying them into
the final image so this is how I would
try to do it and one more point I can
add it that I can also review the
container configuration optimization I
would review and optimize jvm and
application server configurations to
reduce a memory footprint and also
improve the performance I'll adjust jvm
Heap size garbage collection settings
and threadpool configurations based on
application requirements so in this way
if you approach this question I think so
your interviewer will be very very
impressed now let's move to the next
question which is the question when you
are deploying a dockerized application
to a kubernetes clusters using Helm
charts however when you attempt to
deploy the application you would
encounter an error indicating that the
container is unable to mount a volume
and how would you debug and resolve this
issue Within the helm charts and
kubernetes deployment configuration
quite an interesting question now let us
see the approach to solve this problem
so guys whenever you want to debug and
resolve the issue of a container which
is unable to mount a volume in a cuberes
clusters which is unable to mount a
volume in a kubernetes cluster deployed
using Helm charts you can follow these
steps first of part inspect the helm
chart configuration review the helm
chart templates and value files to
ensure that the volume configuration is
correctly defined then you have to
verify that the volume type name Mount
path and other properties are accurately
specified in the helm chart check for
Cub's resources use cuex CTL get pods
cux CTL describe pods or cuex CTL logs
command to inspect the status and logs
of the pods affected by the volume
mounting issues so guys you can use
these codes okay these are the certain
commands so
okay this is one or
same and here you could just type
describe pods or you can go for cubic
CDL
logs okay and you can make the K as
small
okay so this makes uh one of the answers
for this question next thing is what you
can do guys you can verify the volume
configuration check for persistent
volume and persistent volume claim PV
and PVC use these resources and check
that they are correctly configured and
available in the kubernetes cluster
ensure that the PV and the PVC have
matching names storage class access mode
and other properties required for volume
provisioning and mounting next one is
troubleshooting the volume provisioning
if Dynamic volume provisioning is used
you have to verify that the storage
class is specified in the PVC available
and capable for provisioning the volumes
you have to check the status of the
storage provider like the cloud storage
service to ensure that it is operational
and accessible from the cuberes cluster
then fifth one is permission and access
you have to ensure that the kubernetes
service account used by the Pod has the
necessary permissions to access and
mount the wall if using Secrets or
config Maps as volumes you can verify
that they are correctly configured and
access I by the PS so these were some of
the points which you can mention and in
this way you will completely answer this
question now let us move to the next
question that is suppose you have a
complex microservice architecture okay
which is deployed on a Docker swarm
cluster now one of the microservice
which handles critical Financial
transactions experiences intermittent
performance issues causing delays and
potential Financial losses you need to
diagnose and resolve the issue promptly
to ensure the stability and reliability
of the application so how would you
approach this question guys so guys
diagnosing and resolving intermittent
performance issues in a critical
microservice handling Financial
transactions on Docker St cluster
requires kind of bit systematic approach
the first of all I would like you to
look for monitoring and logging you have
to utilize Docker swarms built-in
monitoring capabilities or the third
party monitoring tools to GA metrics on
CPU usage memory utilization Network
traffic and container Health analyze
container logs for any error messages
warnings or patterns indicating
performance bottlenecks check resource
utilization metrics to identify if there
are any spikes or anomalies in CPU or
memory usage that coincides with the
performance issues ensure that the
microservice has sufficient CPU memory
and network bandwidth allocated to
handle Peak loads third one is Network
latency investigate Network latency
between the microservice and other
components in the docker swarm clusters
including databases external services
and other microservices check out for
Network congestions packet loss or
communication issues that could impact
performance fourth one is you have to
look for database performance examine
the performance of database assessed by
the microservice monitor query execution
times database logs and indexes to
identify potential database related
bottle you can also go for optimizing
the database queries indexes and
configuration settings to improve query
performance and reduce latency now next
thing what you can do is you can go for
scaling and load testing consider
scaling the microservice horizontally by
adding more replicas to distribute the
workload across multiple containers we
can perform load testing to simulate
real world transaction volumes and
identify performance limits and
scalability issues next thing you can go
for continuous monitoring and alerting
Implement continuous monitoring and
alerting systems to proactively detect
performance issues and notify
stakeholders in real time set up alerts
based on predefined thresholds for CPU
memory latency Matrix to trigger
investigation and remedial actions now
what you have to do next is do
incremental changes and testing make
incremental changes to the microservice
configurations codebase or
infrastructure settings based on
diagnostic findings test changes in
staging environment before applying them
to the production to ensure they do not
introduce regression or new issues so
guys by following these steps leveraging
monitoring diagnostic optimization
techniques you can diagnose and resolve
intermittent performance issues in a
critical microservice ensuring stability
and reliability of the financial
transactions which you have applied
running on the doer cluster so guys I
