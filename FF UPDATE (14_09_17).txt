yeah hi friends
I think the physio and bio are going in
a safe hand and let's have few more
interactions and majority of them will
be new miracles right now and go ahead
so first of all I just want to go in
detail related to the blood that is
clotting factors so factor that
participates in extrinsic pathway okay
so extrinsic pathway the factors that
are involved in this is 3 4 5 7 and 10
so the second question is the factors
that are involved in the intrinsic
pathway the answer is 4 5 8 9 10 11 and
12 and I hope you guys are well known
that extrinsic pathway is related to the
flow through mean time whereas the
intrinsic pathway is related to the
partial drones in thromboplastin time
okay so extrinsic pathway is related to
the prothrombin time whereas in a
intrinsic pathway is related to the
partial thromboplastin and the next
question the factors that are common for
both the extrinsic and instant intrinsic
pathways that is for five centers you
can clearly appreciate them for four
five five ten okay we'll go ahead so
very clear extrinsic pathway three four
five seven ten intrinsic pathway four
five eight nine ten eleven twelve common
factors are four five ten an extrinsic
pathway is related to the proton beam
time whereas an intrinsic pathway is
related to the partial thromboplastin
time hope everything is clear afternoon
and the next question the factor that
are absent in stores blood often in the
store blood the answer is five and eight
next question
cryoprecipitate is reaching which
factors cryoprecipitate is reached in
which factor the answer is eight five
and eight are optioned in the case of
stored blood cryoprecipitate is rich in
factor eight next question hemophilia A
which is also called as nice classical
hemophilia is deficient due to factor 8
and the hemophilia B that is called as
am a christmas factor or the Christmas
disease that is deficient due to factor
9 hemophilia C is deficient due to
factor 11 and the question para
hemophilia is due to the deficiency of
factor 5 something called as in a
vascular hemophilia which is called as
an a pseudo hemophilia that is nothing
but one relevant factor clear hemophilia
A which is called as in a classical
hemophilia due to factor 8 hemophilia B
factor 9 Christmas factor I'm Ophelia C
factor 11 para hemophilia factor 5
vascular hemophilia hemophilia is due to
was the LaVon factor
so the next questions are vitamin K
dependent factors or factors deficient
in patient under water in syrup so these
are the factors which are deficient or
vitamin K dependent factors or the
factors which are deficient in the
patient who is taking warfarin therapy
the answer is 2 7 9 10 one more question
factors that essences from the liver all
K dependent that is 2 7 9 10 plus faster
ones and factor 5 I hope you are very
clear that in law that is vitamin K
dependent factors are 2 7 9 10 warfare
and efficient patient who is under
warfare and the revision factors are 2 7
9 10 never synthesis 2 7 9 10 + 1 5
clear right so we are going hard with
you numericals that is the total
cholesterol levels
the answer is 150 to 200 milligrams per
deciliter per second 1 HDL cholesterol
the answer is 35 to 75 LDL cholesterol
the answer is 80 to 175 creatinine serum
levels the answer is 0.72 1 point 4
milligrams per deciliter
so to Lucas during the fasting 70 to 110
milligram per deciliter
so glucose
to have a post handle the answer is less
than 140 milligrams per deciliter hope
you are very clear normal cholesterol
levels that is 150 to 200 milligrams per
deciliter cholesterol switch are high
HDL that is 35 to 75 milligrams per
deciliter
and cholesterol which are LDL that is 80
to 175 milligrams per deciliter
creatinine levels that is 0.7 to 1.4
milligrams per deciliter glucose during
the fasting that is 70 to 110 milligrams
per deciliter glucose after 2 hours post
random that is less than 140 milligrams
per deciliter
so going ahead HB values in the mail
that is 14 to 16 grams per deciliter in
the females it is in and around 13 to 15
grams per deciliter and the next most
commonly asked need questions that is
like elated hemoglobin which is called
as an hba1c the value is 3 to 6
percentage of total HP pH of blood
answer is 7.35 to 7.45
ph of urine the answer is 4 point 5 to 8
pH of saliva the answer is 7 point four
to seven point six very clear
heimo globin male 14 to 16 grams per
deciliter hemoglobin female 13 to 15
grams per deciliter black allotted
hemoglobin percentage is 3 to 6
percentage of total hemoglobin pH of
blood that is 7.35 to 7.45 ph of urine
that is four point five to eight and pH
of saliva that is seven point four to
seven point six apart from this I just
want to make few more important values
that is the serum potassium levels
that is three point five two five milli
equivalents for later sodium values 136
to 145 million spur later urea 20 to 40
milligrams per deciliter and uric acid
that is three point five to seven
milligrams per deciliter it's very clear
I'm repeating again the potassium values
of three point five to five milligrams
but it's
milliequivalents per liter sodium that
is 136 to 145 million colons per liter
urea that is 20 to 40 milligrams per
deciliter uric acid that is three point
five to seven milligrams per deciliter
support from these values you need to
make three important notes all the
things what I am discussing right now or
four bits okay so so the next one is
calcium most commonly asked questions
ninth 11 milligrams per deciliter next
album in three points five to five grams
per deciliter alkaline phosphatase forty
to 125 units per liter
bicarbonates
22:26
nearly equal insulator Beiler rubin
0.221 milligrams per deciliter chloride
96 to 1 or 6 million gallons per liter
I'm repeating again calcium nine to
eleven milli
grams per liter albumin three point five
to five grams per deciliter alkaline
phosphatase forty to 125 units for later
bicarbonates 20 to 26 milli equivalents
per later by Arobin 0.221 milli gram per
deciliter chlorine there is 96 to 1 or 6
min equivalence per liter I hope it is
more than enough for today
please try to recap them whenever you
have time signing off
Shree and they sponsor thank you
