yeah hi - welcome back now I'm going to
discuss few important topics related to
community dentistry okay first important
thing they were these were the questions
which are recently asked in the need as
well as in the aims okay okay the year
of eradication
okay the year of eradication okay so
these are the things that you have to
make a note okay so most of the
questions can be asked I mean the
previously it was asked already leprosy
was asked it was planned to eradicate by
2018 and maybe the measles is plan to
eradicate in 2020
TB is plan to eradicate in 2025 just to
make a note of these - okay that is file
area eradicated by 2017 the reduction of
infant mortality rate to 28 should be
done by 2019 these were the areas which
were previously asked may not may not
have such questions as as there is some
drift in your region need 2020 so
they're not asking the numericals for a
memory based stuff rather than they're
more focusing on the the conceptual
things okay again this is an area to be
focused okay fathers are again the most
commonly asked and if you see the recent
need examination there were many
questions asked in this particular
Journal okay the father of Epidemiology
okay that is Jon Snow the father of
Public Health is a most commonly a
frequently asked question various
examination the father of Public Health
is not a person it is a disease that is
covered because of origin of cholera the
the the crowd or the other society has
given more importance to public health
public heisting okay so that's the
reason why a disease has made the origin
of Public Health so the father of Public
Health is not a disease is not a person
it's a disease that is coming up the
Father father of modern medicine that is
Hippocrates and father of the medicine
is a
the hypocrites okay the father of Indian
medicine is charcoal okay these are the
questions which are most frequently
asked and of course the most common
questions in this recent trend changes
evidence-based okay it can be an
evidence-based dentistry or an
evidence-based medicine like whatever
treatment you plan whatever treatment
you plan whatever procedure you plan for
example if you if you are telling like
so we have discussed lots of smart
material which are the recent advances
right or you give more importance to
composites when you're talking about any
aesthetic restoration or you go more
importance to a few other material like
the smock material when you come to a
critical situation of handling a case
people can ask you why you have done
this okay fine you why you have done
this because there are many clinical
trials were done on these cases and
there are lots of evidences proving that
this material is best among the list so
everything whatever we do everything
whatever we follow is an evidence-based
means you have an evidence it is already
proven that it's the best and that is
called as evidence-based dentistry or
evidence-based medicine so they can ask
you a question like it's a simple thing
that is five days of evidence-based
dentistry okay this is 1 this is 2 and
this is 3 this is 4 and this is 5 see
these are the five ways which are
directly or indirectly related to the
evidence-based medicine or
evidence-based dentistry okay this Pico
is again a question that is asked in the
recent examinations which we'll be
discussing in further classes you know
further classes okay visas again Pico is
again a question which was asked so most
of the questions they are asking
directly or indirectly related to the
latest trends in the studies that is in
the studies of evidence-based industry
or medicine okay so this is called as
evidence-based triangle so they can ask
you a question the father of
evidence-based medicine or
evidence-based medicine it's okay you
can just make a note about the father's
a scientist names previously they used
to ask scientist names for sure but a
drift is there they were dropped they
have dropped the questions based upon
scientist based
or numerical based mostly memory based
questions we have dropped but anyway it
is mandatory that you have to learn
everything so this is already discussed
that is called as evidence base triangle
so what this evidence base triangle is
going to give you an information look as
you move from the base from the base
this is the base right so as you move
from the base and move to the top that
is the top or tip or epics of the
triangle as you move from here to there
as you move from here to there the
strength of evidence increases means for
example if you compare cohort study to
the meta-analysis they can ask you which
of the following has the better strength
which of the following has more
importance which of the following is
just preferred to make your study more
strong means you have to go for
meta-analysis meta-analysis is the tip
is the strongest as you move from the
tip to the base your strength or your
evidence is going to decrease so most of
your questions will move around this and
you can add add few important things
like evidence-based evidence-based
medicine or evidence-based practice or
evidence-based dentistry is a golden
standard aspect for the clinical
practice ok it's a golden standard you
can they can ask you which is a golden
standard for the clinical practice the
answer is evidence-based industry or
evidence-based medicine and they can ask
you the strongest epidemiological
studies the strongest studies the song
if study is the study which is faced
towards the tip because you will have
four options you need to identify the
best option among the four so among the
four you can check this which is towards
the apex which is towards the apex apex
is strong okay so you have to make a
note about this order meta-analysis
followed by systemic reviews followed by
critical appraisal followed by
randomized trial follows better so you
make an order so among the four options
which is towards the apex or towards the
tip is most strongest okay so they can
ask you the least strong is the least
strongest is the experts opinion ok
experts opinion is the
strongest they can ask you questions on
the arrange them in sequence or arrange
them in the order from high strength
through low strength of low strength
high strength or they can ask you what
is evidence-based medicine directly or
indirectly questions but you got an idea
right evidence-based is whatever you do
in a clinical practice you should have
an evidence to prove for example a
simple example
you heard on something to the patient
okay so there is some mishap that has
happened because of your treatment
procedure or something
your new treatment procedure or
something the patient has some loss that
loss can be a loss of teeth sometimes a
loss of jar necrosis of the particular
area or some times a loss of life also
so anything can happen but you need to
support yourself how you can support
yourself you can clearly show that this
is an evidence-based thing already many
people has tried it it is proved that
this is a good so I have tried it but
this may become a contradictory for this
particular patient so you should have an
evidence background for everything what
you do right now in the clinical
practice to overcome any anything
anything in your clinical practice can
be good or bad okay so this is what all
about the evidence-based which is a most
important area of focus nowadays in this
particular top a few other things that
we are going to discuss in further
videos and further classes stay positive
take care of you thank you signing off
