hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel today we'll be learning
about how to calculate time difference
between two different timings in excel
but before we begin let me tell you guys

simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to calculate time
difference between two different timings
using excel
now let's get on to the practical mode
now we are on our excel spreadsheet as
you can see on my excel spreadsheet let
me expand it
we have two different timings that is in
and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the end
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out
so here we have made some minor self
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the am pm so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24 hour timing that is 13 20
13 30 so this represents the 24 hour
format
but since we are you know working on
office timings let's keep it as am pm
okay
so there you go so we have our
timings of in and out now to calculate
the time difference between the in time
and our time so this particular
calculation is completely simple all you
have to do is press equals to select out
time minus select end time so there you
go press enter and you have the total
number of hours the employee has been
working in your organization so here
also we have made some minor cell
formatting so usually it comes out as am
pm right but instead of that we have
made a minor cell formatting we have
navigated into time and we have selected
the 24 hour formatting so that we have
just ours in our output so that's how we
have calculated the time difference
between two in times and out times of an
employee using excel now with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to calculate time difference using
excel and if you have any queries
