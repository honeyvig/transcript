hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel and in today's session
we will learn how to select an entire
column or an entire row in just one
click but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to select an entire
column in excel so for that we might
want to get back to our practical mode
and now we are on our excel spreadsheet
now you might want to you know add
some extension to your data since we
have sales here you might want to add
the dollar logo right so if you have
like 5 to 10 rows then it's easy but if
you have multiple rows then it might be
a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows i mean the entire row selected all
the cells are selected
right so this is one way and again
there is another way where you can just
you know uh click on the first table
header and
press ctrl spacebar so the combination
key is ctrl spacebar for columns and if
you want to select the entire row it is
shift spacebar so this is the method two
and another method so you might have a
doubt here right so when you click on
the column name or when you click on the
row number the entire row or entire
column gets selected right and you
wanted to select only the cells which
have data so we have another way for
that so you can select the cell now hold
the control and shift key and press the
lower arrow key to select the entire
column with cells having data so there
you go you have selected all the cells
in one single column with only data and
all the cells which do not have data are
not selected same applies to rows as
well control shift right arrow key or
left arrow key based on your rows and
all the rows with data will be selected
i mean all the cells in a row are
selected not the entire row
and
coming back to the first question that
is adding the dollar symbol so here we
have general so go to the data type and
add currency
so you have rupees here so currently we
are in india so we have rupees now what
is the advantage of selecting the entire
row when you don't have any data in the
57th row or the next cell right
i'll show you now let us add the number
100 and press enter
there you go let us add another number
like 1000 and press enter so the data
formatting is automatically applied to
all the cells so most of the time your
cells or the data sheet will be varying
you might have to add or remove elements
or numbers right so in such scenarios
this will be helpful
so with that we have come to an end of
this session on selecting an entire
column or selecting an entire row in
excel and if you have any queries
