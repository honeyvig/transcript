yeah hi winners uh very very good
morning one and all uh hope you are
doing great
so this is dr srikhan from invidi
conquer now i will be listing out the
topics
of general anatomy or anatomy and how
you have to organize them to make your
preparation easy and of course to be to
make your revision more comfortable
so logic for any competitive exam
particularly for a dental and a medical
student where you have
uh your utmost focus towards the memory
based aspects handling so many subjects
because dental and medical we have so
many subjects and we need to revise them
because it's more of a memory based exam
so your organizing your stuff is more
important so so that you will be more
comfortable in the last 15 to 20 days to
touch all the subjects so that you can
enter the examination hall with lots of
confidence so keeping this in mind
i have taken the basic reference of
dental decks okay
which most of you will go through for
your national words preparation so i
have taken the contents in that and i
try to organize in a most customized way
so that
you can feel comfortable and proceed
with the preparation
so among the topics of
anatomy so i have listed
okay six topics seven topics you can
consider six or seven topics as must do
topics for your anatomy
so out of that must do topics the first
one i want to stress on is osteology
so in osteology it is mandatory
that you need to complete
uh it includes joints it includes the
foramens of your skull and the contents
which are going through the foramens and
it includes different bones in the body
all all not six bones okay it includes
all the bones all the joints and all the
foramen okay so that is the main thing
that we need to focus on
so this is all about uh the osteology
which is one of the important thing and
coming to the second topic which is a
common topic covered in many other
subjects like even in physiology and
biochemistry also we talk more about
cells and cell arguments initially even
in microbiology pathology also we'll
talk about cell and cell organelles okay
so we talk about prokaryotic eukaryotic
cell differences and everything
in almost all these subjects even in
general histology also which is not
listed out in anatomy in histology also
we talk about cells first cells and cell
organelles and all these things it's a
very common 11th 12th standard 11th 12th
grade topics uh which you have to do but
it's better you try to finish these
topics in your anatomy itself then
jumping into the nerves now so you
should be very familiar with the cranial
nerves all the cranial nerves their
branches particularly you should be very
focused on the
nerves which moves around the head and
neck which are very very uh important
particularly from dental student point
of view
uh
as as you are giving a dental oriented
exam it is mandatory that you should be
clear-cut and perfect with
the two nerves one is
definitely the trigeminal nerve and
second one is your facial now
then comes with the muscles and muscles
also utmost important is muzzles of
mastication
models of facial expression and muscles
of head and neck okay your stimulator
mastery and all these are very very
important aspects that you need to work
on
apart from that
there are few areas where
they are asking questions throughout the
body but you should be very familiar
with head and neck nerves and arteries
of head and neck throughout the body and
coming to the embryology the basics of
embryology should be perfect with the
basics of embryology and coming to the
lymph node lymph node histology should
be perfect as well as the levels of
lymph node because levels of lymph node
are more integrated to your
neck decisions which we are going to
learn in oral surgery so it is more
related to the application part of oral
surgery or they can simply ask this
particular part of tongue is drained
which
which lymph node or this particular
salivary gland is trained to which lymph
node or such contents they may regularly
ask okay so apart from these seven
contents which i have listed out uh and
i want you to add one more important
aspect that is your salivary glands has
to be added
okay so salivary glands i mean there are
few topics which are ignored in the list
of dental decks but now i am going to
add so i want you to
have a glance over those contents they
are not going to eat your time or brain
but they are very very important okay so
one such topic is definitely i'll vote
and i will go with
salivary glands
and the second topic i want to stress on
is the basics of eye eyeball
particularly the muscles of eyeball are
very very common and familiarly asked
questions maybe that may be covered as
uh that may be covered in the nerve or
nerve system okay nerves of head and
neck or some areas it will be covered
but
the muscles are muscles of head and neck
it will be covered but i
basic anatomy and
muscles of eyeball are now supplied to
the muscles of eyeball is very very
important then comes i want you to focus
on the basic anatomy of year also
okay so these are the additional things
which were not covered in the content
list of dental decks and i want you to
add on to your customized preparation
schedule
so apart from this okay there are few
other topics which are listed out which
are topics
which has to be done in your physiology
rather than an anatomy like for example
urinary system renal system so what we
do renal system renal system in
understanding the anatomy of the kidney
so we talk about the physiology of the
kidney also there in physiology so it's
your wish whether you want to cover
the basic anatomy here and jump into the
physiology aspect when you're taking
physiology or it's better to make your
preparation more comfortable it's better
i list out i'll i'll try to list out all
these topics topic 8 renal system topic
9 respiratory system means respiratory
system where we are going to talk about
the anatomy of the lung how many how
many lobes are present in the left lung
how many lobes are present in the right
right lung the basic anatomy okay what
is nasopharynx or pharynx okay and all
these structures from nose epithelium
lining and everything about the lungs
respiratory system followed by i'll be
talking about the physiology
i'll be talking about your physiology
your volumes capacitance everything how
this physiology occurs how the carbon
dioxide is being transformed how the
oxygen and everything i will be talking
about the physiology
so that my suggestion for you is
i want you to go ahead
and try to wrap this in physiology
rather than doing here similarly g8
basic anatomy of git what are the
different parts of git what are the
different parts of stomach similarly
endocrine what are the different types
of glands and their secretions so
secretory part and their action part we
learn in physiology so basic names of
the glands and what are the hormones
they release we learn in endocrine so
you so my suggestion 8 9 10 11
11 okay
your 13 and 14 will learn in physiology
12 we'll learn here anatomy anatomy of
the brain will learn here that's a dry
topic so anatomy the basic anatomy of
the brain the basic anatomy of the
spinal cord will be doing here but rest
other topics my suggestion i want you to
include in physiology because probably
uh will try to wrap up physiology
immediately after finishing your general
anatomy so that it will be more
comfortable for you so you can take most
of you who are preparing for uh
who are preparing for national birds try
to do uh anot and physio okay try to do
it and not followed by physio so it's
going to be more comfortable for you
so next coming to the
few other topics okay as has already
discussed with you few other topics like
blood it's better you do with physiology
okay nerve physiology of nerve there is
something called as how nerve conduction
occurs how muscle contraction occurs all
these are physiology topics it's better
you do in physiology okay so your
tissues and body cavities you can try
here but i i suggest like a blood
nerves and all these has to be done
along with the physio
okay there are few other topics related
to the dentistry were included in uh
anatomy okay so you have some special
chapter called as dental anatomy okay
which every every of these topics will
be covered
okay right so
i don't mind you do here or it's better
you do there okay so
final conclusion of my story is
i want you to take the print out of this
okay and take the print out of this keep
this as checklist means these are the
topics that you have to cover mandatory
okay and do uh prepare a checklist
similarly for all the subjects
okay so whether you are done with these
topics or not if you are done keep a
tick mark if you are not done
okay keep keep a different color coding
or something so that
along with physio once physio is done so
most of the physiology and anatomy enter
things will be completed or once your
physiology uh anatomy and dental anatomy
is done most of the topics will be
marked okay so this is how you have to
plan organize your stuff
related to the general analysis okay
right so
what to be done how to be done how to be
focused material aspect and everything
will be shared
respectively on your
uh groups okay right so i hope uh this
this video uh how to organize the stuff
is useful for you okay so
as of now signing off
uh dr srikanth from team mbs concur
if you feel this video is useful please
do hit a like and
if it is
if it may be useful for your friends and
do share it
bye take care
