hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn today we will be
discussing about kotlin interview
questions the 30 questions that will be
covered in this video will help you
summarize every important concepts and
serves as a perfect programming resource
for kotlin interviews
so now let's get started with an
exciting video on cortland interview
questions but before we begin make sure
to subscribe to our youtube channel and
press the bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
so now let's go ahead with our first
question which is
name some of the features which are
there in kotlin but not in java
so some of the features which are there
in kotlin but not in java are null
safety feature operator overloading core
routines range expression and smart
casts so these are some of the
features
that make kotlin better language than
java
now coming to the second question which
is what is the difference between where
and well
both where and well are used for
declaration of variables however
where is a general variable that can be
assigned several times whereas val is a
final variable that is immutable and can
only be initialized once
now moving on to the third question
which is
what are the advantages of when over
switch in kotlin
in java the word switch is used whereas
in kotlin the word when is used
when is more compact and effective than
a regular switch
and it has
superior design than switch
when can be used both an expression and
a statement but switch cannot be used as
both
it can be used as statement but it
cannot be used as expression now moving
on to a next question which is a
multiple choice question
which of the following are the types of
constructors in kotlin
so first is parameterized and constant
constructor
option b is primary constructor and
secondary constructor
option c is default and no argument
constructor and option d is none of the
above so you can take your time in
figuring out the correct option among
these four options
because i'm going to say it's correct
option you can pause the video and take
your time
so our correct option is option b
primary constructor and secondary
constructor are the types of constructor
in kotlin
so option b is the correct option
now moving on to our next question that
is the fifth question which is
how to get the length of the string in
kotlin
so this is also a multiple choice
question
our options are a
str.length of
option b
length str
option c
str.length and option d
str dot length off with small o
so you can take your time in figuring
out what is the correct option
meanwhile
i'm gonna say the correct option
so a right or correct option is
option c
str.length
so if you want to
get the length of a string in kotlin you
can use str.length
now
moving on to the next question which is
which feature allows
removing the risk of occurrence of null
pointer exception
so it is an important question as well
so
there are four options first null risk b
null safety c null pointer nd all of the
above
it is a very important question
and
now the correct option of
this question is
e
null safety
null safety allows us to remove the risk
of occurrence of null pointer exception
it is a very essential feature of kotlin
language
now
moving on to the seventh question which
is
what is null safety and nullable types
in kotlin
so null safety commonly referred to as
void safety ensures that no object
references have null or void values
whereas in kotlin nullable types are
references types
that are declared by appending a
question mark to the string this
question mark is what we add at the end
of the data type to make it as
nullable
now
moving on to the eighth question which
is
what is higher order function in kotlin
a higher order function accepts one or
more function as arguments and returns a
function as output
it is not like any other function
the higher order functions are
frequently combined with lambda
expression to create code that is both
compact and powerful
instead of integer string or array as a
parameter to the function we will pass
anonymous function or lambdas in higher
order function
so basically we pass a function to other
function known as higher order function
now
moving on to the ninth question which is
what is elvis operator
the null safety attribute in kotlin
allows us to assign null values to the
variables
can use if else or the always operator
to see if a value has a null value
always operator returns the first opened
and if that operand is true otherwise
evaluates and returns the other operand
now our next question is
why is scotland interoperable with java
so this is our
tenth question
so kotlin is compatible with java
because it uses jvm byte code
jetbrains places a strong emphasis on
kotlin's interaction with existing java
code while building compatibility
the team ensures that kotlin can
interface with existing java code easily
and thoroughly
compiling it directly to byte code
speeds up the compilation process and
eliminates the distinction between java
and kotlin on jvm
so this is the reason kotlin is
interoperable with java
now coming on to the 11th question which
is
what are the range expressions
a range is a set of values defined by
their beginning and ending points
range expression in kotlin make it
easier to iterate over a set of values
to make a range in kotlin use the range
2 and down 2 functions
we may also define a range of values by
using the double dots operator
as we can see in the example for
i in 1 double dot 10
this will print all the elements from 1
to 10
and for 10 in
down to 1
will print all the elements from 10 to 1
in descending order
the third one is which is
4
i in 1 double dot 10 step 2
this will print
elements with a gap
now step two means there's a gap
so it will print elements like one
three
five seven nine because we have used
step two if we'll use step 3 then it
will give a gap of 2
like 1
4 like that
so on
moving on to the 12th question which is
what do you understand by
data class
so data classes are the classes that are
used to hold the data or information
these data classes were previously
exclusively used to generate java codes
but with the explicit implementation of
the higher and greater collection of
properties they are now important in
kotlin as well
functions like tostring and equals are
also combined with this language
now moving on to the 13th question which
is immutable variable
so this is a multiple choice question
and the options are a variable that are
change that can be changed b a variable
that cannot change that is read only
c a variable used for string
interpolation
d none of the above
so
we have already talked about immutable
variable
and
you can pick the correct option
now i am gonna say the correct option
so the correct option is b a variable
that cannot be changed is called
immutable variable that is the variable
that cannot be changed
now coming on to the 14th question which
is
what are co routines
it is a very important concept
so the letters co and routine stand for
cooperation and function respectively
a core routine is a coatland feature
that can perform everything a thread can
do
while still be incredibly efficient
a core routine is a lightweight code
that doesn't require any processor
background switching and doesn't map on
native threads
so this is co routines
now let's have a look at the 15th
question which is
difference between safe calls and null
check
safe call operator is used to determine
whether a variable's value is null or
not
if it is null
null will be returned otherwise the
requested value will be returned
on the other hand
when the value of the variable is null
you can use the null check operator to
throw a null pointer exception
so this is the difference between safe
call and null check
now coming to the 16th question which is
what are init blocks in kotlin
initializer blocks that are invoked
after the primary constructor are known
as init blocks
one or more init blocks can be found in
a class file
and they will be run in order
in kotlin it is not feasible to do any
operations in the primary constructor
instead
you must utilize the init block
so this is the init blocks in kotlin
now our next question which is the 17th
question is
what are lambda's expression
so lambda's expression are anonymous
function that can be handled as values
meaning they can be sent as arguments to
a function
returned or used in any other way that a
normal object can be used so it can be
returned and used in any other way like
a normal object can be used
so the lambda expression has no name and
is created and assigned as a separate
variable it doesn't have any parameters
and returns no value in the function
so this is called lambda function it is
used with higher order functions
now coming to the next question which is
what is inline function
so in line functions tell the compiler
to include the entire body of the
function wherever it is called in the
code it is used to improve the
performance of higher order function as
well as the inline function call and
inform the compiler to copy parameters
and functions
to use an inline function all you have
to do is to add the inline keyword to
the beginning of the function definition
so this is
inline function
now coming to what is null safety so
null safety is a very important feature
the type system of kotlin is designed to
eliminate the risk of null references in
code
the type system in kotlin distinguishes
between the reference that can and
cannot hold null
so here's an example of not null
reference which will show you compiler
error
so
this is the example string equals abc
after that
the other is the example of null
reference where we have used the
question mark as we have discussed
previously
so because to allow a variable to hold
null we have to declare a variable as
nullable string with question
mark so now our next question that is
the 20th question is what is late in it
so late in it is an abbreviation for
late initialization
if you don't want to initialize a
variable in the constructor and instead
want to do it later and you can
guarantee the initialization before
using it
use the late init keyword to declare
that variable
it won't start allocating memory until
it's been initialized
now our 21st question is
what is the difference between const and
well
the const keyword is used to declare
properties that are immutable by nature
that is the properties that are read
only
also the values of these properties must
be known at compile time only
now if we talk about val for read-only
properties the val keyword is also used
but the main difference between the
constant val is that the val properties
can be initialized at the runtime also
but it is not so in case of const
coming to the 22nd question which is
what is the difference between open and
public
so open for extension
is what the open keyword indicates
the open annotation on a class is the
polar opposite of the final annotation
in java
it allows others to inherit from it
on the other hand if no visibility
modifier is specified
public is used by default which means
your declaration will be visible
everywhere
if nothing else is supplied public is
used by default
so next question is
what defines a sealed class in kotlin
so it is a multiple choice question
a
it's another name for abstract class
b
it represents this restricted class
hierarchies
c
it is used in every kotlin program d
none of the above
the correct option is option b
it represents restricted class
hierarchies
so
the restricted class hierarchies defines
the seed class in kotlin
now moving on to the 24th question which
is what is lazy initialization in kotlin
so lazy initialization is a feature in
kotlin that indicates that your variable
will not be initialized unless you
utilize it in your code
if it only be initialized once
after that you repeat the process with
the same value
so now moving on to our 25th question
which is what is the entry point of
every kotlin program
every kotlin program's entry point is
the main function
the main function does not have to be
written inside the class in kotlin
the jvm automatically encapsulates it in
a class when it is compiled
the command line arguments are retrieved
using the strings given in the form of
array string so this was the answer of
this question now moving on to the next
question which is what are companion
objects in kotlin
so if we wish to write a function or a
member of a class that may be called
without needing the class instance
we can do so as a member of companion
object within the class in kotlin
as a result by declaring the companion
object we can only access the class
member by class name
so this was the answer of companion
objects in kotlin now moving on to the
27th question
which is
where does this kotlin run
cortland programs can execute on a
normal jbm just like any other compile
java code
this means that the kotlin compiler
converts cottling programs to bytecode
that the jvm can understand
as a result kotlin is a java kind that
works alongside with java so basically
kotlin is a kind of java you can say
that
it is worth noting that
bits of java code can be used to create
kotlin applications
so now our next question is
why do we need object keyword the object
keyword in cotton allows you to declare
a class and create an instance of it in
one step
the object keyword is used to obtain a
data type with a single implementation
it has three different meanings and can
be used in three different contexts
first is object declaration
object expression
and companion object
so this was the meaning or why we need
object keyword
in kotlin so now coming to the second
last question which is what is string
interpolation
so let's start with the launch
so launch is a core routine that fires
and then forgets
it's as though a new topic that has been
started
if the code inside the launch throws an
exception
it's considered like an uncaught
exception in a thread
which is normally written to
stdewr in backend jvm apps and crashes
android apps
now on the other hand async async is
used to launch a core routine that
calculates some data
you must use a weight on the result
which is represented by an instance of d
referred
uncaught exceptions in async code are
held in the resultant d referred and are
not
transmitted anywhere else
unless processed they are silently
dropped
so although async is used to start the
co routines it does so by blocking the
main thread at the await functions entry
point
and launch
launch will not block the main thread
but the rest of the code will not be
executed while waiting for the launch
result because launch is not a suspend
call
and this was the last question that is
the 30th question of kotlin interview
questions
