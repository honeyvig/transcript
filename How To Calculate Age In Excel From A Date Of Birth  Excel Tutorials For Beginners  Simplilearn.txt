hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel and in this session we
will learn how to calculate hn excel but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you're a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn now without
further ado let's get started with our
one point agenda that is how to
calculate h in excel so for that let's
get back to the practical mode and you
can see now we are on our excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of date and on the column b we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the date of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated if function or if you also
call it as date diff function based on
your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff in
excel for further information that video
will be linked in the description box
below you can go through it or you can
use the end screens and icards linked to
this video to get back to the tutorial
based on date diff in excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these data paths so
all you have to do is
type equals to and type
dated f
and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth
that is the first parameter now the
second one is
the today function because you're
calculating the age of these people as
per today right so we have a today
function in excel press on tab to select
it and give a close bracket now come up
and if you wanted to calculate the h in
terms of this you have to
you know give d as the input
yeah here it should be d as the input
and don't forget to use the double
quotes here and if you use the single
quotes there might be an error so use
double quotes if you want it in the days
part you can give days and if you wanted
in months you can give months for now we
want an ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the h here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in excel and with that we have come to
an end of this tutorial on how to
calculate agent excel if you have any
