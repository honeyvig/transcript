welcome to this video on kubernetes
architecture at simply learn de you know
friends that kubernetes is also called
K8 or Q it is an incredibly powerful
platform that helps you manage and scale
applications automatically but it can
feel complex and overwhelming at the
same time many people find kubernetes a
bit tricky when they read through the
documentation especially when they are
trying to understand how all the pieces
fit together to manage container
in this video we are going to break it
down for you in Easy terms we will
explore two types of nodes in kubernetes
the master node and the worker node we
will talk about how these nodes work
together inside the cluster to manage
and orchestrate your applications so
Guys Without further Ado let's get
started but before that just a quick
info guys simply learn has got devops
Engineers master program you can become
a devops expert by joining this course
in this course you are going to learn
about docker subes anible terraform
Prometheus Jenkins Microsoft Azure and
many more Technologies so guys hurry up
now and join the course the course link
is mentioned in the description box so
guys let's start with understanding
first what is POD a pod is the smallest
unit in kubernetes it is like a wrapper
around your application inside a pod
there's usually one or more containers
now you'll be wondering what is a
container a container is where your
actual application runs it includes
everything that the app needs to
function like Code system libraries and
dependencies containers are lightweight
and can be easily moved across different
environment making them very popular in
modern software development you can
think container like a box that has your
app and everything it needs to run
whether you run it on your laptop or on
a Cloud Server or inside a kubernetes
pod the container will always behave the
same way let me give you one
example suppose you run an online
e-commerce store you have a front end
web app that the customer see and the
back end the database that stores the
product information and orders in
kubernetes you might choose to package
the front end and back end as two
separate containers so you could run
both the web app and the database inside
the same Po in this case both containers
front end and back end share the same
resources
such as memory and network this might be
useful if they need to be closely
coupled and always run together now
parts are basically responsible for
managing resources for containers inside
them like the memory CPU and storage and
each P run on a node and kubernetes
decides which node will run on each part
now let's understand the kubernetes
architecture so guys as we all know that
kubernetes is an open-source platform
designed to automate deploy scale and
manage centralized application it
provides a powerful way to ensure that
your applications are running
efficiently and can easily scale across
multiple machines and can also recover
if something goes wrong at the heart of
kubernetes architecture there are worker
nodes and master nodes these two
components work together to ensure your
apps are always running smoothly in this
video we will take a closer look at each
of these component and how they interact
with each other so let's understand
first the worker nodes worker nodes are
the machine which can be either physical
computers or virtual machines where your
applications actually run think of them
as a workers for your kubernetes cluster
they execute your app workloads handle
the task required them to run each
worker node in kubernetes runs these
three main processes that is container
runtime cuet and Q proxy let's
understand each one of them one by one
the first process is contain runtime the
container runtime is like the engine of
your worker node it is responsible for
running your applications which are
packaged into containers containers are
basically lightweight Standalone units
that contain everything your app needs
to run this includes Code system
libraries and dependencies the container
runtime is a software that ensures these
container are properly managed and
executed on each worker node one of the
most popular container runtime is loer
as you can see all over here so there
are two instances of first there is a my
app which can be a front end then you
can consider this as the back end so
guys you can consider something like
this these two as your two containers
this can be your front end this can be
your back end or database now there's a
container runtime all over here which
can be Docker in this case so the
container runtime in this case is Docker
and it is ensuring that the container
for your web app is running on the
worker node so if you have multiple
applications they will be packaged into
separate containers and container
runtime will manage them making sure
they are running as expected the next
process that we are going to discuss
about is called cuet cuet is like a
manager that oversees everything
happening on a worker node it talks to
the master nodes which are responsible
for managing the entire cluster the
cubet gets instruction from the master
node detailing which application or pods
needs to be run on the Node it ensures
that these applications are running by
managing containers inside the ports
unlike container runtime which is
specific to managing containers the
cubet handles the interaction between
kubernetes and the worker node it is
responsible for making sure that the
right number of containers are running
that the resources like CPU memory and
storage are allocated properly to those
containers so you can say for example we
have the master node that sends a
request to the cube Lade saying run two
containers for the web app so one
container is there for web app and one
is for the database the cuet will check
the available resources on the worker
node and ensures that the containers are
up and running it also continuously
monitors the health of these containers
to make sure they don't crash or run
into problems if container fails the
cubet can restart it based on the
policies defined in the kubernetes
ensuring that the application remains
highly available I hope so you would
have got an idea regarding CU blade now
let's move move ahead and understand
about Q proxy think of Q proxy as a
traffic director for your kubernetes
cluster in a distributed systems like
kubernetes your applications which are
running on different noes Q proxy is
responsible for managing Network traffic
and ensuring that data is routed
correctly between different services and
ports when an application needs to talk
with each other in this case Q proxy
sets up the necessary Network rules and
ensures that the traffic flows smooth
smoothly between different pods services
and nodes it manages the internal
networking of the cluster and ensures
that each pod has a unique IP address
now let's move ahead and understand
about the working of Master nodes while
worker nodes handle the execution of the
application Master nodes are the brain
of the kubernetes system the master node
manages the overall state of the cluster
and makes decision about which
application should run and where they
should run the master node constantly
monitors the Clusters to ensure
everything is working as expected there
are four key components that make up the
master node the first one is API server
the API server is like the front desk of
the kubernetes control plane it acts as
an entry point for all the request you
send to the kubernetes whether you are
creating a new application checking the
status of your pods or scaling your app
you communicate with the kubernetes
through the API server the API server
handles all these requests and ensures
that they are passed onto the correct
components within kubernetes for example
let's say you want to deploy a new web
application in your kubernetes cluster
you would send a request to the API
server which would receive the request
it will validate it and pass it to the
appropriate components like it can be a
scheduler or a control manager now let's
move ahead and understand about the
second component that is the scheduler
if I talk about the scheduler guys the
scheduler is like a smart planner for
for the cluster it is responsible for
deciding which worker node should run a
new application when you create a new
app in kubernetes the scheduler looks at
all the available worker nodes and
determines the best node for the app to
run on based on available resources like
CPU memory and network the scheduler
ensures that your apps are distributed
efficiently across a cluster so that no
single worker node is overloaded now
let's move ahead and understand about
control manager the control manager is
like like the quality control Department
of kubernetes it constantly monitors the
state of cluster and ensures that
everything is running as it should if
something goes wrong like a pod crashes
or a node goes offline the control
manager steps in to fix it the control
manager is responsible for ensuring that
the desired state of the cluster matches
the actual state if you define that you
want three replicas of an app running
and one of them crashes the control
manager will automatically create a new
replica to maintain the desired State
now the final component is etcd which is
also called as the cluster brain etct is
a database that stores all the data
about the kubernetes cluster it is often
referred to as brain of the cluster
because it keeps track of everything
including the apps which are running
where they are running and the overall
state of the cluster atcd is a
distributed key Value Store meaning it
can store data across multiple machines
and ensure that it is highly available
and fall tolerant this is crucial for
kubernetes because the entire system
relies on etcd to know how the current
state of the cluster is for example if
you want to deploy a new app kubernetes
stores information about the app like
its configuration location and state in
etcd if something happens to the cluster
kubernetes can recover the current state
from etcd now let us look at the example
of setting up a cluster now now that we
understand how worker nodes and master
nodes work let us go through a simple
example of a kubernetes cluster setup in
this you have a basic cluster with two
Master nodes and four worker nodes
running on it let us say these ports
contain a web app and a database you
start by creating pods and each pod
contains one or more microservices for
your web app then the scheduler steps in
once you submit the request to
kubernetes through the API server the
scheduler looks at the available worker
nodes and assigns both the pods to your
worker nodes then comes the cubet which
manages the Pod the cuet on the worker
nodes receives the instruction from the
master node to run on the two ports it
starts a container inside each Port
using Docker or another container
runtime and it ensures they are running
smoothly then we have q proxy which
handles a communication the web app pod
needs to communicate with the database
pod Q proxy set ups a network route and
ensures that the two applications can
exchange data securely and efficiently
then we have control manager which
ensures the stability if one of the Pod
crashes or fails to start the controller
manager detects the issue and creates
new instance of the Pod ensuring that
both your web app and the database stay
online then finally we have the etcd
which keeps up the track all the
information about the state of the
cluster including running pods their
location their status is stored in etcd
this ensures that the cluster can
recover from any issues and always knows
what is happening so this was a simple
example illustrating the cluster setup
kubernetes is a powerful platform for
managing cized application across
cluster of machine by understanding the
roles of worker nodes and master nodes
you can see how kubernetes automates the
deployment scaling and management of
your apps so this was all for today's
