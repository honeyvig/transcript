hi Venus welcome you all to M de s
conquer online finish line for pepper
one now the topic of discussion is dye
materials so before going into the
present topic I would like to tank my H
body dr. Gibbs assassin and my guide dr.
T Rambabu and my junior dr. Surya Maud
ring for helping in making this video so
my task is to finish this in less than 5
minutes ok so how well we can approach
towards the particular question called
as dye materials in your paper so coming
to the contents basic introduction
definitions requirement of dye material
okay there are six to seven dye
materials that are materials used in dye
preparation and you are going to talk
about each and every dye material in
which we are going to talk about the
advantages and disadvantages dye systems
is another question which we'll be
discussing in the next video and a
proper conclusion with good references
so this is our task for dye material so
if you are clear with the contents it is
easy to frame your answer in a proper
way
so first of all you need to write about
the definition of dye what is dyed you
need to write a proper definition from a
standard textbook and it is mandatory
that you have to code the textbook name
at the definition because as you start
with definition the definition should be
perfect and a proper coding will give a
very positive impression so once you're
done with this you need to write about
the classifications okay so there are
classifications method of placement it
is direct dye indirect dye and the
amount of to three placing it can be
intra coronal or extra karana you can
add this reference which is which is a
star reference for this particular
question
then you can write about the differences
between the direct and indirect
fabrication basing upon the question
okay if it is just for five marks or
seven marks I feel you can just write
the classification and just move to the
dye material and individually you can
describe all five or six time attributes
but writing this direct and indirect
fabrication differences is going to
consume some time so basing upon the
questions if it's the ten marks question
so it is mandatory that you have to
write about the direct and indirect
fabrications too so an extension of this
direct and indirect fabrications when
you have to go for in a direct
fabrication and when you have to go for
an indirect fabrication the next about
the requirements the basic requirements
of dye material so all these seven are
the basic requirements of the dye
material it should be economical it
should be easy to use it should have a
good color so that you can't you can
contrast the finish lines it should have
a high strength and abrasion resistance
it should reproduce the fine details and
sharp margins accuracy and dimensional
stability all these are the common basic
requirements of any material which is
specific to dye material here then comes
the material that are used for making
dice the most common is gypsum products
which is type four and type five then
the next one is investment next one is
electro form dyes which are
silver-plated copper plated in which a
poly sulfate dye material a poly sulfide
impression material is used epoxy resins
which are most commonly used in the labs
now and amalgam can be used as a single
time material flexible dice and some
refracted eye surface so you need to
talk about these individual things
basing upon the availability of time but
make a note when you're talking about
individual things the mandatory headings
should be advantages and disadvantage
about from the basic introduction of the
material you need to write about
advantages and disadvantages of all of
these materials so I'm just going to
give a brief idea that is the gypsum
products type 4 type 5 what is the other
name of time for what is are the name of
type 5 what are the advantages of this
part of the disadvantage as you know
that it is more more prone to aberration
that is the main disadvantage of gypsum
products so once you are done with this
I hope you
this gypsum products which is again a
question for the pro store people in
which they need to talk about type 1 2 3
4 & 5
so in this content we are going to talk
more about 4 & 5 which are used as a guy
material so you need to write about all
the water by powder ratio ok setting
expansion compressive strength and
setting time of all this 4 & 5
next comes to increase the abrasion
resistance of this gypsum products what
can be done okay either you can go for a
silver or a copper plated or you can add
a hardener or you can add some silica
which which acts as a refractory
material increasing the strength of the
material and the next one is die stone
or investment how what is what what you
are going to do okay all these things
you have to learn next as already
mentioned advantages and disadvantages
oh man thank you for every material next
they are appropriate dyes electroplated
I say there corporal interpolated
or either silver electroplated which is
cornice electroplating so in this
electroplated dyes I apart from
mentioning advantages and disadvantages
the other mandatory thing that you have
to mention is the system okay the system
contains of a nacho anode and a cathode
I had a current and an electrolyte
solution okay how this how much current
should be used how much time it should
be and all these things are accessary
things that you have to make a note
apart from that go on take this and
disadvantages the next comes you can add
a note about the properties of
electroplated
dice what are what are what is dye stone
if it is used if it is a copper plated
if it is a silver plated the the things
you can add a note because these tables
are going to give more impression next
is epoxy resin say epoxy resins are
generally a self cured acrylic material
again you have to maintain the
advantages and disadvantages
so epoxy resins and die stone comparison
of the properties of epoxy resins in dry
stones next comes is the refractory dice
okay so refractory dyes are generally
made for the preparation of full ceramic
restorations
okay so just make a note about all these
refractory dice
malcom dying okay advantages and
disadvantages of amalgam
followed by the last one is the flexible
dye material okay they are similar to
that of the silicon and polyether
impression material okay and make a note
about that going as a centrist
advantages/disadvantages it is more
expensive so at last you need to mention
them references right so you can add
Phillips you can add the textbook
reference is basically for this because
this is more of an EM very basic
oriented topic right so before going for
the references it is better if you add
some evidence-based stuff okay so
article related to the evidence-based
stuff as dye materials are more related
to prosthetics this question can be is
asked so many times for the end of
people also ok very few cases this
question was repeated for pedo people
but this mighty this question was asked
for end of people also so I'm going to
post the reference articles which you
can code in evidence-based dentistry a
heading before references ok conclusion
is how good dye should be like how
should you select a dye so basing upon
the selection of a dye a simple basic
normal logical common-sense conclusion
is as none of the dye material follows
the ideal properties of dye material
water discussed okay so while selecting
a particular case basing upon the
material of the restoration okay we
prefer to go for a particular dye which
may give better outcome or a better
result and longevity of a restoration or
the crown the crown is also called as
registration so longevity of a
registration to get a better outcome
right so this can be linked to evidence
based so this is how you have to
conclude it and followed by you can
quote the references thank you all dr.
speakin from team MDS conquer I'll be
will be discussing the part 2 with the
dye systems ok different dye systems are
there so I'm just going to discuss them
in part oh thank you take care
