YouTube channel before we begin if you
love watching Tech videos subscribe to
our Channel like that tutorial and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
today we are gonna integrate chat GPD on
WhatsApp
this will be a straight tutorial on how
to integrate chat GPT on one device and
you can use other device over the mobile
phone to start a chat with the
integrated device and the chat Deputy
will answer all your queries I will show
you a demo before starting
so for that
first we'll open the command prompt
and run the file
mean
for that
write the command go run
main.code so this is the file that is
written in the go language
and we're gonna run with the command
Goran main.com for that you need to have
colang installed on your system
so I will guide you with all the process
but currently we are seeing the demo so
here this command will generate a QR
code that will scan with the device
which we want to integrate the chat GPT
on so we'll wait for the file to get
executed and after this we will execute
the server.py file and that will open
the chat Jeopardy on the Firefox browser
you can also use other browsers that is
chromium and other if you want but we'll
use Firefox to skip the one step
verification that chat Deputy ask us
whether if we are a bot or a human so we
will run the file again as there was
some error
so this time yeah it print perfectly now
we'll take the device and open WhatsApp
on it in which we want to integrate the
charge APD so I am using one device to
just capture this QR code
so this is the device
and you can see
that my device has captured this QR code
and you can see here that WhatsApp me
meow
it has been activated so now we'll run
another file that is server.py file and
that is the python file for that we'll
open the command prompt again and that
would be another command prompt and to
run that file we write the command
python
server.py
and you can see
in the Firefox browser chair GPT has
opened and I have logged in already so
we didn't it didn't ask me to login
again
now
we'll take another device and with
message on the
mobile device which has been integrated
with the charger building
so from this device
I will write hi
and you can see on the screen that chat
Gypsy replies hello how can I assist you
today and the scene you could see on the
WhatsApp chat so today we will ask
Church repeating
what is the capital of
India so you can see that the charge
repeating is typing
the capital of India is New Delhi and it
has been responded to
or mobile device so this is how
we can integrate chat GPT on a WhatsApp
and this would be the simple tutorial in
this you don't need to code any
uh this there would be another tutorial
if you know what's behind the
code or what behind the integration part
so you could
watch that video and know how we have
integrated but in this tutorial I will
guide you with how to download the files
and how to run the files and how you can
integrate charge Deputy on your device
so before proceeding with the tutorial I
have an insightful for you guys

you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section
now we will move to start integrating
charge GPD on our device
so for that first you have to download
this repository and it contains some
files and I will upload some more files
here you just have to download it
download the zip file
and after downloading it
you just need to extract it in a folder
foreign
so we will extract and
C drive in Python projects
mainly we create the folder here only
so here we'll create a folder
okay integrate charge obtain WhatsApp
mean or yeah
right integrate
checked keep it that's it
so inside this folder
we'll extract the files and I think it's
been done
so we'll just visit
C drive python projects and inside it we
have integrate chat repeating and we
have these two files so to run these two
files what you need is you need python
installed on a system and golang
installed on your own system so I hope
you guys know how to install Python and
golang if you don't I will just give you
a quick tutorial
so to download the
python you just need to visit the
python.org website and move to the
download section and you will see the
download the latest version for Windows
you just need to click that
and the download will start for you the
package has been downloaded so I will
provide you the link on how to download
the
python in the description box and also
the link for the GitHub repository
so you don't have to search it anywhere
also you can search it on the browser
just write integrate charge obtain
WhatsApp and avisara Ahuja you will get
the GitHub link and just write GitHub
also in the search bar you will just
redirect it to
this
and now you have downloaded the python
so just open the exe file
and start with the installation so you
can choose add python dot dxa to path
you can choose that
and
customize installation
and just click on the python test suit
and the next you can add the python to
environment variables so you have to
take both these options
and then you will click on the install
as I have already installed it so I
won't need to install it again you just
need to click on the install button and
here you will get the python installed
okay
and the other thing you need is golang
go language
so to download it you have to go sorry
you have to go to its official website
and go to the download section and here
you will see the Microsoft Windows as I
am working on the Windows operating
system so I will download for the
windows I've already downloaded and
installed it so you guys can download it
and I will show you like this is simple
how to install golang you don't need to
add anything so it's been downloaded
okay
to guide to the installation okay
so we are just waiting for the setup to
be initialized so that
we can install it
now you can see the next button is
available just click on that
is currently installed yes you can see
that it's already installed so you don't
need to do anything in installing the go
language just click on install and it
would be installed for you so I won't be
installing it again as I have already
installed on my device
so moving on now what we'll do
first we will run the server.py file
so for that
we will go to the folder where we have
extracted our files and here we will
open the command prompt and
run the file server.py so to run a
python file we have to write the command
Python and then the name of the file
that is server and its extension that is
py so we have
initiated that
okay uh Firefox is already running as we
have node
closed but we have opened for the demo
I think uh
it's an error
I will
again
run the confound I will just close the
previous command prompts
yeah I have
closed them
now I will open the new one and you
should open the command prompt the new
command prompt after installing the
Python and The Go language I will also
assist you in
installing the GCC compiler because you
would be needing that for go language
so first we'll
random server file
so you could see that by running the
python server.py file
you could see that the charge upd has
opened up in the Firefox browser
so I will show you the code
what we need for that you need to
install the flask
system OS modules
playwright module
and here
in the 16th night you could see that we
have used Firefox you could use chromium
for Chrome but the case is you need to
do the one step verification that is the
captcha thing for
in your leg
initializing the charity but we don't
need that so we are using the Firefox so
you should have Firefox on your system
now what I want you to do is just
install these modules as if you if these
modules would not be installed on your
system it would show an error it would
give you an error in the command prompt
only as I have already installed them so
it's not giving me any error
so I will tell you the commands to
install them
[Music]
so to install flask you can just write p
y p i space flask in any browser and it
will direct to the website
so you could open the first link that
would be pypi.org and this is a command
pip install flask so you can just copy
that
and open your command prompt first we'll
create it Ctrl C
and
now you could see that we are in the
folder integrate chat repeating and here
you could paste this command and press
enter
it states that that the requirement is
already satisfied as I have already
installed these modules
and the other module you need is
playwright so just copy the command go
to your command prompt and paste this
command
and press enter it would be installed
for you and another
module you need is virtual environment
so just copy this and paste in your
comment prompt and another module you
need is
the OS module
OS
OS system and we'll open the py pi
that is the official website the PIP
command website and you just copy the
command
go to your command prompt
paste the command and press enter and
this module would also be installed for
you guys
and now you have installed the go
language the Python language and the
modules you need to run the server.py
file now what you need to do is run the
go file but before running the golang
file what you need is
GCC compiler so to download it
I will provide you the link for the GCC
or you could just see here I'll provide
you the link in the description box
below you could just click on that
you will be directed to this page just
click on this release that was 24th May
and what you need to download is this 64
plus 32-bit
just download it
and as it gets downloaded just open it
and click on the create button
and after that the second option then
next and the directory you want to
install in
as I already installed this
I will choose
the C directory only
in C
I would
install in Python projects okay
okay it didn't
took the folder
in C
of course we can sell it
in Python projects and
in the same folder that was integrated
charity
okay
so I'll click on next
there's no time Direction yes I want to
install here and when you click on
install it would get installed for you
guys I've already installed it
started so it will get installed again
so now what you have to do is you have
got the
all the requirements to integrate the
chat Jeopardy on WhatsApp that is all
the modules for the server.py file and
the main.co file for that you have
installed the go language and the GCC
compiler so you could run both the files
and for that
we will close the command prompts and
open the new command prompts
and this is a
folder
so we will open one come command prompt
here
sorry
and we have to open different command
prompts for both the files for the
golang file and the python file okay
so we will open the command from tab
and
now to run the golang file we need to
write the command go space run space the
name of the file and extension that is
main.co
and we have executed the file and this
file will provide us with a QR code and
we'll scan the square Port from our
first device in which we want to
integrate the chart GPD and before that
we will run our another file that is
server.py file and for that we'll open
another command prompt
and to run this command
and to run this file we'll write the
command python space the name of the
file that is server and the extension.py
so we'll see whether a QR code is
generated or not
and I can see
that it's been linked to
the previous device as we have done in
the demo so we haven't logged it
out
so I will check with the device yeah
it's been active so I will just
log out from that device
and run it again
or I will open another command prompt to
run the golang file again
so to run it
will open the command prompt and write
the command CMD for that
and here we'll write the command to run
the
go file
and we have done that
and if we see the server.py file
in your
has been
perfectly executed
but we are not able to
yeah all right
everybody is running fine now what we
have to do is
use our first device to scan this QR
code so that chatubity
gets linked to our first device and then
we'll use another device
to chat with the chat GPD
so now we have opened our first device
and open the WhatsApp and click on the
link devices
and here
I'm going to scan this QR code
and you can see that it's logging in
now it's logged in
and now from the another device
will ask a query to judge everybody
and we'll ask charged repeating to write
a code
to add two integers
and that one python
so we just misspelled python but we hope
that our chair GPT
understood that so here we can see that
the judge everybody got the command
and it has
random good example so here's an example
called to add 20 percent python
so you can see that
charity has been integrated and we'll
see
its response yeah we got the response
and now we'll ask another question and
that would be
what is the currency of United States
um
let's see what it responds the country
of the United States is the United
States dollar it is the most commonly
used currency in international
transaction and in other words primary
Reserve currency
so we can see that till it writes all
the lines whose sentences it's been
executed on the browser and after it
completes oh it stops generating the
answer
it centered to the WhatsApp chat
so here
we are done with a project
now you guys have understood how to
integrate chatgibility with WhatsApp and
what you have done is we have downloaded
the repository and we have to extract
all the files that are present in the
repository I will update all the files
you just have to extract them into a
folder and then run the main.co file and
the server.py file and before executing
these files you need to have golang and
python installed on your system and for
the python you need some modules that we
have seen that is the playwrite module
The Flash module the OS system module
and the virtual environment module so we
have seen how to install them and when
you will just execute the file on the
command prompt you would get errors if
these files or modules are not installed
on your system and for golang we have
installed the GCC compiler and after
installing all these requirements then
you have to just run both the files and
when you run the golang file you will
get the QR code just scan it with your
device on which you want to integrate
the chat APD and after that from any
device you can just message on that
number on which you have integrated the
charity and the child GPT would answer
all your queries
and with that our session is completed
