hey there Welcome to our introduction to
tensorflow video I'm thrilled to be your
guide on this journey into the world of
tensor flow in this course we will start
by unraveling the mystery of tensor flow
understanding what it is and why it's
such a game changer we will explore data
flow graphs the building blocks of
tensor flow programs and delve into the
basics of writing tensor flow code as we
progress we will compare tensorflow 1.0
with 2.0 and uncover the hierarchy of
the tensorflow toolkit we will walk you
through the Practical demonstrations
using tensorflow 2.0 showcasing its
improved features we'll then dive into
the fascinating realm of frequent neural
networks exploring their applications
and witnessing a Hands-On demo whether
you're a beginner or looking to enhance
your tensorflow skills this course is
designed for you let's walk into this
exciting journey together and unlock the
potential of tensor flow for real world
use cases let's get started
