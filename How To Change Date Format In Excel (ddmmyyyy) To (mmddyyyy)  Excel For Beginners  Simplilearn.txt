hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel and in this session we
will learn how to format date in excel
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to format date in
excel now we might want to get back to
the practical mode so you can see on my
screen we are on the excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see
dates in column a and different formats
in column c d e and f respectively now
by default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so for that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option press that
and remember to have the delimited icon
you know you might be having the
dash as your icon or slash as your icon
for the delimited thing and
select that and next next and here you
can see right it's in general mode so
you can press on date and dmi will be a
date format that is date month and year
now click on finish so it's been
formatted now now let's copy the same
data and paste it in all the four
formats
so that we'll see the different formats
that we can change to or customize to
right
so there you go let's expand the columns
a little bit
now we have day
month and year
so now you might want to change a couple
of things right for example you wanted
to change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the cells and right
click and select the format cells option
and in here you can see the date
function and in here you can see
different types of modifications that
you can do to your data right so
[Music]
you might want to also change your dates
based on the location so right now we
are in india and imagine if you wanted
to you know change something based on
u.s or if you have if you're having your
client in us and he wants the dates and
us format you can also change that so
here you can see english united states
and press on that press ok and you can
see it's been changed to us format where
you have years in the first place
months in the second place and dates in
the last place right
and now let us imagine that
your client does not want the dates all
he needs is just months right you can
also do that get back to the format
sales option go to custom and here
instead of
you know a month date and year you all
you can do is just write down
month and year and select okay so you'll
have only month and year not the dates
now your client is being a little more
you know he wants a little more detail
and he wants you to add a lot of
granularity to your data which includes
day
time etc everything right so you can
also do that so the same way go to
format sales custom and here
i think it's in date itself
so
let's navigate a little
yeah here so you have the day date
month and year press ok so there you go
right so that's how you can do it
and now let's try a little bit more
if you have a few more options pending
so go to format cells
and
custom
and
you also have
timings
so here you have date month year and the
timings
press ok and they have all the timings
as well so since these dates are you
know i created them just a few moments
ago to keep it simple so i did not have
to add the
diamonds here so if you are keen about
adding the timings you can also do that
for example if you wanted to add the
timings of the employees logged in and
logged out you can also do that using
the same format so with that we have
come to an end of this tutorial on how
to format dates in excel and if you have
