now without further delay over to our
training now we are on the Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet and here I have some
sales data so we have Ru ID order ID
ship date ship mode Etc so what we are
up to is to create a funnel chart so
before we create a funnel chart let's
try to get some data right so let's
create a pivot table and you know we
have a row or column named as region so
let's create five different rows which
have the data related to NorthEast
Southwest and Central regions and let's
try to find out the highest number of
sales from a particular region that is
why we are going to sort and then let's
copy the data from the pivot table to a
new sheet because pivot table will not
allow you to create a funnel chart so
let's try to add those data into a new
spreadsheet and let's create a funnel
chart of it so basically funnel chart
looks like a bar chart and the only
difference is the shape of the bars if
you see them vertically or horizontally
the way you're putting it then you can
find out it takes a shape of a funnel so
with that briefing let's get started now
just select any Cel on the spreadsheet
go to the insert menu and there click on
the pivot table from the stable range so
Excel will automatically select the
range and you can see the range got
highlighted with the total lines and
select the new worksheet option and
there you go and now you have the PIV
table ready and now you might want to
add some data on your pivot table
right so here is the field list so in
case if you don't find the field list
you can find it in the pivot table
analyze show button and now we want two
sections the first one is region let's
pull the region to row the next one can
be anything it could be profit discount
quantity sales so let's go with the
sales according to our initial plan
finding out the sale in the regions so
you can uh check if the aggregation is
some or not basically sometimes you
might get count or average so we wanted
sum so it's exactly the sum and now you
can you know select any sell and right
click to sort
it largest to smallest now you have the
sorted list now select your data copy
and go to the new sheet paste This Here
and Now go to the insert option once
again and uh expand the charts option
and automatically you have recommended
charts on the front and here the final
chart is one of the recommendations just
click on that press okay and now you
have the Fel chart you can uh you know
change the title to region
wise you can also edit your chart so
let's say this is currency right so you
can go to the data types and here go to
currency and change rupees to dollars
since the data set has dollars United
States English dollars okay and if you
want to get rid of the decimal points
you can also do that and uh yeah you can
also change the Colors by getting into
the colors option you can fill different
colors to different regions and uh yeah
so far so good so you can see central
region has the highest number of sales
and with that we have come to an end of
