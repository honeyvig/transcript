HTML CSS and JavaScript play pivotal
rules in the front end development
collectively shaping the user experience
on websites and applications HTML or
hypertext Mark language serves as a
foundation defining the structure and
layout of the web content it structures
text images links and other elements
creating the skeleton of the web page if
I talk about CSS or cascading style
sheets it is like the stylist of the
trio it's responsible for enhancing the
visual presentation of HTML elements it
allows developers to control the colors
fonts spacing and overall layout
ensuring a polished and consistent
appearance across different devices now
here comes a JavaScript it is like a
dynamic force that breaths life into the
static web pages JavaScript enables
interactive and responsive features it
can manipulate the HTML and CSS in real
time facilitate ating actions like form
validations image sliders and
interactive forms JavaScript connects
with users responding to their actions
without the need for page reloads in
essence stml structures the content CSS
Styles it and JavaScript adds the
interactivity together they form a
cohesive frontend development stack
turning a mere collection of code into a
visually appealing userfriendly and
dynamic digital experience now before we
move on and learn more about HTML CSS
and JavaScript I request you guys that
do not forget to hit the Subscribe
button and click the Bell icon let's go
through the agenda for today's video
first first we'll go through a quick
introduction to basic website
architecture to understand how a website
actually works then we'll understand
what HTML is and moving ahead we'll go
through the use cases of HTML finally
we'll go through the installation part
and the editors we can use to start with
with
HTM let's move on to the first topic for
today's video tutorial website
architecture website architecture
basically defines the design and
structure of a website a website
contains two important parts the front
end and the back end the front end of
any website is something the user came
across we can also state it as the
client side of any website whatever the
user of the website sees while going
through any particular website is
considered as
frontend HTML CSS and JavaScript are the
three most popular and mainly used
Technologies which are responsible for
the development of the graphical user
interface the combination of these three
Technologies is responsible for giving a
smooth and appealing user experience on
the other hand anything the user doesn't
witness while going through the website
but actually exists somewhere in the
website and and the server is known as
the back end of a website whenever we
visit a page and send a request for the
content the server goes through the
database and then creates a response
that is sent back to the browser the
browser then interprets the response and
displays the content on the scre several
Technologies are used for backend
development few of them are JavaScript
Frameworks like nodejs and nextjs python
Frameworks like Django Ruby Frameworks
like Ruby on Rails C++ Frameworks like
Apache and many more other technology
let's move ahead and we'll now go
through what HTML is HTML stands for
hyper text markup language introduced in
the year 1993 by Timber nurley the same
person who invented the worldwide web in
the year
1989 the first version of HTML was
written in 199 but released later in
1993 as HTML
1.0 HTML got many updates with time and
the current ongoing version of HTML is
HTML
5.0 HTML is also known as the most basic
building block of the web which is used
to create the structure of any website
with the help of numerous predefined
tags it helps the browser to understand
the structure and style of a document or
file for viewing over the
Internet it allows our web pages to host
videos images and other applications it
also facilitates navigation within web
pages or between websites through
hypertext hypertext refers to the links
present in any website to connect
different web pages and create a whole
website HTML has a lot of use cases web
development HTML code is used to design
how a browser displays web page elements
such as text hyperlinks and media files
internet navigation users can easily
navigate and insert links between
related pages and websites as HTML is
heavily used to embed hyperlinks web
documentations HTML makes it possible to
organize and format documents similarly
to Microsoft Word moving on to the
installation part HTML does not require
any special software to work if you have
notepad installed in your system that's
enough to start using HTML the best part
about HTML is its ease of use let's move
on to the editors part now and will'll
then download a particular editor for a
complete HTML playlist an editor or IDE
which stands for integrated development
environment is a software application
that comprehends facilit ities to a
programmer for software development just
like Photoshop makes it easier to edit
photos in the same way IDE makes it
easier for a programmer to write code
the number of idees present in the
market today is huge some of these
editors are notepad++ atom and vs code
these editors are free to use on the
other hand editors like Sublime are free
but with some limitations to access all
the features of line we have to go for
the premium version for the license and
then we can use it for software
development my personal choice for an
editor is the visual studio code there's
a reason behind using vs code as an
editor let me tell you a few advantages
of vs code or other editors first of all
it is free to use as it is open-source
software so we can get it at no cost it
supports multiple programming languages
there's nothing like we need any web
support or work on different editors for
different programming languages we can
use vs code for different languages as
well extensions are also one of the main
reason behind using vs code suppose we
want to use a programming language it
does not support all we have to do is to
add an extension and we are good to it
also does not affect the editor's speed
as it runs as a different
process besides all these properties one
main key factor behind using vs code is
its avail a ability in different
platforms like it is available for Mac
Linux and windows so I think there are
enough features we have discussed till
now there are many more features that
we'll discuss while installing and
working with vs code let's start with
the installation part now the
installation process for vs code is
pretty simple just go to Google and
write here vs
code press enter and the next page which
will open will show us the results click
on the first link over here and we are
here at the website of vs Cod right now
you can see the download button in front
of your screen you can click on it and
you can download the stable version for
your operating system from here only or
you can go to the other download button
present at the top right corner of your
screen click on the button over here so
you can see here we have all the
extensions as well these are the top
extensions we have to download them
inside s code once the downloading part
overs so here you can see the download
Starts Now sit back and relax until the
download finishes once the download
completes open the setup file from your
downloads and it will take us to the
license agreement page now agree over
here click on next and it will take us
to the browser part so here what we have
to do is we have to choose a location
for the VSS code file to locate so you
can choose any location so for now I'm
clicking on next over here now you can
see we have a different folder so we can
click on browse and then select it and
then click on next so here we can see we
have some additional features so what
we'll do is we'll create a desktop icon
now you can see other options as well so
click on them as well click on next and
now click on install the installation
will start once we are done with the
installation part click on finish and
the vs code will start automatically
fine so here you can see we have the
page over here what we can do is we can
open a folder from here so if you have
any folder so what we can do is we can
open it from here now what we'll do is
we'll create a new file so here you can
see we are in a file what we have to do
is we have to save this file now so
click on file click on Save and now we
can save this file at any place or any
location we can see so what we are going
to do is we are going to go on desktop
we are going to create a new folder over
here we are going to to name it as HTML
now inside HTML what we are going to do
is we are going to write here the name
of our file so we'll write here first
then we'll write
here the extension so what we have to do
is we have to write here first. HTML and
here you can see we have an HTML file
over here right so you can see we have
four options over here the first one is
for opening a folder or any particular
location so click on open folder now
what what we are going to do is we are
going to open HTML over here and you can
see we have the HTML folder open now we
have the file over here as first. HTML
which we created recently then we have
the search button over here to search
anything or to replace anything the next
button we have over here is for the
source control then after this we have
the debug Button as well and then we
have the extension so these are the
features vs code provides us and below
here we have the accounts option and the
settings option what we can do from here
is we can change the font size and
different settings right now the next
button we are going to discuss is the
extensions button here we can find many
extensions given by the vs code Studio
Community they are free to use so for
now we'll use these two or three
extensions so what we can do is we'll
click on HTML CSS support so you can see
I have already installed these
extensions over here so then we have
JavaScript and typescript nightly and
the live server extension so this
extension is pretty important the live
server one and the HTML CSS support you
can leave the JavaScript and typescript
nely for now so we have to install these
two extensions for now so I have already
installed it you can install them in
your computer now the next thing we have
to do is so we can start writing our
code here on I've already told you that
while saving any file make sure that we
are saving that file with a HT ml
extension so what we have to do here is
we have to put an exclamation mark over
here and press enter and you can see we
have the basic HTML code which we'll
need in almost every program from now on
so we don't have to write this code
every time just press the enter key
after putting an exclamation mark So
this code will come in our screen now
here we have different tags right so
we'll discuss these tags later on while
working on the HTML file so I hope for
now you got the installation part and
what is HTML basically using HTML is so
easy that we can simply start with it if
we have basic computer knowledge we got
you covered if you are a newb to HTML
please stay connected with us and you
guys will understand HTML in a very fun
and exciting way before we go through
the different tags present in HTML let's
discuss what a tag is a tag refers to a
special word wrapped in angular brackets
which are used to define a particular
type of content on a web page after
using a tag in an HTML file the browser
decides how to render or display the
content on the screen the list of tags
present in HTML is pretty huge we'll go
through some basic tags in today's video
and we'll go through the remaining tags
while working with them so let's start
with the most basic tag we have in HTML
you can see here we have a basic program
written over here all the tags mentioned
over here are mandatory for all HTML
programs the first thing we have here is
the doc type as HTML you can see it over
here we have written doc type HTML so
this is not an HTML tag but an
instruction for the system about the
type of document basically we are
telling the system that this is going to
be an HTML document so that all the
browsers can know that this particular
document is an HTML document and work
accordingly the next next tag we have
here is the HTML tag you can see the
HTML tag starts from here and goes till
add right we have ended this HTML tag at
the end of a HTML
document now this tag is necessary for
all HTML documents if you are working on
an HTML document then this tag is what
we are going to need the HTML tag
represents the root and the end of the
whole document this is a container tag
that contains all the other tags with
within it so this tag is pretty
mandatory in all HTML document now the
next tag we have here is the head tag
you can see the head tag over here and
the ending of this head tag is present
over here we have certain tags present
inside this particular tag now you can
see that this head tag contains meta
tags and the title tag right you can see
the meta tag over here we have three
meta tags and then we have a title tag
as well now the meta tags doesn't appear
on the page itself but only in the Pages
Source schol metatags are essentially
little content descriptors that help
search engines what a web page is all
about now the next tag we have here is
the title tag the title tag is used to
define the title of a web page basically
we write the name of our web page inside
this tag for example if we see here the
title of our web page is document form
now if we change the title of this HTML
document and write here something
like for first document fine now save
the program open it with live server now
you can see it over here that the window
name is changed to first document
there's no change in the web page itself
so what we are going to do is we are
going to reduce the size of a vs code
and the browser we are going to keep
them side by side here so that any
changes we made in this HTML document
are reflected in the web browser other
tags we can use inside the head tag tag
are the style tag the script tag and the
link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to our HTML
page we have to provide the source of
that file and then any styling changes
we make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web page for that so
let's create a CSS file first what we
are going to do is we are going to
create another file over here let's name
it as style. CSS now this particular
file has CSS says as extension this will
tell the browser that this particular
file is a CSS file and we are going to
use it for styling purposes fine so we
have this style. CSS over here now we
are going to link this with our HTML
document for that what we have to do is
we have to write here link so this is
the tag now we have to write here re and
we have to write
here
stylesheet fine now the next thing we
have to do is to provide the source code
of this particular file so for that we
are going to use href href is going to
be style. CSS now close this link tag
now this ra tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document now you
can see it over here we have this Rel as
stylesheet this means that this
particular file is a stylesheet and we
are going to use this for styling
purposes another important tag we have
inside the head section is the script
tag this tag is used to declare or use
any script within the HTML document
basically used for JavaScript so it's
not necessary to use this tag within the
head section only we can use it anywhere
but for now we are going to use it
inside the head tag the syntax is also
easy we have to write it like script SRC
now SRC is going to be the file name so
let's add another file over here we'll
write
first. JS so this will tell the browser
that this particular file is a
Javascript file so we are going to write
here inside this now we are going to
write first. yes now we have to define
the type as well so type is going to be
text and the file is a Javascript file
so we'll write here JavaScript fine now
close this tag and the script tag will
closes automatically you can see it over
here fine the script tag is
closed keep one thing in mind that we
have to close the script tag every time
but the link tag is not necessary to
close the next tag we are going to
discuss is the body
tag the body tag defines the document's
body now you can see it over here if we
go back to a HTML page you can see the
body tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc there
can only be one body element in an HTML
document any tag we are going to use
within the body tag is going to define
the structure of for web page now the
next tag we are going to use is the
heading tag there are six different
types of heading tags starting from H1
and goes to H6 H1 refers to the most
important heading and H6 refers to the
least important the font size of H1 is
the largest and the font size of H6 is
the smallest among all so let's use them
all here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1 now inside this H1 we'll write
this is
heading one save the program and you can
see it over here we have a heading in
our web page which says this is heading
one similarly we have the h2 tag as well
so if we write here H2 and inside this
if we write this is heading two save the
program you can see the change in the
font size you can see the difference
over here the font for H1 is greater and
the font for H2 is a bit smaller than H1
similarly we have
H3 and for H3 we are going to write here
this this
is heading c three fine then we have H4
as well so we are going to write here H4
and inside this we are going to write
this is
heading F fine similarly we have H5 and
H6 as well so we are going to mention
them first here so we'll write here this
is heading five and finally we have
H6 which is used for heading six so we
are going to write here this is
heading six fine save the program and
you can see the difference in all the
headings over here the size for H1 is
the largest and the size for heading six
is the smallest we can use any of these
headings according to our
notes similarly we have the paragraph
tag as well in HTML it is used to write
a paragraph or any content within the
web page the sent Tex is simple we have
to use the P tag for that so if we write
here p and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing will write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first
HTML document fine now save this program
and you can see it over here we have
some text present in the web browser
right so these are the most basic HTML
tags we discussed in today's video and
as we said the list of tags is large and
we'll discuss them while working with
them so please go through these tags on
your own and let us know if you face any
issues we have already discussed about
tags in the last video we came across
several important tags in the previous
video like the HTML head and the body
tags a simple definition of tags states
that a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen right now keeping this definition
in mind the definition of an element in
HTML states that an HTML element is the
collection of a start TCH its attributes
an end teag and everything in between
the tags right so an HTML element is
basically a collection
let's understand this with the help of
an example what we'll do is we'll write
over here inside the body of this HTML
document we'll
write P fine now this paragraph tag over
here is an example of a tag it has
opening tag and a closing tag so this
whole thing is a tag this paragraph is a
tag over
here now if we add an attribute to this
tag like an ID or a class so what we'll
do for that we'll write here let's say
ID is equals
to par one fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tab so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tab
we'll write over here let's
say this is
a paragraph fine so we'll write here
paragraph So This is the content of a
paragraph tag now we have four different
parts present over here we have the
starting tag over here so this is the
starting tag this whole thing over here
is the starting tag then we have
attribute so ID here is the attribute
then we have the content of this tag so
this is the content present inside whole
tag
and then we have the end part of a
paragraph Tex so this represents the end
part right so the combination of these
four things is known as the HTML
element now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so the these two things are
pretty same so let's write something
inside this as well so let's say we are
writing here this
is paragraph 2 fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph 2 so what we have to do is we
have to remove a from here save it now
and now now it says this is paragraph 2
fine so I hope you guys got that HTML
tags are not Cas
sensitive fine now let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss empty elements in
HTML most HTML elements have a start tag
and an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
tag and this is the end part right so
this indicates that this paragraph tag
ends over
here now there is a group of elements
that are exceptions to this rule so
these elements are called empty or void
and only have a start tag since they
have no content present inside the tag
so they must not have an end tag in HTML
example of empty elements are like the
Break Tag we have we have image link and
many more such tags the list is quite
long so so what we'll do is We'll add an
image using the image tag so image tag
is basically an empty element so we'll
use that particular element and you guys
will understand what empty elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing tag
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
name then we'll write here SRC so SRC
over here is attribute we'll discuss
attributes in upcoming videos so inside
this will provide the path of our image
so let's say we
have this image present
inside images folder which is a folder
present in a system so where we are
saving all our HTML programs so the next
thing we'll write here is alt alt stand
for alternate so if the image is not
shown over the browser then the
alternate text will be shown so let's
say we are writing here image one now
we'll close this image tag so that's all
we don't have to close this particular
image tag we don't have to write here
like this so you can see we don't have
to write here like this anything so if
we not write it over here that's fine
because image element is an empty
element so let's save the program and
you can see we have an image over here
in the browser so the image size is
quite large what we'll do is we'll
reduce the site so we'll write
here this for
now we'll discuss all these things in
the upcoming videos so don't don't worry
about it for now you can see that we
have an image over here so this is our
image this particular image is what we
have added using the image tag so this
is done now the last thing we'll discuss
in this video is the nesting of elements
nesting means we can use the tag or
element within another element for
example you can see we have a paragraph
over here so this is a paragraph which
says this is paragraph 2 let's add some
more things over here so let's say we
are WR over
here HTML stands
for
hypertext workup
language
fine and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph tag so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bol so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
B tag now save the program and you can
see HTML is bold in nature now right
similarly what we can do is we can Nest
one more tag inside this Bol tag so what
we can do is we'll write here I now we
have to put this HTML inside both these
texts save this program and you can see
the HTML is cursive in nature now so you
can see we have three different Texs or
we can say we have two different tags
inside a particular Tex this is known as
nesting of elements so we can do it with
HTML as well I hope you guys must have
got an idea about what HTML elements are
and how elements are different from tags
in
HTML in the last part we came across
HTML elements we saw the difference
between HTML tags and elements now that
we already have an idea about elements
let's discuss what attributes are let me
write the basic syntax of an HTML
element over here first so what we'll do
is we'll write over here let's use the
paragraph Tech so we are writing over
here this is
a basic
example of
elements in HTM fine I hope you guys
must have got an idea about what this is
this is actually a basic HTML element we
have nothing else over here just a
simple example of HTML element an
element consist of start Tech an ending
tag and the content within the tag right
so this particular thing is an
element now attributes in HTML refer to
the additional Properties or
characteristics of an element for
example if we write here let's suppose
we are writing over here let's say we
are writing over here ID
as par1 fine now save this program and
you can see over here that we have a
paragraph which says this is a basic
example of elements in HTML now we have
this whole element with ID as par one or
we can give any ID of our choice now
this ID is unique for this particular
element for now you don't have to worry
much about this ID or any other
attribute just focus on what attributes
are we are going through the working of
attributes basically so we can use the
ID of this attribute to style this
particular element so basically this ID
attribute defines what this HTML element
is we have to use the style tag element
or we can say we have to use the style
element for styling this particular
paragraph you will understand it once we
go through the tag so let's do it over
here what we'll do is we'll use the
style tag over here so we'll write Here
style you can see this is a style
element basically it has start tag it
has ending tag now we'll write some
content inside this particular tag so
let's say we are writing over here
hash par one now inside this what we'll
do is we'll Define some styling
properties so let's say we are writing
over here background color as red and
we'll write here color so this color
here refers to the font color basically
so we'll write here blue now save this
program and you can see the paragraph in
a browser is changed so what we did here
is inside this style element we access
this particular ID so ID is unique for
each element we'll discuss it later on
so basically this particular paragraph
tag has an ID named par so we are using
that particular ID then we have some CSS
properties so these properties are used
to style a particular element so we have
used it over here you can see it over
here if I zoom out a bit in the browser
you can see the background color of this
whole paragraph is red and the font
color is blue fine what we want to say
here is this ID over here is basically
an attribute it is used to identify or
change a particular element we have many
attributes present in HTML so we'll go
through some of them let's say we are
adding an image over here so let's add
an image and you guys will understand
about HTML attributes here as well so
we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of a image so if we go
back to this particular HTML folder so
here we have a HTML folder you can see
we have a folder here named as images
and we have an image present inside this
particular folder right so what we have
to do is we have to provide this path
inside a HTML file so what we are going
to do here is we are going to get back
to vs code and inside here we'll write
images so this is our folder name and we
have a file named html.png present
inside that particular folder so SRC is
the attribute and this particular thing
is the value of a attribute right now
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to write here alt now
inside this alt let's say we are writing
HTML over here now this alt attribute is
used when we add an image on so
basically what happens is when we add an
image to a web browser sometimes what
happens is the image is not shown over
the browser so in that case the
alternate text will be shown so if this
particular image is not shown in the
browser then this particular text will
be shown so let's save this program
we'll open a web browser here side by
side as well you can see that this
particular image is present over here in
a web browser the size of this image is
quite large we can change the size in
two different ways we can either use the
ID at attribute here as well and then
use that particular attribute in The
Styling tag of CSS file to change the
size of this image or we can simply use
the height and width attribute in the
image tag over here so that's the simple
one so what we are going to do is we are
going to write here height height is an
attribute we have to define the height
in pixels so we have written over here
300 pixels save the program and you can
see the height of this image is 300
pixels same thing goes for width as well
if you write here width and if we Define
the width as 300 pixels as well save the
program and you can see now the height
and width of this particular image is
300 pixels right so guys this is all
about the basics of attributes in HTML I
hope you guys understood this we'll go
through each attribute while working on
those attributes in the upcoming videos
so don't worry about it if we haven't
covered all the attributes over here
we'll go through them in the upcoming
videos before we move on and discuss the
different formatting tags in HTML let's
understand what formatting is formatting
refers to the process of making the text
present on a web page more appealing to
the user for example let's say we want
to add a heading in a HTML document and
for that we want a specific font size
let's say we want to add a heading with
a bigger font size for this purpose we
have the heading tag present in HTML
which provides us with six different
font sizes with H1 being the tag with
the greatest font size and H6 with the
smallest one we have already discussed
in in the previous videos as well now we
need to make sure which font size we
want and we can use the heading tag
accordingly let's understand this with
the help of an example let's suppose we
are working on a web page wherein we
want a heading so let's say the heading
is what is HTML we want the font size to
be bigger so simply we'll write here H1
we have already mentioned it that H1 has
the biggest font size of all the six
heading tags right so inside this we'll
write what is HTML so let's suppose this
is the heading now on saving the program
you can see here on the browser that we
have a heading with larger font size so
what we can do for now is we'll remove
this heading from here now save it and
you can see we have only one heading as
of now we have the heading as what is
HTML we can also write a paragraph after
this heading tag that will explain what
HTML is using the paragraph so let's do
it over here as well and you guys will
understand it much better so here we are
going to use the break element so this
is basically an empty element used in
HTML for line break so what we are going
to do is we are going to put it over
here so this is the tag BR tag or Break
Tag we can see now what we are going to
do is we are going to write here inside
the paragraph tag
HTML stands
for let's write it in capitals we'll
write here hyper
text
markup language
fine so here we have paragraph that says
HTML stands for hyper text markup
language now what we want to do is we
want to add another heading to this web
page which will Define the uses of HTML
so basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading tags
so we want another heading let's say
over here now the main heading of our
web page was what is HTML and we want it
to stand out among all the headings
present in our web page that's why we
use the H1 tag for that heading now for
the next heading or for the new heading
we'll have a little bit smaller size
than the main heading so what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
h2 tag or the H3 tag for that so let's
use the H3 tag for now we'll write over
here h 3 so basically we are going to
write it after a br tag so we are going
to use the BR tag over here or the Break
Tag we can say now we are going to write
here uses of HTML fine now save the
program and you guys can clearly see the
difference in font size of both the
headings let me zoom in a bit here in
the browser so now you guys can see it
much better the there's a difference in
the size of heading one and heading
three right so this difference is what
we are talking about there are six
different sizes for a heading tag in
HTML we can use any of these heading
tags according to our need figure out
which one of these six tags is best
suitable for your web page and use that
simple and easy let's move ahead and
will now discuss some more formatting
tags present in HTML let's move ahead
and we'll now discuss some more
formatting tags present in HTML the next
tag we are going to discuss is the Bold
tag this tag is used to make the tag
text bold or strong so there are two
different tags for the same task for
making the text bold we can either use
the Bold tag or simple B tag we can say
the other tag we can use is the strong
tag the functionality of both tags is
similar so we'll use them side by side
so that you guys can see the difference
or they are basically same so what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here after this BR te we are going to
write here B so b stand for bold Tech
now we are going to write something in
here so let's say we are writing over
here
HTML now again after BR tag we are going
to use the strong T fine we'll write
same thing here the content will remain
the same so we are going to write HTML
over
here now here we used both tags with
similar content present inside the save
the program and you can see we have two
similar outputs here on our web page the
outputs are exactly similar the working
of both the tags is the same right now
let's recall the nesting of elements in
HTML from the previous video we have
said earlier that we can use an element
within another element in HTML we are
going to Nest this bold tag inside a
first paragraph tag it means that we are
going to Nest this bold tag over here so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use bold tag inside the full form or
we are going to put the full form of
HTML inside the Bol tag fine so save it
and you can see we have hypertext markup
language written over here in the
browser in bold right it looks better
than the previous one just like the Bold
tag we have two more tags present in
HTML to make the text on screen look
more appealing to the user the italic
tag and the underlined tag now you guys
must be thinking that these three
formatting techniques are also present
in Microsoft Word you right these three
tags are present in both msword and htl
the working is also same so let's use
these tags here once but we are going to
do is we are going to use this text over
here only so we are going to put this
hypertext markup language inside three
different tags so we are going to put
them inside italic we are going to put
them inside bold and we are going to put
them inside underline is so we are going
to do this over
here now you can see the nesting of
element ments over here if I zoom in a
bit on Visual Studio code you can see we
have a paragraph tag then we have three
tags present inside it so we have bold
Tech we have italic and underline so
this is called nesting of elements now
save this program and you can see the
text over here we have hyper text markup
language in italics it is underlined and
it is B and nich right the next tag we
are going to use is the delete tag we
have two different text present for this
task as well let's say we want to put a
line through the center of any text
Crossing it out basically let's say that
this text is not relevant fine so let's
go through an example first what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
break tag over here and now after this
Break Tag we are going to use a
paragraph tag we are going to write a
paragraph
so let's say we'll write here I would
like to have a
cup
of
okay cup
of coffee fine save it and you can see
we have this paragraph or sentence over
here on the browser now what we want is
we want to delete this particular word
or we can say we want to put a line
through it fine so what we are going to
do is we are going to write
here
strike fine we are going to put coffee
inside this strike T because we want
this particular word to cut and then
let's say we are writing over here D
fine so save it now and you can see it
over here it says I would like to have a
cup of coffee has a line over it and
then we have written T so you guys can
understand the meaning of this sentence
by yourself I guess we can use this tag
anywhere according to our needs we can
achieve this same thing with the help of
the delete tag as well what we have to
do is we we have to write here in place
of strike what we are going to do is we
are going to copy this piece of code
from here we are going to paste it here
now instead of strike we are going to
write here delete so D this is the
TCH and we are going to close this tag
as well now we are going to write coffee
inside it and save the program and you
can see we have the exact same output
with this tag as well fine another tag
we have in HTML for formatting is the
mark tag now the mark tag in HTML is
used to Mark any particular text the
text will be highlighted with yellow
color for example let's say we are
writing something over here or we can
just paste this again and we are going
to remove this part now we want to Mark
the word coffee let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here mark this is the tag and inside
this tag we are going to write
coffee let's say fine save the program
and you can see it over here we have
this sentence which says I would like to
have a cup of coffee and coffee is
highlighted over here right so this is
the mark tag and we can use this tag for
formatting now the last tag we are going
to discuss in today's video is the font
tag the font is an inline element used
to change font sizes font colors and
font styles of the text in a web page
this this element has its own attributes
so the three attributes we can use are
size color and pH fine size is used to
change the font size of the text we can
write values between 1 and seven with
one being the smallest and seven being
the largest font exactly opposite to The
Heading text so you can learn it that
way color refers to the font color we
can simply write the name of the color
or we can use the hexadecimal values for
colors the hexadecimal numbers are
specified according to the RGB value for
each
color the last thing we have is face
face refers to the font style the
default HTML font is Times New R we can
use any font style of our choice using
this attribute so let's use this tag
over here and you guys will understand
it much better I guess so what we'll do
is we'll write
here let's say we are using a paragraph
Tech so we'll write something over here
let's say I prefer
now we are going to use the font tag
over here so this is a tag you can see
it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is size so we'll write
here inside size let's say the size of
this font is four then we have color so
color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red and
then we have the face so let's say we
want the font style to be
Wana and we'll
write something over here let's say we
are writing this over red fine now save
the program and you can see it over here
it says I prefer red fine so let's
complete this sentence what we are going
to do is we are going to write something
after this font tag as well so let's say
we are writing over here red over blue
save the program and you can see it over
here that we have this particular
sentence which says I prefer red over
blue so let me increase the size of vs
code so that you guys can see it clearly
so here you can see we have this
paragraph tag then we have written
inside it I prefer and we have kept this
red word inside a particular element
font element basically this font element
has three different attributes size
color and phase now let's change the
size of this to six for
now and
we'll check the output save the program
and you can see red over here is quite
large in size right it looks different
so I hope you guys got this formatting
an HTML document is mostly done using
CSS but now HTML also allows us to
format our documents using different
tags basic formatting we can say so
formatting is making the web page more
appealing using these particular tags so
the list of formatting tags present in H
HML is quite long we can't discuss all
of them here but if you use any of those
tags in the upcoming videos then surely
we'll discuss them over their own now
the task for you guys is to use these
formatting tags and let us know if you
find any difficulty in using them in
HTML a phrase tag is used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
what does that mean let's try to
understand this with the help of an
example we'll first take a paragraph for
this example a small one maybe so let's
do it here what we'll do is we'll write
here P so we are going to use the
paragraph tag let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here hello everyone then I'll write this
is Cal and let's suppose we are writing
over
here please subscribe
to YouTube channel
fine save this and you can see here that
we have the same paragraph here on the
browser now what we said earlier about
the phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right so here we have a paragraph and we
want to provide meaning to a block of
text let's say we want to put some
emphasis on the word YouTube over here
fine we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasized tag in
HTML the Syntax for this tag goes like
this so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand now we have the emphasize tag
in HTML the syntax is pretty simple what
we have to do is we'll write over here
so we are going to make changes inside
this particular paragraph tag only so we
are going to use the emphasis tag over
here so what we have to do is we have to
cut the word YouTube from here and we
have to paste it here now the syntax is
so simple we have a two word tag so it
says em it stands for emphasis now save
the program and you can see here in the
browser you can see the difference
basically the word YouTube stands out
from the rest of the words present in
the paragraph to lay some more emphasis
on the word YouTube we can use the title
attribute now title attribute will be
used inside the emphasis tab right so
let's do it here once so what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
title attribute over here so let's say
the title says check
a
YouTube channel fine so let's break it a
little more so here you can see we have
these three lines so inside this
paragraph tag what we are doing
is we are using the emphasis tag and
inside that emphasis tag we are using
the title attribute fine on saving the
program you can see nothing changes over
here on the browser to witness the
change here we have to take our mouse
cursor over YouTube and you can see we
have a small popup here that contains
the value of a title attribute let me
zoom in a bit here so here you can see
on taking the mouse cursor we have this
small popup with the value of a title
attribute right another thing we can do
for this task is we can add a link over
here here on the word YouTube we'll
discuss it in the upcoming videos when
we'll go through text links in HTML so
you guys will understand it much better
then now you guys may have a question in
your mind that we can do this exact same
thing with formatting tags as well right
yes of course we can do that but
formatting refers to the process of
molding the text for a better look and
feel of the text while phrase tags are
used to provide meaning to a block of
text it's not necessary that if a tag
falls under the category of formatting
tags then it can't be a phrase tag the
difference lies in the purpose of using
that particular tag I hope you guys are
getting
it the next tag we are going to discuss
is the mark tag we have already
discussed this tag in the formatting
tags as well so let's discuss it one
more time the mark tag in HTML is used
to Mark any particular text the text
will be highlighted with yellow color so
we have discussed it previously now what
we are going to do is we are going to
copy this piece of code so we are going
to copy the whole paragraph from here
and then we'll paste it here now instead
of using the emphasis tag we are going
to use the mark tag over here fine so we
are going to change the tag name from
emphasis to mark for the opening and
closing tag save it now and you can see
we have another paragraph over here
which is almost the same or which is
exactly the same it says hello everyone
this is kosan please subscribe to our
YouTube channel now the thing to notice
here is the word YouTube it is
highlighted in yellow color right so the
title attribute will work same over here
as well if we put a mouse cursor over
the word YouTube you can see we have
this popup with the same title value
right so one thing to notice here is the
title attribute is basically the
differentiator between the formatting
Texs and the phrase Texs it means that
the tag Remains the Same but the way of
using it defines the purpose so let's
let's move ahead and we'll now discuss
the abbreviation tag in HTML the word
abbreviation in general terms refers to
the short form of a word that's it we
have the answer here if you're using any
abbrevation for any word we want the
user to know that this particular word
has a special meaning then we can use
the abbreviation tag so the syntax goes
like this what we will do is we'll again
use the same
paragraph and
we'll paste it over here
again so what we are going to do
is we are going to remove this empty
space from here so that you guys will be
able to see the whole code or as much
code as possible so what we are going to
do now is we are going to use the
abbreviation tag fine so we'll remove
this piece of code from here we have to
put this over the word YouTube so what
we are going to do is we are going to
write here abbreviation and inside there
we are going to write YT so this is the
short form of YouTube
basically now save the program and you
can see that we have another paragraph
but there's no difference over here as
of now the word is simple there's it's
not standing out basically right so this
is because while using the abbrevation
tag we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this T so let's do
it here we have to write here title and
we we have to write Here YouTube because
YT stands for YouTube so we are going to
write Here
YouTube now save the program and you can
see here that the abbrevation YT is now
underlined with a dotted line fine this
indicates that the word YT is used as an
abbreviation here and the user will know
that something is different over here on
taking the mouse cursor over it you can
see we have the value of a title
attribute you can see it says YouTube so
this is basically the short form of
YouTube why it over here now the next
tag we are going to discuss is the
address tag this tag is used to display
the address in the web browser the
content is written within the opening
and closing address tag is considered as
an address in HTM so this is the address
we generally use fine not an IP address
or nothing else the general address we
use for our location or for a address so
let's use this tag over here we'll write
here address and and this is the tag now
inside this tag we are going to
write YouTube office let's
say then we
have 1 2
3 street so this is going to be the
street name for our address then we have
let's say sector so let's say the sector
is
456 and then we
have the place name is NOA and the
country name is India
fine so this is an address and let's
save the program you can see here the
difference in the browser the address
tag over here has a different font this
tag is used to indicate that this
particular block of text is an address
so you can see it over here this is a
address now if you want see it clearly
let me remove these three paragraphs
from here save the program now and you
can see we have address over here so if
you want to write it in different lines
so what we can do is we can use the
break tag over here then over here again
save the program and you can see we have
the address over here the font is
different that's the only difference
between address tag and other tags till
now we have covered different types of
tags present in HTML we came across the
formatting tags and the phrase tags
present in HTML in the last part we also
covered the differences between these
tags apart from all the differences
these tags exam they are still similar
in one aspect that is these tags are
used to change the appearance of a web
page whenever we use these tags we
change the look and the feel of a web
page now the meta tag is a bit different
from these tags this tag does not impact
the appearance of a web page it is used
in the head section of the HTML document
and does not require any closing tag to
work what this tag does is it give
information about the data we have on
our web page meta refers to metadata
metadata means data about data for
example if we have a website that
provides the user with some data it can
be any kind of data and the user can go
through it to gain some information but
the information about the data present
on a website is given by metadata
only what does it mean to provide data
about data for example if we go go to
Google and search for a keyword now how
Google works is it goes through the
keywords present in any particular
website and then shows the user that
particular website those keywords here
refer to metadata and we have to put
them inside metat tags in HTML the
description we get while searching for a
website is also present inside the meta
tag of any HTML
document basically what we are trying to
say is this tag is used to give
essential information about any
particular web page meta elements can be
used to include name value payers
describing properties of HTML documents
for example if you want to put any
keyword for a web page the name
attribute inside the meta tag will
contain the keyword and the value
attribute will contain the actual
keyword
name there's no closing tag needed in
meta elements because these elements
contain information within attributes
only we can use multiple meta tags for
different information
so let's start with the programming part
now and you guys will get a better idea
about meta tag in
HTML here we have a simple HTML document
wherein we already have some meta tags
present over here so these tags are
present in any new HTML document we
create in vs code let me show it to you
again let me zoom in a bit in vs code so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a new HTML file over here so
let's create one so let's say we are
writing here the name is meta HTML fine
now press the exclamation key so we have
to write it this now press enter and you
can see we have all the necessary tags
present in our HTML document right you
can see here we have three meta tags
present over here with some attributes
let's discuss these tags first the first
meta tag over here you can see has the
keyword or has the attribute as caret
right it says caret and the value is UTF
8 now UTF refers to Unicode
transformation format 8bit it is the
most common character encoding present
in the whole worldwide web that is the
whole internet so the next meta tag here
has the attribute HTTP equ or we can say
HTTP equivalent the value is X UA
compatible here and then we have the
content attribute with value as IE
equals to Edge now this tag tells the
Internet Explorer to display the content
in the highest mode available we
generally don't need this tag in an HTML
document unless we are working with
bootstrap now the next meta tag here is
used for the viewport width of the web
page you can see it over here it says
name is equals to viewport and content
it contains width device width and
initial scale is set to 1
point0 fine now this gives the browser
instruction on how to control the
dimension and scaling of a web page the
width is equals to device width part
sets the width of the page to follow the
screen width of the device which may
varry depending on the device size so
the next thing we have the initial scale
is equal to 1.0 right it is used to set
the initial zoom level when the browser
first loads the web page so 1.0 is the
default value so these are some
predefined metat tags we get while
creating any HTML document in vs code
now let discuss some more thing we can
do with a meta tag in HTML we discussed
previously about keywords present on a
web page right so what we'll do is we'll
first write over here we are going to
create a meta tag then we'll write
inside here name is equals to let's
say
keyword and then we have the content
attribute so it will contain keywords
inside it what we are going to do is we
are going to write some keywords let's
say we are writing over here HTML
CSS
JavaScript and let's write something
else let's write here meta so these are
the keywords over here now what we did
here is we Define some keywords for a
web page now when any user searches for
any of these keywords and we want Google
to show a web page at the top then we
have to include all the possible
keywords that the user can use to search
in in Google fine similarly if we want
to give any description about a web page
what we have to do is we have to write
meta over here so we are going to use
another meta tag over here so next up we
have the name attribute inside name
we'll
write
description and inside content will give
the description the actual description
fine so we'll write this is a page
for metat tags in HTML and we'll close
this
meta that's it this is the description
of a web page one thing to say here is
none of these meta Texs we are using
will affect the physical appearance of
the web page so these metat Texs are
basically related to search engine
optimization
only so that's why we are not using them
side by side along with Google Chrome
because we can't see them or we can't
witness them now the next property we'll
be discussing here is the a revised
property this property is used to
mention the last revision done on the
web page the syntax goes like this we
have to use a new metatag for it and
then inside name what we have to do is
we have to write here revised and then
we have to write here content and then
we have to provide the name so we'll
write here simply
code then we'll write the date over here
fine so we'll write here 14 0320 0 22
this is the date you guys might have
noticed while going through Google after
searching for any website that last
updated is mentioned there in some cases
so this is the Syntax for doing so in
case we want to put the name of the
person who made the change then what we
can do is we can write here meta again
so we have to use the meta tag again and
again for each property fine so we have
to write your name now we have to
mention author and insight content we
have to write the name of
author so let's say Cal is the name of
author now this meta tag over here
states that kosel is the author of this
web page who made the changes and worked
on it fine now if we want a web page to
refresh automatically after a particular
time interval we can use metatag for
this task as well what we can do is we
can write
here after this we can write here meta
now we are not going to use name over
here we are going to use HTTP equip and
then we have to write here
refresh then inside content we have to
pass here value so three here in this
statement refers to the time in seconds
if we include this statement in a HTML
file then the page will get refreshed
after every 3 seconds we can witness
this right now save the program and what
we have to do is we have to open it with
live server we'll click on open it with
live server and you can see here after
every 3 second the page gets refreshed
right so this is how the refresh
property in metatag actually works till
now we came across certain types of tags
in HTM we have a good idea of how and
when to use any particular tag while
working with HTML now let's imagine a
situation where we are working on the
front end of any web page which contains
more than a, lines of code we are almost
almost finished with the front end but
suddenly we realize that we made an
error somewhere previously or we want to
change a particular piece of code let's
say in that case we can't go back
checking each line to find that
particular piece of code right that's
why comments can help us and save our
time a comment is common for almost all
programming languages the syntax May
differ in different languages but the
usage Remains the Same it is a line in
programming that does not affect the
output of the progr program it stays
there in the code but does not affect
the output by any means in HTML the way
of writing a comment is quite simple we
have been working with text for some
time now the Syntax for comments also
remains similar to them all we have to
do is we have to write here like we want
to add a comment here let's say so what
we have to do is we have to put an
exclamation mark and then we have to put
this now this is the Syntax for comments
in HTML now whatever thing will write
inside it will be treated as a comment
fine so one thing to notice here is that
there is an exclamation mark at the
start of every comment we use but not at
the end fine just keep this thing in
mind and we are good to go with comments
in HTM let's save our program and you
can see there is no change in the
browser so for your convenience what we
are going to do is we are going to add a
paragraph over here so let's say we are
writing over over here we are going
through comments in HTML let's save the
program and you can see that particular
paragraph in the browser so the comment
won't affect the outcome of any program
by any means
fine another use of comments is they can
be used to hide content now hiding
content means we can temporarily hide
any tag from the HTML document according
to our needs so let's say we have an
image over here and we want to see if
the web page will look good with the
image or without it so let's add an
image first what we'll do is we'll write
after this paragraph
tag IMG let's say the source
is inside images we have html.png this
is the image then we'll write here
alternate alternate will be let's say
HTML now save the program and you can
see the image over here but it's quite
large so let's fix this first we are
going to write here height and width so
we are using attributes basically so
we'll write your width width is going to
be 250 pixels again save the program and
here you can see we have a image
fine now to remove this image
temporarily what we have to do is we
have to put this whole image tag inside
the commment what we'll do is we'll
write over here the Syntax for comment
now this is the comment what we'll do is
we'll copy this image tag we'll cut it
from here and we'll paste it
inside this comment
fine now save the
program and the image is temporarily
removed from the browser right simple
and easy now a comment can be a single
line comment or a multi-line comment no
change in the Syntax for that anything
we put inside these tags will be taken
as a comment by the browser so what we
are trying to say here is comments are
very useful in programming it's just a
note for the programmer to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program or we can simply say with
commments we can place notifications and
reminders in a HTML code we have been
through the image tag previously if you
guys remember when we came across empty
elements in HTML there we saw the Syntax
for image tag in HTML actually the image
tag falls under the category of empty
elements in HTML that's why we saw it
there as well it means that this
particular tag in HTML does not require
any closing tag to work it has
attributes we'll go through them in a
moment before that let me clear this one
thing to you guys any image we see on a
web page is not inserted into that page
instead it is linked to a web page what
the image tag does it holds a space for
the referenced image you will understand
it much better in a while so let's go
through the syntax of adding an image or
ATT ing an image we can say to a web
page using the image tag is not at all a
task for the user it's the easiest thing
to do in HTML we can say that so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
body tag what we are going to do is we
are going to write here IMG so this is
the tag and we already know that this is
an empty element so it does not require
any closing
tag now inside the image tag we have to
add attributes so we'll write here SRC C
so let's discuss some important things
before we move ahead you can see over
here that we have used the SRC attribute
inside the image tag this is a necessary
attribute while using the image tag in
HTML why so this attribute specifies the
path to the image any image we want to
attach to our web page needs to be
stored somewhere either in the system or
it can be anywhere on the internet as
well so let's move move back to the main
folder so what we are going to do is we
are going to move back to our main HTML
folder so here we are inside the HTML
folder now what we are going to do is we
are going to make large icons over here
so here we are in the HTML folder you
can see we have all the HTML files over
here right here we have an image named
python so if we double click on it you
can see this is an image and the name of
this image is python right so what we
are going to do is we are going going to
click on it right click basically go to
properties and here you can see we have
the name of a file and then we have the
type type here is PNG PNG means portable
Network Graphics it is basically an
extension for images and pictures so
HTML do support other extensions like
jpeg GF SVG and many more other
extensions so we can use any of those
files with those extensions now to
attack this image to a web page we need
to provide the path to the system
through which the system can understand
that this particular image is stored in
this part of the system or the drive
fine so the path you can check here is
at the top of this window click on it
and you can see the path over here so
this is the path so this python file is
present inside the C drive users then we
have a name this folder name as Cal B
then we have desktop and HTML fine so
this is the path of a image let's move
back to vs code and we don't need the
whole path as of now because the current
HTML file we are in right now is present
inside the HTML folder so we don't need
to specify the whole path as of
now all we have to do is we have to
write the file name here inside the SRC
attribute what we'll do is we'll write
here the file name so a file name is
python. PNG fine so this is a file name
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here on the browser the
size is quite large as of now we'll see
how to manage this thing after some time
for now let's reduce the size of the
whole web page what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size and
you can see the whole image over here
fine another possibility is we can store
all the images inside a single folder so
here if we go back to a HTML folder here
you can see we have a folder named
images Right double click on it and you
can see we have different images present
over here we have three different images
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript we can
use any of these images so let's get
back to vs code again and the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
access any image from that particular
folder fine so what we are going to do
is we are going to write here after this
IMG then SRC now inside SRC we have to
write the folder name first fine so
we'll write here images then we'll use
slash and then we'll write the file name
so we have three different files over
here this is the benefit of using vs
code we have all the three files we can
use over here so let's use css.png as of
now close the image tag save the program
and you can see the image over here so
let's do one thing we are going to use
the B te use it now save the program and
let's use it once again so that it will
be easy for us to understand so here we
have two different images the python one
and the CSS one so basically what we
have to do is we have to give the
correct path of that particular image
fine so the next attribute we'll discuss
is the alt attribute or we can say the
alternate attribute let's write it over
here first what we are going to do is we
are going to write your alt press enter
and write something over here let's say
we are writing over here CSS so this alt
attribute we have here provides an
alternate text for an image if the user
for some reason cannot view it so
basically it can happen because of slow
connection and error in the source code
or in the source we can say or if the
user is using a screen reader so it can
be any of these reasons but if the user
is not able to see that picture then an
Al alternate text will come at Place
fine so the value of the alter attribute
should always describe the image so
that's why we have written over here CSS
so that the user can understand that
this particular image over here is a CSS
image or it can be basically anything
that describes the image fine so let's
do one thing here what we'll do is we'll
make an error over here in the SRC
attribute let's change the file name
over here let's say this is the file
name that's a simple error right nothing
major over here let's save the program
and you can see the image is not here
anymore
fine so I believe you guys might not be
able to see because I have to increase
the size for
that
so you can see here now there's no image
present at this particular part of a web
page because the source is wrong so the
file name is wrong basically instead of
that we have text present over here
which says C CSS fine so this is how the
alt attribute works in the image tag
further and talking about the actual
size of these images over here we can
change the size of these images in two
different ways so let's start with the
easier one first what we'll do is we'll
use the height and the width attribute
just like the source and Alternate
attributes we have these attributes are
also used within the image tag all we
have to do is we have to write
here height height is let's say 250
pixels and then we have width as well so
width again is let's say 250 pixels save
the program and you can see the image
height and width is now 250 pixels we
can do the same thing for this file as
well so what we'll do is we'll write
here width as let's say 100 pixels
and height as again 100 pixels save the
program and you can see the size of this
image is 100 pixels in width and height
now fine another way of using these
attributes is to use them within the
style tag we can use this tag anywhere
in the program although this tag is
related to CSS and we can also Define
these things in CSS files but as of now
we are not talking about that concept so
we'll stick to HTML only so what we'll
do is we'll write here to use the style
tag what we have to do is we have to
write
Here style now what we want to do is we
want to access the image tag so we have
to write here IMG curly braces now we
have to define the properties inside
here fine so what we'll do is we'll
Define the width over here as 500
pixels and the height as well fine
height is again going to be 500 pixels
now one thing to notice here is this
image tag or these properties will be
applied on both the tags because we are
using tag over here fine so we are
changing the properties of a tag so both
the image tag will be affected save the
program and you can see the image size
are now changed both are 500 pixels so
let's do one
thing let's remove it from here and this
as well now change the size to let's
say 200 pixels and 200 pixels save the
program and you can see we have both the
images over here both are 200 pixels in
width and height so this tag is also
working
fine what we summarize from this is we
can use these attributes within the
image tag itself or we can use the style
tag to change the style of the image so
these are some of the basic attributes
we can use within the image tag in HTML
I hope you guys got it try it by
yourself and let us know if you face any
problem a table is a set of data
elements that allows us to store or
represent data into rows and columns
just like we created cre tables in
normal life for representing the data
the same table we create in HTML as well
a table consists of rows and columns we
can arrange any kind of data like text
images links other table Etc into rows
and Columns of ss fine the table tag in
HTML is used to create a table so let's
do it here side by side and you guys
will get a better idea of what we are
talking about here so let's create a
simple table first we'll discuss each
step here so what we'll do is we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll
create a new tag so this table tag this
is a table tag whatever data we want to
put in the table will go inside this
table tag only now save the program and
you can see we are not able to see any
table here so we'll see it in a while
now let's add some data here first we
know that a table consists of rows and
columns right
the table row tag defines any Row in
HTML or in a table we can say the Syntax
for it goes like this what we'll do is
we'll write over here inside the table
tag only we'll write TR now this TR
represents table room fine one thing to
notice here is we are nesting one tag
inside another tag the table tag is
responsible for creating a space for the
table the table row tag is used to add a
row to that particular table now the
next step is to add columns inside the
table each row can contain one or more
than one column the table data tag is
used to add data in columns so it might
sound a bit confusing at the moment but
let's do it over here and you guys will
know how easy it is to add data in
column what we have to do is we have to
write here simply TD TD stands for table
data and we have to put the data inside
this t TD tag TD means table data tag
and this tag represent a column in a
table fine so let's write it over here
R1 comma C1
fine let's give some space over here as
well then again we are going to use the
TD
tag so we'll write R
comma f
now here we are we have added two
columns inside the first row so let's
check the output now save it and you can
see we have the data over here this is
basically the table data R1 means Row
one C1 means column 1 and similarly R1
means Row one C2 means column so this is
a single row with two different columns
fine now we are not able to see the
structure of the table right in order to
get the structure of the table we have
to include an attribute inside the table
tag what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the table
tag we have to write here border and
inside border we have to mention the
Border width so which is basically 1
pixel right now save the program and you
can see this border attribute will show
the Border all around the table and the
S
fine we can change the width of this
border by changing the value of Border
over here so for example if you write 10
pixels and now if we save the program
you can see the Border
changing so this looks nice right so for
now we'll write here one pixel only so
this is the table border moving ahead
let's add another row over here first
what we'll do is we'll use the table row
tag again and the rest HTML will take
care of we can add a row in a table
anywhere in the HTML keep this thing in
mind until the table row tag is nested
inside the table tag HTML will man
manage to add the row in the table fine
what we'll do is we'll write here after
this table row we are going to add
another row so we are going to write
here TR now inside this we have to write
some data or we can say we have to
include some columns so this is going to
be the row two so we are going to write
here R2 C1 for column 1 and then we'll
write here TD
again we'll write here R2 then we have
have C fine now save the program and you
can see we have another row over here
which says R2 and C2 and R1 and C1
obviously so adding rows and columns
seems an easy task now right I hope you
guys got it moving further we'll now
discuss the table heading time so every
time we arrange some data in the table
we need some reference to that data
right let's say we are creating a bill
for a restaurant what we need need in
that bill are the name of the product
and the price
fine so we need to mention it at the top
of each column to do so we need to use
the table heading tag the Syntax for
this tag is pretty easy what we have to
do is we have to write here after the
first table rag the Syntax for this tag
is pretty easy what we have to do is we
have to write here before the first
table rag so we have to write here only
because this is going to be the heading
so it has to be present at the top of
the table before any row and column we
have to add another row over here now
inside this row we have to mention
headings fine so we have to use the
table heading Tex so the syntax is this
now we have to write here the first
heading so let's say first heading is
item and then we have the second heading
as
as price fine save the program and you
can see we have two headings over here
now let's change the tables data first
and we'll create a bill for some
restaurant let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to add
another column over here in each row so
we are going to add a column let's say
it's Sr number so it's going to be the
serial number then we have to change the
data here only fine so we'll remove
the data from
here from each row basically so we'll
remove this as
well and we'll remove this as well fine
now this is going to be the first row
after let's save the program once and
you can see over here we have empty
cells present over here we have three
headings serial number item and price
let's work on the first row now we need
another table data tag so the serial
number is going to be one for first row
let's say the item name is t then we
have the price so let's say the price is
going to be rupees 20 save the program
and we have our first row over here now
for the second row we have to put the
serial number as two then we
have coffee or let's
say black coffee then we have to use
another table data tag now we have to
mention the price the price is let's say
34 black
coffee and we are good to go with this
as well we are going to copy this whole
row from here we're going to paste it
here the serial number is going to be
three the item name is let's say
capuccino so we'll write
here
capucino and the price is is going to be
a little higher than black coffee let's
say 60 for
capuccino and then we are going to add
another item over here fine so the
serial number is going to be four
instead of capuccino let's write
here espresso then let's change the
price to
90 save the program and you can see the
table over here it looks nice
right now we have three columns the
procedure is the same and you just saw
it right just like we added the table
heading here in this table similarly we
can give a caption to the table as well
like here we can write the restaurant's
names or we can write the bill or
anything we want so that particular
caption will be present at the top of
the table so what we have to do is we
have to write here at the top before
this table row tag before the first row
we have to write here caption caption is
another tag now we have to write here
let's say the resturant name is XY
z Restaurant save the program and you
can see the caption over here as XY Z
Resturant fine now the next thing we are
going to discuss in this video is the
row span and the call span attributes
suppose we want to merge two cells and
create a single one merging two cells
means let's say we want to merge these
two cells fine this one and this one so
for that we can use the column span
attribute or the row span attribute
fine so for example let's suppose we
want to print the grand total of all the
items for that we don't need the serial
number so what we can do is we can merge
the first two columns of this row with
the help of call spin so we are going to
create another row over here and we are
going to merge these two columns fine in
the new room so what we have to do here
is we have to write here after this row
we are going to add another row so for
that we have to write here table row tag
now inside this table row tag we have to
mention the table data tag and then
we'll write here calls span calls span
is going to be two because we want to
merge two cells fine now what we'll do
is we'll write
here grand total and we are going to add
another cell so we are going to write TD
again so let's add it and the total
price is I guess 200 so we'll write here
200 save the program and you can see we
have two columns merged over here
fine similarly we can also use the rose
pan attribute whenever we want to merge
two rules one thing to keep in mind is
we can use these attributes within the
table table data tag only not in any
other tag for
example if we want to merge two rows
fine so what we can do is we can write
here Rose pen and we are going to write
here to save the program and you can see
these two rows are now merged
fine so let's remove it for now and save
the program again so this table looks
nice
now the next attribute we have in tables
is the background color attribute we can
use this attribute to change the
background color of the whole table or
of any particular row or column fine we
just have to use the BG color attribute
as per our requirement for example if we
want to change the background color of
the first row which contains all the
headings what we have to do is we have
to write here inside this first table
row T we have to write here BG color and
this is an attribute now let's say we
want to color it as red fine save the
program and you can see the out the
whole row is red in color now fine
similarly we can change the Border color
of the whole table with the help of
Border color attribute we have to write
here inside the table tag so this is the
main tag and we have to write
here border color is equals
to let's
say yellow fine save the program and you
can see the border is now yellow in
color one thing I want to tell here is
we can change the background color of
any particular set fine so let's say we
want to change the background color of
espresso fine let's do it let's change
this background color to Brown fine so
here we have espresso inside this table
data typ what we have to do is we have
to write here BG color and we have to
mention here Brown save the program and
you can see it's brown in color
fine so guys this is basically how we
can create an add data in a table in
HTML I hope you guys got what we went
through in today's video try doing it by
yourself and let us know if you have any
confusion lists are used to group
related pieces of information so that
they are evidently associated with each
other and easy to read of course it
makes a web page easier to read for the
user right there are three different
types of lists present in HTML the
ordered list unordered list and the
definition list we'll discuss each of
these list in detail so now that we have
a basic idea of what lists are let's
move on to the programming part
directly the ordered list is the first
list we have in
HTM it uses different schemes of numbers
to list our items the o tag is used to
create an ordered list in htl so an
ordered list uses numbers or some sort
of notation that indicates a series of
item an ordered list can start with
numbers like 1 and continue through 2 3
4 and so on it can also start with
alphabets like a b and continues through
CD and so on Roman numerals can also be
used in ordered
lists so let's create one list over here
first and you guys will get a better
understanding of the ordered list in
HTML the syntax goes like this we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll
write o o stands for ordered list to add
items to a list we have to use the lii
tag lii stands for list items so this is
the Alli tag anything will write inside
this particular lii tag will be added as
a list item to that particular list
fine we have to put each list item
inside this particular tag in order to
add it it to the list so let's add
something to this list first what we'll
do is we'll write inside here let's say
app fine then we'll add another item
over here so let's say we have
mango let's add some more items and we
have banana and lastly let's say we
have orange fine so we have four fruits
here we we are including them in a list
now save the program and you can see
here we have a list present over here in
the browser this list over here has
numbers right it has 1 2 3 and four we
can change them to alphabets or Roman
numerals for that we have to use the
type attribute within the O TP so what
we have to do is we have to go here and
we have to write here type press enter
and if you're using vs code you can see
the types of ordered list we can write
here one we can write here capital a
capital A is used for uppercase letters
we can write here small a for lowercase
letters we can write here capital I for
uppercase numerals then we can write
here small I for lowercase numerals so
let's write here small I first and you
can see the list is changed there are
lowercase numerals now which starts from
1 2 3 and four we can use here capital I
as well for uppercase numerals similarly
we can use
capital A for uppercase alphabets and
small a for lowercase alphabets you guys
can see it here
right we can also specify the starting
point in an ordered list and for that we
have to use the start attribute we don't
have to do much we have to write here
start and we have to write here any
number let's say we are using lowercase
alphabets right so if you write here
five now the fifth alphabet is e the
list will will start with E now save the
program and you can see the list starts
with e f g and H
right one thing to keep in mind while
using the start attribute is this
attribute works with numeric values only
so I hope you guys must have got an idea
about the ordered list in HTML moving
ahead let's discuss the unordered list
now an unordered list typically is a
bulleted list of items it is basically a
collection of related items with with no
special order or SQL fine so let's
create one unordered list here as
well the UL tag creates an unordered
list in HTML we'll write here ul ul
stands for unordered list and now we
have to include list items fine the LI
tag will be used for that we have to
write here Li let's add some items over
here so let's write the name of some
vegetables now so let's say we are
writing over here potato then we
have let's say
carrot and then we
have let's say
cabbage these all are vegetable names so
let's say we are adding one more here
let's say it is reddish
fine that's it save the program and you
can see we have another list over here
this type of list in HTML is known as
unordered list you can see these bullets
over here in front of each list item
right
we can change the type here as well with
the help of type attribute for an
unordered list the type attribute can
have three different types Square Circle
or disk the default one we have here in
this particular list is the disk so if
we write here inside the UL tag
type and if we specify here the type as
let's say Circle save the program and
you can see it over here we have Circle
CES over here now right similarly we can
use squares as well so if we write
here Square save the program and you can
see it changed to
square so the last type of list we are
left with is the definition list in HTML
a description list or a definition list
is a list of terms with a description of
each term in a definition list entries
are listed like a dictionary or
encyclopedia if it sounds a bit confus
using then let's create one here and you
guys will understand so the DL tag is
used to define a definition list in HTML
the list item tag is not used within the
definition list instead we use two
different tags here the DT tag is used
for the term and the d d tag is used for
the definition fine for example if we
create one list over here so firstly
what we have to do is we have to define
the list so for that we have the DL t
for definition list now inside inside
here we have to mention the term so
let's say the first term we have is HTML
and for the definition of HTML we have
to use the DD tag fine so let's say HTML
stands for
hypertext
markup language
fine okay let's add another item over
here so let's say the second term we
have is
CSS okay CSS we'll write over here then
we'll write inside the definition let's
say CSS stands for
cascading
stylesheet fine save the program and you
can see here we have another list
present in the browser which defines the
terms HTML and CSS we can add as many
items as we want in these type of lists
we can add more than one or we can just
add one item it totally depends on us so
I hope you guys must have understood
what lists are in HTML by now try it by
yourself and let us know what you
learned before discussing text links in
HTML let's understand what a link is any
website we go through in today's world
must contain a link a link in HTML is an
object that allows us to a new location
when we click on it provides a simple
way of navigation between different
pages present on the web these links in
HTML are know known as hyperlinks and
hyperlinks allows us to navigate between
websites by clicking on Words emails and
images thus we can create hyperlinks
using text or images available on a web
page so let's go through an example of
what links are and how they make it
easier for the user to navigate within
web pages here we have a sample web page
we created it when we went through
jQuery on this website you can see we
have words present over here like home
about categories top rated and content
fine if we click on any of these word it
takes us to that particular section of
the web page what actually happens is
when we mention these words on the HTML
file we provided them with specific
links so that it will be easier for the
viewer to get to any particular part of
the website without much hassle I hope
you guys now have got an idea of what
links are let's see how how these links
are added to a Webb page now in this
particular video we'll go through text
links in HTML we'll cover image links
and email links in the upcoming videos
so don't worry about them now in HTML
the anchor tag is used to specify a link
anything present between the opening and
closing anchor tag becomes the part of a
link and we can click that part to reach
to the linked web page or document so
the syntax for for the anchor tag goes
like this inside the body tag we have to
write here e so this is a anchor tag and
anything goes in between there will be
considered as a part of the link
fine now the next thing we'll do is
We'll add the link to a website here to
specify a link in HTML the HF attribute
is used this attribute specifies the URL
of the web page or website or document
the link goes through so HF is basically
a attribute fine so what we have to do
is we have to write here inside the
anchor tag we have to mention the HF
attribute and now we have to write the
URL of website over here fine so let's
say the URL of a website is
www.g
google.com fine and the text will be
let's say Google
fine now save the program and you can
see here we have Google written over
here on the web page in blue color it is
purple for now you will get to know
about it later on in this video
only so the URL we mentioned over here
inside the anchor tag will take us to
the homepage of Google search engine
click on it and you can see here we are
on Google's homepage right so moving
ahead let's discuss the two different
types of URLs we have in HTML the two
types of URLs are absolute URL and
relative
Ur the URL we used here in this example
which navigates the user to Google's
homepage is an example of an absolute Ur
basically when a full web address is
mentioned in the href attribute it
refers to an absolute URL on the other
hand the relative URL refers to a local
link a link to a page within the same
website or without the https and www
part fine the Syntax for this is also a
bit different so let's go through it
what we'll do is we'll first create
another web page for this so let's
create one here we have to name it so
let's say we are writing over here
about.
HTML oh let's write some code over
here let's say we are writing over here
this is the about section of our website
so we'll write here
H2 and about us and let's write a
paragraph here as well we'll write here
welcome to
a YouTube channel fine so we are done
with it let's save this and let's open
it with live server once and you can see
it's working totally fine this is let's
say the about a section of a website now
what we'll do is we'll move back to a
original file so we have this original
file over here and we'll create a link
over here fine basically what we are
doing is is we are linking these two
HTML files fine now in here what we'll
do is we'll create another link which
will redirect us to that about us page
so for that we have to write here a hre
and we have to close the anchor tag fine
so in here we have to write the file
name so we'll write here about. HTML and
we'll write here about us
fine save the program now and you can
see we have the word about us present
over here click on it and it will take
us to the About Us section of a website
or to the about us page of our website
you can see it over here now the
reference to adding a local page is the
same as attaching an image to a web page
we can provide the path of that
particular page inside the href
attribute moving ahead let's discuss the
target attribute in Anchor tag whenever
we click on a link it opens a web page
in the same window by replacing the
current web page this happens by default
in HTML fine we can change this to
either within the same window or in a
new window the target attribute can have
four different values the four values
can be self blank parent and top so self
is used to open the related document
within the same window for example if we
use this particular attribute over here
inside this anchor tag we'll write here
Target then we'll write here _ s and
save this program and we'll refresh this
page once again one thing to keep in
mind is we have to write the value like
this only with the underscore present
before the value fine now save the
program and now if we click on the link
over here the about us link the new
document will be opened in the same
window only this is the default value as
well in any web page so if we want to
change the document to open in a new
window we have to write
here instead of self so let's do it for
this link now what we'll do is we'll
write Target over here Target will be
set to blank with an underscore save the
program move back to the web page and
click on Google over here you can see
this link is opening in a new window now
fine similarly we have the top and
parent values as the parent value opens
the document in the parent frame and the
top will open it in full body of the
window we'll discuss them later when we
go through HTML frames in the upcoming
videos one more thing we can do with
links is to change the color of a link
for that we have three different
attributes a link V Link and
Link a link refers to an active link We
link on the other hand refers to a
visited Link and Link ref refers to the
color of the normal link we can mention
these three attributes inside the body
tag only if we want to make similar
changes to all the links present on the
website if you want to do it for one
single link what we have to do is we
have to mention these three attributes
inside the anchor tag of that particular
link only fine the syntax goes like this
for now we'll mention them inside the
body tag so we'll write here link link
is is going to be yellow in color then
we have a link so a link is going to be
let's say brown and then we have we link
fine so we link is going to be let's say
green fine save the program and you can
see Google and about us are now green in
color because they are already visited
link so what we'll do is We'll add
another link over here we'll write a hre
so let's use
any HTML file from here so let's use the
meta HTML one so we'll write here meta
do
HTML Target will set to let's
say blank fine we are going to open it
in a new window so let's say we are
writing over here meta save the program
and you can see Meta over here which is
also in green color because these all
these three links are visited click on
it and you can see the color changing to
Brown fine because it states that these
links are active as well
fine now let's talk about the default
color of an HTML link as well so an
unvisited Link in HTML is underlined and
blue in color a visited link is
underlined and purple in color that's
why this particular Link at the start
was in purple color an active link is
underline and red in color so this is
the task for you guys you have to use
these attributes to change the color of
a link present on a web page so I hope
you guys must have got an idea by now
about the anchor tag in HTML now that we
know enough about links in HTML and we
saw previously how to use it with a
specific word or phrases in HTML we'll
do the same thing but this time we are
going to do it with images only now a
link in HTML is an object that allows us
to a new location when we click on it it
provides a simple way of navigation
between different pages present on the
web just a quick revision of what links
are in HTML so we already know how to
attach an image to a web page in HTML
the image tag is used for it now to add
a link within an image we have to Nest
one tag inside the other it's not as
hard as it sounds so let's do it here
and you will understand it much better
we'll use the image tag within the
anchor tag first of all we'll write here
in inside the body tag of a HTML
document we'll write a then this is the
anchor tag we have to write here href
href is an attribute we came across this
in the previous video so now what we'll
do is we'll write inside here the
reference to a web page so we'll let's
say write here
https then we have to write here
this let's say we are writing here
www.google.com fine now the anchor tag
is ready let's recall what we did with
text in the last part we simply wrote
the text between the anchor tag and the
browser treated that text as a link fine
now what we have to do is to add an
image in place of that text so we'll
simply Nest the image tag here what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
anchor TCH inside the body of anchor TCH
basically so we will write here image so
this is our tag now we have to add an
image over here fine so let's say we are
writing over here SRC now we have this
image present inside the images folder
so let's use one image from this and we
have to write here alt alt is going to
be HTML for this that's it we have used
the image over here save the program and
you can see we have an image over here
on the browser the size is quite large
right so let's fix it first so what
we'll do is we'll use the height and the
width attribute within the image tag so
we'll write here height height is going
to be 200 pixel then we have the width
as well width is again going to be 200
pixel save the program and here you can
see the image size is fine now if we
click anywhere on the image then the hom
page of chrome will open because the
image is attached to that link only we
have written over over here
www.google.com fine so it will take us
to the homepage of Google search engine
click on the image and you can see it
takes us to the homepage of Google so
attaching a link to an image is shortly
one of the easiest task to perform in
HTML we have used an absolute URL over
here in this particular image we can
also use a relative reference the syntax
will remain the same so let's do that as
well what we'll do is we'll write over
here inside the body tag again we'll use
another image so let's use the break tag
over here then we'll write here a href
href is going to be a relative reference
so let's say we have this about. HTML
file in a system so let's use it for now
so we'll write here about.
HTML then we'll Nest the image tag
inside here so we'll write here
IMG now we have to close this tag we'll
write here SRC SRC is going to be inside
the images folder again we are going to
use css.png
we'll write here alt alt is going to be
CSS then we
have height height is going to be 200
pixel and width width is again going to
be 200 pixel the same thing we did with
this image as well save the program and
you can see we have another image over
here which says CSS 3 and we have used a
relative reference or we can say a
relative URL over here for this image so
this image will take us to about. HTML
we can do many such task using images in
HTML so let's click on the image first
you can see the image over here click on
it and you can see we are in the about
us page right it says Welcome to our
YouTube channel so this is how we can
use images within anchor tag in
HTML the attributes for both the tags
Remains the Same we can still use the
target attribute within the Anor tag for
the new web page to open either in the
same window or in a new one so I hope
you guys must have understood by now
adding an image and attaching a link to
it is quite easy I want you guys to give
it a try and learn something new out of
it so that's all for this video guys the
easiest part to do on a web page is
adding an email link you already have
seen this feature on so many websites
they provide the user with an option to
write an email to them in case of any
query request or complete but in some
cases it can cause unnecessary spamming
problems for our email accounts so we'll
quickly go through the syntax as there
is not too much to explore in this
particular topic the anchor tag and the
href attribute remain the same here as
well so the syntax goes like this we'll
right here inside the body Tech we'll
use the anchor tag so we'll write here a
then inside href we have to write
something but before that let's close
the anchor tag and we'll write some text
over here so let's say we are writing
over here like
write okay so let's say we are writing
over here contacts fine so this is going
to be the text now we have to provide
the mail ID or the receiver's mail ID
inside the href attribute but for that
we have to write here mail to mail to is
a special keyword used in this
particular attribute so inside here we
we have to write the email ID so let's
say we are writing over here email
to or we can say email
demo at
theate
gmail.com so this is the receivers email
ID let's say so we have specified the
email ID here inside the HF attribute
now save this program and you can see we
have the link over here on the browser
you can see it over here we have contact
us click on it and it will open the mail
app in our system we can choose any app
from here of our choice so guys this is
how we can link an email to our web page
another thing we can do here is we can
open this email in any particular app as
well for example if we want to open it
in Gmail we have to follow certain steps
we are not doing it here because of some
privacy but let me tell you guys how to
achieve it so first of all you have to
go to Gmail then click on compose write
the receiver ID in the two part now copy
the full link for the whole web page I'm
talking about this particular link so we
have to copy that link and we have to
paste it inside the HF attribute of a
HTML file we can use the target
attribute as well to open it in a new
tab and that's it so guys I hope you
must have got an idea about how email
links actually work in HTM try doing it
by yourself and let us know if you face
any problem in general term a frame
refers to a support structure we go
through this word in our daily light a
frame can be a piece of furniture it can
be the frame of a building or a car or
it can be anything that gives it its
shape basically before if frames were
introduced there was a concept of frames
in HTM let's discuss it a bit HTML
frames were used to divide a browser's
window into multiple sections where each
section is capable of loading a separate
HTML document a collection of frames
present on a web page refers to a frame
set there were certain disadvantages of
using frames in HTML like smaller
devices cannot cope up with frames often
because the screen is not big enough to
be divided up a page may be displayed
differently on different computers due
to different screen resolutions the
concept of frames was pretty similar to
tables in HTML where we can divide a
window into rows and columns and each
frame will be able to load separate HTML
docum document with the introduction of
HTML 5 the concept of frames was removed
from HTML so if we try to use frames in
2022 we can't do that the replacement of
frames was also introduced with the name
I frames iframe stands for an inline
frame it is used to embit another
document within the current HTML
document the basic use of this tag is to
embit media files like videos on a web
page we can display a secondary web page
on a main page by using this tag so
let's go through the syntax of iframes
now and you guys will get a better idea
the most basic attribute used in iframe
is the SRC attribute this attribute is
used to provide the file name or the
website name we want to embit in a HTML
document the syntax goes like this the
tag we have is if frame so we'll write
your I frame now this is a element and
inside there we have to write the s SRC
attribute now inside the SRC attribute
we can either provide the website name
or the HTML file for now we'll use the
file so we have a file named embit do
htl fine so let me quickly show you the
ed. HTML over here so this is our file
this is just a basic HTML file within
image with address tag then we have a
paragraph and then we have the code tag
fine so let's open it with live server
once and you can see we have this HTML
file we have a basic image with some
text present over here now we want to
embed this HTML document with a main
HTML document so let's move back to our
main document first so this is our main
document now we have already added this
file name this .html inside the SRC
attribute now save the program and you
can see here we have a small window on
the browser where the embedded document
is open we can scroll down to check
everything we have on the ID HTML file
we have it over here right so this is
how the if frame tag actually works the
size of this box or window we can say is
quite small right we can change it
according to our needs with the help of
the height and width attributes so we
have to write here inside the iframe tag
we have to write here
height and let's say the height is going
to be 300 pixels fine then we'll write
here width width is again going to be
300 pixels save the program and you can
see here the size is
changed it's larger and the image is
more visible now we can also add a video
file here and we can make it play this
is why the iframes in htmls are mainly
used so other attributes we have in this
particular tag are the title attribute
this attribute is used to specify the
title of the iame so that screen readers
use this to read out what the content of
the High frame is what we have to do is
we have to include it over
here we have to write here title and we
can give any title so let's say for now
we have frame save it and you can see
this is a document and whenever the
screen reader will go through it it will
let the user know about the content
present inside the frame now as you can
see here on the browser you will notice
that this particular if frame has a
border right a shadow like thing on the
top and left side of the box so let me
Zoom it and here you can see we have
border on the top and left hand side of
this box or window we can say or frame
we can also say but there's no border on
the right and on the bottom right so
what we can do is we can remove it with
the help of style attribute so what
we'll do is we'll use the style
attribute over here inside if frame tyag
so we'll write Here style now inside
style what we have to mention is we have
to mention the Border property so border
is going to be none save the program and
and you can see that the border is not
present anymore you can see it over here
there's no border as of now we can also
change the border so we can either
remove it or we can change it so for
changing the Border what we have to do
is we have to write here instead of n we
have to mention here the Border value so
let's say the Border value is going to
be 3 pixels
solid and black
fine now the Border will be of three
pixels solid in nature and black and
color save the program and here we have
the result on our browser you can see
the Border over here so there were many
attributes present within the iframe
element in HTML but with HTML file most
of them were depreciated one thing I
want to mention here is that we can also
open a website inside this iame just
provide the website name as we did for
links and it will work but many websites
don't allow this feature like Google
Facebook and Instagram so the task for
for you guys is to check this feature
with the website and let us know which
website you used and if it worked
elements in HTML can be categorized into
two different categories inline elements
and Block Level elements let's go
through the inline elements first and
you guys will get an idea about them
inline elements in HTML take as much
space as they need and we can add
content within them without a line break
the Bold italic and underline elements
are some of the elements that fall under
the category of inline elements for
example if we have a paragraph written
over in the browser and we want to use
any of these elements within the
paragraph then we don't need a line
break in that case all we have to do is
to use these elements and without a
doubt that thing will work let's use it
over here so what we'll do is we'll just
write over here inside the body tag
let's use a paragraph over here so we'll
write here
this is a and now we'll use the Bold
element so let's say we are writing over
here this is a
paragraph So This is a basic paragraph
save the program and you can see it here
on the browser we have a paragraph and
this particular word over here is bolder
you can see that paragraph over here is
bolder in nature we don't need any line
breakes here right the element we used
here is B and it is an inline element
this was basic example of inline
elements in
HTML Block Level elements on the other
hand appears on the screen as if they
have a line break before and after them
there is no need to specify the line
break they automatically take the full
line or width of the web page and create
a line withd the paragraph element
header element and the list elements
fall under the category of Block Level
elements anything that follows these
type of elements appears on its own new
line the most important Block Level
element is the div element it is used to
create the actual layout of the web page
by grouping similar types of elements
together we can also provide similar CSS
properties to a group of elements
present within the div tag so let's just
use this tag over here and you guys will
understand it much better for using a
div tag we have to write here inside the
body tag we have to write
here div div stands for division fine
this tag over here will create a
container type of thing in the browser
and anything we write inside it will
follow a specific pattern in the browser
for example if we write here inside the
div tag so let's say we have a heading
tag present over here so we'll write
here this is first group fine so let's
say we are creating a group over here
now we'll write here this is first Str
now H4 stands for heading tag is also an
example of Block Level elements so we
don't need any line break over here now
over here we'll use the paragraph tag
which is also a block level element now
let's say we are writing over here list
of cars
fine now after that let's say we are
using an unordered list over here so
we'll write a ul and inside this we'll
add some elements so let's say we are
writing over here
the name of some cards so let's say we
have Honda over here then we have let's
say hday and let's add some more
elements so let's say we have BMW as
well and finally we
have a fine so these are the four
different list items we have now we have
enough content inside the div save the
program and you can see here on the
browser that we have a list present over
here now we can apply similar CSS
properties to each of the elements
present inside the div tag what we have
to do is we have to use the div tag over
here so what we can do is we can use
this div tag inside the CSS file as well
but for now we are going to style it on
the HTML part only so what we'll do is
we'll use the style attribute and inside
style attribute we'll write over here
color so let's say the color is going to
be blue so this is the font color so we
have to write here blue and after this
we are going to use another property
let's say so let's say we are writing
over here border B is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and let's
say black in color fine now save the
program and you guys are able to see the
area acquired by the whole div tag we
can align these items present inside the
div tag later with the help of CSS
properties we'll discuss it in another
video when we go through CSS for now
let's create another division over here
so what we are going to do is we are
going to create another division so
let's write over here div again so this
is another division we have so what we
are going to do is we are going to copy
it from
here and we are going to paste it inside
this D tag so we are going
to name it as the second group we have
so we'll write here second and instead
of cars we are going to write here the
name of bike
manufacturers so we'll write here let's
say Ben and we
have duetti and BMW will remain the same
because it is a Car and Bike
manufacturer then we'll write here let's
say at the
end Suzuki fine now save the program and
you guys can see we we have another list
over here what we'll do
is we'll use some CSS properties here as
well so we are going to write here
inside this Dave tag we are going to use
the style attribute now inside this we
are going to use the color color is
going to be let's say red and we'll
write here border as well so border is
going to be 2
pixels solid in nature and let's say
green in color fine
save the program and you guys can see
here we have another division present
over here so you can see it is in a new
line but it's not clearly visible so
let's do one thing we are going to use
the break tag over here save the program
now and you guys can see both the
containers now are clearly visible fine
these borders are not visible by default
we can make them visible with the help
of CSS properties like we did here now
you guys might be wondering what the use
of this D tag is so whenever we create
the layout of any website this is the
tag we use the most to provide better
structure to a web page this tag along
with CSS is of more use than any other
HTML tag present today you will get a
better idea about it when we go through
CSS in the upcoming videos any web page
we create using HTML always has a white
background which sometimes may look a
bit boring to the user so is there any
way through which we can make it look a
bit attractive to the user yes in HTML
we have the background color or the
background attribute this attribute is
used to change the background of either
the whole web page or of any particular
tag we can use an image in the
background or we can just change the
background color we'll do both in
today's video so let's start by changing
the background color of the whole body
first to change the background color of
the whole body we can use the BG color
attribute
BG stands for background color and we
can use the name of any color it's hex
value or the RGB value of any color now
the fun part is this attribute is
depreciated in HTML 5.0 a lot of such
things happen in HTML 5 so let's see if
we can still use this attribute to
change the background color of the whole
body what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the body tag we'll simply write
here BG color and we'll the color new so
let's say we are writing red over
here you can see the attribute is
written in red color over here the BG
color we are talking about this
attribute so it's red in color it means
that this is not working anymore so
let's save the program and you can see
here on the browser that this thing is
still working now to change the
background color of any particular area
like we can say a division we have to
use the background color attribute we'll
change the background color of a whole
division for that what we'll do is we'll
write some code first so we have used
the same code from the previous part
wherein we discuss the div tag in HTML
we have a list present inside this
container save the program and you can
see here on the browser right the
background color of this division is red
for now because the background color of
the whole body is red so it's invisible
basically so what we'll do is we'll
remove this BG color from here save it
now and you can see we have this
division over
here now what we have to do is we have
to change the background color of this
particular division so for that we'll
move to our division and here you can
see we have the style attribute so we
have to provide the value or the
property inside the style attribute only
so we have color and Border over here
already now what we'll do is we'll write
over here background color and the
background color is going to be let's
say Aqua so if you're using vs code you
can see see we have this colors over
here and what we can do is we can change
the color from here and it will set the
RGB values accordingly fine so vs code
provides us with this
option now save the program and you can
see the background color of this
particular division is changed now so
this is how we can change the background
color of any Division if we try to use
the BG color attribute or the BG
attribute whichever we used in the body
tag previously it will not work over
here because that thing is depreciated
from HTML 5 and to change the background
color in HTML 5 or above versions We
have to use the background color
property only inside the style attribute
we can also use the same style attribute
to change the background color of the
whole body but we have to do is we have
to write here inside the body tag so
here's our body tag and we have to write
here Style style is the attribute and
here we have to
write background color so the background
color is going to be let's say a little
different for now what we'll do is we'll
use the brown color over here save it
now and you can see we have brown
background for the whole body tag right
for the whole body we have the brown
background another thing we can do with
background is we can change the
background of any division or the whole
body with an image as the property name
inside the style attribute will change
and we have to provide the URL for that
image that's it so let's do it here
we'll try doing it with the division
first so what we'll do is we'll write
here inside the div tag so we have this
division over here we'll remove this
background color property from here and
instead of background color we have to
write here background image so this is
the property name now inside here we
have to provide the URL so URL is the
path of a image so we have a images
folder present in a system so this is
the folder now we have these images
present over here what we'll do is we'll
use background 1.png
save it now and you can see the change
in the background so this is basically a
transparent background so let's make
some changes over here what we'll do is
we'll remove this style attribute from
the body tag and save it now you can see
this is the background we can also
change the color of this particular div
tag so the font color basically so let's
make it black for now and we have to
move the marker from here to Black and
and it's good to go save it now and you
can see we have black font color over
here so you can see the image in the
background of this particular division
for
now we can do the same thing with the
whole body as well right here inside the
body tag so we have to write here again
we have to mention the style attribute
inside the style attribute we have to
mention background image the URL the
process will remain the same we have to
provide the image path so we have images
and then we'll provide background two do
jpg save it now and you can see the
background it's a little bit tricky to
see it over here because the image is
not clearly visible so for that we have
another property present in HTML so what
we have to do is we have to write here
with background image we have to pass
the property
as background size and the value is
going to be
cover save it now and you can see now
the image is clearly visible so the font
is not visible because the image color
and the font color is quite similar so
we can change it from here so what we
have to do is we have to change the
color again so let's do it once again
and now we'll try to use white save it
now and you can see this over here so
this is not clearly visible but this is
how we can change the background of any
particular division or the body tag in
HTML so Guys these are the few ways to
change the background of any web page
using HTML I hope you guys got it the
task for you guys is to use a JF file
here and see if that thing works or not
not much of a task just change the file
name here and we have to pass the file
name with dogf as extension just change
the file name and it will work as it's
quite obvious that while working on any
web page we need to make sure that it
looks attractive to the user to gain
more of their attention what colors can
do to a web page is quite
understandable and we need to make sure
that colors present on a web page should
be at Point the question that arises
here is how we can achieve that is it
possible to do it with the help of HTML
only yes it's possible to do so before
we move on and see how let me tell you
guys that we can achieve the same thing
with the help of CSS as well CSS stands
for cascading style sheet in fact CSS is
always a better option because it helps
us does make the whole document not only
cleaner but also provides some extra
features in it now what if we don't have
any CSS knowledge how HTML can be used
to make change in the color scheme of
any web page the first thing to keep in
mind while using HTML for making color
changes is the style attribute we have
been through this attribute already and
we know that this particular attribute
is used to make style changes to any
particular HTML element or the whole
document let's take an example here
where we'll use a division and we'll
change the background color and the font
color of that particular division we'll
also change the Border color for that
we'll write here so let's create the
division first so we'll create the
division using the div tag so we'll
write here div now inside div We'll add
a heading so first add a heading let's
say so let's say the heading is this is
an ex exam fine now let's add some
paragraph over here so we'll use the P
tag for that or the paragraph tag we can
say so let's say we are writing over
here there are three
different
methods to
change
the color in a web page fine so we'll
write in
a web page fine we are done with the
paragraph now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to add an
unordered list over here so for that
we'll use the UL tag which stand for
unordered list now we have to add the
list elements inside here so let's say
we
have color names as the first option
then we
have let's say the hex codes so we'll
write here hex codes and finally let's
say we
have RGB values fine so we'll write here
RGB values
so here we are done with the basic
container the next thing we'll do is
we'll make the Border visible so first
of all save the program and here you can
see we have all the data over here we
have a heading we have a paragraph and
three different list title fine now
we'll use the style attribute inside the
div tag to make the Border visible first
so what we'll do is we'll go to the div
tag over here we'll use the style
attribute we'll write Here
style and here we have the style
attribute now inside this we'll write
border now the Border will take three
different values first of all we'll
write here the Border size so let's say
the border is going to be 2 pixel thick
and the
border is going to be solid in nature so
basically we have written solid over
here save the program and here you can
see on the browser that we have a border
present around the whole division this
is basically the whole area acquired by
this div element now you can see here
that we didn't specify any color of our
own choice here right the default color
of this border is black however we can
change this color from the border
property present inside the style
attribute so it takes three parameters
by default we have given two here we
have given the Border size and the
Border nature the third one will be the
color of this border so what we'll do is
we'll basically write here let's say red
fine red here is the color name save the
program and you can see here the Border
color is red now it's easy right in the
same way we can change the background
color of this whole division as well the
property name will change what we have
to do is we have to write here after
border so we have border over here now
after border we have to put a semicolon
over here and after this we have to
write
here
background color fine so we have the
background color prop property over here
now what we have to do is we have to
write the name of our background color
so let's say the background color of
this property is going to be Aqua for
now right here Aqua save the program and
you can see here the background color
has changed now this background color
property has the capability to change
the background color of any particular
element or the whole body you can
witness the change here on the browser
you have already witnessed it it can be
used to change the background color of
the whole body as well for that what we
have to do is we have to go to the body
tag over here and we have to use the
style attribute over here as well so
we'll write Here style now inside the
style attribute we have to mention
background color and let's say the
background color is going to be blue
fine so blue here is the color name save
the
program and we have the whole background
in blue color now you can see it over
here right right the next thing we'll
discuss is how to change the font color
of any particular element you can see
the font color here is black for now now
we'll see how we can change it for that
we have to use the color property inside
the stylet so you can see it over here
we have the style attribute present
inside the div element what we have to
do is we have to mention another
property over here so after semicolon
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here color and we are going to
specify the color away so we have a list
of colors over here in vs Cod so let's
say we are using blue violet save the
program and you can see the font color
is changed fine so this is how we can
change the background color and the font
color of any web page or of any element
the last thing we are going to discuss
in today's video is the color coding
methods present in
HTM there are three different ways to
specify any particular color in HTML we
can either use the color name to do so
which we did till now so here you can
see we are using the color names so here
you can see we have blue violet we have
Aqua so these all are color names we
have red and blue as well now apart from
that we can also use the RGB values or
the hex values of colors the rgp values
stand for red green and blue colors
these three colors are the most basic
and these can be used to make any color
fine this color value is specified using
the RGB property so what we have to do
is instead of writing the name of color
we'll remove it from here and now we'll
use the RGB value so we have to use the
RGB property first so we'll write here
RGB and here you can see we have three
different values present inside RGB we
have red green and blue fine the value
can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a
percentages so what we have to do we
have to write
here let's say
255 and for green we are also going to
use
255 and for blue let's say we are using
255 fine so these are the RGB values for
white color fine so for black we have to
mention zero for all three colors it's
easy to use these values if you have a
good idea about colors and you know how
to make different colors out of these
three basic colors save the program and
you can see the background color is
changed to White NOW fine now not all
the browsers out there support this
method of color coding so it's
recommended not to use it the last
method we have is the hex method in this
method as well the three basic colors
are used a hexadecimal is a six-digit
representation of a color the first two
digits represent the red value the next
two are a green value and the last one
is the blue value each heximal code will
be provided by a pound or H sign for
using the hex values of any color so we
have to write here now what we are going
to do is we are going to change the
background color using hex values so we
have blue for now here now what we are
going to do is we are going to use a hex
value of any color fine so let's say we
are using yellow fine so we have to
write here hash now we have to provide
the hex value so we have to write here f
f FF and 0 0 so this is basically equals
to the r RGB value so we will write the
equivalent RGB value for yellow color as
well so the equivalent RGB value for
yellow color is 255 comma 255 comma Z so
these two colors are same these two
things means actually the same this is
the hexa decimal value and this is the
RGB value for yellow color so we'll
remove this for now save the program and
you can see the background is yellow in
color fine I hope you guys got this if
you're using VSS code as an editor then
we have an advantage as it allows you to
choose the colors from its own color
scheme just click here on any color and
you can see we have this color scheme
over here we can choose any color of our
own choice we have to set this cursor
inside here and it will give us the hex
value of that particular color so you
can see it over here so let's do it for
now save the program and you can see the
background color is changed I want you
guys to give it a try and let us know
what you learned just like colors in
HTML are used to make a web page look
more appealing to the user fonts also
play an integral role in designing a web
page fonts are used to increase the
readability of content present on any
web page we have been using fonts since
the very beginning of this course now
that we have enough knowledge about
adding paragraphs or text to any web
page so we'll see how we can manipulate
that text present on a web page with the
help of HTML only before HTML 5.0 was
introduced there used to be a specific
tag present in HTML for changing the
font the HTML font tag was used to do so
but now this tag is depreciated from
htl instead of that the style attribute
in HTML again comes into play while
changing the font on any web page we can
change the size color and type of font
used on any web page with the help of
style attribute in HTML so without was
in any time let's move on to the
programming part directly first of all
let's add some basic text to the web
page what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the body tag we'll use the
paragraph tag and we'll write here
this is an example
of let's say fonts in HTML fine so save
the program and you can see here that we
have this text present on the web
browser the text over here is simple one
thing to keep in mind while using fonts
is the user will only be able to see our
font if they have that font installed on
their computer otherwise the font will
automatically change to default
according to the user system to change
the font in HTML what we have to do is
we have to write here inside the P tag
or paragraph tag we can say we have to
use style attribute first and then
inside the style attribute we have to
pass the font family fine so this is a
property and we have different fonts
present in HTML so if that particular
font is installed on your PC then it
will work totally fine so let's say we
have comic sense MSS a font fine so this
is a font save the program and you can
see the font is changed for this
particular paragraph now let me show you
the default font for HTML as well so
what we'll do is we'll write here this
this is an example of save the program
and here you can see the difference in
these two paragraphs the second one has
Comic sense Ms as the font family
fine the list of fonts is quite long and
you can use any of your own choice so
another font we can use is Verana so
what we'll do is we'll copy this
paragraph from
here and we'll paste it here
fine
so what we have to do next is we have to
paste it here okay so it's not copied so
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here now what we'll do is we'll change
the font family so we have to use the
style attribute again now inside style
attribute we have to write your font
family and in font family we have to
write we have to write it here so we
have to write
here with done fine so save the program
and here you can see see this font is
also different from these two paragraphs
so this paragraph seems a bit different
so this is the font family Verana if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more similarly we can use any font in
HTML make sure that whichever font you
are using is installed on your computer
another thing we can do with fonts is we
can change the size of the font so for
changing the size of font we have to
take another paragraph so we'll copy it
from here we'll paste it here and we'll
write something here like change size
fine now save the program and you can
see over here we have another paragraph
So this paragraph says this is an
example of fonts in HTML and we have
written change size inside brackets so
now to change the size of this paragraph
We have to use the tile tag and inside
the style attribute we have to write
here font size fine so the font size is
large larger medium small smaller extra
large extra small extra extra large and
extra extra small we can use any of them
or we can give a specific size of Our
Own in pixels fine so we'll use the
double XEL here save the program and you
can see the change in the font size we
can use both these properties together
as well both font size and font family
we have to write here font family and
inside font family we have to write the
font name so let's say this is the font
name save the program and you can see
the font is changed now
fine we can also change the font color
present on our web page we discussed it
in the previous video as well where we
went through colors in HTML for changing
the color of the font what we have to do
is we have to write here inside the
style attribute we have to use use the
color property so color in HTML stands
for font color fine so we have to write
here color and we have to use any color
of our own choice we can either provide
the hex value or we can also provide the
RGB value or just the color name so we
are going to provide the color name for
now save the program and you can see
this color over here the change in font
color fine so let's use any other color
so we'll use green over here save it now
and now you guys will be able to see the
change in
color so guys this is how we can use
HTML fonts to make a web page look more
attractive to the user it all depends on
us how we can use these fonts colors and
all to make a web page look more
appealing I hope you guys got this give
it a try and you'll understand how easy
it is in the most basic definition a
form is something we use to take the
user's data for example if the user
wants to register on a website then they
have to give us their names email and
some more info about them a form takes
input from the user and then posts it
into the backend application for further
processing and other stuff like
validation and all the HTML form tag is
used to create a form it's quite simple
to create a form in HTML we'll move to
the programming part directly and create
a simple form to start with so the first
and foremost part is that we need to use
the form tag to create a form so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body of
our program and we'll write here form so
this is the form tag in HTML save the
program and you can see here nothing
happened on the browser so this form tag
created an area for a form it basically
work like the div tag we used in the
previous videos now to include data in a
form we need text areas or we can say
input boxes in our form there are
various form elements available like
text field text stage area Fields drop-
down menus radio buttons checkboxes Etc
so let's start using them in the form
here first of all we'll create a text
box for the users's name for that what
we have to do is we have to write here
inside the form tag so we'll write here
first name and then we have to write
here input so input is another tag so we
have to write here
input and then we have to use the type
attribute so the type is going to be
text for this text box and we'll write
here name name is going to
be first name
fine now save this and you can see here
we have an input box for the first name
the same code we can use for the last
name as well what we have to do is we
have to copy it from
here we have to paste it here so we'll
use the BR tag before using it again now
we have to change first here with last
we will write here last and in name as
well we'll
write last fine so we have this last
name over here save it and you can see
we have first name and last name we have
two different text boxes present over
here we'll use the BR tag one more time
save it now and you can see it clearly
now right so here we are done with the
first text box ofers now this input tag
over here is used to create these text
boxes and the name refers to the text
boxes name fine another thing we can do
here is we can write
here placeholder and inside placeholder
we can write something let's say we are
writing over here first name and you can
see first name over here it's permanent
until we write something inside the Box
the placeholder value will appear on the
text box same thing we can do here as
well we have to write here
placeholder so we have placeholder for
last name as well save it now and you
can see the value of placeholder over
here the moment we start writing
something over here you can see the
placeholder value is not here anymore
fine if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to no
more now there are different types of
form controls that we can use to collect
data using HTML form they are text input
controls we can use checkboxes radio
buttons we can use select box controls
and we can also use file select boxes so
we can use radio buttons in our form for
that what we need to do is we need to
change the type in our form so that's
the only thing that will change no
matter what controls we are using so
what we have to do is we have to write
here let's say we are using Break Tag
first so we'll use two Brak tags over
here in order to make the whole web page
clear and easily understandable for you
guys so next thing we'll do is we'll
write
here gender so let's write here gender
then we'll use Break Tag again and after
this we'll
write
input type is equals to radio and we can
write here name name is going to be
let's see mail and the value for this is
going going to be maale again fine we
can use the value attribute here as well
so we'll use it later now the next thing
we'll do is we'll write
here input again we'll add another
gender so let's say we have type here
as radio again and then we have name
as female and we'll write
here so save it now and you can see two
radio buttons over here we can check
them in and you can see we have radio
buttons working totally fine we can use
these values later on as well similarly
we can use checkboxes as well in our
form we'll see how in the upcoming video
where we'll create something like a
login or a sign up form using HTML only
so there are three different types of
text inputs used on forms we can use
single line text input controls so this
control is used for items that require
only one line of use input such as
search boxes or names they are created
in HTML using the input tag we discussed
them till now so these all are the
example of single line text input
controls which we discussed till now the
next are password input controls this is
also a single line text input but it
masks the character as soon as a user
enters it they are also created using
the HTML input tag so the syntax goes
like this we have to write here after
this so we'll use the BR tag again over
here and now we'll write
here input so before that let's
write password so this password is going
to be the user's password for our
website for login or maybe for signin so
this is the password so we'll write here
input type is equals to password and
then we'll write here name
as password fine save it now and you can
see password written over here with a
text box fine right inside here will get
masked so if we write anything over here
you can see it in the form of password
it will get masked as soon as we enter
it so this is done to make the password
a secret now we can also set the maximum
length of a password using the max
length attribute so what we have to do
is we have to write here max
length and the max length is going to be
let's say eight fine save the program
and now if we write something over here
you can
see and now we are not able to use more
than eight characters inside this
particular text box right because we
have defined the max length as eight and
it will allow only eight characters
inside the text box fine the last one we
have our multi-line text input controls
this is used when the user is to give
details that may be longer than a single
sentence so multi-line input controls
are created using html text area tag the
Syntax for a multi-line input is simple
we have to write here after this so
we'll use the BR tag again for two times
and then we'll write here let's say
description fine so after description
we'll use the BR tag to make it more
clear and then we'll WR write here text
area so this is the tag and then we have
to Define rows and columns here so rules
are going to be five and we'll write
here calls so these two are the
attributes we'll write here 50 this
basically we are defining the area
acquired by this text area fine then
we'll write your
name and we'll write here
description then we'll write something
over here so let's say we write over
here
enter description
here and that's it save the program and
you can see we have a text area present
over here it's bigger in size than the
normal text boxes we had earlier so what
we can do is we can remove it from here
and we can use the placeholder attribute
inside the text area tag to write such
thing
fine the last important thing in a form
is the submit button so this button is
used to submit the form data we can
either use the input tag or the button
tag for a submit button fine so let's
use the input tag for creating a button
first what we'll do is we'll write here
after
this we'll write here the Break Tag and
then we'll
write input type is equals to button and
then we have value is equals to submit
fine save the program and you can see
the button over here on the browser so
here's the
button we can further make this button
work with the help of JavaScript but we
are creating the layout only for now so
let it be this way only the next method
we can use for creating a button is by
using the button tag so what we have to
do is we have to write here just use the
BR tag once and write here button so
this is the tag and write here the name
of button fine so we'll write here
submit save the the program and you can
see here another button fine so here's
the button you can see both the buttons
are exactly same no difference between
the buttons we can style this form
according to our needs we'll do
something different in the next video
whenever we go through the login or sign
up portal of any website we see that on
the login page we use credentials like
ID and password name sign up page on the
other hand refers to the form we need to
fill in order to be a part of that
particular website
so what we'll do is we'll create a login
page and a sign up page in today's video
and we'll see what we can learn from
this video so without wasting any more
time let's move on to the programming
part directly we'll start with the login
page first so first of all here we are
in the HTML file we'll start using the
form tag but before that we are going to
provide a heading for this login page so
what we'll do is we'll move to the body
tag and we'll write here H1 so H1 stands
for heading one I hope you guys already
know this particular element so what
we'll do is we'll write here login form
fine so we have written login form over
here save it and you can see we have
login form return on the browser the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to style it a bit using the style
attribute we have been through it
already so we'll write Here style now
inside style what we'll do is we'll
align this text at the center of our web
page so we we write here text align and
we'll text align it to the center fine
so here we are we are done with text
aligning save it now and you can see it
moving in the browser so it's in the
middle of the web page now you can see
it over here clearly the login form is
present at the center of a whole web
page fine now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to use the
form tag over here fine so we'll write
here form and and this is a form tag so
we are going to create the form inside
this particular tag only now let's style
this as so what we'll do is we'll write
here Style again the style attribute
comes into play so we are going to use
the Border attribute now we are going to
keep the Border 3 pixel thick solid in
nature and let's use this particular
color so we'll write here F1 F1 F1 so
this is white color basically so here
you can see it it's not completely white
off white or a bit grayish we can say so
here you can see the form body so I hope
this is visible for you guys so the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to use a container now so what we'll do
for that we'll use the div tag we'll
style it and then we'll move on further
so we'll write here div now inside div
we are going to use the style attribute
again obviously so we are going to
provide padding over here now we'll
write here 25 pi
so what is pedding you guys repeat so
what is pedding you guys might be
wondering about it padding provides the
space between the border and the content
of an element fine so the space between
the border of that element and the
content is known as pedding so pedding
is going to be 25 pixel for all the
sides so pedding is basically four S
from top right bottom and left fine so
we can provide all the values or we can
provide a single value for for all fine
so here padding is 25 pixel now we are
going to set background color for this
and the background color is going to be
let's say light BL fine save it now and
here you can see we have a container
which has a border of gray color and the
background color
is sky blue or we can say light blue
fine now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to start creating
a form so here we are inside the div tag
so you can see we have the form tag
first and inside the form we have a
particular division now fine so what
we'll do now is we are going to create a
login form so we'll use the label tag so
label tag stands for the label of any
form so you will see it over here so
we'll write here
username and we'll
put colon over save it now and here you
can see we have username present inside
the container or we can see inside the
form fine so let's put a space over here
save it now and now I guess it looks
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to create a text box now
so for that we are going to use the
input text so we'll write
input type is equals to text for this
username and then we'll write here
placeholder placeholder will write
enter username fine now after this we
are going to write here name name is
going to be let's
say username again and then we'll write
here let's say required so required is
another attribute we have so what will
happen now is if we leave this box empty
and if we don't write anything over here
and if we try to submit a login form
then a popup will appear which says
credentials required or something like
that only so HTML provides us with this
feature so save it now and here you can
see we have a label user name and a text
box which says enter username fine
similarly we'll create a label for
password and text box or password fine
so we'll write here label again and
we'll write here
password save it now and here you can
see we have a label for password as well
now what we'll do is we'll write
here again we are going to use the input
tag so we'll write here input type is
equals to password you guys are already
aware of this type and then we'll write
your placeholder and we'll write here
enter password fine so we'll write here
enter password then we have the name for
password we'll write here name is
equals to password and then we'll write
here a required again fine save it now
and here you can see we have another
text
box now so let me make it a
little more here for you guys so here we
are done with the username and the
password the next thing we need is the
submit button now fine so we'll write
your button type is going to be
submit how we can use the input tag as
well as we did in the last video so
we'll write
here log fine so this is the button name
save it now and here you can see we have
the login Button as well now what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
checkbox or we can say a remember me
function fine so for that what we'll do
is we are again going to use the input
tag for that so we'll write here input
then we'll write here type type is
equals to
checkbox and then we'll write here after
this checked checked is a property again
so we'll write
here checked as checked so then we'll
write
here remember me fine save it now and
here you can see we have a checkbox and
a remember me option fine the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
create another button the cancel button
fine so we'll write here button button
and type is going to be button again
then we'll write
here id id is going to be let's
say cancel button why we are using this
ID because we need this ID in the CSS
part we'll see it later then we'll write
here the name of button is cancel
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a cancel button as well now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to put some links over here so for
that we are going to use the anchor tag
again we'll write here a href href is
going to be let's say hash because we
are going to write here forgot password
so we'll write
here forgot
password or we can write here forget
password
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a link present over here now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here and then we'll add
another link for the sign up page fine
so we'll write here a hre again
reference is going to be signin do HTML
so this is going to be the signin file
or the HTML file for the sign up page
then we'll write
here register fine
save it now and here you can see
register written over here on the
browser so we are already done with the
login form the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to use CSS for
that so we are almost done with the HTML
part for this login page all of you guys
are well aware of the style attribute
till now right this attribute is used to
change the style of any particular
element let me tell you guys another way
of using this style attribute in HTM we
can use all these styling properties
inside the style tag as well for that
what we need to do is we need to move to
the Head section of a HTML file and we
have to write Here style fine so here we
are we are here with the style tag so
what we are going to do is we are going
to style a HTML document inside this
style tag
only
fine what we'll do here is we'll write
here body first fine so what we are
doing here is we are styling the body
tag the whole body tag now fine so what
we'll do is we'll use the font family
first so we'll change the font family
we'll write
here okay we are going to use Gil sense
we are going to use this then we'll
write here the background color so we'll
change the background color of this
pitch we'll write here RGB the RGB
values are we have to write write it in
small letters the RGB values are 13 4
comma 132 comma
133 fine we are done with it save it and
here you can see the change so the RGB
values are not working because we have
written RBG over here instead of RGB
save it now and here you can see the
background color is green now fine so it
looks nice now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to style the
button so the button tag we have used
here you can see it over here we have
used the button tag for cancel button
and for submit button fine or we can say
for login button so we are going to
style both of them at once so we'll
write here button we'll write here the
tag name basically so button is the tag
name now we'll change the background
color of this button which is going to
be let's say
hh150 5 FM so guys I'm already aware of
these colors and you can do what we did
in the background color video or you can
change the background color according to
you you can use the color name you can
use the Hax values or the RGB values the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to provide here the width width is
going to be 100% of the whole T fine
then we'll write here color color is
going to change the font color of this
button so we'll write here RGB
again and we are going to write here 248
comma 248 comma 248 fine let's see what
it is so here you can see the login and
cancel button are changed now so the
font color is white the button color is
blue and next thing we are going to do
is we are going to write here padding
padding again is going to be 15 pixels
for all the sides then we'll write here
margin fine so we'll write your margin
margin is going to be 10 pixel
and 0 pixel fine so what is margin guys
margin provides the space between the
border and the outer element there's a
difference between padding and margin
padding provides the space between the
border and the content of element so
here in this case this is the content
and this is
the pading fine margin on the other hand
refers to this space between this
element and the next element fine so
margin as 10 and 0 pixel means 10 pixel
from top and bottom and 0er pixel from
left and right fine the next thing we
are going to do here is we are going to
write here border fine so border will
Define as
none save it and you can see the buttons
here now the next thing or the last
thing we are going to write here is we
are going to change the cursor to
pointer on taking over these buttons you
can see the cursor change now
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to style the
input tags so we'll write here
input and we are going to style them so
we'll write here type is equals
to we have used a lot
of input tags right so we'll write it
type is equals to text and then again we
are going to write here
input then we'll write here type is
equals
to password fine so we have two input
tags for username and for password so we
are going to style them at once side by
side we are going to style them so the
next thing we are going to write here is
we are going to set the width as
100% And then we'll write here margin
again so we'll write your margin as 8
pixels and 0 pixels fine save it now and
here you can see the login form is
looking more and here you can see the
login form looks much better now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to define the padding as well
padding is going to be 12 pixel and 20
pixel
fine then we'll write here display
display as
inline block then we have border over
here border is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and we are going
to define the RGB value again so RGB is
going to be
109 for green we
have8 and for blue we
have and for blue here we have let's
let's say
240 and save it now and here you can see
the borders over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to remove
pixel from here and here you can see we
have the input boxes or we can say the
text box is working totally fine now
what we are going to do last is we are
going to write
here box sizing you can see these boxes
going out of area so we'll write your
box sizing as border box save it now and
here you can see the login form is
almost done fine so let me close it
once now the next thing we are going to
style is the button tag again so we'll
write here button and then we'll write
here a property it totally depends upon
us if we are going to use these
properties or not so we have to remove
from here we have to write your hover
and on hovering the opacity will change
so the opacity will change to 0.7 now
look it carefully and here you can see
when we take our mouse cursor over any
button there's no change right now save
the program try to take the mouse cursor
again you can see it's still not working
as of
now have to remove this and here you can
see now it's working totally fine on
taking the mouse cursor over any button
it hovers now the opacity will change
fine the last first thing we have to do
is we have to style the cancel button so
we are going to use the ID over here so
here you can see in the HTML part of
cancel button so we have used the ID as
cancel button over here so we are going
to use this ID to style this particular
button
fine we'll write here inside this cancel
button width width is going to be Auto
then we have padding padding is going to
be 10 pixel and 18 pixel for top bottom
and for left right fine then we have the
margin as well and margin is going to be
10 pixel for top bottom and 5 pixel for
Left Right save it now and here you can
see the login form is completely done
fine now that we are done with the
styling part let's check the final
output save the program and you can see
here so here you can see on the browser
we have this basic login for it looks
fine right we can make it more
attractive but we need CSS for that with
HTML we can do this only so let's move
ahead and we'll now create the
registration form or the sign up page so
let's move ahead to another HTML file so
here we are in the HTML file so this
file is for sign up page here you can
see the title for sign up so we'll
remove this form tag from here it's a
mistake save it now and now what we are
going to do is we are going to open it
with live server again so here you can
see this HTML file has no output as all
so let's create the signup form now if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more so what we'll do first is we
are going to write here the style tag
and we'll finish it later on now moving
to the body part what we'll do is we'll
style the body first so we'll use the
style attribute now we are going to
define the font family here font family
is going to be this one again let's say
we have used this in the sign up form or
we can say the login form as well so the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to change the background color for
this whole body now what we are doing
here is we'll write here
RGB then we'll Define the values as 134
comma 132 comma 133 the same one from
the pre previous login form save it now
and here you can see the change in the
background color of the whole body tag
fine next up what we'll do here is we
are going to use the H1 tag
again we'll style it as well so we'll
write a style we are going to align it
to the center we'll write a text
align and we'll write here text align at
the center fine so here we are next
we'll write
here registration
form save it now and here you can see we
have registration form written at the
center of a web page fine next thing we
have to include a lot of text boxes and
a lot of labels in this particular
registration form because for login form
we need only two text boxes or two
labels right the username and the
password but the signup form is
different we need a lot of information
about the user so for that we are going
to use a lot of input tags first thing
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here then we'll use the
form
tag and that's it inside the form tag we
are going to change the style over here
only so we'll write Here style and we
are going to use the B border is going
to be 3 pixel solid in color and or you
can say solid in nature and off-white or
gray in color fine so here you can see
the border on the
browser now what we are going to do next
is we are going to use the div tag
again so we'll write here
div here we have the div tag so let's
style this div tag over here only we are
going to use the style attribute for
that we are going to define the padding
padding is going to be 25 pixel for this
as well background color we are going to
use light blue save it now and here you
can see the container on the browser so
it's similar to the login one now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use label first so we'll write here
label then we have the label
as first
name and save it you can see we have our
first level over over here
the next thing we need is the input area
or the text box for this first name so
we'll write here
input type is equals to text then we
have name name is going to
be first name then we have sze or we can
say the length so we'll write
here max length max length let's Define
it as
15 and we are done with the first text
box use the break tag again over here
and that's it so we are done with first
name similarly we have to mention the
middle name last name as well so let's
define them here so we'll write here
label
again this time we have the label
for middle
name and that's it save it and here you
can see we have middle name written over
here we'll copy this piece of code or we
can say the input tag from here we'll
change the name to last name and save it
here you can see we have another text
box present over here fine so one thing
we forgot to mention here is the
placeholder so we can write here
placeholder
enter first name fine save it now now
and here you can see the placeholder on
the browser so we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here we'll mention for
last name or for middle name as well
save it now and here you can see
something is wrong save it
again and there's something wrong
fine okayy so there's a problem with the
live server so what we'll do is is will
open it again with live server and here
you can see it's not working as of
now okay the Break Tag we
have something wrong over here let me
check
guys okay we forgot to mention this over
here save it now and it's still not
working
with live server again and it's working
now
fine so it's working as of now we'll do
the same thing
for last name as well so we'll copy this
piece of code from here we'll paste it
here we'll change middle to last
everywhere so we'll write enter last
name over here then we have name as last
name and we have to write here
enter last name or we can say last name
over here save it now and here you can
see we have another text box and another
label present over here for last name as
well now what we are going to do is we
are going to select or we can say we are
going to use options or we have to
mention them over here so for that we'll
write
here label so we are going to mention
course over here and for course we are
going to provide drop down menus so for
that what we need to do is we need to
use the
select tag in HTM so inside the select
tag we have to provide options options
let's say the value of option is first
value is going to be course and then we
have to write here course it is going to
be a drop down list so we have to
mention a lot of options over here so
we'll write your option
again and then we'll write
here value value is going to be VCA
then we have to write here BCA save it
now and here you can see we have course
over here so here you can see till now
it has two values let's add some more
values over here for options or we can
say let's add some more options over
here we'll add let's say three four more
options we'll write here BBA instead of
BCA for this then we have let's
say
btech and we'll change the value over
here as well we'll write here bch then
we
have MBA as well let's say so we'll
write here
MBA then finally we have let's say mtech
as well so we'll write here
mtech save it now and here you can see
if we click on this code you can see we
have different options available we have
BCA BBA btech MBA and mtech so the
select tag or we can say the option tag
and select tag both are used for drop
down men so here is a drop down menu so
we have to put a colum over here save it
now and I guess it looks fine
now so the next thing we need to do is
we need to use the radio buttons for
gender fine so what we are going to do
is we are going to
use the break tag
and then we'll write
here gender so gender is going to be the
label so we have to put it inside label
tag so we'll write here
label and we have to put gender inside
fine save it now and here you can see we
have gender present over
here now what we are going to do is we
are going to put a break again over here
and then we have to
use the input TP so we'll write input
type is equals
to radio for radio buttons when then we
have to write your name name is going to
be mail and the first value is going to
be M fine then we have to put the BR tag
again then we'll copy it from here we'll
paste it
here for
female then we have to change the value
here as well email we have to write here
we have to put a br tag we'll copy it
from here again and let me close it once
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here now we have to write here instead
of
female other fine so we will mention
other over here as
well save it now and here you can see we
have three radio buttons over here for
gender we have male female and other
fine now next thing we have to include
is we have to include the phone number
for phone number we need two input boxes
one for the country code and another one
for phone number fine so we need to
write here and we'll put another break
over here then after this break we need
the label for phone fine so we'll write
your
phone and after phone we have to write
here
input type is equals to text for phone
number then we'll write here name name
is going to
be country
code then we have to write here the
value as well value is going to be + 91
this is the country code of India then
we'll write
here max length max length is going to
be three so that the user cannot write
anything inside here fine save it now
and here you can see we have phone as
label and we have a text box if we try
to write anything you can see we are not
able to write so what we'll do next is
We'll add another input box or we can
say the text box for phone number so
we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it again we are going
to use the name as phone for phone
number the value is going to
be none so we'll remove value from here
and then what we'll do is we'll change
the max length to 10 digits fine save it
now and here you can see we have another
text box over here so what we'll do is
we'll change the type here so you can
see we are able to
write characters here as well what we'll
do is we'll change the type as number
fine save it now and now you'll be able
to see that we are not able to write any
character over here but we are able to
write a number
fine so here
is the text box for phone number fine so
we are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write here
break let's use it twice and after this
Break Tag what we need is the address so
we'll write
here label label is going to be
address so we have to write here address
we have to put a column over here and
after this address we have to put the
Break Tag and a text area so we are not
going to use this text box for this now
we are going to use the text area
attribute so we'll write here text area
text area columns are going to be 80 for
this area and rows is five
fine value is going to
be let's say address over
here and we are almost done so save it
now and here you can see on the browser
we have a text area for address fine so
what we need to do next is we need email
we need password and retype password we
need three more options right so let's
start with email so what we are going to
do is we are going to use break over
here twice so that it will be clear for
you guys to see now what we'll do is
we'll write
here inside label we'll write
email so we have the label as email then
we'll write
here
input type is equals to email then we
have ID
as email then we can write here name as
well name is going to be email again so
save it now and here you can see we have
a text box for email as well now what we
need to do is we need another box for
password so we are going to use the
break tag
twice and now we are going to use the
label tag again label is going to be
password save it now and here you can
see we have label as password now we'll
write here input type is going to be
password then we have ID is equals to
pass in case we need them in the CSS
part that's why we are using the ID
attribute here name is going to be pass
again and that's it fine so we have text
box for password now what we are going
to do next is we are going to use the
break tag
again next up we need to retype password
because this is a registration form the
user needs to retype the password he
choose fine so we'll write here label
label is going to
be a re-enter
password and that's it we need an input
box for this as well so we are going to
use this one only so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it here and we are
going to use the brte again
fine save it now and here you can see we
have another text box for a re-enter
password
fine the next thing we need is the
submit button the last thing so we we'll
write here
input type is going to be button then we
have value value is going to be
submit so save it now and we are done
with the registration form as so here
you can see we have everything we need
in a registration form so here we are
done with the HTML part only let's style
this page a bit now we'll move on to the
Head section again and we'll write here
inside the style attribute or we can say
the style tag basically so we'll write
here we are going to to
use
input input for type
as text so basically we can do one thing
we can remove it we can go back to HTML
and we have this input one over here
we'll copy it from here we'll come back
to sign up page and we'll save it so
here you can see it looks fine so some
of them are not working obviously
because here for email we have use the
input as email so for that to work what
we need to do is we need to write here
again after a comma we need to write
here input then inside these brackets we
need to write here type is equals to
email and for one more we need to write
here
input type is equals to number fine save
it now and here you can see these two
are also working the text area we can
also use over here so what we can do is
we can write here text area only and it
will work as well so we need to change
the Box sizing for this address
attribute or we can say for the text
area attri so one thing we are going to
do here is we are going to write
here text area as
well let's see if it works you can see
we have written text area over here and
it works completely fine now fine so
here you can see we have both the pages
now if we move back to a login form you
can see this is a login form and this is
a registration form so it looks nice so
what we can do is we can go over here
login form and we can click on register
and it will take us to a registration
form because these two pages are linked
together fine so this is how we can
create a HTML login or sign sign up page
using HTML and a bit of CSS we can say
so what is an HTML HTML also called
hypertex markup language is the most
widely used language for developing web
pages it defines the structure of the
websites and format web pages all the
content that you add on the web pages
are through
HTML so what is CSS CSS which is a short
form of cascading stylesheet is a simple
design language which is used for making
web pages look good and presentable we
format our web pages through CSS it can
be attached to any HTML element and
style or even position according to
developers Choice it gives you freedom
to edit things on the web pages how you
want now that we know what CSS is let's
dive into how to use CSS for that we
need to understand the syntax of the
CSS so luckily the syntax is
straightforward and easy to understand
the first part of the syntax is the
selector there are many different types
of combinations and types of selectors
for now all you need to know if the
syntax starts the selector next comes
the curly Braes inside the curly Braes
we add the property and its
values so this is the complete syntax of
the selector the name of the selector
first followed by the curly Braes and
inside the curly Braes we add the
property and the value
this is an example of a selector here H1
is our element and we have changed the
color of the heading one to
Red now that we have discussed the
syntax let's now discuss about the
selectors
so the last example that we discussed
was an example of an element selector
this is a class selector we specify the
class selector by a DOT followed by the
class name and the property value
the ID selector we mentioned by the hash
sign hash ID name and followed by the
property value now that we know about
the selectors and the syntax let's jump
to a demo to understand the CSS better
so we are on our sublim textor and we
have two files ready index.html and
style.css let's start by adding the
standard HTML boiler
plate we'll add the title as what is
CSS now to link our HTML file with the
style file we'll use the link tag so
link and here we'll name the style file
that is
style.css now our HTML file is linked
with the CSS
file now let's create something basic so
we'll add an H1 and we'll say
introduction to CS
s let's add a P
tag
this is the
introduction now to add a style to this
page we'll go to this stylesheet and
we'll select the element hement we'll
change its color to red
okay now just save the
file and open this
index.html so you can see this H1 is of
color red and this is our P tag this is
how the basic CSS Works let's do
something
more let's discuss a little bit more
about the priority order so we'll go
back to our sublim text editor and here
we'll add H1
color to
Blue now think which of the style will
work in CSS the style order works from
top to bottom
so if you see the flow first the color
will change to red and after the color
will change to Blue so the current style
should be the blue so if you go back and
refresh you'll see this H1 is
blue okay now let's go back and add a
class here so we'll name this class say
red now if you go
back and change this to dot
red color red and the H1 to Blue now
you'll think that the color of the H1
should be blue since the H1 this element
is below this one but that is not true
element selectors are the lower level of
the selectors so when you go back to the
page and
refresh okay I think we haven't saved
this save the
file and now refresh you'll see the H1
changes to Red so the CSS gives priority
to the class selector after that the ID
selector and at last the element
selector now let's discuss the different
ways you can add your color so the first
one is the
name you can add different color names
here there are several colors preloaded
in the CSS you can save
pink save the
file go back and you see the color
changes to Pink the second way is
through the hash
value hash is the color combination in
the terms of numeric and letters you can
check the value of the any color through
a website
called Color
Picker so just select the Color Picker
here and you can see we have the hex
value of different
colors so let's select this color this
is a hash value so let's copy
here
save and go
back you can see the color changes to
Green to know more about colors you can
check our CSS Colors video in the CSS
playlist next we are going to discuss
about the Box model so for that we are
going to create a new
div so we'll create one div
here
and give it a class name
box save this now go back to the CSS and
let's create our
box so for to create a box we have to
specify the
height so we'll set the Box height to
say 100
pixels
we'll set the width to 100 pixels too so
this will be 100
pixels we'll set the padding to 20
pixels padding is the space between the
boxes and the
border and we'll set the margin to 50
pixels We'll add the
Border as 10
pixel
solid and any color of your choice let's
say
San so just save the file and go
back now if you refresh we have this box
you can see this is the margin
part and the padding is this part the
space between the two
boxes
let's add a background
color so to add the background color
we'll use the background color property
and we'll keep it to light
pink or yeah light pink go back and
refresh let's inspect this element to
understand the Box model better so right
click and click on
inspect now below you'll see this is the
Box our box Box
model you can see this is the padding
part this is the border and this is the
margin I hope you understand the Box
model better
now so we have discussed about the
different elements and class selectors
we have discussed how you can add the
colors to your element and now we have
discussed the Box model and this
different properties
so this pretty much sums up everything
you need to know to get started with CSS
you can follow our CSS playlist which
cover the different topics in details
CSS uses the color values to specify the
colors on a page they can be specified
using predefined color names hex or RGB
format there are nearly 140 standard
color names hexadecimal is a six-digit
representation of a color the first two
digits are represents a red value the
next two are green value and the last is
a blue value all the other colors can be
created using the combination of these
three colors there are several websites
available where you can know the hex
value of the different shades of color
as you can see the black color is
signified by hashtag and the six zeros
the red is # FF and the four zeros
followed by it the RGB color value is
specified using the RGB property this
property takes three values one for red
green and blue the value can be the
integer between 0 to 225 or a percentage
as you can see the black color is
signified by 00 the red by 255 the Blue
by 00 255 and the green by
0255 now let's move to an example to
understand how we can add the colors to
our
page in this example we will see how we
can add colors in different ways to our
HTML so we are on the sublim text rator
as you can see we have the standard Bo
ready with an H2 and a paragraph on our
page open the style tag and make the
font size of the paragraph to 25 pixels
so it is clearly
visible
let's start by adding colors to our text
just by color names HTML supports nearly
140 standard color
names we'll make the color of the
paragraph green for that just type color
and set the color to
Green as you can see our paragraph is
changed to Green let's try one
more this time we will add the color
red just
refresh as you can see the color is not
changed to Red there are nearly 140 HTML
standard colors that is supported by the
web
browser you can also add colors using
the RGB format there are many websites
available to know the RGB or hex value
of the desired color one such is
html.com as you can see in the HTML
course.com we have we have the hex value
and the RGB value of the desired color
let's try
one we'll add this color with the RGB
value 171 229 and 27 to our paragraph So
for that just type RGB and the color
code you
want as you can see the color is not
changed to our RGB value let's try one
more this time we'll use this RGB value
to our
text you can see the color is changed to
our desired
value in this way you can use the RGB
format to change the
colors the next way is using the hex
values heximal is a six digit
representation of a color the first two
digits are red next one two are green
and the last are the blue value let's
see how you can use the hex
values as you can see the hex value for
this color is # 31787 F we'll use this
value to our
text
to add the hex value you have to use the
hashtag followed by the color
code you can see that color is changed
to our he value let's try one
more you can see the hex value for this
color is # F14
a07 just copy the desired value to your
file
you can see the color
changes you can also add color borders
to our heading do that just mention the
Border style along with the color
code we'll add the Border color red to
our
H2
now you can see we have the border
around our
H2 I hope you have understand how to use
the color values to a web page there are
mainly three ways by which you can add
the colors to your web page they are Hax
RGB values and the color names let's
start by opening a style
tag the background image is always set
on the body tag so type body and open
the curly
braces the background image is always
set on the body tag so open the body tag
with curly braces and start typing
background
image use the URL value of the
background image to set the path of the
image make sure the image is in the same
folder as of the HTML file here we have
our file nature 3.
jpj so mention the path inside the
double
quotes save the file and let's see how
it looks on a web
page
as you can see we have the image on the
web page let's format this image a
little bit we'll start by setting the
background size so type background
size and there are three values to the
background size first one is auto it
will set the image as it
is save the file and let's see how it
looks on a
page as you can see the size of the
image is as same of the original
size the col value will set the image
image size that will be fit to the web
page as you can see the image is set to
the whole web page we can also set the
image size to manual let's say we want
the image size of withd 500 pixels
so now as you can see the width of the
image is 500 pixels next we will set the
background repeat property there are
three values to background repeat first
is no repeat with the no repeat value
the images will not repeated on a
page now as you can see the images are
not
repeated second is repeat X it will set
the images to be repeated on x-
axis as you can see the images are not
repeated on the x-axis similarly repeat
the images on the y-
axis as you can see the images are not
repeated to the y axis and there's a
default value repeat which will repeat
the images on the web
page so let's keep it to cover so let's
keep the background size to cover and
set the background repeat to no repeat
let's save the file and look it on a web
page now as you can see the image is
fully fit to the web
page let's add a text above our image to
see how it looks like so I'll add a
paragraph tag and type some random text
here let's set the text color to red and
align it to
Center I'll type P and open the curly
braces
I'll set the color to
red and I'll set the text align to
Center let's save the file and see how
it looks on a
page as you can see we have a text above
our image which is centrally aligned and
the text color is
red what is a
grid a grid is a set of intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines defining
the rows and
columns and what is the grid layout so
CSS grid layout is the most powerful
layout system available in CSS it is a
two-dimensional system meaning it can
handle both columns and rows unlike
flexbox which is largely a
onedimensional
system you work with grid layout by
applying the CSS rules to both the
parent element which became the grid
container and the elements children
which become the grid
items the CSS grid out Exel and dividing
a page into major regions or defining
the relationship in terms of size
position and layer between parts of a
control buil HTML
Primitives you can see this is the basic
layout of a grid system like tables grid
layout enables an author to align
elements into columns and rows however
many more regular layouts are either
possible or easier with CSS grid than
they were with tables for example a grid
container child element could position
the themselves so they actually overlap
and layer similar to the CSS positioned
elements so here are the features of the
CSS grid layout they are fixed and have
flexible track sizes you can create a
grid with fixed track sizes using pixels
for example this sets the grid to the
specified pixel which fits to the layout
you desire we can also create a grid
using flexible sizes with percentages
with the new F unit designed for this
purpose
you can place the items into a precise
location using the grid line numbers
names or by targeting an area of the
grid the grid also contains an algorithm
to control the placement of items not
given an explicit position on the
grid you can define an explicit grid
with a grid layout the grid layout
specification is a flexible enough to
add additional rows and columns when
needed features such as adding as many
columns that will fit into a container
are
included it also gives you control of
overlapping content more than one item
can be placed into a grid cell or area
and they can partially overlap each
other this layering May then be
controlled with the Zed index
property so here are the basic
terminologies you should know to work
with the grid system
better the grid line is the dividing
line that make up the structure of the
grid they can either be vertical or
horizontal and decides on either side of
rows and
columns a grid column is a space between
two adjacent vertical grid lines the
size of a grid column is determined by
the grid template columns property on
the other hand a grid row is a space
between two adjacent horizontal grid
lines its size is determined by the grid
template row
property the grid cell is the single
unit of a CSS
grid and in Grid design a gutter is
basically the width of the space between
columns a gutter margin is the white
space formed by the adjoining inside
margins of two facing pages in a book or
a space between columns on a page so
with this let's now move onto the
handson demo and see how the DD system
works in actual world if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
we are on the Sublime Text Editor open
with a project with some basic
background Styles and nothing inside the
body you can see this is the basic
background style we have pre-applied
just to have a good look of the Box
model we'll start by creating a
container and wrapping our grid items in
it so let's create a grid and give it a
class named grid
container
and inside of it we'll put our different
grid items so we'll just create
different grid items and give them a
class grid item followed by a class
number they belong to so that we can
easily distinguish between
them
just copy paste this five times so we'll
have the five elements on our
page
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the
page so you can see we have the
different grid items on the screen so
that are easy for us to visualize we
have not applied any styles to them
other than the visual
Styles so we'll go back to our
code let's go back to the CSS styling
sheet so to create the grid we'll open
our stylesheet we need to display grid
on our grid container so we'll select
our grid container and set the display
to
grid
if you save
now you will see nothing changes this is
because the grid itself doesn't Define
any rows and columns for us to work with
it just they give the alignment properly
therefore by default it looks just
exactly the same to make the grid look
actually great what you need to do is
Define columns and rows for a
grid so to do this you will use a set
grid template and set the column if you
we want to set the size of the column uh
we'll set the size to 100 pixel and 150
pixel
now if you refresh you have the 100
pixel column on the left and a 150 pixel
column on the right and then the grid
captures next
row but what if we want a box to
flexible size themselves according to
the items inside of them here we'll use
a fraction init instead of a 150 pixel
column we want one fraction of our size
and instead of 100 pixel we want the two
fractions of our size so we'll just
replace with two
fractions and this with one
fraction now if you save the file and go
back to the
page you'll see the the items on our
left here in our first column are twice
as large as the item on the second
column and that's because of the F units
we have defined you can see the
difference in the sizes the item one is
the twice of the size of the item
two another thing you can do is with
columns is use repeat suppose you want
four Columns of a size 100 pixel wide
you can just write repeat command and
inside of it how many times you want to
repeat the
size so we'll just delete
this and use the repeat we'll set the
number of times we want to repeat and
the size of
the
columns now if you save the file you
will see we have a four Columns of 100
pixel wide we can do the same things for
row just set the grid template rows and
Define the size you
want
now you can see we have the symmetric
size all around our
container if you don't know how large
your grid is going to be you can use the
grid Auto rows and this will determine
the size of all the rows that is added
after the template rows suppose we want
all our rows to be 100
pixels so we'll just delete the grid
template
rows and set the grid Auto row 200
pixel now you can see all the rows are
now 100 pixel
tall
let's change our column back to 100
pixel and 150
pixels so that it'll be easier for us
further we'll just delete this grid Auto
rows now we'll talk about the spacing of
the rows and columns apart from each
other we can do this with the help of
the grid Gap property grid row Gap will
give some spaces between the rows
similarly the grid column will you the
spaces between the
columns now you can see the gaps between
the rows and columns now we want the
same value for both The Columns you can
use a grid grab property and mention the
space we'll just delete this
two and instead of it we will use just
the grid
Gap and set the size to 20
pixel now you can see the evenly spaces
between the rows and the
columns this is all you need to know
about the sizing of the different
columns and rows now let's talk about
the positioning items within its GD
cells so for horizontal positioning we
could use the justify items and we can
set that to
Center
so that centers each item within the
cell by default it is set to
stretch we can also set it to
start
or
end or space
around we will live this to
Center to vertically position the
content we could use the Align
items the Align items also accept the
same values we can set it to
Center we can also set this one to start
or
end
just we'll keep this to Center as
well you can also align the entire grid
within the
container so let's get rid of these to
just demonstrate them in a proper
manner we could use the justifi content
and that will align the content
horizontally within the
container
we can also set this to start or to
end just set this back to
Center to align the content vertically
we could use the Align content and the
Align content also exess the same value
we can set it to
Center or
start if you inspect the
elements
you can see they are aligned centrally
between the container we'll just close
this okay so this is everything you need
to know to get started with a grid
layout grid works very similar to the
flex box but it allows you too much in
terms of laying your elements because of
its 2y
nature what is a flex box Flex boox also
called flexible Box model is basically a
layout mode or model that provides an
easy and clean way to arrange the items
within a
container if you are using a CSS for a
while you must have used the old block
model where you assign width in terms of
percentage or fixed width and then use
the float to arrange the items on the
page suppose for example you want to AR
three boxes in a row then you have to
enter everything manually from width
height and to padding flexbox can do all
these things with ease
some of the concepts of flexible Box
model is the ability to alter the item
width and height to best fit in the
containers available in the free
space flex model is Direction agnostic
which is different from the Box model
which is vertically biased and the
inline which is horizontally biased
flexbox works for
both flexbox is more effective in small
scale
layouts so here are the main properties
of the flex
okay so let's jump to some code and
learn how these Flex properties work
okay so we are on the subline text
trator to get started let's add a div
inside a body here and we'll give a
class of flexbox container since this
will be the container where all our
flexbox item will
reside
then inside this container we will add
another div and give it a class flexbox
item and one more class flexbox item one
which will help us to understand which
items we are referring to when we style
our elements
individually let's just see the file and
see how it looks on a page now if you
save the file you can see we have the
box because I have already applied some
of the styles to this flexbox items
let's just see The
Styling so you can see we have the items
styled just a basic styling so that we
get the box on the web
page now let's just copy these and add
two more flexbox items and you will see
we have two more boxes on our
page just copy and paste them
below give them the class name flexbox
item 2 and flexbox item 3 just save the
file now you can see we have three boxes
on the
page now to create a flex container we
will add display Flex to our Flex
container and this is how we create a
flex box
container so here we will just add
display
Flex just save the
file now you can see all the items are
in the same height and they're all in
the same row you will also notice that
if we shrink our browser the items
adjust themselves accordingly to fit
within the
browser now if you want to sty the
elements on the main axis we will use
the property justify content inside a
flexbox container let's make it a
center save the
file now you can see that all the
elements are in the center of the page
another thing we can do is if we want
our layout to have a spaces between the
elements we will set the justify content
to space
between
you can see all the items are now evenly
spaced if you want to lay out your items
on the cross axis we would use the Align
items property the default value for
this is stretch if we want to keep the
size of our items we will use the center
and then all our items will be Center
vertically before flexbox aligning the
items vertically inside the container
was nearly impossible with flexbox you
can do it
easily
now you can see the items are aligned
vertically inside the container now
let's just delete everything and we just
keep the display
Flex now if we want to have a column
layout instead we will use the flex
direction and change it to column Flex
Direction column now if you refresh the
page you will see all the items are
shown up in a
column now we can start talking about
the different properties that can be
applied to our different flexbox items
as opposed to flexbox container items
the flexbox container is only for laying
out and spacing between your items as
well as the positioning of your item
inside the container the actual flexbox
item properties are used to override
those item Properties or to apply
different sizing to these elements now
if we want our first item that it does
not shrink when we shrink our browser
we'll set the flex shrink to zero to our
first
item so we'll set the flex shrink to
zero now if you go back back to the
page and try to shrink
this you'll see the first item Remains
the Same it does not
shrink now in the same way you can set
the items to grow in proportion with the
web browser suppose we want a flex box
item to to grow with the as the page
grow and cover all the empty spaces so
we'll set this Flex grow to
one now you will see the all the empty
spaces are taken by the second item
let's say we want a second box to be at
the center of the container instead of
stretching to full height we can use the
Align self property and set it to
center now you will see that the Align
self property overrides the Align
content property of the
container you can see it is centrally
aligned
so this is all you need to understand
and get started to work with the flex
boxes I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and learned something new about the flex
boox and how you can use the flex boox
to create the dynamic layout for your
site so we are on the sublim tech serer
to get started I have created a box
named simply run with background color
pink the font size is 30 pixel and we
have set the border to zero solid green
let's see how it looks on our
page so as you can see we have a box
named simply with background going all
the way to the end I have also removed
all the padding and margin from the page
so that the boxes are pushed just at the
corner of the page as you can see let's
start by adding a padding of 20 pixel to
the
box if you save the file you can see the
Box increased by 20 pixel from all the
sides
padding occurs inside the background of
an element it goes around the content of
the element most of the buttons inside
the CSS designed using padding so that
the background of the button becomes
wider than the actual text the next
thing we can do is change the border of
the element if you change this border
size to 15 pixel we will get a nice
solid background of color
green the Border goes around the padding
of our element so we have add the 20
pixel of padding around the content and
15 pixel of water around the padding
which is around the
content now we'll see the working of the
margin if we add 30 pixel of margin to
our element you can see the spacing on
the outside of our
border so let's add the 30 pixel margin
and
refresh you can see this spacing on
outside of the Border margin is used to
space two elements apart from each other
now let's let change these values to see
the difference let's make the margin 40
pixels we'll make the padding 30 pixels
and let's keep the Border 20 pixels and
make it color
red This is 40
pixels let's observe the
changes so as you can see our border now
has a red background the padding is 30
pixel the margin is 40 pixel let's
inspect the elements to understand it
better by clicking on inspect you can
see the different styles here in the
computer tab you can see the Box model
this is a Content area uh this is the
padding area this is the border and this
is the margin area we have the margin of
40 pixels around the border so so you
can when you click on this area you can
see the margin get highlighted the
Border area gets highlighted of 20
pixels this is the padding and this is
the content you can change the size of
the content by adding the height and
width so let's try adding height and
width we'll give the height 50 pixels
and we'll give the width also 50
pixels just save the
file now when you refresh
what are CSS
selectors CSS selectors allow you to
select and style HTML elements selectors
are used to find elements based on their
ID classes types attributes value of
attributes and much more let's discuss
the most common selectors there are
several different types of CSS selectors
the most common of them are CSS element
selectors CSS ID selector CSS class
selector CSS Universal selector and CSS
group selectors so what is a CSS element
selector the element selector selects
element based on the element name this
is a CSS selector it means it will
select all the P elements on the page it
will style all the P elements to the
central aligned having blue color this
is a CSS
selector it is set to P this means it
will select all the P elements on the
page it will style all the P elements to
be Center aligned having blue color
let's look at what it looks on a
page so as you can see all the elements
are centrally aligned with a text color
blue CSS ID selector the ID selector
uses the ID attribute of an HTML element
to find a specific element an ID should
be unique within the page so you should
use the ID selector to find a single
unique element to find an element within
a specific ID use a hash character
followed by the ID of the element so
here we have used the hash paravan so
all the rule will be applied to the HTML
element with ID equal to par 1 so this
is an ID selector it will be applied to
all the HTML element with ID is equal to
par 1 as you can see it is applied to
the element having the ID Paran and all
the other elements are defaultly styled
CSS class selector the class selector
finds the element with a specific class
set by the HTML class attribute to
select an HTML with a specific class use
a period character followed by the name
of the class so this style will be
applied to all the elements having the
class name class one this is a class
selector it is denoted by a period
symbol all the elements having a class
name class one will be styled with
centrally aligned and color blue as you
can see the element having the class
name class one is styled and all the
other elements are set to default CSS
Universal
selector the universal selector selects
all the elements on a page the universal
selector is assigned by a star character
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a stylesheet as you can see
it is denoted by a star Mark all the
elements inside our web page will be
centrally aligned and the color will be
set to Blue as you can see all the
elements are centrally aligned and the
colors are set to Blue CSS group
selector in Styles sheets there are
often elements using the same style to
minimize the code you can group
selectors to group The selectors
separate each selectors with a comma
here we have group selectors for H1 H2
and P so style is applied to H1 H2 and P
elements only it is better to group The
selectors to minimize the code here we
have group selectors P H2 and H3 so
style will be applied to only elements
having P H2 and H3 as you can see so all
the elements of P H2 and H3 are
centrally aligned and colored to Red we
are going to discuss what are key frames
and we'll try to understand the syntax
of the key frames so let's get
started the key frames are used to
specify the animation code in the page
they're used to change the animation
from one pattern to another keep in mind
that the key frames do not have any
selectors on them they're not listed
inside anything they're on the root of
the CSS page you write atate key frames
and the name you can name it anything
you want we are going to use that name
later on to call the selector in this
case we are looking at PR and two from
implies the initial State and to the
ending State here in this example the
element will start from 0 pixel and will
go all the way to 100 pixel so what we
are going to do right now is we are
going to jump to the key frames and work
out some examples to understand the
working of the key frames better if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more so we are on the sublime textor and
this is a simple setup we have created
one HTML element named box and we have a
CSS body of padding 50 pixel and the Box
element has an inline block background
red with height and withd 200
pixel and also I have an animation St
declared on the box currently it's doing
nothing because it is calling key frames
called my frames but we have not yet
created any key frame we will discuss
what these animation line means at later
stage but right now I need those lines
to be able to explain you to the
functioning of the key
frames you can see we have a box on our
page with the color red and padding 50
pixels around it we are going to write
add the key frames and I'm going to use
the name my frames then we'll write
promt condition to have the starting
State and let's just keep the height 200
pixel and then we want it to grow and we
will set it to increase till 500 pixels
so let's just create our key
frames this is a PR
condition we'll set it to 200
pixels and we want it to grow till 500
pixels
just save the
file now as you can see our box is
growing all the way to 500 pixel and
when the animation is done it resets
back to 200 pixel and start again
because the animation is looping you can
also put multiple style declaration for
example I'm going to write background
pink in the two
condition just save the
file you can see that the animation is
starting at red and ending at pink now
instead of saying from and to you can
also say from 0% to 100% this is as same
as doing from and to but what it enables
you to do is you can add something in
the middle of here say 30% and we will
make the color any different so in the
place of prom we'll write
0%
and we'll replace two with
100% let's just add one more condition
in between say
40% so at 40% we want the color to
change to say something uh
green let's save the file and see how it
looks on the
page so as you can see it starts with
red it turns to Green in the middle and
then all the way converts to Pink as you
can see there are lots of interesting
things you can do with the key frames
all of the things that I'm showing you
today are just like how this works to
really get a great understanding of how
it works you just have to open your
editor and start experimenting on
it okay so now let's go back to our code
and learn about the animation
property so here we have the animation
named my frames the animation name
should be as same as key frames name to
work it properly the animation duration
specifi for how long we want our
animation to last in this case 2 seconds
let's just change this to say 10
seconds just save the
file now as you can see the animation is
going at a slower speed just to cover
the 10 seconds of
that let's just reset it to 2
seconds the timing function used to
mention the transition there are some
keywords such as EAS in linear EAS in
out and some more the animation delay is
interesting to understand it means how
long we are going to wait once the
animation is triggered before the visual
starts
happening let's change it to 3
seconds as you can see the animation
starts after the 3 seconds iteration
count specifies how many times the
animation should happen here we have set
it to
infinite
which means animation will keep on going
let's change it to something say
five as you can see after the count of
five the animation stops we'll set it
back to
infinite
animation running State can be paused or
the running
state to get started I have a really
simple example setup as you can see
inside my HTML I have the two paragraph
tags and I have a formatting with a
background color of San color and font
size 30
pixels as you can see this looks like
something like this on the page the very
first property we are going to discuss
is a display block
property the block display values make
an element a block element the block
elements start a new line and span the
entire width of the viewport by default
like how P elements behave there are
also line breaks before and after these
elements the default value of the P
element is a display block so here this
looks something like
this
what display blocks does is it means
that it is going to take the entire
width of given to it this is going to
force a new line above and new line
below it so you cannot have something
next to here now if we change here this
[Music]
to the next property we are going to
discuss is inline the inline display
value turns any element into an inline
element these elements will appear on
the same line without
brakes now if it change here this to
display in line now all the P tags will
behave as an inline element now if we go
back to our page and refresh you can see
now this is an inline
element the inline element takes the
minimum amount of space possible as you
can see here the cular takes the minimum
amount of space to fit all the content
inside of this p
so this is what an inline element does
also all the inline elements are on the
same line they share the space together
because they take the minimum amount of
space possible there are no line breaks
in these elements and they try to fit as
closely as possible now one of the
demerits here is we cannot change the
height and width of the inline
element if you change here height to 200
pixels and with 200 pixels and Save
just go back and refresh you'll see
nothing happens this is because in the
inline display property you cannot
change the height and width of the
element the next property we are going
to discuss is the inline block value the
inline block value is a hybrid of inline
and block elements elements assigned
display inline block appears on the same
line with the other inline elements a
characteristics of inline elements
however inline block elements are also
like block elements in that you can
change the width and height of the
CSS now if here we try to change the
height and
width of the
element just just change this to inline
block now if you go back to the page and
refresh you'll see the height and width
property works this is one of the major
difference between the inline block and
the inline inline display property
the last name type of display we are
going to discuss is the display none and
this is a really straightforward display
property just delete
this and change the display to display
none now if you save the file and go
back and refresh you'll see both the
element disappears
the display none removes the targeted
elements and all its child elements from
the page this causes accompanying
elements to behave as if this element
does not exist first let's cover the
theoretical part here we will discuss
what is the SS position property and its
different types after that we'll jump to
practical example to learn how to work
with these properties so let's get
started so what is CSS position
property the CSS position property
allows you to to define the position of
an element on a web page the top right
bottom and the left CSS position
properties are used to determine the
final location of the
element there are four values that you
can use to set the position of an
element on a web page they are static
fixed relative and absolute using one of
the four values above you can specify
how an element should be positioned you
can also use the top bottom left and
right properties to further Define the
element position on a page so let's
discuss each of the properties
individually CSS static
position this is a by default position
for HTML elements it always positions an
element according to the normal flow of
the page it is not affected by the top
bottom left and right
properties it is important to note that
having a static position is the same as
not setting the position property at
all the next is CSS fixed
position
the fixed positioning property helps to
put the text fixed on the browser the
fixed test is positioned relative to the
browser's window and does not move even
when you scroll the
window the next is CSS relative
position the relative position property
is used to set the element relative to
its normal
position the relatively positioned
element behaves the same way as a static
element except that it is now subject to
the values of the four other CSS
properties
we'll discuss each of them with more
detail in
examples now there is CSS absolute
position the absolute positioning is
used to position an element related to
the first parent element that has a
position other than static if no such
element is found the containing block is
HTML with absolute positioning you can
place an element anywhere on the
page now let's move on to the example to
understand each of the properties better
to demonstrate the properties I have the
simple example set up currently we have
three elements with just basic coloring
style we have not applied any position
style to them now let's click on this
element two and inspect
it just go to the computed and type here
position to see the position of this
element so you can see that currently
the position is static static is a
default value of of all the elements of
the page in
starting the next position we'll see is
a relative position it works almost in a
similar manner to static if we go here
and change a position to
relative you can see nothing changes
relative Act is the same as static with
the only difference is that the relative
allows you to change the top left left
right and bottom of this element let me
show you an
example now if we change here to
left 20
pixel and
refresh you will notice the elements
move itself to 20 pixel from the left
let's set the top to 10 pixel as
well
you can see the element has moved 10
pixel from the top and even overflows
the element below this is because
relative position when applied with the
top right left and bottom actually takes
that element out of the document
flow so let's just reset
it next property we are going to discuss
is absolute position and this this
property gets well along with the top
right left and bottom so let's make this
position to
Absolute and you can see the changes
made due to this by just
saving the absolute value completely
removes the element from the document
flow this is useful when you want a
particular element to be a specific
position but you don't want to disturb
the other element's positioning
absolute position positions the element
inside of some parent container that it
can reference now just let's shift the
top to 10
pixels you can see the movement of this
[Music]
element
the absolute position always position
the element inside some parent container
that it can reference to now if we
change the here body position to
relative now the this nav bar will
position the element according to this
body so if we go here and refresh this
you can see that this two isn't relation
to with this
container and this is where relative is
very
useful
next is fixed positioning which is very
similar to Absolute positioning with
some differences so let's change this to
fixed and just save
this now you can see it completely
ignores this relative positioning and
goes entirely at the top this is because
fixed position elements are always fix
fixed based on the entire HTML element
it has nothing to do with the parent
elements one unique feature of the fixed
element is they stay in the same place
when you scroll let's make the height
here to 200 vertical
height now if you scroll down you will
see that the element two will stay on
the same
position see the two elements is stick
to the same
position but absolute does not work that
way when you change this here to
Absolute you can see it does not stay at
at the top now this is one major
difference between absolute and
fixed so that's it you can see the
working with the CSS position super easy
in this particular session we will go
through the introduction to JavaScript
we will see why JavaScript was developed
what was the need for JavaScript and
also the evolution in technology in
recent few decades basically I will give
you a brief introduction behind
JavaScript programming so without any
further delay let's get started
JavaScript was developed in the year
1995 by a person named Brendan Ike
Brendan was working for Netscape
Communications while he developed
JavaScript in 10 days there were a few
changes in the name of JavaScript
initially it was mocha which was later
changed to live script and then it
finally became JavaScript the start of
JavaScript wasn't that good as so many
developers who were using Java at that
time they considered JavaScript as a
language for designers and
non-engineers no one ever knew that this
small side scripting language would have
a great future today more than 90% of
the websites out there they are using
JavaScript somehow many of you guys gets
confused with Java and JavaScript let me
clear it for you that both Java and
JavaScript they are different languages
they have almost nothing in common many
people say that JavaScript was named
after Java as a part of a marketing
strategy to gain wider acceptance and
recognition in 1995 Java was a buzzword
when JavaScript was developed that's why
they renamed JavaScript after Java let's
move on to what is
Javascript have you guys ever been
through a website where you can see
images that slides automatically one
such website is Amazon the homepage of
Amazon where we can see different types
of ongoing sales is an example of
JavaScript in Layman language JavaScript
is a lightweight scripting language used
to make web pages more interactive and
more likely earlier when JavaScript was
developed it was only a side scripting
language to do basic tasks like you can
add popups in your web page or you can
make your web page more interactive
nothing more than that but now the whole
scenario has changed with the help of
JavaScript we can create applications as
well if we talk about applications let's
take an example let's suppose we want to
create an app we can create it in
Android or in iOS
but we have to learn few different
languages to create those apps for
Android we have to learn Java and XML
and Swift We have to learn for iOS but
with the help of JavaScript you can
create hybrid applications which can
work on any platform without any problem
TCH giants like Google PayPal Amazon and
YouTube they are using JavaScript these
days the evolution of JavaScript in the
past few years was unbelievable
suppose you want to create a single page
website everyone of us is familiar with
Gmail let's suppose so Gmail is a single
page website which looks more like a
desktop software than a website so Gmail
is based on angular.js it is a popular
framework by Google which is free of
cost and it is totally based on
JavaScript now let's go over some of the
features of JavaScript these features
are actually why it is considered that
using JavaScript is advantageous over
other languages so let's start with some
of these points JavaScript is not a
proper programming language indeed it is
a scripting
language which works in the runtime
environment just like python so there
are few other languages like C++ and
Java they need a compiler to work but
with JavaScript you don't need a
compiler once you are done with the
script it will interpret and show you
the output in the browser directly next
up is lightweighted Javascript can
provide programming facility to some
extent in JavaScript you don't need to
specify any data type or return type
which helps in making development more
quicker that's why it is known as
lightweighted JavaScript is both client
side as well as server side technology
client side technology runs on the
users's computer whereas the server side
technology runs on the web browser
initially when JavaScript was introduced
it was introduced as a client side
technology but with the introduction of
node.js in 2009 one can now work in the
back end as well there is a way to
validate the users Data before sending
it to the web server and we can do that
with the help of JavaScript the data
will be checked for correct form and
value all we have to do is start a loop
give it the condition to check the data
JavaScript is also platform independent
although originally designed to work on
browsers only but now it is a platform
independent language which means once
you are done with the script you can use
it on any browser or platform without
any problem JavaScript is an object
based scripting language although many
programmers do not consider JavaScript
as a true objectoriented programming
language due to its lack of class
concept it does support other features
of objectoriented programming like it
supports encapsulation it supports
polymorphism and also it supports
prototyp
inheritance the last but not the least
feature of JavaScript is case sensitive
so when it comes to keywords identifiers
names and functions JavaScript
differentiates between capital and
lowercase letters we have to keep this
in mind while
programming now I will quickly go over
some of the JavaScript applications
where JavaScript is currently being
implemented first one that comes to
every person's mind is web development
it was also the main motive behind
developing JavaScript we have
Technologies like angular we have
node.js we can create beautiful web
pages also JavaScript can be used along
with HTML and CSS to make those static
looking web pages more engaging if we
talk about other applications of
JavaScript we can use it in app
development either mobile app or web app
like we took the example before that how
hybrid apps made with the help of
JavaScript can take over traditional
Android and iOS app one of the most
important and unique application of
JavaScript is in SmartWatches the
bangle.js is an open-sourced Smartwatch
powered by JavaScript Gordon Williams
the man who is currently working on this
project it is said that this new
open-source stack built around
JavaScript will replace the onboard
firmware soon the next application of
JavaScript is client side validation as
we discussed earlier JavaScript is used
to validate the user data whether the
user's input is correct or Not by
crosschecking it with the given
condition like the user wants to enter
in your website and you want it to be a
user with at the gmail.com in his email
ID so you will give that condition to
JavaScript and it will cross check it
with the users information like when the
user will try to enter in your website
it will check that if at theate
gmail.com is there or not in the user's
email ID so it can validate the user
also apart from that one more
application of JavaScript is game
development JavaScript can be used to
make fully fledged 2D or 3D games using
different libraries although most
JavaScript game development focuses on
creating games used in browsers only
till now we have an idea about what
JavaScript is its features and its
applications so if you want to learn
JavaScript you need to do some basic
things to make your learning experience
more smoother let's take a look at the
pre requisites to use JavaScript the
first one is the basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS to use JavaScript along with
HTML and CSS you first need to know how
HTML and CSS Works see HTML is used to
create the structure of a web page while
CSS is used to style that web page in
order to use these two with JavaScript
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS because if you want to
learn a new language first of all you
need to know why to use that technology
and to learn JavaScript more efficiently
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS it's better to have a web
browser that supports JavaScript like
Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox or you
can use Safari as well if you are using
a Macbook you will need an operating
system like Windows Linux or Mac
operating system to learn JavaScript a
computer with minimum 52 MB of ram would
be enough for you to start learning
JavaScript but I will recommend you a
computer with 1GB of Ram or 4GB of RAM
for a better experience you can use any
text editor you have notepad which is
free and is already available for
Windows if you don't want to use notepad
you can use other free softwares like
sublime or you can use visual code in
this particular course we will be using
visual code and I'll tell you how to
install visual code and what are the
features of visual code also suppose you
do not have any prior knowledge about
JavaScript don't worry about it we will
take you through the whole course and we
will ensure that you can understand
JavaScript that's all for this video see
you in the next one where we will go
through why one should learn JavaScript
we will also look at the different types
of jobs you can get after learning
JavaScript Dom stands for document
object model it is an API for HTML and
XML documents which helps JavaScript to
understand what is there written inside
the HTML document API stands for
application PR programming interface to
understand API better let's take an
example of a restaurant imagine yourself
in the restaurant you are sitting at the
table with the menu the chef in the
kitchen is also part of the system the
waiter here works as a messenger between
you and the chef that's what API does it
works as a moderator between JavaScript
and the HTML document Dom defines the
whole HTML document in a hierarchical
form to make it understandable for
JavaScript so that other JavaScript
functions can work over it it represents
the entire document in the form of
object and nodes whether it be elements
or text or anything stored in the
document the entire page content can be
accessed or manipulated by JavaScript
Dom is not used with JavaScript only
other languages like python also uses
dom dom was designed to be used
independently
to begin with dom there is nothing
special you have to do different
browsers have different implementation
of the document object model every
browser uses Dom to make the web page of
the document accessible by JavaScript
let's move on and see what is document
object model with the help of an example
I believe you guys have the basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS a prerequisite
for this course let's start things off
with a basic HTML exam example here we
have a code that consist tags like HTML
head body heading tag Etc we have the
HTML tag here the opening HTML tag and
the closing HTML tag inside the HTML tag
we have the head tag which contains the
document's header part inside the head
tag there is a title tag that contains
the title of the web page then comes the
body tag which contains a heading tag
and two div tags with IDs as div 1 and
div2 a div tag defines a particular
section in the HTML document the ID used
within the div tag it is an attribute
basically that has to be unique within
the document to make the element unique
from other elements next up we have a
paragraph tag with a class attribute
within it CSS and JavaScript uses
classes to select and access specific
elements don't worry guys if you have no
idea about it let us first see the
output of this code before going to the
document object model of this whole
document so guys this is the output of
the previous code we just came through
here we can see the title of the web
page as well as heading after it there
were two different div tags used in the
code here's the output of both the div
tags the question here is where are
those ID and class attributes seen in
the output the answer to this question
is there's nothing on this web page that
can show both of them we can use them in
our CSS file or through JavaScript to
specify the containers in which they are
used so we have concluded how a normal
document works and how the browser
interprets the HTML code but how
JavaScript uses this code is a bit
different that's where Dom comes into
play when the actual HTML document is
loaded in the browser another
representation of that document is
created known as document object model
here's the model you can see on your
screen each of the tags used in HTML
document is correspondingly represented
as objects in the dog like starting from
the HTML tag and covering all the other
tags like head title body and few more
the same hierarchy as there was in the
HTML document goes with the document
object model also document object model
is simply the same HTML document with
different representation the reason
behind this different representation is
that it's easy for JavaScript to
interpret this format JavaScript can't
understand tags but it can understand
these objects JavaScript can easily
manipulate these objects using different
functions which we will see in future
while working on these functions for
example if you want to access the text
present inside the heading tag you can
do it by accessing The Heading tag with
JavaScript you can also work on the
style of this text with the help of
JavaScript as well JavaScript uses the
concept of nodes it can access nodes of
the document object model there are many
types of nodes present in the Dom the
basic three types are element node
attribute node and text node the element
node consists of all the tags used in
HTML document like the head tag and the
body tag the attribute node contains the
attributes used in HTML document by now
I hope you have understood the concept
of attributes so JavaScript can access
these attributes as well and the user
user can work upon them as per
requirements the text here in the HTML
document that is simply it can also be
accessed with the help of JavaScript it
is the value of that particular element
that's all for this video see you in the
next one where I'll show you how to
install a text editor for this
particular course we will be using
visual studio code I will run you
through the installation process as well
if this video helped you anyhow do give
it a like comment your doubts share we
are using vs code Studio as a text
editor to write the script here we have
already discussed the benefits as well
as the features of vs code in the
previous video so as I've already
mentioned you must have a web browser
with JavaScript enabled in it so if
you're using Google Chrome it's quite
easy to enable JavaScript let me take
you through it open Google Chrome go to
settings and just write JavaScript in
the search option go to site settings
and scroll down you will find here
JavaScript allow it if it's not allowed
in my case it's already allowed so I'm
good to go once you have downloaded the
editor and you are done with the
environment setup and all you can start
writing the program so let's go to V
code we will open a new file here and
save it with the name let's open a new
file and we will save it with name
first. HTML make sure to save your file
with HTML extension as it will make it
easy for the computer to understand that
this particular file is an HTML file so
in the last video we installed an
extension named live server let me tell
you how to use it and what are the
benefits of using live server so let's
write a basic HTML program or just press
the exclamation key and press enter here
we are with the basic HTML program we
have not done anything yet just edit it
a little bit we'll add a heading tag and
inside the heading tag we will write a
heading let's suppose we are
writing hello so now right click on your
desktop and click on open with live
server what this will do it will open
your program in the browser see it's the
basic thing so let me tell you what its
benefits are it will open your program
in the browser and whatever changes you
are making in the programs will be
directly shown in the browser the moment
you save them see just use Google Chrome
or whatever browser you are using and in
the vs code side by side we'll be using
it side by side now let's suppose we'll
change something here let's add a word
here hello
world and the moment we save it it will
be reflected in your browser as well so
that's the benefit of using live Ser we
will be using it during our whole code
so now we are done with that let's start
with the program so here we are with our
basic HTML code which has only tags in
it it will print nothing if I remove
this heading tag let me remove it and
the moment I save it it will print
nothing so guys let me give you a brief
introduction to these tags these HTML
tags are used to render HTML L files
properties so that the browser can
differentiate between simple text and
HTML tags you can use as many tags
according to your requirements in our
first program we will write a single
line statement over the browser for that
we will need the script tag don't worry
if you don't know much about script tag
let me tell you briefly about this tag
functionality it is used to embed a
client side script language remember
guys script tag is used to embed
JavaScript with HTML this is where HTML
and JavaScript comes together it may
contain the scripting statements or
Point towards the external script
through the SRC attribute we will see
the SRC attribute as well we'll use the
script tag inside the body tag or we can
use it wherever we want to use it like
it's not necessary to use it inside the
body tag only we can use it anywhere in
a program so let's start with this first
let's start the script
tag
and we are done with it now the script
tag we have to type an
attribute the attribute is the type is
it's a text
file we are done with our script tag to
write on the web page we use a very
basic command the document. write it is
a JavaScript method using which you can
print anything on the browser let's see
what document. write can do let's write
here something document. write
and any text you want to write inside it
let's suppose hello
world welcome
to Simply
code so guys we are done with this we
have written a text over here hello
world welcome to Simply code let's see
what will happen when we save it press
crl + S and the moment you save it here
it will be reflected on your browser
here you can see in our browser it's
written over here hello world welcome to
Simply code we can Define JavaScript in
an external file as well let's see how
we can do this how this script tag will
Point towards an external Javascript
file here what you have to do you have
written script just before type use an
attribute SRC and give it the source of
the file but till now we don't have any
Javascript file so let's create a file
first name it as script.js
remember you have to save it withjs
extension we are done with it and we are
good to go so here we will write
document do
write and any text you want to write
here hello world welcome
to Simply learn we will save it the
moment we will save it
here there's something wrong I
guess okay we we have not given the
source code of that JavaScript so here
we will have to give the name of that
file it was
script.js moment we will save it see the
text is changed here initially it was
Hello World welcome to Simply code but
now it is Hello World welcome to Simply
learn this document. write is not
interpreted by the browser that's
because this script tag is now pointing
towards an external Javascript file
anything you will write inside this
script tag will not be considered now so
we are done with the script tag here we
now have an idea of how to embed
JavaScript with HTML and now let's see
some of the features of document. WR so
let's suppose you are you have written
this text here let's erase it and see
what else it can do let's give it a task
to add two numbers let's suppose we have
given here 9 + 3 let's see if it works C
it will give you the output directly
here document don't write 9 + 3 it will
give you the output as 12 similarly L
you will do any mathematical task any
calculation you want to
do let's
suppose 7 * by
8 see you can see here 12 56 12 let's
give it another one 9 * 5 minus let's
suppose 3 and save it see 9 into 5 is 45
and if you minus 3 from 45 you'll get 42
here is the answer for s42 56 is for 7
into 8 7 * by 8 and 12 is for 9 + 3 so
with that we are done with how to embed
with uh JavaScript with HTML let's move
on to another Concept in JavaScript that
is console.log console log is a function
in JavaScript that works the same as
document. write but it will not print
anything in the browser let's give it a
try let's clear this and suppose we
write here
console.log and give it a command save
it and see there's nothing printed on
the browser let's write something in the
body tag we'll use a heading tag and
write something here let's go again and
go to body tag we'll use a heading tag
here as well and write something here
let's suppose we
write code save it see this is printed
on the browser to open your browser
console go to browser right click here
and go to inspect element or you can use
control+ shift+ I which I normally do
here you can see the console option see
it has many options like elements
consoles sources Network and many more
but for now let's focus on Console here
you can see the text printed here so
what's the point of doing this whenever
we write a code we usually have many
variables and functions and a lot of
these kinds of things we don't always
know what to expect as the output maybe
we expect a particular result but we
might get something else one way of
debugging our code is that we can pass a
value to this function here only and we
can check the result of that value out
of the code let's add two numbers here
so if you don't understand it basically
what we are doing for now we are writing
a small piece of code like the program
is not that big but later on when we are
good with JavaScript and we'll use
JavaScript as a primary language the
size of the program will go longer and
longer so not every time you are
supposed to check the output of your
code by doing that only so if you are
using any variables or you are using any
functions you can check the output here
only if you have to use that variable in
that way or you have to change something
so you will get it here only that's the
use of
console.log let's add two numbers remove
it a is equal to 5 and let B value is
eight suppose okay we are done with
these two numbers and we will what we'll
do we will
write console.
log we have given it the command to add
a and b let's see if it works here see
the value of a + b is 13 you can see it
here in console the value is 13 you can
see it here so here we can see that the
output is 13 you can do any complex
calculation here in the console it will
give you the correct answer you can see
here script.js colon 4 the number after
the column is the line in script.js here
in our file we can see that the
console.log command is in line number
four so here it is written that it is
line number four here so if you click on
this you can see the script.js open in a
very small window and you can edit it
from here as well so this is not a
random line number to Pro prove this
let's go on to a program and let's move
this to another line see now the
console.log is in line 11 save it and
here you can see this also changed to 11
so let's make this more complex add
another variable C We'll add another
variable here let suppose we add C here
we'll give it a more complex equation
let's suppose let C equals
to
the moment we save it it will give it
the answer oh no we are done with the
equation let's change it here also the
value of C
is let's see if it works or not press
crl + S it's saved and the value of C is
7even let's see if this value is correct
or not the value of a was five 5 into 3
is 15 15 + 8 is 23 23 + 4 is is 27 27 +
a - 25 value of a is 5 - 25 is -20 27
minus 20 the value of C is 7 say it's
correct check it yourself if you can do
something more interesting with this
console.log or you can do something more
interesting with document. right so
console log allows us to debug our code
and we can use it if we are not sure
about the output in a lengthy program so
guys that's all for this video see you
in the next one where I'll run you
through JavaScript statements and
comments if this video helped you anyhow
make sure to like it comment your doubts
share it with your friends and don't
forget to subscribe simply code thank
you so variables are named storage that
a program can manipulate as the name
suggest a variable is a value that can
change according to conditions variables
refers to those memory blocks inside the
computer where we can store information
let's suppose you want to store any
value inside your computer
so variable will represent the location
of that value in simple terms variables
are cups with stuff inside them and you
can use that stuff later again and again
according to the way you want to before
the introduction of es6 or ecmascript we
can say which is the updated version of
JavaScript variables were declared using
a single keyword only which is where
we'll try to declare a few variables
here we'll see how where keyword works
so let's comment this thing first so
let's declare a few variables let's
suppose where a equal to 15 we will
declare where B and the value of B will
be six we will declare where C and the
value of C will would be a + b so here
we have defined three variables a b and
c a is a variable with value 15 stored
inside it and so is B the value of B is
six but C is a Val variable that will
contain the value of a + b let's try to
print this on browser document.
write and we will print the value of
C save it and here you can see the value
of C is
21 that's the correct answer so
similarly you can also print a and b as
well let's print a and b as well here
what we'll do we'll copy this line we'll
paste it for a
and we'll update this here as well so it
won't create any
confusion so here you can see the value
of C is 21 the value of a is 15 and the
value of B is 6 it shows the value of
all the three variables we declared but
with the introduction of es6 or E my
script in 2015 two more ways were
introduced to declare a variable these
are let and const we shall discuss these
two terms in the later part of this
session let me show you how to declare a
variable there are a few things you have
to keep in mind while declaring a
variable name here we have seen we use
three variables a b and c that was an
easy task to do but giving a variable
any name like something other than a
single alphabet so you have to keep a
few things in mind while naming them
start them with the letter underscore or
a dollar sign you can't use any sign
except underscore or dollar so if you
are giving a variable name you can't use
any other sign except the underscore or
the dollar sign you can use these two
signs only you can't use any other sign
you can't use a number in the starting
apart from that let's suppose you want
to give it a name as 9be you can't do
that in JavaScript JavaScript won't
allow you this if you try to save it it
will throw you an error invalid or
unexpected token so you can't do this in
JavaScript there is no limit for the
length of the variable name but you
can't use reserved keywords in a
variable name like let's try to create a
variable with name as class class is a
reserved keyword in JavaScript we'll
save it and see here it throws an error
unexpected token class but you can use a
class with capital c let's save it and
here it will work fine why it works
because JavaScript variables are case
sensitive if we try to create a variable
with same name Let's see we try to
create a variable with where girl and
the another variable will be where girl
with capital G this time JavaScript will
treat these two variables differently
these two are different variables for
JavaScript as JavaScript is case
sensitive when it comes to variables
let's declare a few more variables let's
remove it we'll declare a few more
variable let let's comment this part as
well we'll declare a few more variables
suppose we declare a variable with
keyword where and we'll name this
variable as bike name where bike name
and press enter if we leave this
variable without assigning it any value
the by default value will be undefined
let's try to print the value of this
variable right we will try to print the
value of bike
name save it here you can see the value
it CHS is undefined so the by default
value of a variable if you do not assign
it any value will be undefined let's try
to give it a value let's suppose we try
to give bike name we use equals to
operator to assign it a value to assign
let's suppose we'll assign it
Yamaha semicolon and press control plus
s to save this and here you can see the
output as Yamaha you can also assign a
value to the variable during declaration
as we have done in the previous examples
here we have assigned the variables
value at the time of Declaration only
let's move on to let and const so we
will discuss let and const but first we
will compare let with where let is also
used to declare a variable just like
where is used but there is a limitation
to use let let is not accessible outside
the Block in which it is declared so we
will use let here only let bike name
equals and we will change this value as
well we'll change it to Hero let's say
save it and here you can see the output
as hero but if we try to put this code
inside a block let's suppose we put this
code inside this block a pair of curly
braces and we will again try to access
document. right we'll try to access bike
name again from here from outside the
block we try to access this save it and
here you can see by name is not defined
it is an error in line 18 so what's
happening here basically you can't
access a let variable outside the scope
you can't access it from here but it
will work with where if we try to
replace let with where and save it here
you can see it says hero and hero
because first it will interpret this
method and then it will interpret this
as well in case of where due to its
limited scope let variables are used
when there is limited use only
like in for Loop or in while loop we
will learn these Loop in future let will
not allow you to redeclare any variable
let's understand this with an example
here's the code as well we have declared
where bike name and we'll remove this
and first we'll try to do this with
where let's suppose where bike name
equals to TVs control+ s it says hero
and TVs so the variable name the bike
name is same in both both cases here and
here as well these are same but with
where keyword you can do that let will
not allow you to do this if we use let
here in place of where we'll write let
here as well and we will change the
value as well we will give it
as
Kawasaki and let's suppose Suzuki
here save it see by name has already
been declared so that's what let won't
allow you to do you can repeat the same
let variable in different scope it won't
create any problem but it will not allow
you to redeclare any declared variable
so let's move on to const we use const
when there are values we don't want to
change or that will never change
basically so the keyword const is little
misleading as it defines a constant
reference to a value not the const
Conant value we can't change the
Primitive value but we can change the
properties of constant objects let's
write another piece of code for const
keyword so let's declare a variable
const X is equal to
5 comma Y is equal to 7 let's
say so here what we we have done we
declared a variable X and a variable y
with value as 5 and 7 we declared this
time with const keyword and a variable
Zed which is x + y we printed Zed on the
browser and it shows the value as 12
which is x + y 7 + 5 is equal to 12 now
what we will do const will let you do
this but if you try to update the value
of x let's suppose we try to update the
value of x as X = to X Plus +
10 we'll print X this
time document.
write X let's save this it will throw an
error assignment to a constant variable
in line 24 so here you want to upgrate
the value of x you can't do this with
const keyword you can do this with let
and where as well but you can't do this
with const also const won't allow you to
redeclare any variable just like let so
if you try to use const x
again is equal to 10 save it so here it
says identifier X has already been
declared this thing you can do with
const the scope of const is the same as
let it can be used within the block
where it is declared so guys that's all
for this video see you in the next one
where I will run you through data types
in JavaScript I hope this video will
help you do give it a thumbs up if you
like this video comment your doubts
below share it with your friends and
don't forget to subscribe Simply Good
data types is an essential Concept in
every programming language to work on
any variable you should know its type it
refers to the kind of data which is
being stored inside a variable the type
of variable is holding basically every
programming language has its own set of
data types which is unique in its own
way we discussed earlier that JavaScript
is a light we scripting language because
we don't need to specify any data type
in JavaScript after all all the
variables in javascripts are Loosely
packed or we can say JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language we
shall discuss these properties later in
this video for now let me tell you about
different data types present in
JavaScript so JavaScript data types are
divided into two categories primitive
data types and non-primitive data types
primitive data types are stored in stack
whereas non-primitive data types they
are stored in Heap I don't want you to
go deep in these two terms as if you're
new to programming so we'll leave it
just keep one thing in mind that
primitive data types are based data
types whereas non-primitive data types
are objects or we can say they are
derived primitive data types they are
further divided into five categories
they are divided as numbers strings
Boolean undefined and null nonpr data
types or complex data types we can say
on the other hand they are divided into
two parts arrays and objects we'll have
separate videos on these topics for now
let's discuss primitive data types to
understand primitive data types much
better let's declare a few variable here
let's say we declare where X and give it
the value as 16 we'll declare where Y
and we'll give it value hello W we'll
declare one more let's say where
flag and the value will be
true here we can talk about those
properties of JavaScript which I
mentioned earlier JavaScript variables
are Loosely packed and JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language
these two points refer to the same thing
here you can see we have defined three
variables X we have defined variable X
we have defined variable Y and flag as
well the values for all three variables
is different from one another see
variable X is holding a value that is 16
variable Y is holding a value hello
world which is a string so 16 is a
number hello world is a string and
variable flag is holding a value that
refers to a Boolean value in place of
true we can also write false here so
what's happening here here you can see
there's no data type if you are coming
from a C++ background or a Java
background this will be a little bit
weird for you guys because in C++ and
Java we used to do it like we'll Define
an integer let let me show you so how we
will define an integer in C++ or Java
what we'll say we'll use intx = to 5 or
something like that we already had a
data type for string as well we have car
in C++ but here in JavaScript we have no
data type we are only using the wear
keyword that's what we call as Loosely
typed this line means that you don't
have to define the data type of the
variable what happens in JavaScript is
whatever the type of value you'll pass
to the variable the data type will
change accordingly so you don't need to
worry about if you are passing a number
or if you are passing an
string just relax just when you pass the
value to the variable it will be
determined automatically so these are
the three basic primitive data types
present in JavaScript which are
number Boolean value and string so let's
move on to the next one which is
undefined we'll Define a variable p and
we'll leave it as it is so this variable
P has an undefined data type it means
that any variable which is already
declared but has no value inside it it
has an undefined data type I'll tell you
a basic operator the type of operator
we'll go through the operators in later
videos but just try to understand the
basic need and use it with me for now
this operator will help you know the
type of value a variable is holding see
let's use it here we have declared a
variable P we'll check the type of P so
to use this operator you have to use it
with document do right
now so we'll do document do right and
we'll use two
brackets and inside it we'll
write type of and whatever like we want
to know the type of variable X let's
suppose we'll write here
x semicolon save it and you can see here
it says number this means that this
variable has a value which is a number
similarly we will check for all the
variables present here we'll check for
every variable we'll check for y we'll
check for flag and we'll check for p as
well let's copy this and paste it three
time and let's change the value here
from X to Y in this
line and from X to flag
here and here we'll change it to P so we
have done it we'll save it and see here
it says number first variable why it
says it's a string because you know
hello world is a string it's a sequence
of character for variable flag it says
Boolean so it's defined as true or false
and for variable P it's written here
undefined with this we are left with
only one primitive data type the null
data type there's a difference between a
null value and an undefined value
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means the absence of any value
suppose you are using null as the value
for any variable the type of operator
will return this variable as an object
but if you're not giving any value to
this variable you are leaving it after
declaration the type of operator will
return undefined here's an example for
this see we'll declare one more variable
here we'll declare where num let's name
this variable num and we will give it
the value as null we'll use document.
write type of and we will check with the
help of type of operator that what type
of value the variable num is holding so
let's give here num we are good to go
press contrl + S and C here it says it's
an
object so a null value will always be
shown as an object we'll talk about the
complex types or composite types in
further videos we'll have separate
videos for each of these types don't
worry about it so guys that's all for
this video see you in the next one where
I'll run you through type conversion in
JavaScript if this video helped you
anyhow do like it in the previous video
we learned about type conversion in
JavaScript by now you must have a clear
understanding of data types and we know
enough about variables in JavaScript so
without any further delay let's go
through operators in JavaScript in any
programming language an operator is a
symbol that makes the computer
understand that it needs to do some
specific task like if we want to perform
an addition between two numbers let's
say we want to perform addition between
four and five so guys if you see the
plus sign here this is known as the
operator and the two terms which are
four and five these two numbers the
these are known as the
operants we have different operators for
different purposes like we have Plus for
addition we have minus for subtraction
we have star or estri we can say for
multiplication and many more other
operators as well so there are many more
operators present in almost every
programming language which is present
out there like it operators are present
in Java they are present in C++ in C
almost every programming language out
there has the concept of operators it's
essential for you to know how and where
to use any operator despite of the
language you are working on one needs to
understand which operators are available
right so in this particular video I'll
take you through the basic types of
operator present in JavaScript I'll let
you know the types and we'll learn about
how to use them
and of course I'll take you through the
different categories of operators
present in JavaScript so in JavaScript
there are basically eight categories
into which operators are divided which
are we have arithmetic operators we have
assignment we have string we have
conditional we have logical bitwise
comparison and type of operator we'll
discuss the first three types in this
video that is we'll discuss the
arithmetic operators we'll discuss the
assignment and the string operators rest
we'll talk about in the following video
first up here is the arithmetic operator
hope you all are aware of the term
arithmetic right so arithmetic operators
perform mathematical calculations like
it performs addition subtraction
multiplication and division as well so
here are the few operators you can see
on your screen the plus operator minus
Aster division we have module modulus we
have increment we have decrement so
these are the basic arithmetic operator
we'll see each of these operator with an
example so let's move on to the
programming part first so guys I want to
mention one more thing here I want all
of you to make a separate file for each
topic we'll be covering from now on like
for operators we'll create a separate
file we'll create a separate one for
control statements and other topics
we'll cover in future from today so I
want you to create a separate file
because you know in future if you want
to access these topics it'll be easy for
you to access those files instead if you
are using a single file for all the
topics it'll be quite confusing so let's
start with the arithmetic operators
first let's take two variable we are in
the Javascript file let's take two
variables let's say where X = to 6 and
we'll take another variable let's say
where y equals
to
four now we'll perform some arithmetic
operations on these two variables we
have already seen the arithmetic
operators present like we have plus
minus we have increment decrement we
have multiplication division so we'll go
through all of these right so let's
start with it here we are done with our
basic three operators which is addition
subtraction and multiplication I have
commented the division because I have
something to tell you about the division
so let's check the output here first
let's save it and see the output is
addition 10 subtraction 2 and
multiplication 24 for addition it added
the two numbers it's 6 + 4 similarly for
substraction and multiplication it is 6
- 4 and it's 6 multiplied by 4 for
division I have left division because I
hope you guys know the difference
between Division and the modulus
operator let's try to use the modulus
operator along with the division so what
we'll do we'll commment these three and
let's remove move it from here and what
we'll do we'll paste this here and we'll
use the modulus here so now let's check
the output what it says for division and
modulus see we have divided 6 by 4
division it says it's 1.5 6 ided 4 that
is 1.5 it will show the quotient here
for modulus it's saying two because in
modulus it gives you the remainder and
and in division it gives you the
quotient as the answer so keep this
thing in mind guys keep this in mind
always take a note of it so we are done
with division and modulus next up we
have the increment and The decrement
Operators let me show them to you real
quick so what we'll do we'll declare
another variable let's say where Z
equals to
5 and we'll use the increment operator
here we'll use again document.
write and here will let's say we write
increment how to use increment operator
for increment operator you have to use
plus plus whatever variable you have
used so we'll use Plus+
Z and similarly we'll copy
this paste it here and here we'll use
minus minus for
decrement and change here as
well so let's see what happens let me
give
some space in between them so that you
won't get
confused let's save it and check the
output here increment is it says six and
decrement it says five so you can see
here the functioning of decrement and
increment operator the increment
operator will increase the value of Zed
by 1 and the decrement operator will do
the opposite of this it'll decrease the
value by one so we are done with the
arithmetic operators next up we have the
assignment
operators assignment operators are used
to assign values to different JavaScript
variables let's see the types first and
then we'll see how to use them so we
have these assignment operators here
here we have equals to plus equals to
minus equals to and we have multiplied
equals 2 we have divide equals 2 modulus
equals 2 and a few more
so let's see each of them with example
maybe not each of them but we'll try to
cover almost every single operator out
there which is present in your screen so
let's move on and see let's move on to
the programming part so here we are guys
let's declare a few variables let's say
we are declaring a variable a and we are
giving it the value as 10 suppose and
we'll declare another one let's say
where B and give it the value five so
for assignment ment operators what
assignment operator mean we have used
here the equal to sign right we have
used a equals to 10 this means whatever
value present on the right side of the
operator like here it is 10 it will be
assigned to the variable a I hope you
guys are getting this keep this in mind
so we have the value 10 and we are
assigning this value to the variable a
it says let's try to check the output of
a let's try to print a on the screen
okay
document see here you can see that the
value of a it says 10 and similarly the
value of B is 5 so let's do one more
thing we'll assign the value of a to B
how to do this let's change the value
here only let's suppose we are using the
value of where a and s 13 okay and the
value of whereb will will be providing
as let's say a so now let's try to print
the value of B here we will change we'll
print the value of B only let's save it
and see the output see it says the value
of B is 13 because we have assigned B
the value present at variable a which is
13 that's why it is showing the value of
b as 13 this is what assignment operator
is let's try other assignment operators
as well let's take another variable so
let's say where
A1 equals to let's say
51 so the next operator we will be using
is let's update the value of A1 first so
how to do this let's say A1 equals to no
it's a1+ equal to
9 and we we will print the
value let's check the output now see it
says the value of A1 is 60 here we have
given that a1+ equal to 9 see A1 + equal
to 9 is the same as if you don't want to
write here A1 + equal to 9 you can also
write it as A1 equal to A1 + 9 both of
these lines are same both these
statements means the same they are
performing the same task so A1 = to A1 +
9 is same as a1+ = to 9 that's what I
want you to understand with assignment
operators similarly if you want to
perform A1 minus equals to you can do it
as well so let's say A1 minus is equal
to 5 and we'll copy this line from here
paste it here again and save it now
let's see the output here what it says
some of you guys may get confused that
here it shows the value of 6 is 69 of A1
so in the first statement when we tried
to print A1 here the initial value was
51 then this statement was performed and
the value was updated to 60 then after
that one more statement this statement
is also performed and the value updated
to 69 it's 51 + 9 + 9 and the value we
have here is 69 now what happens if we
are using the minus equals 2 operator
what it will do it will decrease the
value of A1 by 5 it means that A1 equals
to A1 - 5 the value of A1 is 69 and it
will subtract 5 from 69 so here it says
the value of A1 is
64 hope you guys are getting this so we
have so many operators we have so many
of them like let's try a few more so we
have multiply equals to we have division
equals to we have modulus equals to so
I'll write these and then we'll see the
output so we are done with it let's
check the output here for A3 A4 and A5
you can see for A3 we have used multiply
equals 2 for A4 we have used divide
equals 2 and for A5 we have used modulus
equals 2 let's check the output here
save it and see it says the value of
a350
T it here we have taken A3 as 5 it's 10
into 5 because A3 = to A3 into 5 so it's
10 into 5 it shows the value as 50
similarly here it says the value of A4
is 3.75 because we have used here four
so instead of four let's try to use
three and save it see here you can see
it divides it and gives you the quotient
and the value of A4 / by 3 is 5 so simil
similarly for A5 it shows the value of
A5 is 6 because we have used the modulus
operator here and 20 divided by 7 we
have six as remainder so I hope you guys
are pretty clear with assignment
operators now next up we have string
operators the plus operator which we
used as the arithmetic operators earlier
right it also operates as a string
operator so we can use it to concatenate
two strings that mean we can add two
strings as well in JavaScript it is
possible with the help of string
operator similarly we have plus equals
to operator for Strings as well like we
have plus equal to for assignment it has
the same functioning for string as well
let's take the example for these two
operators let's move on to the
programming part so here you can see we
have two variables where St str1 and
where Str str2 the value of where s str1
is hello and the value of where s str2
is world so what we'll do we will add
Str str1 and Str str2 so let's check the
output here save it and see here you can
see the output as hello world but there
is no space between hello and World keep
this point in mind guys so if you are
adding two strings just like this there
will be no space between the two strings
so if you want to add any space between
these two what you have to do you have
to mention it here
separately and this this is the syntax
if you want to add space between your
strings so let's save it now and see
here you can see there's a space between
hello and world so this is the use of
plus operator in strings so the next one
we have plus equals to let's take
another
string let's take it as where s str3 and
we'll give it the value as
welcome so what we'll do we'll use the
plus equal to operator here Str str3
plus equals to let's say
to Simply
code
and what we'll do we'll print the value
of Str str3
here so save it
now so here you can see the value of Str
str3 if we remove this this line let's
see what happens
now and we'll give it a space
here save it now see here you can see it
says hello world for the first St str1
plus Str str2 it says hello world for
Str str3 it says welcome to Simply code
see here the space is already given so
it will show this in the output but
between welcome and two if you want to
add space you have to do the same what
you have done for Str str1 and Str str2
so let's do it here on as well
plus sign yes save it now and see here
you can see it says welcome to Simply
code with proper space so guys with this
we are done with the video see you in
the next part where I'll take you
through the remaining operators we have
five more operators remaining and I'll
also tell you about the associativity as
well till then please go through these
three operators once again if this video
helped you anyhow give it a like comment
your doubts share it with your friends
and don't forget to subscribe simply
code thank you so here you can see I
have taken three variables I've taken
variable a and I have assigned it value
as 12 I have taken variable B and the
value assigned to B is 8 and finally I
have a variable result which stores the
value of a +
b lastly what I'm doing is I'm printing
out the result variable inside the H1
tag here you can see Ive used the H1
tags and I have used the plus operator
to concatenate the strings right I have
concatenated these two strings along
with the result along with the answer of
result so the plus operator here is
doing two different tasks right here you
can see it is performing the addition of
two numbers right and here you can see
it is used to concatenate two strings so
now let's talk about associativity
because I guess you guys are clear with
string operator till now we have
discussed them in the previous video
right so let's talk about associativity
now so certain operators have right to
left associativity and certain operators
have left to right associativity so when
I say right to left associativity in
this case the value present at the right
side of the operator see if you're using
any operator for example here we have
used the assignment operator right we
have discussed the assignment operator
earlier so here you can see the value
present at the right hand side of the
operator will be assigned to the
variable which is present at the left
hand side of the operator so it's going
this way like first the computer will
check the for the value present at the
right it's going from right towards the
left this is what we are known as right
to left associativity and assignment
operators like equals to this have right
to left
associativity let's add here one more
variable let's say we are adding a
variable variable C and we are giving it
the value as five and what we'll do
we'll update result as well let me first
show you the output of this particular
program see the output will be value of
result is 20 and high there high there
is concatenated with the string value of
result is and 20 is the actual answer
the 20 is the value of result so let's
add one more variable here let's say we
are adding a variable C and the value of
C will be five what we'll do now we will
update result as well here you can see I
have done a + b + C so save it and here
you can see the value updated to 25 the
value of result is updated right so the
plus operator has associativity from
left to right till now we have talked
about right to left as for assignment
operators but for plus operators the
associativity is from left to right it
means it will first perform A+ B and
then the value of C will be added to
that of a + b first it will perform 12 +
8 and then finally it will add five to
that value so it will be 20 + 5 and
that's why the output here is 25 we know
that JavaScript is a Loosely typed
programming language right which means
that we don't have to specify data types
every time like we are using if we are
using any data type we don't need to
specify it every time like let's do one
thing let's add a string here so what
we'll do we'll add a string let's
suppose I'm adding hello so practically
the answer would be hello
plus 25 or hello 25 it should be the
answer but let's check the output now
save
it and here you can see the output is
hello
1285 what happened here is the
associativity of the plus operator is
from left to right we know this so it
will start from the left and it will see
that okay the first thing to add is a
string so it will assume that every
everything ahead of this will be a
string that's why we have the output as
hello 12 8 and 5 so 12 8 and five all
are acting as string here let me clear
this one for you with a little bit of
modification now what we'll do we'll
remove this string from here and we'll
add it somewhere else let's say we are
adding it here
so let's add one more variable to make
it more clear let's say we are using
variable D and the value will be
10 and what we'll do we'll perform a
plus b before the string and then we'll
perform C+ d right so here you can see
when you save it it says 20 hello 510 so
when it reached out the first variable
it finds out that the first variable is
a number so it added the first two
numbers right it added 12 and 8 the
answer is 20 then it came across this
string hello and then finally it assumed
that everything ahead of this will be a
string so that's the output 20 is the
addition of a plus b and then the string
hello and finally we have the value of c
and d as string so we have the value
five and 10 not 15 right I hope you guys
get
this so let's move on to conditional
operators the conditional operators
assign a value to a variable based on a
certain condition like it contains a
condition and you know for every
condition like there exists only two
possibilities either it can be true or
it can be false there is nothing else
you can do with a conditional operator
so it works the same as if else
statements which we'll cover in further
videos the only difference between if
else and conditional operators that it
takes less time or we can say its usage
is pretty
easy so here is the Syntax for
conditional operators so it seems pretty
straightforward right so here you can
see we have a variable name we have a
condition depending upon the condition
we have two values here's the example as
well see you can see we have a variable
voter next up we have a condition if age
is less than 18 so it will check for the
condition that if the value of age is
actually less than 18 let's suppose the
value of age is 15 so it will check if
15 is less than 18 it's true then it
will print to young or if the value of H
is greater than 18 then it will print
false or you can say it will print old
enough
here so let's move on to the programming
part so here you can see I have taken a
variable X and the value assigned to X
is 30 what we'll do in variable y I have
given it a condition so it will check
for X which is 30 if 30 is greater than
or equals to 50 so if it's true if 30 is
actually greater than 50 then it will
print true else it will print false so
we'll check the output once let's save
it and see here you can see the output
as false so if you update the value of x
here let's suppose we are updating the
value of x let's suppose it's 60 save it
now and see the output has changed to
true because 60 is greater than 50 right
also if you want to write a message here
only you can do it write it here as so
with we'll copy it from here we'll copy
document.
WR and we'll paste it here let's remove
this document. right and we what we'll
do we'll use this
bracket here and if any message you want
to write like you want to write value
of
so and now what we'll do we'll save it
see it says value of true so or you can
write any other message here as well you
can write value of x is greater than or
you can write
whatever so if you want to update it
like value is and here we will update
true
with
greater and here we'll
use smaller say save it now see here it
says value is greater value of x is
greater than y so that's all for
conditional operators also one more
thing a conditional operators has three
different parts right and that's why it
is also known as tary operators three
different parts as in it has a condition
like here it is it's a it has a
condition and it has two values right it
has true or false so that's why it is
also known as Turner operator next next
up we have the logical operators so
logical operators are used to determine
the logic between two variables or
values we can say we use logical
operators to check whether multiple
conditions are true or
false here on your screen you can see
the three different types of logical
operators present in JavaScript along
with the syntax and example so the end
or not are the three operators present
in JavaScript
the end operator here you can see it it
is holding two values right it it has X
less than 10 and y greater than 1 so the
end operator will return true only if
both the conditions are true like X has
to be less than 10 and Y has to be
greater than 1 so here you can see we
have taken x = 7 and Y = 4 so both the
conditions are satisfying here so that's
why the output of the end operator will
be true for all operator the case is a
bit different so if any one of these two
conditions like we have two conditions
if any one of these two is true then the
output will be true and if both are
false then only the output will be false
the not operator on the other hand will
check if x is equals to Y if the value X
is holding is equals to that of Y if the
value is not equal then it will return
true I hope you are getting this that's
a little bit
confusing but if the value X and Y
holding if they are not equal then it
will return true if they are equal then
it will return false right we'll
understand the programming concept of
logical operators in further videos when
we learn about control statements we
primarily use logical operators with the
if statement through which we'll come
across in the following video in the
next video we will go through the
control statements so we understand the
programming part of logical operator
there only next up we have the
comparison operators so comparison
operators are similar to logical
operators in some way they are also used
to check for true and false as the name
suggests we use comparison operator to
compare two values or we can say to
compare two variables using different
operators so here you can see on your
screen these are the different types of
comparison operators present in
JavaScript we have equals to we have not
equals to we have equal value and data
type we have greater than less than and
we have a few more so I hope you guys
must remember from the previous video
that a single equals to operator is an
assignment operator so if we are using a
single equals to then it will be
considered as an assignment operator for
comparison we have to use double equal
to keep this thing in mind whenever you
are using any operator in Java script or
especially the equals to operator so if
you want to compare two values you have
to use double equals to because single
equals to is used to assign values this
is an assignment operator so let's move
on to the programming part
now so guys here you can see I have
taken a variable X and the value
assigned to X is 10 this code seems a
little bit longer to you but that's a
simple piece of code like I've used
almost every comparison operator we came
across in the previous slide I've used
each one of them and I've used the
document. write after every comparison
operator to put some spaces in between
so that you guys don't confuse between
them so let's check the output now see
you as you can see I have used the
double equals to the triple equals to I
have used X not equals to it so let's
check the output save it and see here it
says false false true true true false
true false
so for xal 2al to 8 it compared the
value 10 with 8 and 10 and 8 are not
equals to so the output will be false as
similar for 10 and we have used the
triple equals to operator which means
equal value and data type so both 10 and
8 have equal data type they both have
the same data type that is number but
the values are different so it will
print false for X not equals to to8 it
says 10 is not equals to8 yeah 10 is not
equals to it8 actually so it will print
true similarly for X not equals to
equals to it it will check that both the
values are not equal but the data types
are equal right so it will print true
for this as well for X greater than 8
yeah 10 is greater than 8 so it will
print true similarly for it will check
for X smaller than 8 and it will check
for X greater than equals to 8 and also
so for X less than equals to
it so by now you have understood how
comparison operators work so comparison
operators are the easiest to use in
programming and that's all for
comparison operators let's move on to
the next one we have the next type of
operator we have is the type of operator
you guys have an idea about the type of
operators right as we have discussed it
earlier in case you haven't watched the
previous videos let me give you a brief
introduction about this type of
operator so the type of operator is used
to provide you with the type of whatever
value you put to the right of it like if
you using any data type and you want to
know about the data type of a particular
variable let's say so you can use the
type of operator it will tell you the
actual data type of any variable so in
JavaScript as we have discussed earlier
in the video where we have particularly
discussed about the data types so there
are five different types of primitive
data types right we have the numbers we
have strings we have Boolean we have
null and undefined so let's try to use
type of
operator so here you can see I have used
four different variables which are I
have used variable X variable Y and
variable flag and variable P so the
values are different the x is holding 17
Y is holding here there and flag has the
value as false and I've have defined P
but I have not assigned it any value
till now so what I'll do I have used the
type of operator to find out the type of
every variable like here I have used it
for X for y for flag and for p let's
check the output now save it and see it
says number string boan and undefined
see here we have given X the value as 17
so 17 is a number then it says it is a
number for hiia it says it is a string
for false it says it is a Boolean value
like in Boolean value we have only two
values like false and true so for
variable P it says
undefined you know there's a difference
between undefined and null data types
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means there's absence of value that
there is no value at all so so suppose
you are using null as the value for any
variable right the type of operator will
return object but if you are not giving
any value to any variable like you are
using the variable as it is like here we
have not given it any value so if you
are doing this the type of operator will
return undefined so let's take an
example of null as well let's declare
another variable let's say where
ABC and we'll give it the value as null
so and finally what we'll do
we'll use type of
operator save it and see here it says
the type of variable ABC is an object so
remember this thing
guys and now we are done with almost
seven operators we had and we are left
with one operator only so so let's move
on to our last operator which is the
bitwise operator this operator doesn't
have that much of practical usage in the
real world they are not definitely
useless but this is something like we
are not going to use on a daily basis so
in computers if you know the numbers are
stored in binary format bitwise
operators work on 32-bit numbers and we
have decimal numbers like we understand
decimal numbers computer works on binary
numbers right so when bitwise operator
are used any operant present in the
operation is first converted to a binary
number and then converted back to a
JavaScript number so here you can see on
your screen we have four different
bitwise operators we have the end
operator we have or we have not and we
have zor or we can say exclusive or the
result and the answers are also here
it's pretty simple see we have used the
end operator before as well while we
were in logical operators but the syntax
was different and here you can see we
have a single ENT sign to use bitwise
end operator so here you can
see how the decimal number first changes
to a binary number suppose we have X as
five here you can see X is first changed
to a binary number this is the binary
equivalent of five and one is also
changed to a binary number and finally
the result whatever result we get it is
changed to a decimal number so that's
how bitwise operators work let's take an
example of bitwise
operators so here you can see I have
taken two variables I've taken variable
X and the value of variable X is five
and another variable is y and the value
of y is 1 and then I have used all the
four bitwise operators like I have used
X and Y I have used X or Y y I have used
not X and I have used the x or operator
between X and Y so let's check the
output now here you can see if we talk
about the output see here it says 1 5 -
6 and 4 so for X and Y see the value of
x is 0 1 0 1 and for end operators it
will return one if both the values are
one if any one of the two values are
zero then it will return zero so what it
will return here it will return 0 for 0
0 for 1 Z it will also return zero
similarly for 0 0 it will also return 0o
and for 1 1 it will return one which is
the binary equivalent of 1 so the answer
here is
one for x or y it will return one if any
one of the two values are one see if
both are zero it will return zero if any
one of the two values is one it will
return one it will return zero again and
finally it has two ones so it will
return
one and 0 1 01 is the binary equivalent
of five that's why the output here is
five for not operator it works a little
bit different it gives you the output
which is same as - x -1 so - x - 1 will
be see - x - 1 will be - 5 Min -1 which
is - 6 so this is a bit different here
the not operator here is a bit different
for XR operator or we can say exclusive
or it will return four why it will
return four it will return one when any
one of the two values is one if both are
one then also it will return false it
will return one only in one condition if
any one of the two values is one then
only it will return one that's why the
output here
the output here will be 0 1 0 0 that's
why it's written as 4 which is the
binary equivalent of 0 1 0 Z so guys
that's all for this video see you in the
next one where I will run you through
control statements in JavaScript I hope
this video will help you do give it a
thumbs up if you like this video so the
if else conditional statement is used
whenever we work with condition it can
be either a single condition or maybe
more than than one condition or multiple
conditions we can work with so let's try
to write a basic program with a single
condition so then we'll move on to
multiple conditions using the Els if
statement so we'll create a new file
today so I hope you guys know the
importance of creating a separate file
for every topic you know it will be easy
for you to work uh to find out that
separate file later if you want to
revise that topic so here is the program
where we have taken variable X and the
value of x is 10 so what we are doing in
this program is we are checking if the
value the variable X is holding that is
the value 10 and if the value is less
than 10 or if the value is Le greater
than 10 so we have only two conditions
either the value can be less than 10 or
the value can be greater than 10 or
equals to 10 as so here in this program
what we'll do we'll first we'll update
this value as 8 so the variable X is
holding the value 8 so to check the
output let's save it and here you can
see it says the value of x is less than
10 of course the value 8 is always less
than 10 right so for 8 that's fine it
will say the value is less than 10 and
similarly if we do the same for let's
say 11 save it now and see it says the
value of x is greater than 10 so that's
quite simple right but what if we are
giving the value as 10 we know 10 is
equal equal to 10 so save it now and see
here you can see it says the value of x
is greater than 10 this is happening
because what we did we as we told The
Interpreter to check the value if the
value of x is less than 10 we didn't
mention that if what to do if the value
is equals to 10 so it will check for
only X is less than 10 not for equals to
10 or greater than 10 so here what it is
doing it is checking if the value is
less than 10 so that it says okay let's
print this statement if the value is
less than 10 or if the value is not less
than 10 or if the value is equals to or
greater than 10 it will print the value
of x is greater than 10 to avoid this
type of misunderstanding we use an elif
statement so the concept of elif
statement is the same as if statement
what we are doing we are using multiple
conditions right we are giving it more
than one condition so how to use LS if
it's quite easy and the syntax is also
similar to the if statement the only
difference is that it contains an else
before if so it's an else if so what we
are doing is we are giving it a
condition that lse if x equals to 10 so
now what it will do it will check for
two conditions that if the value X is
holding is less than 10 or equals to 10
and and what we'll do we'll update it as
so let's check the output now save and
see here it says the value of x is
equals to time right so I hope you guys
are getting this the execution flow for
this program will be like it will check
for the first condition if x is less
than 10 if yes it will print the value
of x is less than 10 if no it will move
on the to the following condition like
under the ls if statement it finds a
condition that if x is equals to 10 10
it will check for it if yes if x is
equals to 10 then it will print the
value of x is equals to
10 or if not then otherwise it will move
to else statement and print the value of
x is greater than 10 we don't need to
specify any particular condition for
this you know because we have already
specified the two conditions that if x
is less than 10 or if x is equals to 10
now we'll take a look at some basic
programs other than this one we'll take
a look at a few more basic
programs so here's the another program
what we are doing here is we are taking
a variable X and the value of x is five
so what we are doing is we are checking
if the number is an even number or an
odd number the thing you have to keep in
mind is the logic to find whether a
number is even or an odd number so to
check uh whether the number is even you
what we do we'll divide that number with
two right what basically we want is we
want the remainder as zero when we use
the modulus operator so what we'll do
here we have written X mod 2 equals to
equals to 0 so if the remainer is zero
then the number will be an even number
because it is divisible by two else it
will be an odd number so that's quite
simple right let's save it and check the
output for five it says odd number yeah
five is of course an odd number right so
that's for even and odd number so here
we have with another program here it
says we have a variable Y and the value
of y is let's
say 8 and what we are doing here is we
are checking if a number is positive or
negative or zero so we have three
different conditions either number can
be positive or it can be a negative
number Any number greater than zero is a
positive number right and any number
less than zero is a negative number and
the third one is a number zero Z it's
neither positive nor negative so let's
check for the number eight save it and
see here you can see it is a positive
number let's see
for minus 2 save it now it says a
negative number for 0 it will say zero
so these two programs are quite simple
guys right the conditions are pretty
simple we use modulus operator we used
greater than or less than sign and
that's quite easy to use right so let's
move on to the next program which is a
bit tricky than these two so what we'll
do in our next program is we'll check if
a number is positive or negative and at
the same time we'll check for even and
odd also if we are giving any number as
input like let's suppose we are using
five we'll check if the number is
positive or negative and odd or even so
we'll do this simultaneously let's move
on to this program so there are two ways
to check whether the number is positive
or negative and odd or even so the two
methods we'll discuss them one by one
the first one here is to use nested if
and the another one is when we use
logical operators along with the if else
if statement so this one here you can
see right in front of your screen is the
nested if method so here you can see we
have used the if statement we have given
one more condition inside another if
statement so first it will check whether
a number is positive or not for X
greater than Z it will check if the
number X is greater than zero then if
yes if it will find it that yes this
number is greater than zero then it will
move on to the nested if and it will
check for odd or even for odd number and
even number it will check if it finds
that the number is even it will print
that the number is positive and even if
the number is not even it will print
print the number is positive and odd so
here you can see the difference what The
Interpreter is doing is it will check
for the number as positive and if the
number is positive then it will move on
to the nested if and check for the even
or odd so if it finds that the number is
even it will print positive and even
otherwise it will print positive and odd
then it will move on to the next
condition which is for negative number
if x is less than zero then it will
again move to the nested if and it will
check for even and odd so if it finds
that the number is even it will print
negative and even otherwise it will
print negative and OD and the last
condition is for the number zero let's
try to find out the output of this and
what we'll do we'll update the value of
x as 8 so save it now here it says the
positive and even so eight is a positive
number and even as well
let's update the value of x as minus 5
save it now it says negative and odd
number minus 5 is a negative odd number
right so that's how it will check for
positive or negative and odd or even so
we are doing both the things
simultaneously in a program we have an
alternate method as well here you can
see on your screen we have written a
program and here we have taken a
variable X the functioning of both the
programs is same both of these program
will check for positive or negative and
odd or even so here you can see I have
taken a variable X let's say the value
of x is 7 it will check for X greater
than Z and X mod 2 is equals to equals
to 0 so we have four different
conditions right a number is greater
than zero that means a number is
positive and even a number is positive
positive and odd a number is negative
and even a number is negative and odd
and the final one is a number is zero
okay we have five conditions and we have
to specify these four conditions here so
here you can see we are using the
logical and operator this means it will
print this statement let's suppose for
this statement it will print this only
if both the conditions are true right if
the number if the value X is holding is
both greater than zero and an even
number so if you try to find out the
output now save it and see here it says
number is positive and odd so the number
seven is greater than zero but the
number seven is not an even number
that's why this line is not there on the
browser it will print this line because
the number is positive and odd right
with this we are done with the video
guys see you in the next one where we'll
go through the switch case conditional
statement that's another type of
conditional statements present in
JavaScript so if you like this video do
give it a thumbs up comment your doubts
below please share it with your friends
and subscribe to Simply code to never
miss an update thank you so iterative
statements or looping statements we can
say are used when we want to perform an
activity multiple times or n number of
times so we don't have to copy paste
that code every time but we can use
iterative statements using iterative
statements will make our code clean and
definitely more efficient so we have
four different types of uh iterative
control statements right we discussed it
in the previous video let's move on to
for Loop which is a first iterative
control statement and we'll move on to
the programming part directly so before
we start one thing to keep in mind guys
is that we use for Loop when we are
clear with the number of iterations in
advance so let's start with our first
program in this program we will print
the multiplication table of 10 from 10
into 1 to 10 into 10 let's start with
coding first we write the for keyword
and then we have three different parts
we have the
initialization which is separated by a
semicolon next up we have the
condition and finally we have the
increment or
decrement so this is the Cent text for
for Loop next up we have the open and
the closed curly braces for the body of
for Loop we'll change these three values
as these are not the actual values right
parameters for these three different
parts of the loop are going to be
different so let me commment this one so
we'll what we'll do we'll leave it here
only we'll change it from here so in the
initialization part what we are going to
do is we'll create a variable let's say
we are creating a variable where a and
the value of and the initial value of a
will be
1 this initialization happens only one
time when the for Loop begins we have to
be careful about the condition we are
going to use because sometimes what
happens is the loop runs forever because
of a wrong condition which will
ultimately crash our program so in the
condition what we have to do is we have
to give a value as in for how long a
fall Loop should execute
here in this case we want to print the
table of 10 right we want to have 10
iterations so what it will do it will
start from A = to 1 and it will go till
this final condition so let's suppose we
are writing here a less than equal to 10
it will start from a equal to 1 and it
will go till a less than or equals to 10
and next up we'll use the increment
operator we want to increment the value
of a by 1 every time right so we'll use
increment operator a ++ or we can say a
= to a + 1 both are the same things
right so here the condition will be like
this for variable a = to 1 a less than
equal to 10 and a ++ so here you can see
the loop will execute from A = to 1 till
a = to 10 and the value will will be
increased by 1 every time because we
have used the increment operator right
next up the body of for Loop will go
like so what we want to print here we
want want to print the table of 10 right
so we'll use
document do write and inside document.
right we'll use the H1
tag so what we want to do is we want to
print the table of 10 right so we'll
multiply 10 by a for every iteration the
value of a will be multiplied by 10 and
then it will be printed on the browser
so we'll close the H1 tag
here in the
semicolon so here you can see we have
printed 10 into a let's save it and
check the output first and then we'll
look at the execution flow of this
program see here the multiplication
table of 10 is printed on the browser
you can see 10 20 30 40 so on and so
forth till 100 so what is happening is
firstly the for Loop is also known as
the entry control Loop it means that the
condition is checked initially the first
time the for Loop runs we perform
initialization only once so here the
value stored at variable a is 1
initially the value is one next St it
will check for a less than equals to 10
is a which is 1 is 1 less than equals to
10 then true the control will be shifted
to document do right and it will print
10 into the value of a is 1 right so it
will print 10 here
next thing it will go for the increment
and the value of a will be changed to
two from one 1 + 1 or we can say 1 = to
1 + 1 right so it will be two now next
thing it will leave this now because the
initialization happens only once now it
will go for the condition directly now
it will check for is 2 less than or
equals to 10 if yes then again the
control will be shifted here and it will
print 10 into 2 because the value of a
is 2 now and after that it it will print
20 here and after that the value of a
will be increase to three because we
have used A++ then it will check for
three is three less than 10 and same
thing will happen it will print 30 and
so on and so forth till the value of a
is 10 now if the value of a is 10 it
will print 100 right and when the value
is incremented it will become 11 so what
will happen now it will check for 11
less than equals to 10 no we know that
11 is not less than equal to 10 right
then it comes out of the loop and it
will print nothing after that so this is
the basic working of the for Loop we'll
go through one more program wherein
we'll print the odd numbers between 1
and 10 so what are odd numbers odd
numbers are those numbers which are not
divisible by two right so we have the
odd numbers as 1 3 5 7 9 and we want to
print them so the difference between
each number number is of 2 the 1 + 2 + 2
+ 2 till 9 right so what we have to do
is we have to write here A + = to 2 we
have to increase the value of a by 2 and
instead of writing here 10 into a
because this time we don't want to print
any multiplication table we want to
print a number only right so we'll use a
only save it and check the output it
says 1357 9 so these are the odd numbers
present between 1 and 10 keep one thing
in mind that you have to give the
condition wisely every time so next up
we have the V Loop while loop is also an
entry control Loop and then we have the
dowi loop do while loop is an exit
control Loop we'll discuss these two in
the upcoming videos with this we are
done with the video guys see you in the
next one where we'll go through the V
Loop in JavaScript if you like this
video do give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to simp code to never miss out
on programming videos so let's start
with the program in this particular
program we will print odd numbers up to
a specific number let's say we want to
print all the odd numbers up to
50 so we want to print all the odd
numbers from 1 till 50 right we came
across the same program in the previous
video as well but this time we will use
the while loop instead of for Loop so
the Syntax for the while loop is
relatively easy to use the code goes
like we start with the while keyword
then opening and closing round round
brackets and finally the body of while
loop in curly
braces if you guys remember from the
previous video wherein we used the for
Loop we had three different parts right
we had the initialization we had
conditions and the increment decrement
part here we have only one condition and
until this condition holds true the
while loop will be executed for example
here we want to print all the odd
numbers from 1 to 50 right so we'll
first initialize a variable let's
initialize a variable first let's say we
have a variable X and the value of x
will be
one we used your one because one is the
very first odd number right after that
inside the condition what we want to do
is we want to print the odd numbers up
to 50 so while the condition will be
like while X less than equals to 50 so
the loop will go till X is less than or
equals to 50 or we can say x less than
50 that depends on us if we want to
check for 50 or not so the odd numbers
will go like 1 and then we have three
then we have five then we have 7 and up
to 50 so the last odd number will be 49
so inside the while loop we will print
the value of x so here we will print the
value of x let's print it
document.
WR and inside this we will print the
value of x inside the H1
tag suppose we try to run this program
now it will go on an infinite Loop and
the reason for this is we are not doing
anything to increment the value of x
just like in for Loop if you remember we
had the initialization first we had the
initialization here as well then we had
the condition we have a condition here
as well and then finally it has an
increment or decrement part right so
here we don't have that same increment
or decrement part we have to do it
separately so we will increment the
value of x here only so here we will
write x + = to 2 or we can say it is
same as x = x + 2 you guys are aware of
it right so the reason is simple because
we want to go from 1 to 3 to 5 and so on
that's why we use x + equal to 2 we
incremented the value of x by
2 save it here and let's check the
output so here you can see it says 135 7
9 and so on and so forth till 49 so 49
is the last odd number before 50 because
we are checking between 1 and 50 right
so 49 is the last odd number let me show
you how the program goes into an
infinite Loop so for that what we have
to do we will command this whole line
here let's check the output now save it
and here you can see it is refreshing
forever and this is basically how a
program in an infinite Loop looks like
the output of this program is the
program will ultimately crash so what we
have to do we have to open a new tab and
then again we have to run the program
with correct increment part so here you
can see you can wait for it to become
responsive or exit the page so here you
can see we have all the odd numbers from
1 up to 50 and the last one is 49 coming
back to the difference between the while
loop and the for Loop we did the same
program previously right using the for
Loop so where to use while loop over for
Loop so consider a scenario where we are
taking input from the user and the input
from the user is why we want to do
something let's say we want to print
something on the screen or if if the
input from the user is n we want the
process to be stopped we can give the
condition in the while loop which will
go like when the character y becomes n
the process will be stopped we'll go
through one such program once we are
done with the Dom manipulation part
wherein we take the input from the user
so that's all for this video guys see
you in the next one where we'll go
through the do while loop in JavaScript
if you like this video do give it a
thumbs up comment your doubts below
share it with your friends and don't
forget to subscribe simply code thank
you so today we have three different
problems for three separate Loops right
we'll go through each of the problems
and we'll discuss the execution flow for
each Loop we'll go through so let's
start this session with our first
problem statement so the first problem
statement goes like this so here we have
to write a program to check whether a
number is prime or not I hope you guys
are aware of what prime numbers are
right so a prime number is a positive
number
that is only divisible by 1 and itself
for example 2 3 5 and we have 7 and 11
these are the first few prime numbers
right if we take an example let's say we
are taking an example of seven so seven
is a number which is divisible by 1 and
seven only no other number can divide
seven right so here in this code we have
to check whether a number is prime or
not so let me take you through the code
so here is the code to check whether a
number is a prime number or not let me
take you through this first so we have a
variable number and the value of
variable number can be any random value
like any number you want to check if the
number is prime number or not you can
give that value to the variable number
so here we have taken 83 next up we have
a variable is prime whose value is a
Boolean value right it can be true for a
prime number or it can be false for a
non-prime number so we have used
comments in this program to make it
easier for for you guys to understand so
here we have used the if statement to
check if the number is one because we
know that one is neither a prime number
nor a composite number right so we have
to check if the user enters the value
one or if we are giving the value one we
have to check for it so if user enters
the value one it will print this
statement that one is neither prime nor
composite here in lsf we are checking if
the value of number is greater than one
or not so if the of number is greater
than one the control will be shifted to
for Loop present inside the elif
statement right here you can see we have
the for Loop here the control will be
shifted to this for Loop so here you can
see we have initialized a variable I and
the initial value is set to two that's
because any prime number is divisible by
one as well right so it won't make any
sense to include one here we'll start
from two and we'll check until the value
of I becomes half of the value of number
so if we take an example of 10 we'll
check until five because you know any
number greater than five won't divide 10
right it's practically not possible so
we'll check for number by two or we can
say we'll check till five only and the
value will be increased by one every
time till now I hope you guys are aware
of how to use for Loop and why we are
using for Loop here we can do the same
program using while loop as well but to
make it more clear how to use for Loop
we are doing this program with the help
of for Loop
so then we have the I ++ or we can say
we have increased the value of I by one
after every iteration until the value of
I
becomes half of the number so the
condition number percent I equals to
equals to0 so here is the main condition
to check if the number is divisible by I
or not so the execution will be like if
we are taking here a number 10 it will
start from Two and it will check if if
the remainder is zero or not so if the
remainder is zero then the value of is
prime will be changed to false and it
will come out of the loop next it will
check for the value of is prime if the
value of is prime is true or not here
you can see if the value of is prime is
true then it will print n or we can say
then it will print that the number is a
prime number else it will print that uh
the number is not a prime number if the
value of S Prime is false for example
when we took the example of number as 10
so the value of S Prime will be changed
to false because you know 10 divides by
2 is equals to 0 uh or we can say the
remainder will be zero so the value of S
Prime will be changed to false and for
false it will print number is not a
prime number so at last we will check if
the number is less than one if the
number entered by the user or any other
number we we have taken like if we take
here minus5 so it will print the number
is not a prime number because by the
usual definition of prime numbers any
negative number cannot be a prime number
that's a usual definition right so we
have to keep this thing in mind and here
in this else Loop we'll print that if
any negative number is entered we'll
make sure that the program gives the
output that the number is not a prime
number so let's try to run this program
and check the output let's save this
program and the output says 83 is a
prime number as 83 is not divisible by
any number except 1 and 83 for example
if we take here any number which is
divisible by so let's say we are taking
75 save it now and see it says 75 is not
a prime number okay here's a spelling
mistake it says 75 is a not prime number
so here we'll correct
this
is so we are done with it and save it
now now it says 75 is not a prime number
as 75 is divisible by numbers other than
one and itself right it is divisible by
three it is divisible by 5 15 and 25 as
well all these numbers divide 75
basically so let's take a different
value here let's say we are taking - 7
let's change the value here as or we can
take it as minus 75 let's save it now so
it says the number is not a prime number
or if we want to try for one as well
let's take it as
one and let's check the output now so it
says one is neither prime nor composite
number because we have given here the
condition if number is equals to is
equals to 1 then it will print that one
is neither a prime nor a composite
number
you can try this program with the help
of other Loops as well so let's move on
to the second problem statement but
before that let me take you through the
same program using the V Loop so here
you can see we have used the V Loop for
the same instead of for Loop here you
can see we have used while I less than
number by two and we have given the
increment condition here and we have
initialized the value of I at the start
of the program so if we try to run this
program it will give us the same output
there will be no change in the output so
we can use while loop as well so we'll
use the while loop in other program
let's move on to the second problem
statement so in this example we'll learn
to write a program in JavaScript to
check whether a number is an Armstrong
number or not so we'll do this with the
help of while loop let's have a look at
how to implement this program before
proceeding to the coding part let's have
a look at what is an AR Armstrong number
so an Armstrong number of three digits
is an integer such that the sum of the
cubes of its digits is equal to the
number itself so for example 153 is an
Armstrong number since 1 into 1 into 1
it means the cube of the digit 1 plus
the cube of five that is 5 into 5 into 5
which is equal to5 and the cube of three
which is 3 3 are 9 and 9 3 is are 27
so it will go like
125 + 27 + 1 so which is equal to 153 so
an Armstrong number of three digits is
an integer such that the sum of the
cubes of its digits is equal to the
number itself so here we have the code
for the same this is the code to check
whether the number is an Armstrong
number or not so here we have taken a
variable and the value is 153 the value
of the variable number is 15 53 right
because we already know that 153 is an
Armstrong number there are few more
numbers like 371 is also an Armstrong
number next up we have taken a variable
sum and the initial value of sum is zero
we have used the variable sum to store
the value of the cubes and next up we
have a temporary variable so that we can
break a three-digit number and we need
the number after all this all this
program all these loops and all we'll
need the number we'll need the original
number to compare it with the sum of the
cubes which will be hold in sum so but
we need to break the number as well
right so we need a temporary variable to
break it here we use the Y Loop and the
loop will run until the value of
variable temp is greater than zero so
the initial value of temp will be 153
here in this particular case the initial
value will be 153 and the loop Loop will
run until the value of 153 is greater
than zero next up we have a variable
remainer that stores the last digits
value as we are dividing 153 by 10
so the remainer here will be three so
the value saved at variable remainder
will be three for the first time then
what will happen with we are updating
the value of sum and the new value of
sum will be 0 + 3 into 3 into 3 so 3 3's
are 9 and 9 3 is are 27 so the updated
value of sum will be 27 next up we are
removing the last digit from the number
so for example we have here 153 and if
we divide 153 by 10 the answer will be
15.3 that's why we are using here parent
because what parent will do it will
convert the float value into an integer
so if we try to perform a simple divide
in JavaScript like if we try to divide
153 by 10 it will give us 15.3 it will
give us a float value but we want an
integer value right so parcent will
change this value to the nearest integer
so 15.3 the nearest integer will be 15
so the new value of temp will be5 then
again this Loop will be executed and for
this time the variable remainer will
hold the value of
15 modulus 10 and the remainder will be
five right so the new value of remainder
is five and the value of sum is 27 + 5
into 5 into 5 which is 27 + 125 right so
the new value of sum will be
152 and then again it will go to the
temp and it will divide 15 by 10 and it
will change the value to an integer so
1.5 will be changed to 1 and next next
up the final value of temp is 1 which is
greater than zero right so it will
divide 10 by 1 and the remainder will be
1 so next up it will add 152 + 1 into 1
into 1 that is 153 right and then it
will divide 1 by 10 using the parcent
but this time the value will be zero
because there's no remainder right next
up we'll compare the value of the sum
and the number variable so the sum
variable here it is holding the value as
153 we break this number into three
different part then we took the cube of
these three number and added them so the
final value of the variable sum is 153
and the initial value of number or we
can say the value we gave to the
variable number is 153 so right it will
print here that 153 is an Armstrong
number or if we use any other number
instead of 153 let's suppose we are
using 121 so it will print 121 is is not
an Armstrong number let's check out the
output once let's save it and see the
output here is 153 is an Armstrong
number so if we change the value of3 to
1 12 1 so let's check the output now it
says 1 121 is not an Armstrong number
why because if we take the cube of each
of the digit and we'll add them suppose
the answer here will be 10 because the
cube of one is 1 and the cube of 2 is 8
and the cube of the final one is 1 so 8
+ 1 + 1 is equal to 10 so that's why one
121 is not an Armstrong number let's
move on to our last problem statement
where we'll use the dowi loop to find
the factorial of a number so here's the
problem statement where we'll have to
write a program to find the factorial of
a number so factorial of an integer is
the product of an integer and all the
integers below it or we can say before
it till one so if we take an example of
five so the factorial of five will be it
will multiply each number before it if
we take five the factorial will be five
into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 or if we
don't include one that's totally fine so
this program is pretty simple as
compared to the previous two we did so
this is a small one to let me take you
through this so here we have the
program and here we have three variables
right we have a variable I which is
initialized as one then we have a
variable n which is five and then we
have a variable F whose value is one F
is for factorial and n is for number we
want to check the factorial of and I is
for checking the condition so here what
we will do we'll use a loop where if we
for example if we are taking five then
the loop will go from 1 into 2 into 3
into 4 into 5 from one to that number
it's not like if we are using from 5
towards 1 but we are going from 1
towards five the answer will be same
right because we are multiplying all the
numbers in both the cases so here we
took five as the number next up we have
a variable F and the value of f is also
one as you know so here we using the doy
Loop for the first iteration it will
perform this so the value of f for the
first iteration will be F = to F into I
which means f = 1 into 1 which is 1 so
the value of I will be increased and it
will become two and now it will check
for while 2 is less than equals to n yes
2 is less than n so it will again go up
and it will update the value of F and
the new value of of f will be 1 into 2
that is 2 then again the value will be
increased and it will become three and
then it will change the value of f as
well if it will become six and the value
of I will become four then it will check
if four is less than five yes four is
less than five and then it will multiply
four with six because the value of f was
six right so 4 into 6 it will become 24
and then finally the value of I will be
5 and it will check if the value of I is
less than or equals to five right while
I is less than equals to 5 yes that's
true because now 5 is equals to 5 and it
will again execute the loop and the
value of f will be 24 into 5 which is
120 and then again the value of I will
be increased now it will become 6 which
is greater than 5 so it will come out of
the loop and it will print the factorial
of the number so let's save this program
so the the factorial of 5 is 120 because
see here we have used the factorial of n
n is 5 and the factorial is 120 so if we
try to give any other number here other
than five let's say we are using here 10
save it it says the factorial is
36280 or it's 36
28,800 so if you try to multiply 10 into
9 into 8 into 7 so on till 2 or we can
say one the answer will be this you can
check it you can Google it or you can go
through it in your calculator so hope
you guys got it with this we are done
with loops in JavaScript we are left
with the foreign Loop which we will
discuss after going through arrays and
objects so don't worry about it that's
all for this video guys see you in the
next one where we'll go through
functions in JavaScript here you can see
we have an HTML web page with a
navigation bar to take the user to
different sections of a website I hope
you already know that we have to create
several web pages for a single website
to make it a fully functional website we
have to create these Pages separately in
different HTML documents and then we
have to provide the links to this
particular homepage for directing the
user to various locations of our website
if you see here in the navigation
bar we have several options starting
with our company's logo so Comfort
learning is the company's logo here we
have an icon of the book to let the user
know that this website is for learning
so we'll see further in this video how
we can use these logos and all then we
have links for several other web pages
of a website that are not working
because we haven't added these web pages
till now the reason for this is we don't
want to make this project a long one we
want to finish it quickly and we want to
give give you guys a basic idea of how
to use JavaScript and other Technologies
to create a fully functional website
next up we have a card button over here
on clicking it opens the cart with items
present inside it and the user can
either clear the whole cart or proceed
further to buy all the things they need
right following this cart button we have
a background image over here with a card
present over the image the the card says
find your favorite course here now you
guys might have guessed that this
website is for buying courses and the
user can buy some courses here which
they want to
study this shop now button is completely
working and if we click on it it will
take us to the courses catalog where we
have several courses present to choose
from we have eight different courses
present here you can add as many courses
as you want or as many products as you
want so we can add any of them to the
cart on taking the mouse cursor over any
image you can see it gives us an option
to add that particular product to the
cart right if we click on this add to
cart button you can see it says in cart
it means that we can't add any specific
course to the cart more than
once we can later change the number of
items in the card but we can add a
course only once from here let's add
some courses to the card and then we'll
see if it's working or not so we'll add
few courses We'll add this one so it
says this course is already present in
cart similarly this course is also
present and we can add this course now
we'll move to the cart we will click on
this cart button and you can see we have
all the courses present over
here now if you notice here we have
these small arrows present right we can
click on on these arrows to change the
number of items we can either increase
the number of items or we can decrease
the number of items as well then we have
a remove button over here and if we
click on this remove button you can see
the course is removed now we can remove
any number of courses we want and we can
also increase the number of products in
our card following it we have two
options over here either we can clear
the whole cart or we can proceed if we
click on this clear cart button there
will be no code present in the card and
the total price will change to zero in
that case fine so I hope you guys must
have known the task by now it's clear
and seems effortless right but these
small things take a lot of precise
coding and attention to work smoothly so
let me show you guys one more thing
before we move on to the coding part if
we reduce the size of a web page or we
can say if we remove the size of a
browser you can see the size of website
also changes if we make the browser
similar to a phone you can see we have
got a menu type of thing over here and
if we click on this we are getting the
options here we have home categories
pricing and about us right so these were
the options present in the navigation
bar we can get them inside a particular
menu using CSS we'll see how it actually
works so a website is responsive right
we'll do it with the help of CSS so
let's let's move on to the programming
part
now so here we are in the vs code we
have all the images already present
inside the images folder in our system
so if you want to see you can see here
we have all the images present over here
and we have four different files we have
app.js we have index.html products. Json
to add products and we have style. CSS
to style all the elements fine here we
are in the HTML file some of you guys
may think that HTML CSS and JavaScript
were fine but what's up with the Json
thing we haven't heard of it in the
previous videos so let me tell you guys
Json stands for JavaScript object
notation just like we create objects in
JavaScript Json is also used to create
objects like name value Pairs and later
we can use these objects to retrive that
data in a HTML file in simple words to
add an item to a cart we need to store
it somewhere to get that data related to
the object and then we can add those
items to our card so Json is used to
transmit the data between a server and a
web application we need to store our
product somewhere so that we can use
them when added to card so you'll get to
know more about it while working on it
basically so for now if you know enough
about JavaScript objects then Json will
be easy for you guys because the syntax
remains almost similar in both the cases
that is in JavaScript and in
Json so let's start writing the code now
here we are in our HTML file and we have
already linked all the files over here
you can see here we have used font
awesome library for icons we'll use on
our website you have seen that book icon
we have used in our logo part and
several other icons like the cart icon
Etc so we'll include those predefined
icons in a HTML file using this
particular library to include this
specific Library you don't have to do
much of a task go to Google Search
cdnjs
Doom
libraries SL font
awesome go to Google and search for this
and then select version
4.7.0 under the version option copy the
third URL with min. CSS as extension and
paste it into your HTML file as simple
as that I'll let you know about the
classes we'll use while working on the
the website now let's start with the
programming part the first thing we have
on our website is the navigation bar
right let me show it to you again so
here you can see we have a navigation
bar we'll first work on this one only so
let's start writing the code so this is
the output of our current website so
what we'll do is we'll minimize the
browser and we'll start writing the code
here
only so what we'll do is we'll write
here nav
class is equals to
Navar then inside this we'll write
div class is equals
to
Burger and inside this we'll write three
div Texs fine we'll write here div class
is equals to layer
1 we'll close this div we'll copy it
from here and and we'll paste it again
three times
fine we'll write here Layer Two and
Layer Three is class then after this
particular div tag we'll add another div
tag with class as
logo then inside this we'll use the span
tag we'll write here span
class is equals to
logo logo text and then
we'll write
here I we'll use the itag to make it a
little bit italic so we'll use the class
as
far fa book fine we'll write Here
style is equals to
margin margin right we'll write here
margin right is
0.1 M then we'll write
here similarly we can close this fine
now we have added the book icon to our
website then what we'll do is we'll
write here again span we'll use the span
tag within this span tag we'll write
Here style is equals
to color and and the color code is
HH F0 95 D1 so these are the color codes
for this particular website we'll use
them we have written here f09
d51
fine then what we'll do is we'll write
here font size as 1.1m and what we'll do
next is we'll write here
before the pan tag closes we'll write
here learning fine okay so what we did
wrong here is we forgot to mention
Comfort
here now we are done with the logo part
next up what we'll do is we'll write
here
div class is equals
to menu bar we are working on the menu
bar for the hamburger menu so what we'll
do is we'll write
here UL so UL stand for unordered list
we'll write here class
as
list and inside this we'll use liit tag
so we'll write here class as let's say
list
items
we'll write here a HF is equals to
hash and here what we'll do is we'll
write here home fine we'll copy this
piece of
code we'll paste it
again three or four times we have four
different options we have home we have
courses and then we have
pricings and finally we have about us
fine so we are done with menu as well
next up what we'll do is we'll write the
code for card now so we'll write here
if class is equals to
cart and inside this we'll write
I class is equals
to for for shopping cart for 1X so here
we have used this special class to
include the card icon to a web page now
next up what we'll do is we'll write
here
div class is
equals to number of
items and then we'll write here
span class is equals to let's say no now
what we'll do is we'll write here zero
inside this fine I hope you guys
understood what we did till now we are
working on the navigation bar only we
have created the navigation bar so this
is the code firstly we have used a class
nav bar for this particular navigation
bar then we have used the div tag for
Burger menu we have three different
layers layer 1 Layer Two and layer three
so this is actually the icon of burger
menu you can see here if we reduce the
size of our website so we have defined
this burger menu and inside this we have
four other options which we defined
later here inside the menu bar and we
have four options right we have home
courses pricings and about us so we are
doing totally right so till now we did
some basic tasks here right we have
added all the navigation bar elements
and the next thing we have to do is to
style our navigation bar according to
the final website it's pretty simple
let's do one thing let's save it once
and check the output now let's see if
it's working so it's totally working we
have a book icon over here we have
comfort learning written over here we
have cart icon over here and we have
zero return over here fine now we have
to style those elements accordingly to
make it look like this so we are making
this navigation bar so what we'll do is
we'll move to our CSS file and we'll
start styling by doing some default
style changes to the entire HTML
document we'll write
here
star margin will be zero the default
margin will be zero padding will be
zero then we
have
box sizing we'll write here border box
and font size will
be 20 pixels for default
fine next up we'll write
here HTML we'll now style the HTML
document we'll write here scroll
behavior is
smooth and
we'll write here anchor tag we'll write
here
text decoration and we'll write here
text decoration as
none and then we'll style the unordered
list we'll write here UL we'll write
here list style
as none fine basic styling is done let's
do some more for the navigation bar as
well what we'll do is we'll write
here do Navar this is the first class
class we have used in a HTML page we'll
write here display
as
Flex then we'll write
here justify content
as space
between align items
is
Center height is 10 VH so 10 VH refers
to the viewport height it will take 10%
of the total height of the screen
then we
have background color as hash EC EC EC
so a little bit of gray grayish white we
can say then next thing we'll do is
we'll style a logo we'll write here logo
and inside this we'll
write pedding sorry we'll write here
pedding left and the pading left will be
2m next up we'll write here
logo text so this is the next class
we'll write
here font size is
1.5 M now the next class we have to use
is the menu bar class so we'll write
here width is
45% and
margin left
is
8.5 M fine I'll let you know what this m
means in a moment so first we'll do this
styling and all next up we'll write here
do list we'll access the list and we'll
write here inside this display as
flex and justify content as space
between
fine next up we have the list items so
we'll write here list
items and we'll of course write here a
as well we'll write here color and the
color will be let's say
black next up what we'll do is we'll
write here font family is s siif font
size
is
0.9m so you must have noticed earlier
that the default font size was 20 pixels
so keep that in mind I'll let you know
the use of M in a moment next up we'll
write
here transition is 0.4
seconds and we are good to go with it
next up we'll write here list
items and we'll write here hover fine
then we'll write here
color is
black on hovering the color of the list
items will change to
Black now the next thing we'll do is
we'll write here
cart padding right will be 2m and
Position will be relative
fine we are done with the card next up
we'll write here
cart
[Music]
number of items
fine we'll write here display
is flex cursor
is pointer we are using repeat we are
styling two different classes here we
are styling the element with classes cut
and the element with classes number of
items fine we'll write here just
ify
contents to
Center align items to
Center we'll write here color is white
Position will be
absolute and then we'll write here
left is 18
pixels and
right as okay sorry we'll write here
left as 18 pixels and top
as - 7
pixels next up we'll
write
background so the background color will
be Ash
F
09
d51 so this will be a the background
color we'll Define the height and width
as well so height will be 20 pixels and
the width will also be 20 pixels
fine the last thing we have to write
here is the Border
radius so keep one thing in mind guys
while you are styling all these elements
do check the website after every styling
event because this will let you know
what this particular event does or what
this particular styling property does to
that particular element so do it when
you are writing this code next up we'll
write
here DOT number of items space do noi so
noi was the class we have already
declared we'll write here font size is
0.7m the next class will be sty in is
the shopping cart so we'll style this
icon as well we'll write
here font size is
1.5 M the font size will be equal to
around 30
pixels then we'll write here cursor is
pointer then we'll write
here Burger we'll style the menu as well
we'll write here
height height will be 28
pixels
width will be 32
pixels and then we'll write
here display is none then
we'll style the layers as well we'll
write here do layer 1 do layer
2 and do
layer three now inside this we'll write
background is
black height is 4
pixel margin top
is 4
pixel width
as 100% And we'll write here border
radius as 10
pixels fine you have seen that hamburger
menu you have seen that icon we were
styling that till now now you might have
noticed here that we have used M here in
this CSS file so I'm talking about this
particular M or we can say em as
well until now we were using Ram or
pixel to define the size of anything
while studying but today we are using M
because M uses the font size for example
if the font size is 30 for the parent
class in this case the font size is 20
the default font size is 20 and the
padding is defined as 2m then the
padding will be 40 in that case it uses
the font size to determine the size of
the property that's why we are using M
and if you try it yourself you'll get to
know better so just try using M and you
can also use Ram or pixel in this case
but for now we'll use M so this might be
a little bit new for you guys but try it
and you'll understand it much better now
save the CSS
file move back to the browser and you
can see here that we have a navigation
bar ready right it's looking fine
although the icons are not visible the
book icon and the cart icon is not
visible so let's go back and see what's
wrong in this CSS file what we'll do is
we'll move to HTML file and we'll see if
something is wrong here or not so
nothing is wrong in this case the error
is because we are not connected to
Internet so if this error continues just
try to connect your laptop or your PC to
the internet and the icons thing will
work fine so you can see here we have
our icons over here we have the book
icon we have the cart icon and what we
have to do is we have to increase the
size of this logo and text a little
little bit right so here you can see the
Comfort learning is a little bit small
when compared to this particular website
so what we'll do is we'll move to a CSS
file and we'll write here instead of 1.5
RM we'll write here 2m fine save it and
here you can see it's looking fine now
actually it's equal the difference is
because of this scroll bar we don't have
this scroll bar in our website until now
so this is why it looks like a little
bit different to you guys it's working
totally fine other than
that so let's move on to the next part
and the next part of our website is the
background image with the card present
on it right so let's write the code for
this section as well what we'll do is
we'll move to our HTML
file and right here we'll
write
section class is equals to section
1 so we are using the section tag to
define a particular section in the web
page now we'll write here
div class is equals to
Banner and here we'll write inside H1
tag find your
favorite
courses or course
here then inside this what we'll do is
we'll write here
a href is
equals to products so the products file
will be using Json for this so leave it
for now we'll write here shop now so
shop now is actually not a button what
we'll do is we'll use a link and we'll
Define it later so
let's save
it and move to the
browser open this website and you can
see here it says find your favorite
course here and it says shop now it's
not inside the banner because we need to
style this particular section to make it
look like a website so let's do the
styling part as
well and then we'll talk about it so so
we'll move to the CSS file
now and here what we'll
do we'll write here
dot Section
1
height we'll use the Cal function and
we'll write here
100 VH
minus 10 VH so what we are doing is is
we are reducing the navigation bars
height we are reducing 10 viewport
height from 100 viewport height it means
that from the whole screen area it will
reduce 10 VH and give it to that
particular image fine so next up we'll
write here width as 100% we wanted to
cover the whole homepage so that's why
we are using width as
100% background so we'll add the
background image we'll write here URL
and inside this we'll give the path of a
image we'll write here
images back
1.png and we'll write here
Center Center cover
fine let's do some more things we'll
write here top as
zero left is
0 Z
index is minus one
fine save it now move to the browser and
see if it's working so here we are we
have a image over here but this Banner
is not here till now we'll style it so
you can see the imag is over here and
one more thing guys we have two three
images over here inside a images folder
I'll let you see all of them so here are
the images and this is the third
one okay so this is the third one so I
was not sure which one to use but if you
guys liked any of these images do let us
know in the comments below and we'll use
that particular image for now we'll use
my personal favorite image we'll use
back.png save it now and this is the
image we are going to use in this
particular video so let me know if you
have any other preference or if you know
any other image we'll use that as well
then we'll write here
section
one and we'll style the banner as well
for that we'll write here
Banner
height is going to be 170
pixels
withd
is going to be 600
pixels
background is going to be a little bit
grayish so we'll write here
rgba 25 comma
25 comma 25 comma
0.7 so this is the particular rgba value
and next up we'll write here position as
relative top as
50% left as 50% of the image we want the
banner to be present at the center of
the image right so next up we'll write
here
transform
translate and inside it we'll write Min
-
50%
to minus
50% next up we'll WR here display
is
flex justify content is space
around
and flex direction is
column text
align
is
Center and then we have align items
is
Center font family is going to be sensor
if again and we'll Define the Z index as
well so the Z index is going to be 8 in
this case fine next up we'll inside the
h H1 tag inside the banner so we'll
write here
Banner H1 and inside this we'll Define
the font size
as
2m
now we need to define the link for shop
now so for that we'll write here display
is
flex
justify content
is
Center padding is going to
be 1
m space
2.
5m next up we'll write
here font size is
0.8m so this is the font size for the
shop Now button which looks like a
button but it is actually a link so what
we'll do is we'll Define the color of
this button is
white and here the background color is
going to
be
HH F9 0
d51 let's use this color
and we'll write here transition all at
0.3
second now save it once move to the
browser and you can see it looks fine
though the only thing that is different
here in this website is the color of
this link right or is the color of the
shop now button so we can change the
color
here the color
is sky blue
so let's try to do it so here you can
see the color seems a little bit
different now I don't know the actual
value of this color that's why I'm not
sure about it so what we'll do is we'll
make it a
little more bright what the save it now
and you can see it looks same now so
this was the color we found that now we
have to change the color of this button
on hovering over it so what we'll do is
we'll write here Banner
a
over
so the background we are going to
change we'll write here hash
D4 76
e
1 okay
one the color codes are pretty hard to
remember so we are not using this
particular color so we'll
change it to a little bit
blue save it now move to the browser and
you can see it looks nice right and the
actual website it's a little bit dull
but in our website it looks nice right
it's a little bit dark than the original
color so that's fine you can change the
color according to
you so you have seen that this part is
also done it looks nice right till
now the task we did was quite easy the
next thing we have to do is to add
products to a website which are the
courses We'll add those images to a
website using Json only so let's do the
HTML part first let's finish up the HTML
part and then we'll move on to the Json
part so we'll move to the HTML file
again and inside this
now what we'll do is we'll Define the
section for products so we'll write
here
section class is equals
to section
2 and ID is equals
to products fine we'll use both the
class and the ID attribute for this
particular section we'll write here
div class is
equals to
title and here what we'll do is we'll
write here
H1 and inside this we'll write courses
we
offer here we'll again add another div
and inside this we'll write class
as
product close this div
tag save it and there will be no
difference on the web page you can see
here we have some text present at the
bottom which says courses we offer
nothing else let's add those images now
what we'll do is we'll move to the Json
file and we'll add those images with
some properties and pictures so let's
move on to the Json
file so here's a Json file products.
Json what we'll do is we'll create an
object here so we'll write
here
items and then we'll use square brackets
now one thing to notice while working on
any Json file is that Json doesn't let
us use single inverted commas or we have
to use double inverted commas for Json
file so if we write here items like
this
it won't work see it says this is an
error so in Json file we have to use
double inverted comma or double codes
not single codes so now inside the items
what we'll do is we'll create the object
for first image so we'll write here
sis and then we'll write here
ID so ID will
be
one we have to use use commas to
separate the properties so now we'll
write here
Fields colum and inside this we have to
use title so the title for first course
will
be Python
Programming Master course
fine now next thing we'll do is we'll
write here the price
the price will be let's say
$123.99 and then we'll write here image
so inside this we'll Define several
properties for the particular image
we'll write
fields and we'll use colon then again
we'll use curly braces we'll write
here
file colum then again we'll use curly
bra we'll write
here
URL so you can see it just says there's
an error so we have to remove this curly
braces from here and we have to put it
here now inside URL what we'll do
is we'll give the name of a file so a
file is stored in images folder and the
file name is and the picture name is
python. PNG fine
so it is working fine now what we have
to do is we have to put a comma here to
again insert one more image property so
we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it for eight
times then what we are going to do here
now is we are going to change the
ID the title of the course so the second
course is C++
Master
course and the price for this is let's
say
$110.99 we have to change the path as
well this image is stored as C++
PNG for the third one we'll write here
ID as three the title is going to be web
development for
beginners the price is let's
say 99 because this is a course for
beginners and the file name is instead
of python we'll write here web
1.png we'll do the same for all the
elements so next up we'll use ID as
4 and title
as Java
programming Master course fine the price
for this course is going to be
$149.99 and the file name
is java.
PNG fine next up we'll write here ID
is5 the title is going to be digital
marketing full
course the price is going to be
$9.99 and the name of a image
is digital.
PNG and then we have IDs 6 for another
course this course is going to be
Advanced web
development and the price is going to be
comparatively High because this is an
advanced course so instead of python
we'll write here web 2 because this is
the name of a image then we have ID as
7 and the file name is going to be data
structures and
algorithms full
course prices you can decide by yourself
so instead of 123 we'll use 99.99 here
and
inside this we'll write data.png this
this is our file
name then we have the ID as 8 for the
last
course the course name
is data science full
course the price is going to be
149 and image name
is data
2
fine so here you can see it says there
is an error remove this comma because we
don't have any other image remaining so
we are done with the Json file all of
this may sound a little bit tricky to
you guys but it is what it is and we
have to keep certain things in mind for
that we can't see these products in the
browser until we are done with the
JavaScript part as well so let's do the
rest of the HTML part first and then
we'll see how this works in JavaScript
save it once go to the browser and here
you can see we are not able to see those
products till now so what we are going
to do next is we are going to move to a
HTML file and inside this we are going
to do the remaining of a HTML part so
what we'll do is we'll write here
div class is equal to
cart
sidebar now we are creating the
structure for our card sidebar it means
that when we use the hamburger menu or
when we decrease the size of a web page
or web browser the cart will open at the
site so we are doing the coding for
that we'll write inside this div class
is equals to
cart and inside here we'll
write
span class is equals
to close card
now inside this we'll add an icon we'll
write here
I class is equals far four times and we
are done with it now next up what we are
going to do is we are going to write the
code inside of our cart we are going to
write here H2 it will
say your
cart and inside this we'll write div
class is equals
to card content next up we'll write here
div class is equals to
Total
sum and we are going to use dollars
right so we'll write here
H1 we'll write
here your total
and
we'll use the dollar sign
here after this we'll write span class
is
equals to
total amount let's say we are going to
change the class name it will be total
amount we'll close this here and inside
this we'll write zero because at the
start there will be no element or no
product present in the card so the total
price will be zero at the initial point
so that's why we have written zero here
now we are going to write here
div class is equals to clear
cut and inside this we are going to
create a button so the button class will
be
BTN
clear cart BTN so this is going to be a
class and here what we'll do is we'll
write
here clear cart
fine we are going to do the same for
proceed Button as well so we'll WR here
div class is equals to clear cut we are
going to use the same class for both the
buttons because I'll let you know what
why we are doing this at the end of this
project now we'll write here
button class is equals to
button clear
cut button fine we'll write
here
proceed we are done with the card
function now what we are going to do is
we are going to write some code for the
menu bar side menu bar so we'll write
here
div class is equals to let's say menu
sidebar inside this we'll write
div class is equals to close
menu and we'll write here
I class is
equals to Far Far
times
and we'll close this it tag over here
next up we'll write here after this
class we'll write
div class is equals to menu let's say
this name is menu menu
bar and inside this we'll write
here unordered list class will
be Manu
list
we'll write
here Li class is equals
to Manu list items and we'll write here
a
hre is equals to Hash we'll write here
home and we are good to go fine we'll do
the same for categories pricings and
about us
so we'll copy this
statement we'll paste it for four times
here we'll write instead of Home
categories pricings and about us fine so
we are done with the whole HTML part now
and we are left with CSS and JavaScript
only let's do that as well let's move on
to the CSS part first and do the rest of
the styling except for the products
we'll do it for products at the last so
let's move on to the CSS file first and
what we'll do is so that it will not
create any confusion we'll write here
menu bar because we have to write the
code here between this Banner style
property and this menu bar for the
products section so that's why we'll
start writing the code from here and
later we'll add a code here in between
so we'll write here do menu
sidebar display will be
none and then we'll write here
dot
cart
sidebar background is going to
be Ash EC EC EC so a little bit grayish
white we can say we'll write here
position
as fixed
right is
zero and top is zero so these are the
properties we are defining in a CSS part
then we'll write your width as 450
pixels
and height
is 100 viewp height fine we'll Define
the Z index as well we'll write here Z
index
is
10
transition is all at 0.3 seconds and the
transition will be linear
fine next up we'll write
here
transform and inside transform we'll
write here translate X fine so inside
here we'll write
100% it will go along with the x-axis
that's why we have written it over here
we'll write here
overflow
scroll we are done with it next up we'll
write here do
cart sidebar and we'll write here do
cart as well so we'll Define padding
here we'll write here padding as zero in
both the
cases next we have Dot card
and close card right so we'll write here
for both of them we'll write here do
card space close card the font size is
going to be
1.3m padding is going to be 1
M and cursor is going to be pointer
fine we'll write here Dot far
times inside this we'll
write margin
top is
0.5m and we'll write here cart
H2 is
text text align will be center for the
heading of a cart which is your cut so
we'll write your width
is
100% margin bottom is going to be 1
M
and what else we have to do we have to
include the font size as well so we'll
write here
font size is
1.1m slightly bigger than the default
font size
then we'll write here font family let's
use only one
fine let's use Verana only so we'll
write here Verana and next up we'll
write here
Dot card
product space do
product D
image space is IMG now we are going to
write here something now we are going to
write the code for all the images
present inside the cart so that's why we
are writing here
width is 130
pixels of that particular image the
width is going to be 130 pixels and the
height is going to
be 90 pixel let's say fine we are done
with this as well next up we'll write
here dot
cut
product content fine now we'll write
here display is
flex Flex direction
is
column and we have justify content is
space
around and align items at the
center we'll write your
margin left is 1
M
and height
is 80 pixels
fine we are done with this as well we'll
write here dot plus-
minus this is for increasing or
decreasing the product number in our
cards those arrows you must have
remember which we have seen in the
website let me show you again so these
are the arrows I'm talking about let me
add a
product now go to cart and these are the
arrows I'm talking about right
now so we are going to style those
arrows as well so we'll write
here display is
flex and
transform we are going to rotate them so
we are going to write here
rotate
at
90° that will look cool so we'll write
here color
is
again # f09 d51 so this is the color
code for a particular color we'll write
here font size is 1
.5m and we'll write
here cursor as
pointer next up we are going to do the
styling for total sum so we'll write
here total
sum text align at the
center and margin is
going to be 1
M 0
0 5 m
and zero again so it's for top bottom
left and right everyone so we'll write
here
next clear
cut text align at the center
and we'll write here clear
[Music]
cut
button now for the clear card button
we'll write
here
background so background color is going
to
be again that same one orange we can say
or little bit of orange as well I don't
know the exact name for that color but
it doesn't matter right we can do
anything we can use any color so the
font color is going to be
white the border is going to be 1
pixel
solid
and white in color for the button right
if we go back to our website and you can
see here this is our
button so we are styling this particular
button
now let's go back here and we'll write
here padding
is
0.5m and
1.7 m
fine cursor will be
pointer and of course transition is
going to be at 0.3 seconds and linear
fine next up we'll write
here clear
cut dot
button on hovering over it what we want
is we'll write here H and we'll Define
the property now so we'll write here
border
okay we'll write here border border is
going to be one pixel thick solid in
nature and of this color so we'll write
here D4
761
fine on overing the color will change
obviously so we'll write here this and
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here background as
transparent
and color is black
fine I done with this as well next up
we'll write here overlay for overlay the
height is going to
be 100 viewport height the position is
going to
be
fixed
the top is going to be zero similarly
the
left will also be
zero we'll Define the Z index as well
we'll write as Z index as 9 and width
is
100% the background
color is going to be
HH
f385
1f
fine so this is for overlay we'll write
here
pity as
0.3
and
transition is all 0.3 seconds
and linear fine so what we are doing is
we are writing the code for this if you
open our cart you can see this
particular area or this particular field
is a little bit different from what it
was it is a little bit different in
color and the opacity is also different
the opacity is 0.3 here we can make it
fully opaque as well so for now we'll
use 0.3
only next up what we are going to do is
we are going to write the prop
property for none we'll write here
none display is none fine now what we
are going to do is we are going to write
the CSS part for tablets and for mobile
screens so if you remember that if you
reduce the size of this Chrome browser
the size of our website also reduces and
it becomes like this so to achieve this
we have to write particular the CSS code
for tablet and for phone we have to
define the max width and we have to do
some more things in there so what we'll
do is we'll write here at
theate
media screen
and Max width is going to
be
768 pixels
fine now inside this we'll write do logo
we'll change the
logo as well we'll write here padding
left
is
zero and after this we are going to
write here do cart heading right is
2m after cart we'll write here do menu
bar so we are going to change all the
properties here almost all the
properties which we'll requir so we'll
write here display is none the menu bar
will disappear we'll write here dot
burger and inside this we'll
write margin left the burger sign will
come into existence now we'll write here
2 m for the margin left for
display we'll write here block next up
we have to do something for section one
and for product section as well so we'll
write here
dot section one and we'll write here dot
Banner
H1 so we'll write here font size is
1.5m and we'll write here
dot Banner a we are going to change the
size of a shop now button so we'll write
here font size is
0.6m
and padding is 1 M and 2 m
fine we are done with this as well next
up we'll write
here dot
section
2 do
title and we'll write here
H1 inside this we'll write
font size is
1.5m so we haven't defined the section
two and title styling part yet we'll
Define it later but we'll write the code
for that as well now next up we'll write
here menu
sidebar display is going to be
block position is going to
be
fixed left is going to be zero top is
going to to be zero so we'll WR here
left is going to be zero and top will
also be
zero then we have width is
100% height
is 100 vport height
and Z index
is
11 background sound is going to
be gray again so we'll write here EC EC
EC then we'll write
here overflow is
hidden
and
transform
is translate so we'll write here minus
100%
and transition is again same we'll write
here 0.3s and linear fine next up we'll
write here menu as menu
bar and inside here we'll write display
is flex height as 80% justify content at
the
center
and we are done so next up we'll write
here menu list we'll change the style of
menu list as
well so we'll write
here height height is going to
be
100% then we'll write here display as
Flex We Are rewriting the code again and
again but each time we are doing it for
different class we are doing it for
different element so keep these things
in
mind and we'll write here
Flex
direction is
column align items at the
center and just defy
content justify content as space around
now it's time to do it for menu sidebar
for menu sidebar
and for close menu both will use the
same styling
properties we'll write your
position as
absolute right is going to
be 30
pixels font size is going to be
1.4m
and after this we'll write
dot menu
list
items and we'll write
here
color is HH f09 d51 the default color we
are using till now and lastly we'll
write
here dot menu Dash
list items space a
on over we'll write
here color
is H
f57b
09 fine so here's a mistake we have
placed colon here twice we'll remove it
and now we are done with the tablet part
so we have to change the style of almost
all the elements we are done with the
tablet part next up we have to write the
same code for mobile part as well and
we'll write here at the rate
media
screen so we'll write here and Max
width is going to be 480
pixels now what we'll do is we'll write
here a stck for font
size is going to be 16 pixel here we
have changed the font size for the whole
entire HTML document we have done it
because we have used m in place of Ram
or pixels in this case or in this video
so that's why we have changed the size
here because we want the screen to be
smaller in size right if we go back here
you can
see the font size is 16 by default and
if we do it you can see the font size
changes for each and every element right
to achieve this we have to use m in
place of pixel or REM we can say now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to write here
dot
section one do
banner and we'll write here width as 280
pixels for
both and we'll write here height
is 100 pixels
fine you can see here the height of this
image is 100 pixel or we can say the
height of this Banner is 100 pixel and
the width is 280 pixels so this is why
we are changing the style of all these
elements because we want all these
elements to fit inside a smaller screen
that's why we have to change the height
or we have to change the width as well
now what we'll do is we'll write
here
Section 1 dot Banner we'll write here
H1 inside this we'll write font
size
is
1.2m display is going to be we don't
have to use display here I guess let's
leave
it so we are done with this next up
we'll write the code for Burger we'll
write Burger margin left is going to be
1
M for mobile for mobile the display is
going to be
block and the width is going to
be 30 pixel
fine we'll do the same for card
sidebar we'll write
here
width is 100% of of the screen the cart
will take whole screen and we'll write
here at the last for
product so for product we'll write here
margin is zero display is
flex justify content at the
center align items at the
center and flex direction is going to be
column so we have covered all almost
every HTML element in the CSS file we
are done with the styling for everything
except products we'll style them later
let's move on to the JavaScript part now
and see how we can fetch those products
so we cannot witness every style change
right now but we'll witness them while
covering the JavaScript part so let's
move on to the JavaScript part first and
we'll start with the card section and
the hamburger menu thing so save it and
if you want to witness the change es we
made you can go here and you can see the
cart is not opening because we need to
write the JavaScript part for that and
everything else Remains the Same if we
reduce the size of our browser you can
see we have a menu over here we can
increase the size and we have a image
adjusting itself accordingly so we can
use it and it's quite responsive as
well let's move on to the JavaScript
part now we'll open the Javascript file
and first of all we'll access all the
HTML elements with the query selector
method so we have several HTML elements
right here you can see we have several
elements present in our HTML file we are
going to access few of these elements so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write
here
const cart is equals to
document
dot query
selector we are going to write
here nav space.
card then we are going to do the same
for a
long time so what we are going to do is
we are going to copy paste this piece of
code again and again for several times
we are going to change the name of
variables so we'll write
here card sidebar and instead of this
we'll write
here do card
sidebar and the next one we'll write
here
Dot close card and here the variable
name will change
to close
card fine next up we'll take another
variable
as burger and here we'll change the
query from Navcard to dot Burger
fine next up we have menu sidebar so
we'll write here menu sidebar and here
what we'll do is we'll write
here dot
menu sidebar
fine next up we
have close
menu and here
we'll
write close menu again after close menu
we have cart items total so we'll write
here
cart
items total
and will we will
use
noi then we have total amount as well so
we'll write here total
amount and here we'll write card price
total we have to access a lot of
elements so then we'll write here
[Music]
cart UI and for this we'll
access card sidebar and cart so we'll
write here do
cart sidebar space
card fine then we have the total sum so
we'll write here total sum we'll put a
dot over
here and here we'll
write total
div then we have the clear button so
we'll write here clear button and here
we'll
write clear card button then finally we
have variable named cart
content to access everything present in
the cart so we'll write here do
cart
content here we'll
write cart content so these are 12
variables and we have accessed almost
every element present in HTML file which
we are going to need further so I hope
you guys understood this we have used
the query selector method to access all
the HTML elements here in the JavaScript
part now next up we'll take two empty
arrays so we'll write here
let
C is equals to an
array and we'll write here let buttons
Dome and it it's again going to be an
array fine now we'll first create some
events to open and close the cart for
that we'll write
here cart dot add event
listener We'll add a click event
here and we'll write here
function now inside this we'll write
cart
Dot
we'll write cart
sidebar dot
style
dot transform is
equals to translate 0% fine so this is
we are changing the style of card Side
Bar next up we'll write here const body
overlay we'll take a variable table of
named const body overlay we'll write
here
document dot create
element and we'll write
here div inside this
fine next up what we'll do is we'll
write
here body
overlay
dot class list do add
and we'll write
here overlay
fine we'll use the set timeout method so
we'll write
here set time
out okay we have written here SST so
we'll write here set time out then we'll
create an anonymous function and inside
here what we'll do is we'll write
document dot query
selector and inside here we'll write
body then we'll write here append and
we'll append body overlay here so we'll
write here body overlay fine and the
time will pass here is going to be 300
milliseconds we are done with this
function We'll add another event so what
we'll do is we'll write here
close cut dot add event
listener now we are closing the card so
we'll write here click then
we'll create a
function and we'll write
here card
sidebar dot style
dot transform and again we'll translate
it to
100% previously we did for 0% and now
we'll translate it to 100% again so
we'll write here translate and we'll
pass 100% inside the brackets
here next up we'll again use the body
overlay variable so we'll copy this from
here and we'll paste it here we'll of
course change the create element value
so instead of create element we'll write
here
document do query
selector and we'll write
here
dot overlay fine next up we'll write
here
document dot query
selector and we'll write here
body
dot remove child we'll remove body overl
from here so we'll write
here body overlay
fine we are good to go save it now
and go to the
browser so here you can see on clicking
the cart a cart is working totally fine
now we are in this particular program so
we are in a website which we are
creating right now this is the original
website this is the final product so
leave it and we are going to work on a
website only so here you can see a cart
is working totally fine now we can open
or close our card and we have two
options over here one is for clear the
entire card and the other one is for
proceeding further next up we'll add
some more events for the hamburger menu
now how to open or close that menu and
all so for that we'll move to a
Javascript file again and we'll write
here Burger
dot ad event
listener and we'll add a click event
we'll write here click we'll write
here
function and then we'll write
here menu sidebar dot style do transform
and what we are going to do is we are
going to
translate again we are going to
translate it to
0% now the same thing we have to do for
this as well we'll write here
Burger do add event
listener inside here we'll right click
and then we'll write a
function which will again do the same
task it will translate to minus 100%
we'll write here menu sidebar dot style
dot transform and we are again going to
translate it
to minus 100% now
fine save it and go to the
browser
now if we decrease the size of a web
page or if we decrease the size of a
browser you can see okay let me decrease
it first so you can see the hamburger
menu over here and on clicking it's not
working right now so let's inspect those
elements once and there's no error but
let me check if there's any mistake okay
so we have to write
here close
menu and now I guess it will work fine
we'll save it again and we'll move to
the
browser reduce the size click on this
hamburger menu and you can see it's
working totally fine now
right so this part is also done now what
we have to do next is we have to create
a class to get those products from the
Json file so keep your eyes open now
guys we'll see how it actually works so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a class named product so this
is our class we'll write here a sync I
hope you are already aware of a sync and
a wait so we'll write here get
product and this is a function we'll
write here const
response is equals to await and while
awaiting it will
fetch products
dot Json
fine then we'll create a variable we'll
write here
const data is equals to
await response do G Jon fine next up
we'll
write products is equals
to data do
items and we'll
write products is
equals to
products do map function we are going to
use so we'll write here again
item then we'll use Arrow function we'll
write the body of this function here
we'll write
here const inside this we'll pass title
and price of the
product and we'll write here item
Dot Fields
fine similarly we'll do the same for ID
as well inside curly braces we'll write
ID and we'll write here item dot
CIS then we'll write
here
const image now we are fetching the
image so we'll write here item
Dot Fields do image
Dot
Fields we actually giving the path right
if you see here in the Json file you can
see inside items we have sis Fields then
inside fields we have title price image
and then inside image we have Fields
file and URL so we'll access each of
them now we'll write here after Fields
do
file.
URL
and lastly we'll write here
return
title
price ID
and image fine
finally we'll write here after
this
[Music]
return
products
cool now what we are doing here is we
are getting the details of all the
products and storing them inside
separate objects so we have all the
objects present over here all those
images were actually stored inside the
local storage and and now we can fetch
them from that particular storage now
we'll create another class for the user
interface of the product so if you save
it now and go to the browser you will
see no difference over here because it's
not working as of now if you go to
inspect elements and console you can see
it
says length mismatch it's because of the
live server so there's no error over
here now we'll create another class for
the user interface of the products we'll
add those products to the cart and we
can delete them from the cart we'll do
everything inside one single class so
let's do
it what we are going to do is we are
going to write
here class let's say the class name is
UI and we'll write
here display products and we'll write
here
products then we'll right here inside
this let result be a
variable and we'll leave it empty over
here next line we'll use the for each
Loop so we'll write here
products
dot for
each and inside this
we'll create an arrow
function so we'll write
here
const product div let's say is a
variable and then we'll write
here document
dot create element again we are going to
create an element so we'll write here
div
and after this what we are going to do
is we are going to write here
product
div
dot inner
HTML is equals
to now the main part starts so inside
this we'll
write
div class is
equals to product
card
and then we'll
write
IMG we'll add the image so here we'll
write mg SRC is equals
to
Dollar product dot image we are going to
fetch it and instead of
Alt in place of alt we'll write alt
as
product in the next line we'll use the
span tag again we'll write a span class
is equals
to add to
card and we'll then write
here
data ID is equals
to product.
ID we'll close this tag we'll close this
span tag we can say in the next line
we'll use the it tag we'll write your I
class is equals
to
FAA
C
plus for 1
x now what we are doing is we are going
to show the number of items present in
our cart over the cart icon that's why
we are doing all this so here what we'll
do is we'll write style is equals to
margin Dash r
right margin right is going to be 0.1
M
[Music]
and font size is going to
be 1 M
fine close this as well close the it tag
as
well and in the next
line right right
here add to
card so the Spen tag is finally we are
going to close it now this is a single
tag I have written it in such a way
because I don't want it to create any
sort of confusion for you guys so the
span tag starts from here and goes till
here now we are remaining with some more
part of it so in the next line what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here
div class is
equals product name and here we'll write
dollar product.
title and we are going to close this div
tag in the next line we are going to
write div again class is going to be
product
pricing and inside here we'll write
product
dot
price and we are going to close this div
tag
here close the first div tag as
well
and we are good to in the next line what
we are going to do is we are going to
write here
const p is equals
to document
dot query selector and inside this we'll
write
dot product we are going to access the
element with product as class or we are
going to access the product query then
we'll write here P do append
equal
to product div what we are doing is any
item we are adding to card is we are
going to append that item inside the
card so that's what we are doing till
now now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to write here a
function get
buttons basically a Constructor we can
say we'll write here
const
buttons we'll write here cons buttons is
equal to
document
dot query
selector we have to write a query select
all and then we are going to write here
inside this do add2 card fine we have
been through all these query selector
methods previously so I don't think that
this is going to create any sort of
problem for you guys so let's move ahead
and we'll write here array
Dot from
we'll write here
buttons then we'll write here
buttons Dom is equals to buttons we are
going to pass the value of buttons to
buttons Dom then we'll write buttons
dot for
each and inside here we'll write button
and we are going to create an arrow
function over here here what we'll do is
we'll will write
here let ID is equals to
button dot data set do ID in the next
line we'll write
let
incart is
equals c
dot find and we are going to pass item
to this
function
so we are going to write inside
here item and again an arrow function
we'll write here item do
ID triple is
equals to ID
fine we're going to check the condition
here if we'll write here
if in
cart then we we'll write here BTN
dot inner
HTML is
equals to in cart so what we are doing
is if we have added the product to cart
already then the button will change as
we have seen earlier that on adding the
product once to the card the button will
change to in cart from add to card so
this is what we are doing here next up
we'll write
here button do
disabled is equals to true we are going
to disable that button once the product
is added to card
fine next up we'll write here button.
add event
listener and we are going to create an
event we'll WR here
click
and
we'll write e here then we'll use the
arrow
function and we'll write here e
do current Target dot inner HTML is
equals
to in
COD then we'll write here e
do current Target do in HTML okay we'll
write here e do current Target dot style
dot
[Music]
color is equals to
White e
do current Target
dot style
dot pointer events equals to
none and we are done with it next up we
are going to store the products in the
card so so for that what we are going to
do is we are going to write here
let cart item is equals to so we are
going to use a little bit of Json now
we'll write
here
dot
storage
dot get storage
products we'll write your ID
comma
amount and the amount is going to be
one we'll write
here C dot
push we are going to push the cart item
to the
cart so we will write here cart
item then we'll write here storage we
are going to store it inside the cart so
we'll write here storage do Save
card and we'll pass cart over here fine
now we have to calculate the total and
we have to set the total items as well
so for that we'll write
here this
dot set cart
values we'll write here
cart and to display those cart item we
have to write here this dot add cart
item and we have to add that cart item
so we'll write
here this
dot add cart
items
item and we'll pass cart item over here
fine we are done with the working of
cart as well next up what we are going
to do is we are going to change the
total value of cart we are going to
change the value of cart on increasing
or decreasing the cart products so first
of all we have to write
here set cart values and we have to pass
cart over here we have to write here
let's say we have a
variable temp total so this is going to
be a temporary variable we'll write here
time total is equals to 0o and we'll
take another
variable for that we'll write
here item total so item total is also
going to be zero now we'll map this card
so for that we'll write here card do
map we'll write here
item use Arrow function so for that
we'll write
here temp
total Plus is equals
to item dot
price
into item
dot
amount so this is how we are going to
get the total amount and then we'll
write here item basically we are
swapping all of that so we'll write here
item total is equal
to item
Dot amount we have to add these two
values so we'll write here item total
plus is equals to item do amount
fine now we'll write
here par
float and we are going to change these
values just like parent we have parse
float as well so inside parse float
we'll write time
total
dot to fixed and we are going to fix it
until two decimal units fine next up
we'll write here cart items total
dot inner
HTML is equals
to items
total and we'll write here
[Music]
C price
total do inner HTML is equals
to
par float we'll write here
temp
total
not two fixed and we'll fix it up to two
decimal units
fine next up we'll write here
add cart
item now we'll write here cart
item and inside this we'll write
let cart
item
UI is
equals to document dot create
element we'll write here
div we'll write here cart
item
UI dot inner
HTML is equals to we are again going to
do the same task so we are going to use
the backt for that so here we'll
write
div
class is equals
to Cod
product
and we'll write here
div class is equals to product image
we'll write here IMG
SRC is equals to we are going to fatch
the image again so we'll write here
dollar and inside this we'll
write card item
dot image
and ALT will
be product in this case as
well next up we are going to close this
div
tag and we are going to start another
div tag here so we'll write here
div class is equals
to
card product
item sorry card product content we can
say and
then we'll write
here in the next
line
div
class is
equals
Cod product
name we'll write here inside H3 tag so
inside H3 tag we'll
write
dollar card item do
title and we are going to close this H1
tag over here H3 tag sorry H3 tag over
here then we'll close this div tag as
well we are again going to create
another div tag this time we are going
to write the
class
as C
product price we are going to fetch the
price
now we'll write
here
again
H3 so our price is in dollars so we'll
use dollars for now we can use rupees
here as well so we can write
here cart item dot price the price is
going to be in dollars then we'll close
this
tag and we are also going to close the
div tag here
fine in the next line we are going to
create the product remove card so we are
going to create a div tag for that and
the class is going to be card product
remove data ID is going to be cart ID so
we'll write here
cart item.
ID and then we'll write
here HF is equals
to
hash and style is going to
be color is going to
be
red and then we'll write here
remove I'm going to close
the anchor tag and then the div tag
fine so we are done with this till now
then we are going to again close this
particular div tag we used
previously now what we are going to do
is we are going to change the number of
products so we are going to use here
class is equals
to plus
minus
and here we'll write inside the it
tag class is equals
to for for
angle
left add
amount fine this is going to be the
class and
the data ID is going to
be cart item ID so we are going to write
here data ID is equals
to
dollar and inside this we'll
write cart item
id do
ID and then we are going
to close this tag and we are going to
close the it tag here
fine next up we are going to use this
span tag again we are going to write
here
span class is equals
to number of
items and we'll close this tag here
we'll write
dollar cart item dot amount
we are going to close the span tag here
so we'll write here/
Span in the next line we are again going
to
use data
ID and here what we'll do is we'll write
here dollar and and we'll write
here cart item do
ID we are going to close the it tag
again and in the next line we are going
to close the div
tag and one more div tag
fine now we are done with it let me
close this first and next up will append
this cart content to the cart item UI so
we'll write here
cart content
dot append and inside this we'll
pass cart
item
UI
fine so here you can see we are going to
close close this so this is the closed
one and inside here we'll
write setup
app again a Constructor we are going to
write here
card is equals to storage Dot
get
cut we'll write
this
dot set cart
values cart
here and then we'll write card do
map inside this we'll write
item and and inside the body we'll
write this
dot add cart
item
item fine I hope you guys are getting
this next up we'll write the cart logic
here we'll write here cart
logic and we'll write
here clear Buton
do add event listener we are going to
create an event again we'll write here
click comma a
function inside this we'll write this
dot clear cut we are going to call this
function over here now we
have to write the Logic for remove
button so we'll do it
here we'll write
here card content. add event
listener click comma
event and we'll write here
inside this
if event
dot
Target
dot class
list dot
contains
C product
remove then we'll again create a
variable let's say the variable is
let okay we have made a mistake over
here we have to close this bracket
here and then we have to write
here let ID is
equals to event
dot Target do
dot data set dot
ID the next line we'll write this
dot remove item and we'll pass ID here
fine in the next line we'll write here
let div is
equals to
event dot Target Dot
parent
element and we are going to use parent
element for quite some time now so we
are going to write here
dot parent element
again for four times so we'll write
here parent element
dot parent element so we have written it
four times here in the next next line
we'll write here div
dot
remove
child and we'll write here event dot
Target
dot we'll copy it from
here and we'll paste it here
fine now in the next
line we are going to close close this
bracket and we are going to start
writing here El
if event dot
Target dot CLA list dot
contains add
amount
then what we are going to do is we are
going to use the ID variable again we
are going to write here let ID is equal
to
event.
Target
dot data set.
ID let item is equals
to C do
find
we'll pass item here
and we'll use the arrow function so
we'll write here item dot ID equals to
ID fine then we'll write here item
dot
amount Plus+ so we are going to increase
the amount of items then what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here storage
dot Save card and we are going to pass
card
here we'll write here this
dot set cart
values
C we'll write here event dot
Target
dot next element sibling do inner
HTML is equals to item dot amount
fine now we are going to use another
elsf here so we'll write here
elsf even
dot Target
dot classlist do
contains reduce amount so we are going
to change the number of products in our
card so for that what we'll do is we'll
write
here let ID is equals
to event. data
set even do target. data
set do ID fine and item will
be let item is equals
to cod.
find
item item do ID triple equals to
ID if we again going to use an if
statement so we'll write here item dot
amount is greater than one if the number
of items is greater than
one then
item
dot amount minus
minus and store
it inside the card so we are going to
write here storage do Save
card and we'll pass cart here then we'll
write here this
dot set cart
values and we'll again pass cart
here in the next line we'll write here
event
dot
Target
dot previous element
sibling do inner
HTML is equals to item dot
amount and finally we'll write here else
and inside the else what we'll do is
we'll write
here this
dot remove
item and we'll pass the ID here we'll
write here let div is
equals to event dot Target we are
basically targeting the events we are
creating conditions for certain
different events like when the user
increases the number of products and the
user decreases the number of product and
if the user removes the product from the
card so we are writing the code for that
so we'll write here event. Target
dot parent
element and we'll write here parent
element again for four
times fine we'll write here div
dot remove
child and inside this we'll write event
dot Target
dot parent element for four times
again it will check each parent
element
so here we are done with it next
up we have to create two functions for
add amount and and for reduce amount so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write
here add
amount and we'll write here
const add button is equals
to document dot query
selector all
inside this will pass
DOT add amount
fine we'll write here add
button
dot for
each and we'll write here inside
this m do add event
listener
and we'll add an event over here we'll
write here
click comma event we'll pass event here
and then we'll write
here like
this let
ID is equals
to event
dot current Target
Dot
data
set do ID fine we'll write here cart
dot
map and we'll pass item over here we'll
write here again Arrow function and
inside this what we are going to do is
we are going to write here item
dot amount
Plus+ storage
dot Save card we are going to pass cart
here we'll write here this
dot set cart
values we are again going to set the
cart values
and we'll again use amount UI a new
variable and we'll write here event
dot current Target Dot
parent element dot
children fine so we are targeting the
parent element along with the children
so we'll write
here amount
UI do inner HTML is equals to item dot
amount so we have forgot to mention here
if item. ID is equals to
ID then do it
fine now we are going to do the same
thing for reduce amount as well so we'll
write
here reduce
amount and inside this we'll
write
const reduce button is equals to
document
dot query selector all and we are going
to pass here
dot reduce
amount fine we'll write here
reduce button
dot for
each
then we'll pass button over here and
we'll use the arrow function
again finally we'll write here button do
add event
listener
click
event let
ID is equals
to event dot
current current
Target dot data
set do
ID fine we'll write here card do map
we'll map it to card and we'll write
here
item then again we'll write your if
temp item.
ID triple equals 2
ID then we'll write here item amount
minus minus so we'll write here item dot
amount minus minus and
if item
dot amount is greater than
zero then what it will do it
will store it inside
the local storage so we'll write here
storage do save cart and we'll write
here
cart then we'll write this dot set cart
values
cart
const amount
UI is equals to
event dot current Target dot parent
element do
children amount UI do inner HTML is
equals to item dot amount
fine
again we'll write here else else what
will happen we'll write here
event
dot current Target
dot parent element so here instead of
parent element we'll
write remove child and we'll write
here
event do current
Target Dot parent element dot parent
element fine in the next line we'll
write this
dot remove item and we'll pass ID
here we are done with this part as well
next up we have to clear the cart so for
that we'll write here clear cart we'll
again do something for that we'll write
here let cart item is equals cart do map
inside this we'll write
item implies is item.
ID cart item dot we'll again use the for
each Loop here we'll write here this
then we'll provide ID
here and we'll write here this
dot remove item we'll pass the ID over
here then we'll write here
const Cod product we'll create a new
variable here we'll write
here document
dot query selector all and we'll write
here
Dot card
product write here card
product do
for
each for each item what we are going to
do is we are going to create an arrow
function here and we are going to write
if item is true if item is
there then item do parent
element
dot remove child will remove the item
now we have to remove the item so for
that we'll write here
remove item and we'll pass ID to that
item we'll write here cart we'll update
the value of cart as cart.
filter we'll write here
item and then we'll write here item.
ID not equals to ID this dot set cart
values and we'll update the card
then similarly we'll again write here
storage
dot Save card and we'll pass card
here then we'll write here
let button is equals to this
this
dot get single
button we'll write your
ID and we'll change the button style
we'll write here button do style
dot pointer events is equals
to
unset then we'll write here button dot
inner HTML
L is equals
to back
Teck I class will be FAA card
plus we are going to close the it tag
here and we'll write here add
to
C fine next up we'll write here
get single button we'll pass ID over
here and we'll write the code for here
we'll write here
let
BTN then we'll write
here buttons Dome dot for
each for each button what it will do
is we'll check
if button
dot data set do ID is equals to
ID
then BTN equals
to button
fine here we'll
return
button
now save
it save this program go to
browser and this is our website go to
browser and you can see nothing is
visible till now we have to write a
little more code to make everything
visible here now we have to store the
data in local storage so that on
refreshing the web page we don't lose
the data so what we'll do is we'll go
back to a Javascript file and we'll
write
here
class
storage equals
to static save products we'll pass
products
here then we'll open craes and we'll
write here local
storage
dot set item
and inside this we'll
write products
dot
comma Json
dot
stringify
products fine we are passing the
products from our Json file now next up
we'll write
here
static get storage
products we'll pass the ID
here and we'll write here
let products is equals
to
Json do
Parts local storage
do get
item and we'll pass
products here fine in the next line
we'll
write
return products dot
find we'll write here
item item do ID is equals to ID fine
next up we again write here
static Save
card now we are saving the products or
in our cart so we'll write here local
storage dot set
item inside here we'll
pass cart and here we'll write
Json
Dot
stringify and we'll pass C over
here next up we'll write here
static get cart we are getting the items
from the cart we'll write here
return local storage
dot get
item
cart here we'll write question mark
we'll pass the Json file here we'll
write here Json dot
pars local storage
dot get item from
the card
fine here we have
to put a square bracket a pair of square
brackets and lastly we have to write a
few lines of code so we'll write here
document. add event
listener and we'll write here
Dom
content loaded so we are adding one more
event to our Javascript file which is
the Dom content loaded so we have to
write here Dom content
loaded and here we have to
write inside the
function
const
products is
equals to new
product and we'll write here const UI is
equals
to new
UI now we have to show card from local
storage so we'll write here UI
dot setup app
and we'll write
here products
dot get
product dot
then and inside this we'll
write
products
equal imply
this
UI dot
display display products we'll write
here
[Music]
products storage
dot save products and we'll
pass products here as well fine we'll
write here dot then we are using
promises so here we'll
write UI
dot get
buttons and UI
Dot card logic
fine now the JavaScript part is done we
have used Json here to make our web page
more responsive towards several aspects
apart from that we have used Json for
adding products to our website as well
now we are left with one more task only
let's do it and then we'll see the final
outcome of this extended code so we'll
move to the CSS file and we'll start
starting the products part let's try if
it's working or not let's save this
piece of code and go to browser click on
shop
now and it's not working we can
see okay it says it's failed to load the
resource refresh it and you can see now
it's working totally fine we have all
our product images over here we have all
of our products we can add them to cart
and we can use the cart as well so the
last thing we have to do is to use
products now now we have to style those
products so for that we'll move to our
CSS file so here's our CSS file and
inside this we have to write here so we
have put a comment over there when we
were not here so we have to style the
products over here so for that we'll
write here do section 2 dot
title
[Music]
and text align at the center
enter then we'll write here section
2
dot
title
H1 and the font size is going to
be 1.8
m the margin is going to
be
1.3m then we have to write the code for
products here so we'll write here do
product and inside this we'll write
margin as
0.5m we have to write here margin we'll
write here 0.5m and
Auto Max
width is going to be 1300
pixels display is is going to be
grid grid
column is going to be so here is going
to be grid column Gap and it is going to
be
2m then we'll write
here grid row
Gap and grid row Gap is going to be 2 m
as well
then we'll write
here
grid
template columns and we'll write here
repeat we are going to create a grid for
our products right so we'll write Here
auto
fit comma min max
we'll write here 350
pixels
and one
ra fine next up we'll write here dot
product card and now we are going to
write here text align as
Center position as
relative
Max width of the grid is going to be 350
pixels and the Overflow is going to be
hidden next up we'll write
here product card
image we'll write here
height is 300 pixels
width has 300
pixels
and transition is
0.3 seconds
linear
fine simly we'll do the same for product
name and product pricing so we'll write
here
product
name
comma
product
pricing margin for them is going to be
[Music]
0.3m we'll write here
dot
product pricing and the color of the
product pricing is going to
be the one we have been using till now
so we'll write here
F0 9
d51 then we
have to write the code for add to card
button so we'll write here add to
card we'll write here align items to the
center justify the content to the
center and color is going to be
white padding is going to be
0.2m and 1
M fine height is going to
be 30
pixels
background is going to
be the
same
F9
d51 position is going to be
absolute right is going to be zero
transform is going to
be
translate along the x-axis to
100% bottom is going to be
80
pixels we have to put a comma
here bottom is going to be 80
pixels transition is going to be 0.3
seconds again and
linear cursor is going to be pointer
fine then we have to write few more
lines so we'll write your product card

website is fine now try adding the
products to the cart you can see the
products are in the
