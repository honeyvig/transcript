often shops from www. shoppingcart tocom
she has her information like email ID
address and credit card details saved on
the website to enable a faster and
hassle free shopping experience the
required information is stored in a
server one day an received an email
which stated her eligibility for a
special discount voucher from shopping
cart.com in order to receive the coupon
code she was asked to fill in her
shopping cart.com account credentials
this didn't seem fishy to her at the
time as she thought it was just an
account verification step little did she
realize the danger she would be facing
she was knocked off her feet when a
substantial amount of money was wiped
off her account how do you think this
happened well yes the email she received
was Fay ANS shopping cart.com account
witnessed unauthorized access from a
third party this type of attack is known
as a Cyber attack and the person who
carries it out is called a hacker could
Anna have prevented this attack indeed
she could have with the help of cyber
security cyber security involves
techniques that help in sec securing
various digital components networks data
and computer systems from unauthorized
digital access there are multiple ways
to implement cyber security depending on
the kind of network you are connected to
and the type of cyber attacks you are
prone to so let's take a look at the
various cyber attacks that Anne could
have been exposed to one of the most
common types of cyber attacks is a
malware attack like Trojan adwar and
spyware to name a few had an and
downloaded any suspicious attachments
online her system could have gotten
corrupted by certain malicious viruses
embedded within the attachments next is
a fishing attack the type of Cyber
attack which an experienced here the
hacker usually sends fraulin emails
which appear to be coming from a
legitimate Source this is done to
install malware or to steal sensitive
data like credit card information and
login
credentials another type of attack is
the man in the middle attack here the
hacker gains access to the information
path between an's device and the website
server the Hacker's computer takes over
Ann's IP address by doing so the
communication line between an and the
website is secretly intercepted this
commonly happens with unsecured Wi-Fi
networks and also through malware
password attack is one of the easiest
ways to hack a system here Ann's
password could have been cracked by
using either common passwords or trying
all possible alphabetical combinations
to prevent future cyber attacks Ann
sought to implement a few cyber security
practices first she installed a firewall
as the name suggests it is a virtual
wall between Ann's computer and the
internet firewalls filter the incoming
and outgoing traffic from your device to
safeguard your network and they can
either be software applications or
Hardware
reinforcements secondly an implemented
honey pots just like how flowers attract
bees dummy computer systems called
honeypots are used to attract attackers
these systems are made to look
vulnerable in order to deceive attackers
and this in turn defends the real system
in addition to these she also decided to
use unique alpha numeric passwords
antivirus software and started avoiding
males from unknown senders that was
Ann's story cyber attacks are not just
confined to individuals but also to
public and private
organizations the cyber attacks carried
out in such places are more deadly and
they result in colossal losses motives
of such attacks are many starting from
tampering with crucial data to monetary
gains let's have a look at a few of the
cyber attacks that companies are
subjected to various public sector
organizations and large corporations
face the advanced persistent threat a in
this form of attack hackers gain access
to networks for a prolonged period
period in order to continuously gain
confidential information companies also
witness the denial of service attack
where networks are flooded with traffic
which in turn leaves legitimate service
requests unattended a variant of this is
the distributed denial of service DDOS
attack when multiple systems are used to
launch the attack when a hacker
manipulates a standard SQL query in a
database driven website it is known as a
SQL injection attack by doing so hackers
can view edit and delete tables from
databases amidst a plethora of cyber
attacks it is indeed a challenge for
organizations with several networks and
servers to ensure complete Security this
is not an easy task and to help with
this cyber Security Professionals are
hired to work on identifying cyber
threats and securing a company's Network
there are multiple job roles in the
field of cyber security if hacking
fascinates you then the role of an
ethical hacker is something to be EXP
explored such professionals try to exp
Network's vulnerabilities just like how
a hacker would do but only to identify
those vulnerabilities and resolve them
for protection against an actual Cyber
attack but if you are looking to design
robust security structures then the role
of a security architect is more apt a
chief information security officer ciso
plays a crucial role in Enterprise
security and is entrusted with the
overall safety of the information in an
organization
so here's a question for you identify
the type of Cyber attack where the
hacker system takes over the client's IP
address a DDOS attack B man in the-
Middle attack c fishing attack d
password attack give it a thought and
leave your answers in the comment
section below three lucky winners will
receive Amazon gift vouchers with the
increase in the production of global
Digital Data it is anticip ated that
cyber attacks will quadruple in the near
future organizations are going to need
cyber security professionals who can
prevent these attacks a career in the
field of cyber security is lucrative and
a very smart decision for professionals
now we humans are highly techsavvy in
today's times with the extensive use of
the internet and modern Technologies
there is a massive challenge in
protecting all our Digital Data such as
net banking information account
credentials and medical reports to name
a few have you heard about the deadly
one to cry ransomware attack the attack
happened in May 2017 in Asia and then it
spread across the world within a day
more than 230,000 computers were
infected across 150 countries the one
cry Cryptor encrypted the data and
locked the users out of their systems
for decryption of the data the users
were asked for a ransom of $300 to $600
in Bitcoin the users who used the
unsupported version of Microsoft Windows
and those who hadn't installed the
security update of April 2017 were
targeted in this attack the one a cry
attack took a toll on every sector top
tier organizations like Itachi Nissan
and FedEx had to put their businesses on
hold as their systems were affected too
now this is what you call a Cyber attack
to prevent such attacks cyber security
is implemented we can Define cyber
security as the practice of protecting
networks programs computer systems and
their components from unauthorized
digital attacks these illegal attacks
are often referred to as hacking hacking
refers to exploiting weaknesses in a
computer network to obtain unauthorized
access to information a hacker is a
person who tries to hack into computer
systems this is a misconception that
hacking is always wrong there are
hackers who work with different motives
let's have a look at three different
types of hackers
black hat hackers are individuals who
illegally hack into a system for a
monetary gain on the contrary we have
white hat hackers who exploit the
vulnerabilities in a system by hacking
into it with permission in order to
defend the organization this form of
hacking is absolutely legal and ethical
hence they are also often referred to as
ethical hackers in addition to these
hackers we also have the gray hat
hackers as the name suggests the color
gray is a blend of both white and black
these hackers discover vulnerabilities
in a system and report it to the
system's owner which is a good act but
they do this without seeking the owner's
approval sometimes gry hat hackers also
ask for money in return for the spotted
vulnerabilities now that you have seen
the different types of hackers let's
understand more about the hacking that
is legal and valid ethical hacking
through an interesting story Dan runs a
Trading Company he does online training
with the money his customers invest
everything was going well and Dan's
business was booming until a hacker
decided to hack the company's servers
the hacker stole the credentials of
various trading accounts he asked for a
lump some Ransom in exchange for the
stolen credentials Dan took the Hacker's
words lightly and didn't pay the hacker
as a result the hacker withdrew money
from various customers accounts and Dan
was liable to pay back the customers Dan
lost a lot of money and also the trust
of his customers after this incident Dan
gave a lot of thought as to what could
have gone wrong with the security
infrastructure in his company he wished
there was someone from his company who
could have run a test attack to see how
vulnerable systems were before the
hacker penetrated into the network this
was when he realized he needed an
employee who thinks like a hacker and
identifies the vulnerabilities in his
Network before an outsider does to do
this job he hired an ethical hacker John
John was a skilled professional who
worked precisely like a hacker in no
time he spotted several vulnerabilities
in Dan's organization and closed all the
loopholes hiring an ethical hacker
helped Dan protect his customers from
further attacks in the future this in
turn increased the company's
productivity and guarded the company's
reputation so now you know hacking is
not always bad John in this scenario
exposed the vulnerabilities in the
existing Network and such hacking is
known as ethical hacking ethical hacking
is distributed into six different phases
let us look at these phases step by step
with respect to how Jon our ethical
hacker will act before launching an
attack the first step Jon takes is to
gather all the necessary information
about the organization's system that he
intends to attack this step is called
reconnaissance he uses tools like inmap
and hping for this purpose Jon then
tries to spot the vulnerabilities if any
in the Target system using tools like
inmap and nexos this is the scanning
phase now that he has located the
vulnerabilities he then tries to exploit
them this step is known as gaining
access after John makes his way through
the organization's networks he tries to
maintain his access for future attacks
by installing back doors in the Target
system the metas sploit tool helps him
with this this phase is called
maintaining access JN is a brilliant
hacker hence he tries his best not to
leave any evidence of his attack this is
the fifth phase clearing tracks we now
have the last phase that is reported in
this phase JN documents a summary of his
entire attack the vulnerabilities he
spotted the tools he used and the
success rate of the attack looking into
the report Dan is now able to take a
call and see how to protect his
organization from any external cyber
attacks don't you all think Jon is an
asset to any organization if you want to
become an ethical hacker like Jon then
there are a few skills that you need to
acquire first and foremost you need to
have a good knowledge of operating
environments such as Windows Linux Unix
and Macintosh you must have reasonably
good knowledge of programming languages
such as HTML PHP python SQL and
JavaScript networking is the base of
ethical hacking hence you should be good
at it ethical hackers should be well
aware of security laws so that they
don't misuse their skills finally you
must have a global certification on
ethical hacking to successfully bag a
position of an ethical hacker like John
few examples of ethical hacking
certification are certified ethical
hacker certification C CompTIA pentest
plus and licensed penetration tester
certification to name a few simply learn
provides a cyber security expert Masters
program that will equip you with all the
skills required by a cyber security
expert you could have a look at it by
clicking the link in the description so
here's a question for you in which phase
of ethical hacking will you install back
doors in the Target system a scanning B
maintaining access C clearing tracks D
reconnaissance give it a thought and
leave your answers in the comments
section below three lucky winners will
receive Amazon gift vouchers the endless
growth of Technologies in this area is
directly proportional to the number of
cyber crimes cyber crimes are estimated
to cost $6 trillion in 2021 hence to
tackle these cyber crimes organizations
are continuously on the lookout for
cyber Security Professionals the average
annual salary of a certified ethical
hacker is $91,000 in the US and
approximately RUP seven laks in India so
what are you waiting for get certified
and become an ethical hacker like John
and put an end to the cyber attacks in
the world let's do the basics first and
then we'll come to the point of
discussion right so let's move on to our
topic of the evening and our first
domain Enterprise infrastructure
security all right uh we discussing
about risk management so let's start the
tonight's topic uh and uh proceed right
so we'll be discussing about risk
management in the information security
where you'll understand the concepts of
cyber security the CIA tried uh we'll
enumerate various factors involving risk
management uh we'll be able to uh
understand the definition between
quantitive and qualitative risk analysis
and also categorize various type of
security control method right and uh
normally we start with a scenario all
right we start with the scenario and the
scenario is you have joined a major
corporation as a cyber security
specialist in your new role as a cyber
security specialist you must help in
securing the organization's Information
Systems right that's your job as a cyber
security expert a specialist now your
job enters in protecting systems from
cyber risk threats and vulnerabilities
by monitoring and detecting uh
investigating analyzing and responding
to security events like Insurance events
so uh the task uh you have been given
are identify the potential threats uh to
the organizations CRI assets identify
one liabilities to organization assets
determine risks uh and for identify risk
perform something known as risk analysis
and recommend appropriate responses this
is what you'll be learning uh on the job
as we proceed the basics first uh what
is cyber security very simple everyone
of us knows it refers to the process of
securing sensitive data and critical
systems from cyber threats right we'll
cover what is a threat what is sensitive
data what is vulnerabilities exploits as
we proceed in our discussions right uh
the goal is to protect the
confidentiality integrity and
availability we'll cover C I tried that
is c i c stands for confidentiality I
stands for integrity a stands for
availability of a organizations critical
Assets Now the assets would be your
networks your computers your programs
your data your human being your
facilities anything is an asset for an
organization you agree with me all of
you what is an asset in an organization
anything which is a property of an
organization anything which gives uh
helps boost the organizations uh
productivity per right understood right
right so that is the goal of cyber secur
to protect the organization allow it to
flourish continue doing business right
so let's come to our Blackboard and I
will start
our topic discussions the first topic uh
will be discussing about
security and risk management
right would you want everything in white
or would you prefer a red font how does
it
look white or red font your choice white
is
better okay great thank
you so I intend to share this with you
once uh every session is complete yeah
jues is f wonderful okay uh white
background is it or black background
with white font this is what I do I use
black background with white font but I
can always change it no problem you can
I have it like this also the white
background with black font good let's
start with our discussion so what I do
normally okay let's have the
introductory discussions yeah okay let's
start with security and risk management
so I'll give you the introduction then
we'll uh move on further uh uh on our
topics right so let's have this
discussion completed okay what is the
issue right so information
security and risk management are
analogous with each
other
analogous with each other this is how I
will create notes share it with you at
the end of the day now as you see in uh
it is clear I we can increase the font a
bit more for for all of us to see have a
better look right the security and risk
management domain forms the Baseline for
all information security Concepts and
practices now in this topic we'll be
focusing on
Concepts and key
areas such as the asset
protection confidentiality integrity and
availability
security governance and
principles
compliance legal and Regulatory issues
that pertain to information security in
the global
context professional
ethics personal security
policies risk management
principles threat
modeling business continuity
planning security risk considerations in
acquisition strategy and
practice security education training and
awareness right at the primary this is
what we'll be covering throughout as we
proceed right so we'll be discussing all
of these one by one now uh this is
something uh which I'm covering through
my own notes uh through my understanding
of what I have learned throughout the
years right so uh remember this is the
Practical part of it which we are
discussing you'll have to go back and
understand it uh during the weekend or
week whenever you are let's start with
an
illustration so let's start with an
illustration let me get my pen activated
there is uh please allow me a minute so
that I can set up my white
pen and writer I'm just give I think I
missed the connector somewhere okay
great so let's start with a particular
illustration I think I will do one thing
I can't find my pen as of now so I can
create over here itself let's draw
shapes and type it there itself so uh
first thing I will cover the topics one
by one black yeah asset
insert so consider
this
asset I'll have to I want to get this
book over here right yeah so consider an
asset in an organization right now uh we
will cover the definition let me
complete the diagram and I'll explain it
to you what do you mean by asset and why
we need to discuss on it right so
there's asset then uh when you have an
asset you need to protect the asset
right you need to protect so assets as I
said can be a human resource can be
computers can be your facilities can be
anything right
uh
let's understand an
asset
basically
requires protection so let's copy this
get it over here okay I'm creating a
diagram for ease of
understanding oh yeah I think this
should be good yeah so it needs
protection once the diagram is ready we
can talk about it in Greater
detail right now this protection will be
based on something and what is that
something what is that something is okay
the cia8 fired which we'll be discussing
in our topic ahead so the protection has
to be based on let's have this thing
again
based we need
requires
requires this thing requires
protection and this protection will be
based on shapes do I have a triangle
yeah will be based on the C I a Triad
which is C stands
for uh let's make it
bigger Okay C stands for confident
confidentiality right can I copy this uh
and the a stands for
availability uh yeah it would have been
easier I did find the find the pen but
connector to my
yeah so a stands for
availability uh there's an i over here
so let's
have an i which says it is
integrity we'll be covering all these
terminology so those who have are
confused not sure what is happening do
not worry we'll cover it right this is
your CIA Triad this is your CIA Triad so
understand we have a asset which
requires protection and this protection
will be based
on
the is based on the CI trial right so
important remember so let's have this
color coded for
e and actually I'm beautifying it
nothing else so right
so that's it make this as green so that
you can see it
better green right so you have an asset
it needs protection the protection will
be based on the CIA R right now what is
an asset at the onset what is an asset
asset is it's not straight let's make it
treat an asset is nothing but let me
make it here we increase the arrows
length so that I can add here and what
is an
asset yeah uh asset is your Hardware
software information people personal let
me see how can I get it here oh
interesting okay so your physical
Hardware now this is creating trouble
for me I don't know uh it should have
worked normally it does but I normally
make these diagrams using my pen I never
use this so this is what is causing the
issue and if I type it is typing
somewhere
else yeah so like I said uh and uh I
assume we are out of the
initial issues right so let's start so
like I said uh the asset uh which we
were discussing what is an asset is a
asset is nothing but your Hardware
so your
software right then it could
be so it could be your uh people right
and information right all of them are
considered to be Assets Now this is yes
everything is an asset your facilities
also can be called an asset so assets
can Hardware software people information
and as is the case soer all of them will
require will require excuse
me yeah all of them will require
protection all of them will require
protection okay so uh we need to protect
it now we've already talked the
protection will be based on RC I
confidentiality integrity and
availability say right so let's uh this
oh excuse
me is
misbehaving no interesting it is not
allowing me to delete this is the line
visible okay you are also able to see
this line which has come up
right okay yeah my apology is the you it
should not have happened like
that interesting it is a
glitch okay now let's move on further
and we'll discuss it if the issue comes
up now this CIA will primarily be given
uh or will be decided based on certain
certain other aspects right and those
aspects would be your
security
security compliance we'll cover this so
uh you'll understand it better
compliance and policies all right so
this CIA will will be primarily based on
security compliance and policies now
again this
also will be ensured through the CIA
will be ensured through let me move it a
bit like this can I just use it like
this yeah it will be Ensure
to
ensured
through security
governance
security
governance
right
and through
compliance compliance this will be
demonstrated through compliance right
now uh
understand uh let's get these boxes in
place so here it
is yeah just trying to get everything in
place um second blocks is the compliance
box over here and we'll make it slightly
looking
right
yeah okay here it is excuse me yeah
coming back to our discussion understand
this security
governance will be driven through
compliance so this security governance
will be driven through
compliance
so
driven
through compliance okay so as of now
most of you must be feeling that this is
all jish but we'll cover it as we
proceed so don't worry right so uh this
is a diagram which we'll be referring
regularly hence I'm creating the diagram
over here right now this compliance will
be
primarily based on certain aspects such
as so the compliance will be based on
certain things which will'll be covering
one by one that is legislations or
regulatory uh so let's say
legislative
legis
ative then
regulatory
regulatory
privacy related
issues right privacy related issues
right
uh
also uh it will be for example let's say
it will be based on pcss now we'll cover
what is pcss as we proceed regulations
Hippa or
gdpr
gdpr right so we cover this as we
proceed Now understand uh the most
important thing we need to understand is
an asset it is Hardware software people
information facility everything and all
of it right now this asset needs to be
protected right the asset needs to be
protected and this protection will be
based on confidentiality integrity and
availability right now this CI a will be
demonstrated using compliance which is
primarily based on legislative
regulatory privacy related issues and
regulations and uh the security
governance will ensure it right now what
is security governance it is nothing but
management practices right standards
policies
procedures that is security governance
so a few things to be remembered over
here where here it is so remember
security governance is nothing
but
management
practices right then it will be your
standards
policies and
procedures procedures we'll cover the
definition uh after this right you
should remember that security governance
in can be ensured by proper management
practices standards policies and
procedures right basically this complete
stuff will give you or will
provide
insights I need to slow down
insights into something known as
security controls the protection me
mechanisms right your uh personal
security and
professional
ethics all
right okay now go all of this in is
interrelated hence we are covering it
like that now this particular aspect
of security controls excuse me I
select
yeah all these aspect of security
controls personal security professional
ethics will
be controlled by or can be ad
using your
compliance right we'll be adhering this
using adhering this using compliance
right now each term we be exping
explaining as we proceed ahead so don't
get confused right so this will
be
AED dear through right security
compliance okay is the diagram clear
right is the diagram clear asset needs
protection asset is nothing but Hardware
software people information uh
protection will be done through the use
of
CIA uh compliance Integrity
availability okay uh this is primarily
okay one more box we'll create so that I
can differentiate otherwise my
handwriting
is okay here it is so yeah now this comp
CIA will be basically based on security
compliance and policies right now you
can ensure the CIA by ensuring you have
proper security governance which is
management practices standards policies
and
procedures and this can be demonstrated
using compliance all right and
compliance can be added through security
controls personal security and
professional ethics right this is what
we are covering all in all in this
particular topic right so let's move on
with the explanation for each topic
mentioned over here any questions so far
anything you would like to understand
anything which you like to discuss right
now we can discuss if you have any
questions we'll be covering
it
okay yeah anything you like to discuss
now please go ahead no wonderful
wonderful so let's come back to our
primary
discussion and here we
begin uh yes I will share the topic
notes uh d with you I will share this
particular page
itself this particular page I will be
sharing with you so do not worry uh I'll
share this document you can ask you can
go through this document whenever you
want and now we have a few questions
we'll address the questions one by one
so normally what I do is uh good the get
the questions here itself so let's
say can I
just give me a second I am setting up
the question so all questions which will
be discussed we add it here itself so
that I can talk about it and give you uh
an Insight so now all those questions
which will be answered uh for the topic
will be here so the first question is
who does the rule uh the question is who
decides the question is from caution
right so let me
just paste
it text only right so the question is
who does uh who decides okay the
spelling okay that does not matter who
decides the rule of
compliance okay so here's the answer for
you uh let me
dictate so the rules of compliance
are typically determined by a
combination
of regulatory
bodies industry standards
organizations governmental agencies and
sometimes International
agreements does that answer your
question
C information in asset means what so the
question
is what information asset means okay so
let me give you the answer on it now
information asset typically refers to
data and knowledge that is contained
within an
organization right so let's talk about a
bit
more now this particular aspect of
information can be either
tangible or or
intangible owned by individuals or an
organization right now this information
can take various forms and is often
critical to the functioning of an
asset uh there
are various types of Assets in case of
information intellectual property
uh Financial
assets physical
assets digital
assets human
capital do you understand if you talk
about information all these can be
called as assets which are either
tangible or intangible what is tangible
or intangible tangible is something
which you can touch intangible which
cannot be touched right like the air you
know it is there but you cannot touch it
same uh if you want to touch a tree it
is there both are
assets okay now how can we ensure that
the Integrity is maintained as per a CIA
now this is a uh topic which will be
discussing in our integrity uh
discussions per se but I can give you an
introduction on it right I can give you
an introduction on it and what is it
about now maintaining
Integrity maintaining
Integrity as a part of the CIA
Triad in information security is crucial
for ensuring that the data remains
accurate trustworthy and
unaltered uh this can be achieved by
strategies such
as data
encryption Access Control
data
validation audit
trials Version
Control uh security training and
awareness backup and
recovery so let's start with our topic
discuss so we address questions now
we'll uh work on the
uh ter terminologies which we used over
here one by one now important things to
remember important
points to remember
here okay let's understand this one by
one the first point assets
require
protection right so this is me typing
now uh there was too many typos
happening second
protection is based
on the
requirements of
confidentiality
integrity and
availability right for the
asset uh
security is
ured
through security
governance that
compromises comprises rather
management
practices and
management and
management
oversight right
security is
demonstrated
through
compliance that
could be
legal or
regulatory in
nature let's try this
now compliance consists of adherence to
applicable legal and regulatory
requirements uh applicable
policies
standards procedures and
guidelines and personal Securities and
policies
also comp Lance can be affected by
security
issues now these are some of the
important points which we should
remember before we understand each topic
separately right before we understand
the complete terminologies which we saw
until now right so as you see over here
we talked about this diagram as an
introductory nature in this diagram we
need to understand these important
points and topics right this is
something which will allow you to better
understand what is happening and why are
we looking into this particular aspect
right in the diagram this is important
you should remember right so let's
proceed with our further
discussion right wherein we'll be
defining each of the topics one by one
over here so the first
thing let me just cover this question
for for you I will not number it I think
numbering would be difficult let's have
the questioned over here so is Cia
tried company or organization specific I
should have asked you this question but
let's do it this
way now the CIA
Triad uh is not specific to any
particular company or organization
instead it is a fund mental Concept in
information
security that applies universally across
various Industries sectors and
organizations also the CIA trial
basically provides a framework for
understanding and addressing the core
objectives of information
security and these core objectives
are
confidentiality integrity and
availability these will be discussed as
we proceed
ahead
yeah all right so I think not many typos
this should work right so uhin doesn't
answer question it is not organization
specific at the onset wonderful your
question is addressed and put into the
notes for ease of
understanding of everyone now uh can you
give an example of security governance
can you give an example of security
governance is slightly jumping the gun
but I can give an example uh let's
say let's say let me think of an example
for you I will not type it I will just
explain it to you like this now let's
consider an example of a banking
industry yes you belong to which
industry are you working or are you a
student let's I'm just asking it so that
I can uh it'll be easy for me to
discuss yeah working in which industry
are you now let's consider an example of
uh security governance in the banking
industry per or the sector now if you
talk about
confidentiality or uh uh in case of the
banking industry ensuring
confidentiality would be Paramount for
protecting the customers and sensitive
information right because it is
financial now Banks Implement various
measures such as the encryption access
control and authentication mechanisms to
prevent unauthorized access to customer
accounts and transaction data right so
for example online bank banking platform
will use uh secure web uh communication
right secure connection connection on
https yeah so you'll be using https
connectivity and multiactor
authentication to ensure that only
authorized users can access this account
that is confidentiality if you talk
about integrity you're basically
maintaining the Integrity of financial
transactions by having check sums
digital signatures right to basically
verify the electronic transactions and
availability would be ensuring that when
a customer wants to access the banking
platform the online banking platform it
is available whenever it is demanded
without interruption the that is the CIA
now in this example security governance
in the banking industry will incorporate
the principles of the CIA to protect the
customer data maintain the Integrity
ensure the availability by placing
requisite processes mechanisms standard
operating processes your guidelines and
policies in place so you have to
implement the CIA protect the CIA having
a certain set of what what did we call
processes practices mechanism standards
guidelines in place and we'll cover
those definition as we yeah uh Zarin
your question is answered okay let's
let's proceed with the uh topic which we
were discussing let's start with asset
what is an asset so we discussed about
asset but we need to CL clearly
understand what do we understand by the
asset and
uh what all does an asset compromise of
right so let's proceed does that okay
now this is something which always
happens I'm just checking it and it has
again
happen okay yeah yeah it is
now uh asset can be
tangible that is perceptible by
touch uh an example of a tangible asset
could be a desktop computer or a
laptop assets can be intangible
also uh which are basically not
physically present you cannot touch it
for example uh corporate image or
intellectual property such as the
patents are intangible
assets clear so far so T assets are
tangible and intangible tangible is
basically what you can touch what you
can uh uh perceive uh with a touch right
intangible is something which is
understood we cannot just touch it
right now assets are used by the
organization for business purposes a
business
processes every asset whether tangible
or intangible has a certain intrinsic
value to the
business the value can be
monetary or of
importance or of both
for
example a simple firewall that cost less
than 10,000
$110,000 may be protecting important
business applications worth millions of
dollars is that understood so uh let's
take an example over here for example if
you have the Coca-Cola as an
organization right what is the most
unique selic Point wonderful see sh and
me are thinking on the same line so he's
given the same example of Coca-Cola
which has Coke as a primary uh what do
you say uh product which they sell right
and it it has a unique formula which is
kept secret for very very long now if
your server which is bought for say ,000
$10,000 has this formula kept inside the
server server itself is$ 10,000 but the
formula is worth millions of dollars
right so what is the server is the
tangible asset what is the data which
has the formula is a intangible asset
right so every asset whether it is
tangible or intangible you have value
Associated to it and the value will be
based on either monetary or
or uh the intrinsic value of the uh
asset per right so it is important for
the organization that is what you should
understand the weather
is
right right I think that's the right
weather yeah okay understood why asset
and how asset is important how you
should understand uh an organization may
get affected now if this particular
Coca-Cola's formula Coke formula is lost
as in it is available on the dark web
whaton Coca-Cola lose its unique selling
point it's competitive advantage in the
market will they will
right yeah they will right you agree
with me all of
you yeah so you should remember this is
what is an asset and when you have an
asset it needs to be protected if you
don't protect an asset you will lose it
and if you lose it that compromise may
get you out of the business you may file
for bankruptcy the organization May file
for bankruptcy right so that is why we
need to protect the
asset so if an asset is
compromised for example stolen or
modified and that data or secret
information is
disclosed it will have an impact that
could lead to monit
loss customer
dissatisfaction and or legal and
Regulatory
non-compliance right so this is what is
a problem you may have loss of customers
uh uh loss of money you may loss uh
regulatory issues may come up you'll be
fined you'll be punished there'll be
penalties as an organization that is
something which will cause a lot of
issue question
says yeah I'll do that yeah thank you
can you please explain how people are an
asset
now uh see understand the people are the
most valuable assets within an
organization
because uh they have skills knowledge
experience creativity and relationship
that employee possesses which will
contribute significantly to the success
and competitiveness of the
organization now anything which
contributes to the organization success
is considered as
a uh asset
so yeah so when you talk about uh human
beings right uh and how information
skills of the workforce can be
considered it can be considered under
say intellectual Capital right that is
collective knowledge expertise skills of
an employees similarly Innovative
Innovation and creativity can be
considered uh such that when employees
are able to innovate generate ideas
right uh customer relationship uh again
employees often develop very very strong
customer relationship let me just put it
in the bullet points ohya itself so
let's talk one by one on these so first
one is uh
intellectual
Capital so this is where the collective
knowledge expertise and skills of the
employees will represent intellectual
cap
capital uh Innovation and
creativity where employees basically uh
the ability of an employee to innovate
generate new ideas and solve complex
problems again can can be considered as
a critical asset for an organization
particularly where the industries are uh
or the industry have a rapid changing
scenario technology is changing
regularly right so that is where
employee can be considered or human
being can be considered as an
asset right so this is where you need to
understand why human being is considered
an asset right similarly uh you will
have customer relationship where in a
lot of organizations have employees
directly in touch with the customers now
customers trust these employees uh they
prefer to talk to these employees this
is where customer relationship and the
this is where your employee becomes a uh
asset right you cannot let go the asset
because you may even lose the customer
and even your organization culture comes
into play and that culture basically uh
uh
significantly uh what do you
say prefers the employees to be trained
in a certain way to be addressed in a
certain way making them an asset which
is which becomes indispensable or at
least a big time uh have big time
importance to the organization yeah
doesn't answer your question
Z okay why do you consider them an asset
because there are a lot of things which
they handle and this is uh all these
things which they handle can be
considered
as something which allows the
organization to grow in Long term right
okay until it types let's
proceed now assets are basically uh
grouped or generally grouped in a
certain uh certain ways and so how are
assets
generally
grouped so let's have this one by one so
first one is physical assets so let me
uh tell you what are physical assets So
Physical assets again are tangible in
nature and are examples could be say
um your
buildings
buildings
uh
Furniture
right uh HVAC systems
HVAC systems
right uh and so on so forth right so
these are considered as assets which are
physical in nature or physical assets
right so these are how you
can group Assets in various segments one
is physical let's move to the next one
which is Hardware
asset Hardware Assets Now when you talk
about Hardware assets these are in
information security per if you talk
about
examples it would include your
servers desktops or desktop
computers
laptops
laptops
router
network
cables and so on so forth yeah so these
are the hardware Assets in information
security per so you are you can
differentiate your assets based on this
so we understanding what are the
different groupings of assets we talked
about physical we talk about Hardware
now the next one logically will come as
software
asset what are software assets okay
these are intangible assets if you can
refer to software as a intangible assets
right now uh these basically uh can be
utilized or are utilized organization by
having licenses right yeah licenses or
your intellectual property can be uh
considered over here uh uh let's example
would
be your operating system OS your dbms
database management system right uh
office
applications you procuring it you do not
have uh you do not have your own system
you're buying it under license to be
utilized then your web
servers web
servers uh server softwares as we call
it
softwares right and so on so forth can
be considered as software assets clear
so
far yeah ad says the same product may
cause loss to other company Coca-Cola
example very true
right so those
are software assets right now another
group or another classification of
assets could be
information
information
assets assets right so if you talk about
information assets again these are
intangible in nature and they are owned
by an organization now this is these are
not
owned but licensed right
licensed right in this case these are
owned by the
organization right so example could be
your business
processes business
processes organizations business
processes then uh
policies
procedures
procedures
um customer
information right uh personal
information then uh agreements
[Music]
and
formulas
which are
developed inh
house inh house right those
are so now uh developed in-house or even
purchase so they are holding them after
purchasing right those are your
information assets clear so far physical
Hardware information
uh software and personal and the last
one is
personal
assets now uh these are basically people
associated
with associated with the
organization right for
example your employees
contractors uh maybe
vendors third party
Consultants right um what
else okay maybe these all few more will
come up here and there so these are your
personal
assets personal assets right got it so
you can group your assets into following
classification physical Hardware
software information and personal all
these are important clear so far and
interestingly
after let's talk about asset now that we
know what is an asset let's talk about
asset
protection right so now if you remember
in our diagram we made an asset and say
it needs to be protected because it is
an asset so asset
protection we talk about asset
protection and what is it about in
information security
domain asset protection involves
security management practices that are
subjected to business and compliance
requirements such practice for asset
protection are called security
controls various types of security
controls would
be physical entry controls to an office
building that allow only authorized
persons monitoring controls such as CCTV
for surveillance of critical
assets right so you have various
protection mechanisms and those prot
protection mechanisms are referring to
physically stopping someone monitoring
it using
CCTV uh controls such as locks for
Hardware asset for protection from
theft uh tamper proofing controls such
as hashing and encryption for for
software and data
assets copyrights are patent for
information access to protect legal
rights identity management systems to
protect personal assets from identity
theft all these are various controls or
prote protection mechanisms in place
right so now when you have an asset we
need to protect that asset for
protecting asset there are various
implementation which can be done a few I
have listed over here yeah now we should
understand that these are not
comprehensive list of security controls
it is now this list is an adhoc list as
of now so it will be basically decided
now this kind of asset protection
mechanism will basically be decided on
uh risk uh risk analysis your evaluation
of the risk assessment of the risk right
similarly controls will be identified
through risk mitigation strategies risk
assessment risk uh uh what do you say uh
decision of risk based on management
policy and this is where your analysis
of risk management or risk management
procedures will come into play so asset
prote
requires or has a requirement that it
would be based on risk in order to
understand the risk we will have to
understand risk assessment and select
the control based on the uh risk
analysis which is done right so we'll be
discussing this based on the
confidentiality integrity and
availability concept so uh if you have a
software be it open source or whatever
and it is being utilized to uh say uh uh
create value for business
okay anything which creates value will
be considered an asset remember that if
be it open source right now when you
talk about offens Source you can
categorize it into say software assets
right you're not owning it but you can
use it and when you use it you are
trying to look for value does that is
that uh underst ad is saying open source
software is not included in this assets
we can include it I have not made it
comprehensive
you can add a lot of things into it you
just I give you an understanding of an
asset
okay okay all right so where are we uh
since I'm talking a lot about risk
management let me give you a small
introduction of risk assess uh
management before we proceed for our
discussions on uh the CIA the
confidentiality integrity and
availability now what why am I uh
referring to it always it's where's my
connection this is something which is
important understand when you sit for
interviews for your uh as a say GRC
professional for cyber security what is
GRC stands for governance risk and
compliance
GRC right governance risk and compliance
you'll be asked such questions so you
have first job in Risk Management uh
would be to something known as inventor
inv when
teriz assets so you will basically make
a list of assets held by an organization
these assets will be
prioritized
prioritized now these will be based on
what uh the prior will be done on
something known as business impact
analysis the
impact uh this as will have if it's
compromised in fact if asset is
compromised do you understand it now
when shya said that Coca-Cola is an
asset you list out the asset now if the
Coca-Cola's asset Coca-Cola's formula is
lost then what will happen you'll have a
big impact on the organization now that
impact is what will decide the priority
of an asset for an organization once
your assets are invent
you will understand the uh value of the
assets uh compromise based on something
known
as
quantitative
and
qualitative analysis we'll cover this in
our future
discussions these analysis will allow us
to get something known as a dollar value
for your asset for asset right and what
will be the issue in case they are
compromised once we have these dollar
values with us then based on this value
uh we will be
based based on these
calculations we will select controls
we
will
select
controls right controls controls are
what protective mechanisms now in case
Coca-Cola's formula you can say controls
can
be controls can
be
encryption yeah Access Control
Access Control right your say
cctvs your uh guard
dogs right these are controls protective
mechanisms right and once the controls
are in place we cannot stop over there
we'll have to
review the
controls
periodically periodically
because it may so happen after a certain
time period these controls may not be
effective or the data may not require
that of
protection okay this is where your
complete structure of uh Asset
Management asset Security Management and
risk management comes into play now this
is a this is in incr the risk management
discussion which we are going to right
this is the introduction I have given
you so don't worry uh just take it as
I've shown you and I'll give you an
example let's say uh let's connect all
these steps as asked over here let's say
uh in the example stick an example of
our friend Coca-Cola right coca cocaa
right Coco Cola and their formula for
Coca-Cola now if you consider this
formula as your
asset what would you do you will think
that first question in when you sit for
analysis of a risk with respect to uh
this formula is that
uh who firstly
uh what is the
threat
associated with
this
asset right so now you tell me what
threat is associated with this formula
exactly
breach of uh data right breach of data
uh is a
threat uh now if this next question to
be addressed if you know what is the uh
threat
Associated if you know what is the
threat Associated which is breach of
data then you need to un answer next
question how much
loss how much much loss will happen if
this is loss if this happens if this
things becomes successful or you can
call it
as
if the
risk
materializes
materializes then what is the case right
so if you now know that the asset is
Coca-Cola's formula the threat is breach
of data then you will know the weakness
now what is this this is the weakness or
vulnerability vulnerability you know the
vulnerability you know the threat right
once you know the vulnerability the
weakness and the threat and you need to
understand the impact it will have on
the business find out the dollar value
so you'll have to calculate the dollar
value based on say what do you feel
about it what will happen to the
business we will say I feel I know that
the business will be be out of uh I mean
it will it won't be able to function we
will lose competitive advantage that is
known as
quanti or sorry that is known as
qualitative
analysis what you feel about it the
feeling of it yeah so impact is high
medium or low what is called impact
would be
high medium
or low and at the same time you can also
use another calculative method which is
known
as
quantitive analysis now you'll use
analysis this is where you'll use
mathematics and get something known as
dollar value so you know that there will
be a $10 million loss in case this
formula is lost I'm just G your ad hoc
number what do you get you get the
understanding what is the impact on the
business now you know that based on this
value
now
based on this
value we now
know
what will
happen if
this as asset is
lost right we know right understood we
know this right that if this asset is
loss was calculated it we understood it
now based on that you will select a
select
a
protective
mechanism to
protect this asset
asset understood is that
understood say we have the formula
coming up when we come to this is just a
generalized discussion you have we have
the formula coming up right so now we
know for example let's say when I said
uh when I said the
loss or the value of this comp asset is
said $10 million right10 million now you
will Pro protect put a control put a
control
which will not cost or which will be
less than the loss of uh compromise as
in we want something which is costing us
or saving us from this loss and does not
cost itself uh $10 million and more the
the cost of the control as is the case
over here right so we select something
which is saving on the uh compromise and
also not costing us us that much so if
by any chance the cost of the control is
higher than the compromise itself the
management will not approve you
understand that right if cost of
control is greater
than
loss
after compromise as in let's say if the
data is lost I lose $10 but in order to
protect the data I need $100 will the
management approve it
yes will the manager approve
it Senior Management will approve it is
it no right financially economically
does not make a sense that's the reason
you put a control if the control is
within now that this is again with
respect to risk strategy this is where
so you'll think of risk strategy in this
case so you will either uh excuse me
strategy you will either
accept risk
R mitigate
risk uh avoid
risk right except mitigate avoid and
what is it another
one uh accept mitigate avoid what is the
fourth one anyone
knows transfer very nice transfer thank
you so what is accept I accept that this
is loss is going to happen I do not
intend to do anything mitigate I will
reduce the levels of the impact I will
reduce the impact aoid I'll just totally
leave it and transfer I'll basically do
an insurance something like that okay
that is where risk strategy come into
place okay so the control in this case
will be placed will be
encryption uh of the formula uh
guards
dogs
CCTV uh building with
control everything yeah so on so forth
understood is it I just ran through the
example to explain it but we'll be
covering it as we proceed in the session
what we understood last time was about
risk management we understood what is
the cyber security before we proceed uh
further uh how many of you are
proficient in Linux have been handling
lenux operating system uh wherein you
can do uh commands on the terminal
uh maybe run an application to uh
scanning and all through the terminal
how many of you are uh proficient
internet right so this is your Ki Linux
machine which you'll be using now that
Ki is up uh excuse me let me just
complete a few Theory things once the
theory is complete uh we'll be
discussing uh Linux today primarily uh
the command line uh of Linux terminal
and how you navigate around the Linux
machines okay I'm setting a small 15
questions Linux quiz for all of you
which we'll be running now just to
understand about Linux uh comfort of
your
people uh the class code just a sec I'll
share it uh we'll have this quiz running
right now
Linux
Basics plus uh create a
and then we log in just use the uh the
class code is given on your url can you
see the URL if I just use your own uh if
on your screen can you see on this part
of the URL uh you have the class code
mentioned that you can
use uh at the answer just login Linux
basics
uh one
sec uh the class code ganga you're
already a part of the class right oh the
link expired no problem I'll share it
with
so uh we talked about CIA Triad uh the
confidentiality integrity and
availability as such uh how it needs to
be
protected uh we understood the CIA Tri
we understood what is confidentiality
Integrity availability and the attacks
on them uh basically uh each threat each
particular uh uh what you say the pillar
of cyber security that is the
confidentiality integrity and
availability has various threats
Associated to it uh those will be
intentional attacks primarily the man in
the middle attacks the packet sniffing
attacks the hacking attacks there could
be accidental leakage through UNT
employees right someone who is
misconfigured something right there
could be issues with authentication
authorization and failures okay because
there's lack of lease privilege need to
know there could be Hardware or software
failures that's a threat to the
confidentiality again how do you protect
yourself if there's an issue for uh if
there's a threat to to the
confidentiality you encrypt you ensure
there's Access Control mechanisms in
place you have administrative controls
now the biggest example of
administrative controls is the
documentation which is done the various
uh agreements which are done for example
when you join a new
organization normally you sign something
known as uh the acceptable use policy
how many of you have signed a acceptable
use policy and a non-disclosure policy
in an organization just say yes on the
chat if I have right Sha has done it
Niha Leander everyone has seen now what
is this this is basically a
administrative control a counter measure
a protection mechanism in order to
protect the organization against breach
of confidentiality right so that is a
administrative control okay uh rest all
is very clear right then comes Integrity
as we all know Integrity is something
wherein we do not want unauthorized
changes to data by unauthorized or
authorized users now remember one very
interesting fact about integrity
Integrity is to be protected at any
given moment for either the data at rest
or the data in transit data at rest
which stored with you which has which is
archived with you or the organization
and data at uh Transit data in motion is
something wherein data is moving on the
network that Network could be internet
that Network could be intranet right and
it has to be protected anyone anyone
does anything as an if it's an
authorized user making unauthorized
changes that is not should not happen if
it's an unauthorized user obviously they
should not be uh allowed to do any
changes to the data that is integrity
and the protection required for it I've
already covered the threat there should
not be accidental modification uh there
should not be intentional
alteration uh another threat is system
malfunction now sometimes your system
just crashes and it causes uh what do
you call it but your basically there's a
corruption in the data that is system
malfunction issue and there could be
environmental factors now if you have a
uh hard disk which is a magnetic hard
disk with you and you place it on a uh
say a speaker on your at home which has
a magnet Building inside you will
realize that your data will get
corrupted right these are environmental
factor or if there's a strong uh em uh
environment electromagnetic environment
around the magnetic hard your data will
get corrup
so that is what is the threat to
integrated yeah so we've covered this
I'm just covering the slides per what is
the production mechanism you use
cryptographic hash to ensure that the
data can be checked if there's a
integrative breach or not it cannot
avoid uh a threat to Integrity but it
can tell you if the data has been
compromised or not right similarly check
some database Integrity referential
Integrity yeah so we are checking about
the Integrity right we are checking if
the data is being has been changed in
transit or not for example let's say you
have an organization wherein the data is
backed up every few hours in a backup
facility away from the main facility now
this data uh will be utilized whenever
there's a situation there's an incident
where in the backup is to be uh called
upon for restoring the systems now in
order to the backup in order that the
backup should work we also have to
regularly check check if the data is
still relevant if the data is still good
the Integrity is not compromised right
that is where your hashes will come into
play we have cryptographic discussions
coming ahead but understand what is a
cryptographic hash cryptographic hash is
something which is a oneway function uh
by one way function I mean to say that
uh any input given to this algorithm the
cryptographic hash algorithm or hashing
algorithm will make give you a fixed
output of a string of characters these
string of characters are non-reversible
as in if you have these string of
characters you cannot go to the input
first thing secondly a small change in
the input will have a corresponding
large change on the output that means if
the data is being sent on the uh data
has been compromised even by minutest of
the birs there'll be huge change in the
hashing value and that tells you that
the data has been tampered with the
attack is on the Integrity of the data
you understood cryptographic hash yeah
at least the concept you got it right
we'll have a greater discussion coming
on it at least the hash is clear uh the
Integrity is clear wonderful thank you
Zarin ARA let's move on okay uh then
availability now very simple if you go
on amazon.com and you try and order a
particular
product so an example it's very easy uh
for hashing algorithm uh for
cryptographic hash let's give you an
example uh
hash calculator actually I wanted but
let's see yeah yeah it
is yeah which is the online hashing
algorithm right uh
now now let's say Amit is sending data
to site
right and the data
says we will have a
secret
meeting at
2200 hours tonight right so this is your
message with Amit is sending sending to
sayi you are working in say the CIA or
or any intelligence agency and you're
sending this data to one another and uh
we are we want to the both of them want
to ensure that the data is not changed
in the transit so what they do they
decide that we will receive the data
irrespective but we will pred decide an
algorithm for hashing now that algorithm
as for them we can have several
algorithms as you see on the screen over
here let's say they site an hashing
algorithm of md5 this is one of the few
hashing algorithm just an example they
decide that the Integrity check will be
done with md5 algorithm right between
both of them Sai and Amit now this is
the message which is sent along with the
message the hashing value is also sent
so what what does Amit do he first
creates the message then runs the md5
algorithm and gets the hash value so
what does amid do let's say I will send
you on the chat also uh this is your
message and the hash value I'll put it
on the chat itself so this is the hash
value so what Amit does he sends the
message encrypted unencrypted however
and hash value along with the message
can you see on the chat Amit has sent
both the details right so I've sent it
on the slack Channel too now what
happens is Avinash is a hacker who is
standing in between both of them there's
a amit's computer or the messaging
system is
compromised what Avinash does he changes
this to say he just adds instead of 2200
OD he makes it 2300 ODS can you see
Small Change not much change right rest
all stays the same and uh he sends this
message to uh he sends it ahead right
now when uh our friend uh Sai receives
this message he calculates the hashing
value right now ainash the hacker does
not know what uh algorithm is utiliz for
hashing just uh assume that he does not
know anything so what s does when he
receives the message he sees the hash
value right he sees the hash value so
this is the message I'm sending on chat
right now and the hash value uh which uh
our friend s calculates is visible over
here now let's compare both the values
let's compare both the values so for
this the hashing value got to First yeah
so this is the hashing value and the
previous example this is the hashing
value can you see does the hash value
match tell me do the hash values match
steam they don't what does it tell Sai
when he calculates the hash value and
seees that the values do not match
because he has the previous value sent
by Amit and he has now calculated
calculated his own md5 hash algorithm
value for this particular data what does
uh s know now Sai says that data has
been tampered with it is not a shity
that it's a compromise
because uh sometimes when you send data
on the network it may so happen the data
gets corrupted right so there's a
possibility that either there's a
compromise or there's a system failure
but the data has compromised the data
has tampered right the data is changed
obviously the data cannot be relied on
do you get the concept uh yeah this is
how hash works this is how your
integrity check works so now this is
exactly what happen happens when the
data flows from the
internet when uh you send data from a
client to a server along with the data a
hash value is sent and this is exactly
what happens between the client and
server pre-calculated hash is sent and
post receipt of the data the server also
calculates the
hash yeah the server also calculates the
hash Bas that's the point uh when s
receives this message he knows the uh
that he has to meet at 2300 hours but he
also knows the data is tampered with
obviously he will not follow the
instructions the data he says the
message has been tampered with that
means somebody has a malicious intent of
changing the data somebody has changed
it and when something is changed you
don't work on it and then there are
other channels to confirm what was the
message and all that is a different
thing already yeah just say yes if you
do
yeah this receiver has absolutely no
idea what change has been done he just
knows the data is changed he has
absolutely no idea what has changed but
he knows the data is changed and once
you know the data is changed you just
drop the data simple right I will not
follow the instructions or you will ask
for retransmission in the network
language because the hash changed the
value changed yes the hash value is sent
by the sender to the receiver
yes there are ways and means to crack
the hash there are ways and means to
protect the hash we'll come to that we
will yes yes every time uh we receive a
message we will calculate the hash value
compare it this is exactly what happens
on the network also on internet also
everything depends on everything but
hash will give you the Integrity
check as in it confirm if the data has
been compromised tampered or changed or
not yeah there are enormous number of
algorithms attacker can keep on trying
however long he wants or she wants how
would uh tell me you have received a
message 10 times with different hash
values from the sender will you still
believe in the message you won't right
the hashes algorithm are pre- decided
between the sender and receiver it's a
part of initial hand check I'll show you
a demo on that uh I can give you a demo
on that but we'll divert completely the
attacker can spoof IPS but change in
data the attacker cannot control the
hash value yeah I can show you in fact I
am going to show you uh uh internet
transaction how does Internet
transaction happens wherein how you
start the connectivity how hashes are
how algorithms are exchanged how data is
transmitted how everything is calculated
it will work yeah we it's a part of uh
my syllabus uh not just simply learns an
additional thing to tell which I I will
show it to you if you want to understand
the name I'll be talking about TCP
handshake uh on the network I'll be
talking about TLS hand check uh do you
understand what is a TLS
hand do you know what is a TLS yes full
form please if you don't know it TS is
yeah yeah tell me see when data is
transmitted over the Internet it is
known as transport layer security yeah
that is encrypted right when the data I
sent so the TLs is a transport layer
security approach and this is where your
data is encrypted along the net in the
network and for that the algorithms are
pre decided the handshake tells so um
now that we have jumped into it let me
tell you what happens is let's say I am
talking to mahavir so I cannot just talk
to mahavir right I will first seek his
permission I will say mahavir may I talk
to you mahavir will say yes let's talk
what am I doing I'm sending a
synchronous request to mahavir mahavir
is sending me synchronous
acknowledgement as in Mah is saying yes
we can talk I say yes that's good I send
an acknowledgement this synchronous uh
request sent from me to Mah synchronous
acknowledgement sent from mahavir to me
and I sending yes final yes
acknowledgement is what is as sinak act
t uh TCP handshake this is known as TCP
handshake once you have the TCP
handshake completed
then we decide mahavir I belong to
Karnataka I speak Canada uh I also know
Hindi I also know English uh which
language do would you prefer now what am
I doing we are deciding on a common
communication protocol uh so mahavir
will say I belong to Rajasthan uh I know
Rajasthani I know English I know Hindi
uh we can talk in English what is it
happening we are deciding on protocols
we are deciding on the communication
line we are deciding in on the
encryption algorithms we are deciding on
hashing algorithm this is known as a TLS
hand chei once you decide on the
language we also decide what code to you
do you use dagri do you use English do
you use uh any other uh what do you say
uh script what is it we are discussing
the encryption
mechanism now when mahavir and me are
talking everything is pred decided what
codes will you use for encryption
English right uh how frequently will we
speak now once we finish this approach
we when we finish everything that now we
have decided to talk we decided our
algorithms and we say now let's we are
done with talking we'll close the
connection that's a reset right we'll
cover that at the onset understand what
is this so this is exactly what happens
on the network a lot of handshaking
happens a lot of data is exchanged uh
within with each other only then your
communication happens everything happens
with a blink of an eyelid because the
modern day communication system so you
won't know about it but it happens and
this will be done I will show this on
live example I've given you a analog
analogous example I will show you using
wire Shar how does it look on the
network right I love giving that example
it's an awesome example and I'll show
you how it works uh with time so we
understand Linux today uh if time
permits we'll go further ahead and we
will also understand this TLS hand check
in the cryptography uh TLS TCP hand
check in the cryptography model in
Greater detail so yeah so let's move to
the threats I'm glad you understood yeah
so CIA th so what is the threat to the
availability I was coming to Amazon when
Amazon you're trying to order a product
and Amazon is down what is happening an
authorized user is not able to place an
order you will get frustrated right and
that is an attack on availability Amazon
will lose buiness business uh and
reputation at the same time right so
that is what is so uh it can be a denial
of service attack or a Dos dos stands
for denial of uh distributed denial of
service attack right that's a malicious
intent for stopping services offer
service provider simple as that right so
this is a there can be a uh see if you
have a Data Center and there's a power
failure what is it it may also lead to
denial of service availability attack on
the network right if there's a power
failure similarly if you're hwac system
your AC what do you call it hwac what's
the full form hwac keep on forgetting it
your climate control system basically in
the uh uh yeah the full form is heating
ventilation and air conditioning hwac
now when you have this climate control
system uh inside your data center it
fails that may also lead in server being
uh the server performance is being
hampered so your availability is
hampered that is what is the point say I
am attacking I am an attacker and you
are a web server right uh I am I am
sending you unlimited number of request
uh let's say uh Aruba wants to uh get
some service from the web server but
since I'm sending unlimited number of
requests the server is not able to cater
for request from any authorized user
yeah the server is not able to cater for
request because there are too many
requests coming from a attacker a single
attacker that is denial of service
attack now if I tell 100 people I pay 10
10 Rupees to 100 people and all of them
I tell them to send continuous request
to a particular server that is
distributed denial of service as in I
have distributed data to multiple
locations okay this is a analogous
example we'll have a technical example
shown to you you can use a tool by the
name of hping 3 to send icmp request now
we will cover that as we proceed ICM
request that so many pings are being
sent to the server that server is unable
to service a authorized request right
that's a d dos and do suppression
wonderful glad you understood it let's
move how do you Ensure High availability
okay you have a uh data center you'll
have a standby data center backup system
right which will work if one goes down
the other will take on immediately you
may have backups in place archives in
place which works right so that helps at
the same time you have protection
mechanisms the IPS is the inent
prevention systems inent uh detection
systems you may have uh firewalls in
place right you may have raid five
configs as Kell has given that allows
you to ensure that your data your
service available at all given times to
the users right so that's availability
now we also discuss about risk again we
gave a formula right risk was impact
into likelihood basically It's a
combination of probability of or a
likelihood of an event right now event
can be positive and negative but what
what we are discussing over here we're
talking about a negative incident event
which is happened that is a risk uh with
reference to negative incident let's say
uh there's a data brid we can have two
different incidents talked about let's
say your power uh connectivity to the
data center goes down it's an event
right a negative event
and what is the risk because that
happens your server availability your
net system availability may go down
right at the same time there's a
possibility that there's a hardware
damage which will happen agreed so
that's a risk now what is a risk it is
the probability that this power system
will go down that is risk do you
understand risk as such it's combination
of likelihood that something will happen
of this sort that is risk it's a prob
ility yeah now in formula's case you can
say uh risk can be impact into
likelihood impact multiplied by
likelihood what is the possibility of a
right we talked about data center now
what is the possibility your data in
this data center may be breached that's
a likelihood what is the probability
that it will have and once the data is
breached what would be impact on the
business as such how much will be the
damage that is the impact right this
damage can be calculated in terms of
dollar values money right or reputation
as such so we discussed about
Coca-Cola's formula last time so what is
the risk associated to it it is the
likelihood that this pook formula is
breached right what is the likelihood it
is a percentage value and if this
formula is breached what would be the
impact with reference to the damage
potential and the dollar value and
reputation loss for the organization
high right so the risk is high because
impact is higher likelihood is a
possibility so impact multiplied by
likelihood will give you risk do you
understand risk now likelihood a to
impact that's risk with me all of you
risk
understood right so uh I gave this
example already the same thing which is
available on the screen uh a server is
an asset to an organization in This
Server I give this example during a last
discussion in This Server about 25% of
the data is in unencrypted format
there's a 25% data which is an
unencrypted format and what uh if a
particular uh vulnerability that is a
weak rule in the firewall allows a
threat agent compromise this data okay
then this risk is
materialized okay I am talking about the
terminology risk is materialized there's
a loss of uh data to the organization
and what is a counter measure you
basically ensure that the weak rule in
the firewall
is replaced amended
reconfigured yeah got it okay okay
coming back to right so that is is the
example over here right so examples of
the risk there could be a fire a threat
agent can be a fire a cluess user or
uneducated un aware user can be a threat
agent malicious Insider now there's a
user there's a employee who's not
promoted due to whatever reason has may
have malicious intent for compromising
the organization right so that's a
malicious Insider hacker someone who who
has ulterior motives to gain Financial
uh benefits by compromising an
organization using his or her skills
right that is a hacker is that clear so
a risk can be associated with natural
disasters uh can be associated with
unawareness of a employee user vendor
contractor human being right and can be
Associated a malicious external entity
and technical option also where in your
Power Systems HVAC systems May Fail you
understand those are the examples of
risk great okay we also discussed about
asset we are uh red discussing asset can
be tangible intangible tangible
something which you can touch intangible
something we understand but cannot touch
right tangible your server is a tangible
thing the data inside the server is an
intangible thing your reputation of an
organization is a intangible thing right
these this is an ass asset so anything
which has value to the organization can
be considered as an asset right okay uh
in connection with uh asset there are
two major terminologies we should
understand one is sensitivity one is
criticality now sensitivity is nothing
but a unit of impact that dis
unauthorized disclosure of information
may have an organization as in when a uh
risk
materializes the amount of impact
this risk or unauthorized disclosure
we'll have on the organization is
sensitivity is sensitivity we talk about
criticality per again it's a measure of
impact that failure of a system to
function as required will will have an A
so it will determine how important an
asset is to the business will the
business continue to work or not will
the business continue to business or not
will the business have a repetition uh
loss or not that's his sensitivity and
criticality yeah okay asset
classification now we discussed about uh
inventorying various assets and
organization right when we inventor
assets we also need to priortize the
assets right and this prioritization of
the assets have has to be done in a
certain using certain processes so what
do you do you prioritize the asset based
on based on the business value
right now we've already discussed this
and I'm sure you remember that what what
do you mean by the business value you
ask the question what will be the impact
on the business if this asset is lost
that will give you the business value
right so Coca-Cola's formula big
business value so high priority asset
maybe uh a CCTV camera going faulty on
the gate uh maybe less uh business value
lesser impact right so that's asset
classification now this uh business
value can be asside based on combination
of criticality and the sensitivity this
will also allow us to understand if a
particular asset is of higher value what
are the risk associated with it how much
is the asset uh exposed to a risk what
is the likelihood what is the impact who
all would be interested in this
particular
asset the competitors the malicious
insiders the hackers yeah the misc
Contrition so on you know who's the
threat agent what is the risk what could
be the impact and what is the
sensitivity and criticality so you get
an understanding when you know what is
your asset so once you know what is
important would be uh the threat to that
important thing uh which is important to
us right and based on that we can have
the classific classification level
assigned to an asset so uh the
classification can be secret top secret
confidential unclass yeah that kind of
uh classification once you know that a
particular data Coca-Cola's formula for
Coke is a top
secret uh has top secret data
classification we know that only only
certain people can should handle this
data and you should have requisite
protection mechanisms on this data right
very very strong protection mechanisms
one of them being encryptions now once
you know that uh what classification
level is it what production mechanisms
in place we will Define uh you can
allocate the resources to the asset
again remember I told you uh last time
also that these production mechanisms
should make uh business sense it should
be economically viable you cannot have a
data which is worth say 100 or asset
which is worth $100 having a protection
mechanism of $200 on it right it should
always be it should always make business
sense it should always make economical
sense right so this is how you will be
doing asset classification you will
understand why asset classification is
done and how does it help us right asset
classification great
great okay you already talked about
identification of asset you must first
identify something to protect uh then
manage the
risk think if the asset is tangible or
intangible right and ensure that there
are production mechanisms placed in
there understand the criticality and all
yeah that's asset identification now
with this we come to the basic Linux
command Linux commands which we are
supposed to discuss right a small
introduction to Linux okay so as you see
on the screen
uh for all those who have not seen Linux
before uh we are talking about K Linux
right now most of the Linux flavors will
have their own uh layout generally it
will be same uh like Windows has the
start button uh this particular dragon
on the left side left corner top will
give you the menu for all applications
which are installed on this particular
machine uh the browser is seen over here
on the tab on the uh what do you call it
this particular panel the top panel
which has a watch on the right side uh
timer and the calendar on the right side
you can shut down the machine using the
button uh given over here we are not
going to shut it down
cancel uh the connectivity is seen over
here you'll have data connectivity
reflected over here your mic speakers
everything will be reflected over here
you can also see the browsers
on the menu wherein if you look at all
applications uh you'll find the browser
listed over here itself so there's a
Chromium browser installed there's a
Firefox installed we'll be primarily
using Firefox in our uh work over here
so let's open okay uh for the browser
for internet connectivity so similar to
Windows machine your Firefox on Linux
looks same so if you see this is how
your Firefox br looks browser looks so
you can open any URL you want over
here simple right so like Windows even
Linux uses a similar same browsers for
that matter uh the Internet Explorer or
the edge browser will not work on Linux
otherwise Firefox okay Safari for Mac
will not have option in Linux but
otherwise Firefox Chrome and several
other browsers are working uh
interoperable between various operating
systems right so you can use a browser
to surf the Internet now Linux is
primarily known to various uh people as
a uh what do you say it has an
availability of something known as a
terminal which allows you to run
commands which is very popular about
between Linux users which is very
popular between the Linux users and this
is what allows them to do a lot of tasks
without actually open any application
running it by typing it on the terminal
now what you see on the screen I clicked
on the red uh box over here which is the
terminal for the K Linux machine uh this
allows you to run various commands on
the uh machine for doing various tasks
we need to do uh on the dragon if you go
you'll find other terminals also
available we'll be using the terminal a
terminal already available in this
particular machine right similar layout
will be there on our UB to machine also
if you open that right uh let me expose
you to the terminal a bit more okay what
you see over here is Kali adate first
thing which comes over here is known as
the username the Kali over here is the
username username the user right uh and
the given K after this is the system
name if you can call it the system name
right so let's say if I make it if I
change
user can you see so the user from Kali
changed to root user so like Windows has
admin
user uh Linux has something known as a
root user we are a root user on a
Kali uh system yeah do you get get
it and what you see over here is the
current
directory slome SL Cali Kali is the
current
directory
understood we just understanding layout
over
here now do you see the difference the
root user is the admin user in case of
Khali uh capable of running uh
administrative level privileges on a
Linux machine
so this is the root
user I shift it to the root user by
using command sudo Sue now uh we'll be
covering this when I do sudo Su and give
a password uh the admin password which I
already given and you don't see it you
will find the user changes from normal
Khali user which is a low privilege
account to a high privilege root admin
account yeah uh even Android is a Linux
based system okay and what you see this
the second Khali is the system per say
this is the system name yeah this is the
system name after that what you see on
the slome Sali is known as the current
directory location there is a current
directory location in Linux everything
is known as a directory right everything
is known as a directory so understand
the terminology as of uh when you come
to the Khali user you see this still day
it is known as still day right and this
is also the current directory basically
a short hand for users home directory a
short hand for users home directory this
still day this this and this is
same okay users home
directory now let's talk about commands
which we can run on Linux now what is a
command understand command is nothing
but uh a software program so when
executed on a command line CLI command
line interface it performs the action on
the computer now again I'll say again
command uh is a software program when
executed on a CLI that is command line
interface it performs a action on the
computer so to execute a command first
step is to type the name of the command
to execute a command the first step is
to type the name of the command right so
in this example the command I'm typing
is
LS what is it
LS and I
enter what do you see what is happening
on the screen right now what am I doing
in Alis all those who know lenux will
tell you that uh it is a command to list
the contents of the present
directory yeah this is a command which
is listing the contents of the present
directory so by itself the ls command is
listing files and directories in the
current working directory at this point
you shouldn't uh shouldn't worry too
much about the output of the command
instead focus on understanding how to
format and execute commands right so the
ls command covered is incomplete uh
we'll be covering this as we proceed
ahead right this is listing the details
LS right uh now many commands can be
used by themselves with no further input
the way we saw LS right some commands
however require additional input to run
correctly uh so those inputs will be
something looking something like this so
if you say clear the screen command this
will be a command then you'll give some
option and possibly some arguments
right so this is the general structure
of commands which will be listed on the
terminal yeah so options are basically
used to modify the core behavior of the
command this options given over here
will be utilized to uh modify the core
behavior of a command while arguments
are used to provide additional
information what additional information
maybe a file name or a user name each
option and argument is normally
separated by a
space okay however you there are some
options wherein uh they could be
combined also so this is the general
layout of command command options and
arguments now you have to keep in mind
that Linux unlike Windows is case
sensitive we have to keep in mind that
Linux un unlike Windows is case
sensitive so whenever you use commands
and options and arguments and variables
and file names we have to exactly put
the uh case sensitive word anything
wrong you'll not list for example let's
say I want to move into the downloads
directories downloads
directory I'm CD I'm changing directory
just understand what I'm telling right
now so immediately I move to the down
downloads can you see the directory
location has changed to download visible
all of you right
now just understand I used D capital and
the spelling downloads however if I say
CD
downloads what error does it say it says
no such file or directory
exists for us human beings this and this
is same but even for Windows I think uh
case does not matter but in case of
Linux the case matters a big deal it
will not do the command if the case does
not M up okay so let's move
on with
arguments
so uh we talked about the command
options and arguments now when you type
uh when you see the format of say
command command options
argument
right yeah so an argument can be used
this argument or arguments can be used
to specify something for command to act
upon if LS is the given command which we
saw before so let's say let's delete
this if LS is a uh given command it see
it's a class in it itself Linux has a
lot of things to do but I'll give you an
concept and then we'll after Linux we'll
have a good break okay so like I said uh
if the Alis command is given uh the name
of the directory as an argument it will
list the contents of that directory so
let's say if I just use LS it will give
me the contents of the present directory
if I use LS and say uh give me contents
of say
documents it will give me the contents
of document directory as of now we have
nothing listed in the documents
directory hence it is giving me uh uh
blank over here let me see if I can find
uh another directory do I have this
directory with me yeah so if I say
lscp it will list out details on this de
now as of now don't worry what directory
I have gone into just understand I have
listed uh directory listings from
another location by giving an argument
of the directory name to the ls command
yeah this is how now you can also use
multiple arguments to list out details
for example
uh we used one uh LS command to list out
a directory we can use the same LS
command by giving another space to list
out another directory say let's say uh
we use
to uh Slash
HC I can use what SSH
let's
SSH you see two different directory
listings can be visible this is the
below one is for directly SSS directory
the above one is for triple P directory
right so I can use uh LS command with
multiple arguments and list out contents
of two different directories right given
as arguments over there understood
that's in basic arguments which we have
there right now we have when we talked
about command options arguments we have
discussed about arguments let's talk
about options so what are the options we
talking about this is the one we are
talking command options
arguements this is where we've discussed
about command discussed about arguments
let's discuss about
options let's discuss about
options Now options can be used with
commands to expand or modify the way a
command behaves again options can be
used with commands to expand or modify
the way a command behaves for example uh
if you use option Dash L right
uh for LS
command it will give long listing
providing additional information about
the files that are listed so if I just
do normal
LS this is the listing and if I do LS
and dasl is long listing it will give me
additional details what are the
additional details over
here the size uh uh of the file the
permissions of the file right so on so
forth will be given over here
right now you have to note that we have
used a small L small case L over here- L
right uh that is a lower Place L if you
use cap uh
uh what do you say a easy way to
remember this would be Dash L is a
pneumonic for long listing right this
is- L can be considered as a long
listing yeah okay yeah so we are
understand it is case sensitive okay
similarly if you want uh to look into
directories recursively you can use
R right ls-
R okay so now uh I'm sorry not
recursively I stand corrected this
prints the results in a reverse
alphabetical order so if you see if I
did just LS it is going in a uh
descending alphabetical order a a c d e
FG if you do dasr it will do a reverse
way right it will reverse it that LS
dasr similarly you can do long listing
long listing by using Das
LR yeah so file permissions the file
size the date it was created
and it is done given in the reverse
lineup moving from n to D in this case
right reverse lineup so in most cases
options can be used in conjunction with
other options so what we have done we
have combined two options long listing
and reverse uh uh listing of the files
together right so we have given separate
options together the combination of
these options will result in long list
output in Reverse alphabetical order as
you seen over here right now uh you have
if you ask me will the order matter no
that is not important that is not
important in this
case yeah so coming back a few more
things I need to cover now when you do
ls- L this by default gives you the file
sizes in bytes when you do ls- L It Is
by default giving you the sizes of the
file in bytes so these are the sizes the
4 496 496 1769 are sizes of the files
which are in bytes if you want to make
it human readable right uh as if you
understand uh the Lang uh make it easier
for humans to understand you can
use ls-
LH right and this will give you
the file size in human rable format so
4K 4K 4K 16 m 16 right so this is what
is a human readable
format right now options are generally
are single letters as you see Dash l h
and all however sometimes there are
words or phrases as well right uh
typically older commands use single
letters while the newer commands use
complete words options right single
letter options uh are proceeded by
single Dash Okay like uh when you do ls-
L it's a single letter with single Dash
right however when you use full uh word
options you'll be using Double Dash so
let me just clear the screen right
you'll be using Double Dash for example
if you remember
ls- H will give you human readable uh
we'll have to do long list in to make it
better
understanding so this will give you
human readable uh format in a single
letter the same thing you can do by
using a complete word a full word often
just
human readable and just enter it will
give you the same
output but you can use these similar
options so such options also come up if
you have a single letter one dash if you
have a word Double Dash yeah so if you
want to see directory listing in human L
readable format for any
directory uh let's say which one we have
SSS directory
uh it is if I say
SLC SL
SS it will give me human Ral format the
same format I can get it using
a word as an
option which is
space human
reable enter same options will come up
nothing changes only thing options
sometimes the options will be like this
sometimes it will be like this right oh
excuse me okay similarly uh so when a
command is executed in a terminal it is
stored in a location uh in a history
list per se so it is this is designed to
make uh it easy to execute same commands
so later eliminating the need to retype
the entire command so your commands are
basically saved somewhere in the history
to allow you to retype you can use your
up Arrow to go through the commands I'm
using my up Arrow right now to go
through all the commands Okay and now
the entire history of the commands is
run which are run in the current session
can can be displayed using the up Arrow
repeatedly one by one right now when you
do the up arrow and press enter the
command will run again simple so if I go
go on doing this up arrow and just press
enter the command will run again which
is saved in the history so you don't
have to type your commands right in case
you want to edit a command you can use
the left and right arrow to edit edit it
so in case I want to list out instead of
ss I want to list out say the PPA
directory I can change it and enter it
allows me so you can use the history uh
to move around uh to move around the
commands which are used prior the left
and right arrow to change the positions
and uh use for editing right
uh let's see in case you want to see all
the commands instead of using up Arrow
which were done today you can type
history excuse
me and it will list out all the commands
so we have run a total of 35 commands in
the session has started right everything
will be listed over
here see the history command I gave a
wrong command also visible
yeah m is telling type the command uh
giving space before the command it will
not show in history interesting let's
try it out so if I just give a space
prior to the command and say um let's
use a new command
date right enter so it has given me the
date right now let's try history it's a
interesting uh thing we need to
discuss yeah it's not showing
interesting Mur thank you so what Mur
has told us if I use the see if I use
date okay it's not doing it wonderful so
where do you use it m this command how
does it
help so if I do date right now and do
history you will see the date is listed
at the 37th command over here however if
I add a space at the start of the
command and type uh let's use another
command
uh what command code should I use let's
use n
map enter and now check
history okay that in map command is not
there oh interesting that's interesting
great so
uh I'm using Google over here to
download the cheat sheet
so you can also use Google that is
easier but uh
okay yeah this is a eight page document
for
Linux complete detail right so I'll
share this one too for
you cheat sheet
close yeah so the cheat sheet is
uploaded you can have a look not
everything can work out uh using these
cheat sheets but uh you need
practice excuse me right you need to
find do
practice okay now one more important
thing uh you should understand something
known as external commands now external
commands are basically binary executable
stored in the directories that are
searched by the shell so if a user types
LS command then the shell searches
through the directories that are listed
in the pathway variable right uh so if a
command does not behave as expected or
if a command is not accessible that uh
it should have been accessible uh then
you can uh it will be extremely tedious
to find this file right manually so you
can use a command by the name of which
okay you can use which so if you want to
know more about a command another
important thing uh let's complete this
first which and you can give the command
name say which LS okay
oh
okay say which LS it should give you a
path actually this should give you this
should have given you a location of a
command where the ls is there if I just
say which python will it give
me which python
yeah so uh it did not give it for Lis
but let's see if I know where is python
uh variable or where is python if if in
in short in a generalized understanding
where is python installed you can find
it using which Command right this helps
you to understand if a particular file
is installed or not available in the
system or not right so that's your
python uh uh that's your witch command
what else
now uh we saw directory listing right LS
we have discussed the uh initial command
options arguments similarly if you have
to change the directory you can use
CD and CD stands for change directory
and the directory name which is uh to be
changed to you can just select and you
will find the directory has been changed
can you see that you can use the CD
command to move within the directories
if you want to understand the present
present working directory you can find
use that using
PWD present working directory that will
give you present working directory got
it so uh now if you do not know
something about a command you can use
the manual which is in Linux
man command so if you want to get
details about any command just say man
and the command's name it will list out
the details about the command it will
give you
what is this LS command it will give you
list directory contents how do you use
it synopsis is given it will give you
description about this file and options
which we can use about use this with
this right so this is how uh man
commands you in case you do not know
what is man you can find out details
using man Manual of the man itself can
you see I opened a manual for man
command itself so it is an interface to
system reference manuals what is it it
is an interface to system reference
manuals and it will give you a
description of each thing which you can
do with this command uh the examples are
given see I give you this example right
man Lis display the manual page for the
item LS or the program
Lis got it similarly if you say uh man
man. 7 it will give you the manual page
for macro page man in section seven so
you can find a section in a particular
manual using the number itself right so
that's your
manual okay uh what else let me see okay
in case you want to get help for a
command uh then you can use let's say
dashh as help right if does not exist
you can use Double Dash and full word
either of it works can you see when I
said Dash L it did not work - H it did
not work when I said Dash DH help it
gave me details about this command so
one way getting detail about a command
is using manual if you want a small
descriptive uh understanding you can use
dash dash help as is the case over here
to find out details about the command
right all options
right uh okay
now we talked about Lis we talked about
CD we talked about
PWD uh present working directory we
understood where are we with respect to
the location we could change the
directory now a bit about the directory
structure of Linux so Linux has a
particular directory systems structure
so now on a Windows system the top level
directory is called my computer all of
you are already aware of it right uh so
it is the top level directory on Windows
the physical devices such as the hard
drives USB drives the network drives
show up under the my computer uh option
and are each assigned a drive letter
right uh such as the C drive D drive
that is how Windows works the directory
structure which Linux has is slightly
different uh let me just show you
directory
structure of L so if I just
okay EXC
me so this is the directory structure of
Linux as you see on the
screen let me explain it to you now as
you see in the screen uh these uh the
directory
structure uh is an example over here as
a screen it uh it is present within the
virtual environment right of the uh
Linux machine now like Windows Linux
directory structure typically is called
file system also has a uh a top level so
uh it is called the root directory the
one you see on the top is the root
directory and it's symbolized by slash
character the slash character over here
can you see yeah so and it this root
Rory is the slash character additional
there are no drives in the Linux
remember each physical device is
accessible under a directory as opposed
to a drive letter in the windows it is
oppos understand as of now and you'll be
uh we'll be discussing it further when
we move inside so to view contents of a
directory you will be using LS as we
already know so if you want to
understand uh see the contents of a root
directory you can just say LS /l and
you'll get the contents of a root
directory can you see that we are
getting the contents of a root directory
by using ls- L same thing which is given
in the diagram over here right I'm
getting this boot Etc proc Dev mentioned
over here so you can you see boot Etc
yeah all the directories which are in
the root directory can we see now here
right where is it where we yeah so now
we can list out the contents of the
directory of the root directory as we
saw in the path over here right using
the ls command we've already done that
now we should notice that there are many
directories with descriptive names right
like the slash boot directory which will
which contains files to boot the
computer if you want to see the slash
boot you can just CD
SL
boot LS and you'll find the uh files to
boot the computer inside this directory
hence the name boot right so like
Windows uh this is the master directory
boot the my computer directory like like
my computer uh and you'll have the
details over here the boot directories
right root directory will have boot
directory boot directory will have
computers files which allow the computer
to boot boot uh boot person right now
the term home directory often confuses a
various people right home directory
often is confused confused by various
people let me just come back here yeah
so to begin with on most Linux
distribution there is a directory called
home can you see this home directory
over
here right under the root directory
there's a home directory now Under This
Home Direct
there's a directory for each user on the
system so if I just go to let's say I go
back to my root
directory I say Lis you'll find the boot
directory I'll find the home directory
right inside the home
directory I will
find the directory for each user as of
now this computer has only one user
hence only one uh uh directory for user
is mentioned here wonderful what I can
do is let's create a
user let's create a user and I'll show
you if I create a user if I have to
create a user I can use command sudo
user ad uh user
ad and what name should we give let's
give a
enter so user is created now like I said
in the root directory there's a home
folder uh home folder will which has or
rather which has users of that
particular computer if I just see
home you will
oh it has not cre just a sec Why didn't
it show the
user where did we create
it it should have created the user in
the root
directory I created a user right it did
not give an error what I did I created a
user to be listed over here but somehow
that user is not available in this
directory that's interesting I will have
to look where did I go
wrong okay let's come back to that later
I actually wanted to show you but yeah
so now uh like I said if you go to the
home directory you will find the users
listed over there now the directory name
is same as the name of the user so when
I said LS
SL
sorry Lis
SLC since there's a k user I see the
Kali name as the directory name over
there right so if you have say a system
admin user you'll find the system admin
name given in the folder over here right
so we are in the Kali user and the Kali
user folder is seen over here okay
moving on uh okay the home directory
again remember it's an important
directory to begin with when a user
opens the cell it automatically is
placed in the home directory right
typically where you work that's the uh
importance of
directory uh like I said PWD will give
the present working directory if you do
PWD it will give you the present working
directory if I use change the user to
sud
sudo Sudo
Su
yeah and if I say PWD the present work
directory is still home right but the
user is root but the user is
root right so present working directory
basically points to the working
directory okay we have a few questions
let me address it one by
one uh balraj is saying is there any
difference in the folder color it seems
different colors of folders n so uh okay
in a typical lenux terminal the color of
the folders vary right uh because of the
configuration per se now uh depending on
the distribution uh we'll have different
colors uh so by default directories are
often displayed in different colors to
differentiate there from the regular
files uh so let's say if I just say uh
as you see just a
sec as you see over here this is a
tarred file a compressed file which has
a different color a regular directory
has a different color if I make a file
uh executable then the name will it will
become
green
yeah okay what is the difference between
Pudo and
Sue
okay basically I am using the super user
uh Command right so sudo and Sue again
uh in most Linux and operating uh Linux
systems or Unix system uh we uh let's
say
um if you want to do something in
elevated privileges right if you want to
execute some command in elevated
privileges you will use the pseudo
command or in full form it is super user
do so let me just type it for you the
Pudo basically stands for
yeah see sud sudo stands for super user
do they've not given a full form or have
they given it no now this is basically
to execute a
command uh in a super user and to
execute a command in a uh elevated
privilege they use sudo so basically
Pudo allows you uh allows a user to
execute a command as another user
typically the root user what is it the
root user so when I say I'm running
let's say I'm ex exiting this to normal
user now if I say want to open a
particular application which requires
administrative privileges I may not be
able to run it so let's say I say net
discover so this is another command uh
discover we'll use it does not have net
discover is it net
discover okay
see it is it says this is most likely
caused by lack of administrative
privileges associated with your user
account so then the user account is not
allowed to run a command because there
are privilege restriction however if I
just use pseudo just pseudo and net
Discover it will allow me to run the
command can you see the command has
started working what is it I am
elevating privilege uh David just that
answer your question sudo allows a user
to execute a command uh typically as a
super user or a root user got it if you
say what is Sue just this so I can tell
you
man man sue does it give me yeah so what
is Su run a command with substitute user
and group ID so now basically Al Su
stands for switch user if you can use
the full form Su stands for switch user
sudo stand for super user to right now
this Su allows a user to become another
user typically again you can change it
to administrator or some other user
person got
it yeah wonderful uh if it's about
Terminals and you're working
on a terminal on a Linux use manual
command or help command to get more
details it will be much more easier so
if I say nmap I can use Manual of nmap
to give me details nmap is a tool which
is a network scanner we'll be using wait
for it yeah so this is nmap I press Q I
can quit it
similarly yeah similarly I can use nmap
dash for
help yes all Comm can be tested in the
lab I am doing it in the simply learn
lab if I just n-h it will give me help
command so your help is available on the
terminal so you can get more
details can we change the password of
the user AC the lab using
commands uh maybe you will not have the
permission if the lab vendor is smart
enough which he is because I know him uh
he will not allow you to change the
password of the lab user user but okay
should not actually you can try it out
okay but there's no guarantee I would
not recommend it uh you can play around
with your own machines with respect to
credentials however it is not
recommended that you uh do it over here
okay wonderful
um right where
we right so moving
on so as we saw we can change the
directories using C CD and you can move
within directories we saw what is a home
directory we saw uh what is a root
directory what is the structure of the
directory right uh if you move to a
particular directory use CD if you say
let's say if you're moving uh into a CD
documents directory right there are
multiple directories okay not here CD if
you have to move out of a directory you
can use CD dot dot and you see you can
revert back to the previous directory
you're moving one directory up using the
CD dot dot now if you say move to a
directory CD
downloads
downloads one
sec happened yeah let me clear the
screen when is can we do any
installation launch any application
using Kali yes yes you can
um if you want let me just complete this
I'll show you that too so if I move to
the CD directory somehow my lab has got
stuck okay I mve to the download
directory if I move further into okay
there's no sub directory in the
downloads
it where was a subdirectory
available let's move to a subdirectory
somewhere but my lab is wait wait
yeah
scratched just a second let the terminal
open
up H uh V is asking can we install
anything yes I'll show you that but let
the lab start give me a
minute okay here's the lab okay the
terminal is open I do not want another
one let's clear the
screen yeah so uh do I have any the
directory in downloads no let's see if
we have something in the home
directory documents do not have anything
okay let's create one uh that will be
easy so if I move into a directory I
want to create a directly I can use
command make
di sorry mkd make Di and I can make a
folder AE right so that's how I create a
directory in inside a
directory right AAP I can move into the
directory like this AAP as you see I am
inside the directory I can list out the
contents of the directory if it anything
is present over
there see nothing in the directory if I
want to create a file I can use a
command
touch to create a file a DOT uh
text do text
enter now what is that created it has
created a blank
page blank document a. text as you see
the size of this page is zero because
nothing is inside right now there are
two three ways of uh creating the file
one is what I showed you other one is
you can use Nano which is an Editor to
create a file or change a file so we'll
create
a1. text using Nano
enter so this is a kind of structure so
this is
a test
document this is a test document right I
can say control
X and Y for saving the document and
enter right control X Y enter now if I
say I if I list out details and
LL I will
find two files listed over
here one with 25 bytes of data one with
zero bytes one was created with touch
other was created with Nano similarly to
Nano there are other editors which can
be utilized one of the few famous one is
whim so you can use whim to just let's
do edit the a
file all right so I'm editing so this is
another editor which allows you to edit
the file but it is certain there is
particular method in which you can edit
the file if I want to enter something in
this uh Vim command I say I for insert I
have to type insert as soon as I type
insert you'll see a insert prompt is
given over here now I can type over here
this is
a test
file right and we can add
to uh how do I see it I say I type uh
press escape on the
keyboard right you see the insert prompt
is gone then do
colon uh just type colon W for write and
Q for
quit enter I will write the changes and
quit now if I
say LS
DOL enter you will find that the 22 byte
worth data is created in the previous
file the time of change and everything
is visible over here seen all of you
clear with
me
yeah okay
great okay let's move on now once you
another way of uh can you repeat this
again which one the whim one okay arind
is telling me if I use x it will will uh
directly do everything okay we'll try
that so if I say
whim and the file name so uh uh s and I
enter this is the file I see I can make
changes to the file let's say I delete
this
two and type new
alphabet sorry I have to press I for
insert once I insert I can type anything
I want to
right now in order to to save the file
there are two options one was Escape I
say col W for right Q for quit another
option our friend uh arind has given
wherein I
can use colon and X to exit let's see if
it
works yeah I have exited let's look if
the change has been Incorporated in our
file so c a.
text you see so
whm you open the Wim file then you
press I for
insert make changes as per
requirement and then you can use colon
and X to save and exit I used to use
colon and WQ right both of them are same
yeah okay understood
say okay great uh we have a question
from David David is asking does Linux
have something like batch files in
Windows okay yes Linux has similar
concept uh to Windows batch files uh
dobat files if you call it and they are
known as shell
scripts yeah David they known as let me
just exit
this what it
yeah okay so there are shell scripts now
these shell scripts are text files
containing commands that are interpreted
and executed by the shell interpretors
right so that's our shell scripts so
we'll be using shell script so if you
want to uh create a uh say a simple
shell script now that you have come to
this and we are using editors another
editor which will help us do is a g edit
so I'm we are create we talked about
Nano we talk about wh another XB editor
is gedit do we have gedit in this let's
see we'll have to
install so in case G edit I say I don't
have this file I say enter Linux will
tell me that the file does not exist and
we can install it now this is the
question and somebody was asking that
can I install applications yes you can
use sudo app
install and the application which is to
be installed gedit in this case let's
install this uh application and it can
install it can you see it's being
installed on my Khali M so anything you
have to install you can use Pudo app
install and the name of the application
and you'll be able to install it as you
see on the screen it is happening right
now where in this application wasn't
there and we are installing
it yes
sure if you do not have a application
you can use
Pudo app install and the application
name to install the
application simple say Pudo app install
and the application name in this case I
have installed gedit which is a textex
based editor for Linux machines where
are you yeah yes
okay great so now that we are uh we've
seen whim we've seen
Nano we've seen whim we've seen Nano
let's work on our options to use a text
based
editor let's work on our options to use
a text based editor such as gedit so if
I say G edit and I say
a uh I give the file name right
enter a text based editor like uh
Windows has a notepad a similar thing
will pop up like this and I can change
CH the file as for my liking over here
also can you see I can change
it I'm changing the
file
yes now uh David was asking do we have
batch files so in Linux we have shell
scripts let's create a small script file
now this is Bash scripting uh not a part
of your course but an interesting thing
if you want to learn however it is not
compulsory you just need to understand
it okay so let's start uh I am creating
a bash file a simple script uh let's say
slash bin
bash and we are going
to uh echo or print out on the screen uh
we want to print
out say
um hello how are
you I'm doing it in the editor right and
I add a question mark a
quote right also uh we will ask the bash
script to list out files in the current
directory like this right so uh in order
to save this document it is simple I
just say control s like we do in Windows
and the file is saved the file is saved
we can close
this okay control L I have cleared the
screen I say LS
you will find the file is here ap. text
right the the file which we created and
the file size must have changed if you
remember it was 20 uh bytes now it is 46
bytes and
uh there is no execute this file is not
an executable in order to create this
file uh make this file executable you'll
use the command
change mod CH mode
all right uh plus X for making making it
executable and the file
name right uh I should have saved it as
s
actually okay let's use
it pH so yeah so now that we have a file
uh uh created over here we can also copy
the file or move the file in the same
location so if I just say um
copy
ap.
text come
on yeah as AP Dosh in the present
location can I do
that yes all people who are who know
Linux can I copy change the name of the
file in the present location
yeah if there's an error Linux will give
you a warning if the operation is done
the Linux will not give in Waring if you
want to look at it sorry
l-l you see I created a file of same
size and name with a different extension
so ap. text was a file I have copied it
as a.s
which is a shell script file do you
understand I copied a file using CP CP
is copying a file now this a.ch can be
given uh execution uh executing uh
privileges that we can execute this file
by using CH
mode plus X and I say
AP
Dosh all right I'm making a shelf file
enter you see it has given no errors
that mean it has worked so if I now do
al-
L can you see the file color has changed
can you see what was the file color
before it was a white color now it has
become green color that signifies the
file is now executable do you understand
that that signifies the file is now
executable yeah David your batch file we
have created a shell file over here okay
so in your uh Journey as a penetra
ethical hacker uh as a penetration
tester you may have to make files
executable you'll be doing it using such
kind of commands change mode CH mode
commands got it now if you want to run
this file you can just use
do/ so you have to run a command just
dot is present working directory and you
want to run the uh this file in the
present working directory so do dot is
the present working directory present
directory present location and the name
of the file to run and we have made it
executable as soon as you say enter it
should give us the command what is it
say hello how are you and it is listing
the contents of the present directory
can you see that what we've done so we
have progressively moved from creating a
directory to creating a file to creating
a shell using various editors then
making the shell exe shell file
executable or batch file executable and
then running the file on the terminal
getting an output on the screen is that
clear all of you this is something you
need to redo when you practice it is
important that you redo
this
okay great so and thanks David for
getting it to my notice uh this is
something which is
uh should be known to us right thank you
so let's see a few questions yesod says
what is root terminal and
terminal okay is in context of lenux a
terminal is a program that provides text
based interface what you see on the
screen to interact with the operating
system okay it is giving you a text
based inter intercept uh uh correction
text based interface face to interact
with the operating system while a root
terminal is a terminal session that runs
with super user privileges now do you
understand terminal gives you interface
root terminal will give you super user
Privileges and same thing can be done
with your
privileges yeah okay
uh okay uh Zarin it will be the same the
commands will stay the same nothing
changes UB 2 is a deian based operating
system K Linux is also a deian based
operating system so all these commands
in exact same format will work in to
also yeah okay
great okay so next question so we have a
question from cell which is from where
the Linux find the application now uh in
case of Linux uh there's something known
as official package repositories
right so no most Linux distributions
have official software repositories or
storage mechanisms where users can find
and install the application when we used
uh when you use just let me clear the
screen when you use app right that is
Advanced package tool what is it
Advanced package tool this allows you
this is a package manager which allows
you to download packages from the
repository of uh the deban oper system
lenux operating system and so on so
forth for Debian you use AP
Dean sorry right use app for
uh for let's say red hat operating
system Fedora Cento I think Centos also
you use yum that is a uh it is possibly
yellow updator modified or something I
forgot all right so that's how you do it
also uh there are other options where in
there are third party repositories
software websites you can download like
you do in Windows similarly you can
download and install applications this
is one option I have given
right most cyber people prefer working
on Linux it's much more convenient
lesser uh issues come up at least I
prefer and I've seen 90% of people who I
work with I'll prefer using Linux
yeah okay
uh okay uh again another question from
Co does the syntax matter while
searching the application yes if you
know if you remember I told you Linux is
case sensitive so you have to ensure the
S case is correct so if you're if you're
looking for Firefox uh let's say this
machine has Firefox I want to open
Firefox I just type Firefox like this
and it will open Firefox but if I don't
get the case correct it will not open
the application simple as that can you
see from the terminal without actually
using the
mouse I can open an application I just
say
Firefox I'll tell something interesting
I'm doing over
here can you see I just changed the case
the first case f and Firefox did not
open if I say
fire fox
without uh change uh with the right case
and I enter it will open
Firefox got it so you can search and
open applications for the terminal so if
I want to open up say BP suit I can type
BP Tab and enter it will open this is a
proy which we'll be using subsequently
so you can open applications directly
from terminal by running a command you
don't have to use Mouse and uh Mouse as
such right okay today we are going to
talk about some really interesting and
Powerful hacking gadgets you should know
about in 2024 but remember this is just
for learning we don't want anyone
getting into trouble so moving on the
best way to keep your computers and
devices safe is to know about the risk
so some risk are easy to cater using
strong passwords and don't download from
Bad websites and don't hand your
unlocked device to strangers but there
are also hidden dangers that can cause
big problems some tools look innocent
but can be very dangerous here are seven
gadgets that look normal but are
actually powerful hacking tools these
tools are made for Security Experts to
test system but they can be misused so
let's get things off with a device
that's small but incredibly powerful
that is Raspberry Pi so Raspberry Pi is
a compact and affordable computer that
has revolutionize the tech world
originally designed for educational
purposes it has become a favorite among
hobit makers and even professionals
despite its small size it boasts
impressive capabilities including
multiple USB ports HDMI output and
support for various operating systems
like Linux and Windows 10 iot core the
Raspberry Pi can be used for wide range
of projects from simple programming and
gaming to complex iot systems and home
automation the Raspberry Pi can also be
dangerous hacking tool with the right
software it can be used to perform a
variety of hacking task for example it
can run Kali Linux a popular operating
system for penetration testing this
allows it to be used for Network
scanning password cracking and even
setting up Rogue access points to
intercept data its small size makes it
easy to hide and its affordability means
it's accessible to many in the wrong
hands this innocent looking device can
become a powerful tool for malicious
activities now that we have seen the
potential of the Raspberry Pi which by
the way is one of the personal favorites
for tinkering let's let's move on to
another seemingly simple but powerful
device the Wi-Fi adapter so Wi-Fi
adapter might seem like a simple device
used to connect to wireless networks but
it can be a potent hacking tool in the
wrong hands these adapters when paired
with the right software can intercept
and monitor Wireless Communications
making them invaluable for network
analysis and penetration testing for
example they can be used with tools like
air crack Ang to crack Wi-Fi passwords
hackers can use Wi-Fi adapters to
perform attacks such as packet sniffing
and man in the-middle attacks these
activities can lead to unauthorized
access to networks data theft and severe
security breaches it's like having a
digital spy in your pocket while
essential for legitimate security
testing it's crucial to be aware of
their potential misuse and to secure
your own wireless networks against such
threats speaking of Wi-Fi you won't
believe how sneaky this next device is
let's take a look at a device that that
takes Wireless heing to a whole new
level the Wi-Fi pineapple the Wi-Fi
pineapple looks like a standard router
but it is a sophisticated device used
for hacking wireless networks it allows
attackers to create Rogue Wi-Fi access
points tricking users into connecting
and revealing their login credentials
imagine connecting to what looks like a
free public Wi-Fi only to have your data
intercepted this device is capable of
advanced manin the-middle attacks
monitoring and recording data from all
connected devices Additionally the Wi-Fi
pineapple can capture Wi-Fi handshakes
which can then be used to crack Network
passwords its powerful feature makes it
a favorite among penetration testers for
assessing network security but in the
wrong hands it can be used for malicious
activities highlighting the importance
of robust wireless security so from
Wi-Fi to Bluetooth which is everyone
these days right let's now explore a
powerful tool for Bluetooth hacking the
ubertooth one the Uber bluo one is an
open- Source Bluetooth testing tool that
appears to be a simple USB dongle
despite its unassuming appearance it can
monitor and analyze Bluetooth
Communications making it a valuable
asset for those testing the security of
Bluetooth devices think of it as a spy
for Bluetooth traffic the ubertooth one
can capture Bluetooth packets perform
Bluetooth attacks and even Explore
vulnerabilities in Bluetooth networks
its ability to dissect Bluetooth traffic
makes it a powerful tool for both
legitimate security research and
potential misuse understanding its
capabilities helps highlight the
importance of securing Bluetooth enabl
devices against unauthorized access and
attacks continuing with radio frequency
tools which honestly sounds like
something out of a spy movie so let's
discuss the hack rf1 and its versatile
capabilities so the hack rf1 is a
versatile softwar defined radio SDR
platform that can transmit and receive
radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 gahz it
looks like a standard electronic device
but can be used for a wide range of
hacking activities imagine being able to
capture and manipulate signals across a
broad spectrum with the hack rf1 users
can capture and analyze various radio
signals Jam frequencies and even spoof
signals to manipulate communication
systems this tool is particularly useful
for exploring and testing the security
of wireless communication systems while
it serves an essential role in
legitimate research and development
the hack rf1 also demonstrates the need
for robust security measures to protect
against radio frequency based attacks so
now let's look at a tool that takes
advantage of a computer's trust in USB
devices and trust me this one sneaky the
USB rubber ducky so the USB rubber ducky
is a device that looks like a regular
flash drive but acts like a keyboard
typing commands into any computer it's
plugged into hackers use it to execute
pre-programmed scripts that can steal
data install malware or take control of
the target device it's like a tiny
digital ninja this tool exploits that
trust computers have in USB devices
making it a potent weapon for cyber
attacks it's a reminder to be cautious
about plugging in unknown USB devices as
they could be rubber duckes in Disguise
ready to unleash harmful commands and
compromise your system security so
finally we have got a real undercover
Gadget here let's uncover the secret
capabilities of the land turtle the land
turtle looks like a typical USB ethernet
adapter but it's a covered hacking tool
used to Monitor and infiltrate networks
don't let its innocent appearance fool
you it provides hackers with several
capabilities such as Network scanning
DNS poofing and data capture the land
turtle can be discreetly plugged into a
network allowing access to gather
sensitive information and gain uned
excess its ability to operate undetected
makes it particularly dangerous
emphasize in the need for vigilance and
robust network security measures to
prevent unauthorized devices from
connecting to your systems so there you
have it guys we have explored some of
the most powerful and dangerous hacking
gadgets out there these tools can do a
lot of damage if they fall into the
wrong hands that's why it's so important
to stay informed and Vigilant about
cyber security next on our docket is a
live demonstration where we solve a set
of cross-side scripting problems
starting from the basic level to the
topmost level six we're going to start
at level
one in this web application it
demonstrates the common cause of cross
side scripting where user input is
directly included in the page without
proper
escaping if we interact with the
vulnerable application window here and
find a way to make it execute JavaScript
of our choosing we can take actions
inside the vulnerable window or directly
edit its URL bar this task needs only
basic knowledge let's see why the most
primitive injections work here right
away let's do a simple query and inspect
the resulting HTML
page I'm going to use this
phrase with a single quod as a special
character we can now inspect the HTML
page
you can see here in this
line the special character single code
appears in the result over
here the provided query text is placed
directly in a b tag as in a body element
we need to perform a reflected xss into
the web application because they are
non-persistent xss attacks and the P
load should be included in the URL to
perform successful
exploitation we can use any payload but
we're going to use the simple one to
perform an alert in this web application
it's simple and can be shown
easily we just going to write the script
over
here I'm going to press search
as you can see we have successfully
launched our first cross-site scripting
attack we can see an alert box popup
with the necessary message and a similar
process can be used to steal browser
cookies and passwords albeit with
different
commands now we have the option to move
to level
two in this web application it shows
that how easily xss bugs can be
introduced in complex chat applications
chat app conversations are stored in a
database and retrieved when a user wants
to see the conversation therefore if a
malicious user injects some JavaScript
code all visitors will be infected this
kind of cross-site scripting attack is
more powerful and it is more riskier
than reflected crossed scripting attacks
and that's why is known as stored
xss I posted my
query with a special character of a
single quote and this is what I get
whatever I typed in simply appeared on
the page right after I click on share
status let's see the
source you can see here the text I
posted seems directly put inside a block
code tag so even a simple script tag we
used in level one should work here but
it will not let us examine the code to
understand why
we're going to toggle the code of here
and check the index.html
file important
part is line
32 the generated HTML fragment which is
the HTML variable in the code is added
to the male HTML using the inner HTML
method so when the browser passing this
HTML fragment it will not execute any
script tag defined within that HTML
fragment HTML parer will not execute a
script tag when it passes htmls via this
method this is why the script tag like
we used in level one is not going to
work here our solution is to use events
events will execute the defined
javascripts we're going to use an image
over here
and when we press on share
status in the above injection we loading
an image that doesn't exist which causes
to trigger an on error event in on error
event the it will execute our alert
method with that we are able to beat
level two and we can now move up to the
next level in our
challenge as you can see clicking on any
tab causes the tab number to be
displayed in the URL
fragment this hints that the value after
the hashtag controls the behavior of the
page that is it is an input variable to
confirm let's analyze the
code as you can see in line 43 inside
the event
handling the value provided after the
hash in the
URL is directly passed onto the chew tab
method no input validation is being
performed the value passed to the choose
tab method is directly injected into the
IMG tag in line
17 this is an unsafe assignment and it
is the vulnerable part of the code now
all we have to do now is to craft a
payload that would adjust the IMG tag to
execute our JavaScript remember the
script tag from level one would not work
here since the variable HTML is used to
add the Dom dynamically hence the events
are ases here once again I will choose
to use the existing IMG tag and change
the source to something that doesn't
exist hence forcing it to fall in to
execute an on error even which I will
pass the URL
once we visit that URL we can see that
our Java popup has opened up here with
the same message of xss level 3 has been
completed with this we can now move on
to level four which is going to present
a different kind of attack
in this web application there is a timer
on the page that means whatever numbers
we put in the Box a countdown starts and
then when it finishes the application
alerts that the countdown is
finished and we can see the time is a
popup appearing over here and this
resets the timer again now it is obvious
that the value entered in the text box
is transferred to the server over the
timer parameter in the URL
well let us examine the code to see how
the timer parameter is being
handled we're going to visit timer. HTML
over
here and we're going to check over
here in line
21 the start timer method is being
called in the onload event however the
timer parameter is being directly passed
to the start timer method we need to
perform a popup Alert in the web
application which escapes the content of
the function start timer without baking
the JavaScript code the parameter value
is directly added to the start timer
method without any filtering what we can
try to do here is to inject an alert
function to be executed inside the on
loone event along with the start timer
method we're going to remove this
argument and put our script over here
now I me press on create
timer and we have a popup with the xss
level four
complete we can now move on to level
five in this web application this
application xss is different cuz this
challenge description says cross-side
scripting isn't just about correctly
escaping
data sometimes attackers can do bad
things even without injecting new
elements into the Dom it's kind of open
redirect cuz the attack payload is
executed as a result of modifying the
Dom environment in the victim's browser
this environment is used by the original
client side script so that the client
side code runs in an unexpected manner
the vulnerability can be easily detected
if the next Link in the signup page is
inspected
the href attribute value of next link is
confirm which is exactly the value of
the next URL query
parameter as you can see over here this
means using the next query parameter can
be used to inject a JavaScript code to
the href attribute of the next link the
following is the best way to do it as
soon as the user clicks on the link the
script will will be trigger
we're going to press anything random and
now that we click next we can see the
xss level 5 that we had provided in the
URL as a parameter to the next
variable since the value of next
provided appears in a popup we can
consider the attack a success and move
on to the final level
six in this sub application it shows
some of the external Javascript is
received if you analyze the URL you can
see that the script is loaded already
the vulnerability lies within how the
code handles the value after the
hashtag if you check on line 45 the
value right after the hashtag is taken
as the gadget
name and then in line
48 the value is directly passed on to
the include Gadget method and the
include Gadget method that we can see
over
here you can see in line 18
a script tag is created and the URL
Gadget name parameter value is directly
used as the source attribute of the
script tag in line
28 this means we can completely control
the source attribute of the script tag
that is being
created that is with this vulnerability
we can inject our own Javascript file
into the code we can inject a URL of our
own hosted JavaScript into the web
applications URL after the hashtag and
the URL should not be using https but
anything like that to bypass the regular
expression for security
checking going to remove the pre-stored
URL and we're going to load our own
Javascript file
finally we have reached the end of our
challenge completed six different
varieties of cross scripting attacks and
use different solutions for all of the
six questions with work from home being
the norm in today's era people spend
considerable amount of time on the
internet often without specific measures
to ensure a secure session apart from
individuals organizations worldwide that
host data and conduct business over the
internet are always at the risk of a Dos
attack these dos attacks are getting
more extreme with hackers getting easy
access to the graph three of the six
strongest DDOS attacks were launched in
2021 with the most extreme attack
occurring just last year in 2020 lately
cyber criminals have been actively
seeking out new services and Pro
protocols for amplifying these DS
attacks active involvement with hacked
machines and botet allow further
penetration into the consumer space
allowing much more elaborate attack
campaigns apart from General users
multinational corporations have also had
their fair share of problems GitHub a
platform for software developers was the
target of a DS attack in 2018 widely
suspected to be conducted by Chinese
authorities this attack went on for
about 20 minutes after which the systems
were brought into a stable condition it
was the strongest DS attack to date at
the time and made a lot of companies
reconsider the security practices to
combat such attacks even after years of
experimentation dedos attacks are still
at large and can affect anyone in the
consumer and corporate space hey
everyone this is B from Simply learn and
welcome to this video on what is a DS
attack let's learn more about what is a
DS
attack a distributed denial of service
attack or dos is when an attacker or
attackers attempt to make it impossible
for a service to be delivered this can
be achieved by thating access to
virtually anything servers devices
Services networks applications and even
specific transactions within
applications in a Dos attack it's one
system that is sending the malicious
data or requests a DS attack comes from
multiple systems generally these attacks
work by Drowning a system with requests
for data this could be sending a web
server so many requests to server a page
that it crashes under the demand or it
could be a database being hit with a
high volume of queries the result is
available internet bandwidth CPU and RAM
capacity become
overwhelmed the impact could range from
a minor annoyance from disrupted
services to experiencing entire websites
applications or even entire businesses
taking offline more often that not these
attacks are launched using machines in a
botnet a botnet is a network of devices
that can be triggered to send requests
from a remote Source often known as the
command and control center the bots in
the network attack a particular Target
thereby hiding the original perpetrator
of the Dos campaign but how do these
devices come under a botnet and what are
the requests being made to the web
servers let's learn more about these and
how DS attack work
a DS attack is a two-phase process in
the first phase a hacker creates a
botnet of devices simply put a vast
network of computers are hacked via
malware ransomware or just simple social
engineering these devices become a part
of the botn net which can be triggered
any time to start bombarding a system or
a server on the instruction of the
hacker that created the botn net the
devices in this networks are called Bots
or zombies in the second phase a
particular Target is selected for the
attack when the hacker finds the right
time to attack all the zombies in the
botnet network send these requests to
the Target thereby taking up all the
servers available bandwidth these can be
simple ping requests or complex attacks
like SN flooding and UDP flooding the
aim is to overwhelm them with more
traffic than the server or the network
can accommodate the goal is to render
the website or service
inoperable there is a lot of wig room
when it comes to the type of DS attack a
hacker can go with depending on the
target's vulnerability we can choose one
of the three broad categories of Dos
attacks volume based attacks use massive
amounts of bogus traffic to overwhelm a
resource it can be a website or a server
they include icmp udap and spoofed
packet flood attacks the size of volume
based attack is measured in bits per
second these attacks focus in clogging
all the available bandwidth for the
server thereby cutting the supply short
several requests are sent to the server
all of which warrant a reply thereby not
allowing the target to cater to the
general legitimate
users next we have the protocol level
attacks these attacks are meant to
consume essential resources of the
target server they exhaust the load
balancers and firewalls which are meant
to protect the system against the dors
attacks these protocol attacks include
SN floods and Smurf DDOS among others
and the size is measured in packets per
second for example in an SSL handshake
server replies to the Hello message sent
by the hacker which will be the client
in this case but since the IP is poofed
and leads nowhere the server gets stuck
in an endless loop of sending the
acknowledgement without any end in
sight finally we have the application
Level attacks application lay attacks
are conducted by flooding applications
with maliciously crafted requests the
size of application layer attacks is
measured in request per second these are
relatively sophisticated attacks that
Target the application and operating
system level
vulnerabilities they prevent the
specific applications from delivering
necessary information to users and hog
the network banded up to the point of a
system crash examples of such an attack
are HTTP flooding and bgp hijacking a
single device can request data from a
server using HTTP post post or get
without any
issues however when the requisite botnet
is instructed to bombard the server with
thousands of request the database
bandwidth gets jammed and it eventually
becomes unresponsive and
unusable but what about the reasons for
such an attack there are multiple lines
of thought as to why a hacker decides to
launch a DS attack on unsuspecting
targets let's take a look at a few of
them the first option is to gain a
competitive advantage many ds attacks
are conducted by hacking communities
against rival groups some organizations
hire such communities to stagger their
Rivals resources at a network level to
gain an advantage in the playing field
since being a victim of a DS attack
indicates a lack of security the
reputation of such a company takes a
significant hit allowing the rivals to
cover up some
ground secondly some hackers launched
these Doos attacks to hold multinational
corporations at Ransom the resources are
jammed and the only way to clear the way
is if the target company agrees to pay a
designated amount of money to the
hackers even a few minutes of inactivity
is detrimental to a company's reputation
in the global market and it can cause a
spiral effect both in terms of market
value and product security index most of
the time a compromise is reached and the
resources are freed after a
while toos attacks have also found use
in the political segment certain
activists tend to use Ros attacks to
voice their opinion spreading the word
online is much faster than any local
Rally or Forum primarily political these
attacks also focus on online communities
ethical dilemas or even protests against
corporations let's take a look at a few
ways that companies and individuals can
protect themselves against dedos
attacks the company can employ load
balancers and firewalls to help protect
the data from such attacks load balances
reroute the traffic from one server to
another in a DS attack this reduces the
single point of failure and adds
resiliency to the server data a firewall
blocks unwanted traffic into a system
and manages the number of requests made
at a definite rate it checks for
multiple attacks from a single IP and
occasional slowdowns to detect a DS
attack in
action early detection of a DS attack
goes a long way in recovering the data
lost in such an event once you've
detected the attack you will have to
find a way to respond for example you
will have to work on dropping the
malicious J dos traffic before it
reaches your server so that it doesn't
throttle and exhaust your bandwidth
here's where you will filter the traffic
so that only legitimate traffic reaches
the server by intelligent routing you
can break the remaining traffic into
manageable chunks that can be handled by
a cluster resources the most important
stage in Doos mitigation is where you
will look for patterns of d do attacks
and use those to analyze and strengthen
your mitigation techniques for example
blocking an IP that's repeatedly found
to be offending is a first
step Cloud providers like Amazon web
services and Microsoft Azure who offer
high levels of cyber security including
firewalls and threat monitoring software
can help protect your assets and network
from DS criminals the cloud also has
greater bandwidth than most private
networks so it is likely to fail if
under the pressure of fre stos
attacks additionally reputable Cloud
providers offer Network redundancy
duplicating copies of your data systems
and equipment so that if your service
becomes corrupted or unavailable due to
a DS attack you can switch to a secure
access on backed up versions without
missing a beat one can also increase the
amount of bandwidth available to a host
server being targeted since DS attacks
fundamentally operate on the principle
of overwhelming systems with heavy
traffic simply provisioning extra
bandwidth to handle unexpected traffic
spikes can provide a measure of
protection this solution can prove
expensive as a lot of that bandwidth is
going to go unused most of the
time a Content delivery Network or a CDN
distributes your content and boost
performance by minimizing the distance
between your resources and end users it
stores the cached version of your
content in multiple locations and this
eventually mitigates DS attacks by
avoiding a single point of failure when
the attacker is trying to focus on a
single Target popular CDN include aomi
CDN Cloud flare AWS Cloud front
Etc let's start with our demo regarding
the effects of DS attacks on a system
for a demo we have a single device that
will attack a Target making it a Dos
attack of sorts once a botnet is ready
multiple devices can do the same and
eventually emulate a DS attack
to do so we will use the virtualization
software called VMware with an instance
of parro security operating system
running for a Target machine we will be
running another vmw instance of a
standard Linux distribution known as
Linux light in a Target device we can
use wire shark to determine when the
attack begins and see the effects of the
attack
accordingly this is Linux light which is
our Target machine and this is parro
security which is used by the hacker
when trying to launch a DS attack this
is just one of the dour that can be
used to launch the attack we must first
find the IP address of our
Target so to find the IP address we open
the
terminal we use the command if
config and here we can find the IP
address now remember we're launching
this attack in VMware now the both the
instances of parro security and Linux
light are being run on my local network
so the address that you can see here is
192.168
72129 which is a private address this IP
cannot be accessed from outside the
network basically anyone who is not
connected to my Wi-Fi when launching
attacks with public servers or public
addresses it will have a public IP
address that does not belong to the 1921
168
subnet once we have the IP
address we can use a tool
called hping
3 hping 3 is an open- Source packet
generator and analyzer for the TCP IP
protocol to check what are the effects
of an attack we will be using wire shark
wire shark is a network traffic analyzer
we can see whatever traffic that is
passing through the Linux light drro is
being displayed over here with the IP
address the source IP and the
destination IP as to where the request
is being transferred to once we have the
Dos attack launched you can see the
results coming over here from The Source
IP which will be par security Now to
launch the hping 3 command we need to
give pseudo access to the console which
is the root access
now we have the root access for the
console the hping 3 command will have a
few arguments to go with it which are as
you can see on the
screen minus s and a
flood a hyphen
V hyphen p80 and the IP address of the
target which is 192 168 72.1 129
in this command we have a few arguments
that such as the minus s which specifies
SN packets like in an SSL handshake we
have the SN request that the client
sends to the server to initiate a
connection The Hyphen flood aims to
ignore the repliers that the server will
send back to the client in response to
the SN packets here the parent security
OS is the client and Linux slide being
the
server minus v stands for verbosity as
in where we will see some output when
the requests are being sent the hyphen
p80 stands for Port 80 which we can
replace the port number if we want to
attack a different port and finally we
have the IP address of our
Target as of right now if we check wire
shock it is relatively clear and there
is no indication of a DS attack incoming
now once we launch the attack over
here we can see the requests coming in
from this IP which is 192 168 72.1
128 till now even if the network is
responsive and so is Linux
light the requests keep on coming and we
can see the
HTTP flooding has started in flood mode
after a few seconds of this attack
continuing the server will start
shutting down now remember Linux light
is a drro that can focus on and that
serves as a
backend now remember Linux light is a
drro and such Linux DRS are served as
backend to many servers across the world
for example a few seconds have passed
from the attack now the system has
become completely irresponsive this has
happened due to the huge number of
requests that came from par
security you can see whatever I pressed
nothing is responded even the wire
shockk has sto capturing new request
because the CPU usage right now is
completely 100% and at this point of
time anyone who is trying to request
some information from this Linux drro or
where this Linux drro is being used as a
backend for a server or a database
cannot access anything else the system
has completely stopped responding and
any request any legitimate request from
legitimate users will be
dropped once we stop the attack over
here it takes a bit of time to settle
down now remember it's still out of
control but eventually the traffic dies
down and the system regains its
strength it is relatively easy to gauge
right now the effect of a Dos attack now
remember this Linux light is just a VM
instance actual website servers and web
databases they have much more bandwidth
and are very secure and it is tough to
break into that is why we cannot use a
single machine to break into them that
is where a DS attack comes into play
what we did right now is a Dos attack as
in a single system is being used to
penetrate a Target server using a single
request now when a Dos attack multiple
systems such as multiple Paras security
instances or multiple zombies or bots in
a botnet network can attack a Target
server to completely shut down the
machine and drop any legitimate request
thereby rendering the service and the
target completely unusable and
inoperable as a final note we would like
to remind that this is for educational
purposes only and we do not endorse any
attacks on any domains only test this on
servers and networks that you have
permission to test on cyber security has
become one of the most rigid Industries
in the last decade while simultaneously
being the most challenged with every
aspect of corporate culture going online
and embracing cloud computing there is a
plethora of critical data circulating
through the internet all worth billions
of dollars to the right person
increasing benefits require more complex
attacks and one of these attacks is a
Brute Force attack a brute force or
known as Brute Force cracking is the
Cyber attack equivalent of trying every
key on your key ring and eventually
finding the right one boot Force attacks
are simple and relax able there is no
prior knowledge needed about the victim
to start an attack most of the systems
falling prey to Brute Force attacks are
actually well
secured attackers let a computer do the
work that is trying different
combinations of usernames and passwords
until they find a one that works due to
this repeated trial and error format the
strength of password matters a great
deal although with enough time and
resources brute force will break a
system since they run multiple
combinations until they find the right
passcode
hey everyone this is B from Simply learn
and welcome to this video on what is a
Brute Force attack let's begin with
learning about Brute Force attacks in
detail a Brute Force attack also known
as an exhaustive search is a
cryptographic hack that relies on
guessing possible combinations of
targeted password until the current
password is discovered it can be used to
break into online accounts encrypted
documents or even Network peripheral
devices the longer the password the the
more combinations that will need to be
tested a Brute Force attack can be time
consuming and difficult to perform if
methods such as data off fisc are used
and at times downright
impossible however if the password is
weak it could merely take seconds with
hardly any effort dictionary attacks are
an alternative to Brute Force attacks
where the attacker already has a list of
usernames and passwords that need to be
tested against the target it doesn't
need to create any other combinations on
its own dictionary attacks are much more
reliable than brute force in a real
world context but the usefulness depends
entirely on the strength of passwords
being used by the general
population there is a three-step process
when it comes to brute forcing a system
let's learn about each of them in
detail in step one we have to settle on
a tool that we are going to use for
brute forcing there are some popular
names on the market like
hashcat Hydra and John the Ripper while
each of them has its own strength and
weaknesses each of them perform well
with the right configuration all of
these tools come pre-installed with
certain Linux distributions that cater
to penetration testers and cyber
security analysts like K Linux and parro
security after deciding what tool to use
we can start generating combinations of
alpha numeric variables whose only
limitation is the number of characters
for example while using Hydra a single
six-digit password will create 900,000
passwords with only digits involved add
alphabets and symbols to that sample
space and that numbers grows
exponentially the popular tools allow
customizing this process let's say the
hacker is aware of the password being a
specific eight-digit word containing
only letters and symbols this will
substantially increase the chances of
being able to guess the right password
since we remove the time taken to
generate the longer ones we omit the
need for including digits in such
combinations these small tweaks go a
long way in organizing an efficient
Boost Force attack since running all the
combinations with no filters will
dramatically reduce the odds of finding
the right credentials in time in the
final step we run these combinations
against the file or service that is
being broken we can try and break into a
specific encrypted document a social
media account or even devices at home
that connect to the internet let's say
there is a Wi-Fi router
the generated passwords are then fed
into the connection one after the other
it is a long and arduous process but the
work is left to the computer other than
someone manually clicking and checking
each of these
passcodes any password that doesn't
unlock the router is discarded and The
Brute Force tool simply moves on to the
next one this keeps going on until we
find the right combination which unlocks
the
router sometimes reaching the success
stage takes days and weeks which which
makes it cumbersome for people with low
computing power at their disposal
however the ability to crack any system
in the world purely due to bad password
habits is very appealing and the general
public tends to stick with simple and
easy to use
passwords now that we have a fair idea
about how Brute Force Works let's see if
you can answer this question we learned
about how complex passwords are tougher
to crack by Brute Force among the ones
listed on the screens which one do you
believe will take the longest be broken
when using Brute Force tools leave your
answers in the comment section and we
will get back to you with the correct
option next
week let's move on to the harmful
effects of getting a system compromised
due to Brute Force
attacks a hacked laptop or mobile can
have social media accounts logged in
giving the hackers free access to the
victims connections it has been reported
on multiple occasions where compromised
Facebook accounts are sending malicious
links and attachments to people on their
friends
list one of the significant reasons for
hacking malware infusion is best done
when spread from multiple devices
similar to Distributing spam this
reduces the chance of circling back the
source to a single device which belongs
to the hacker once brute forced A system
can spread malware via email attachments
sharing links file upload via FTP
Etc personal information such as credit
card data usage habits private images
and videos are all stored in our systems
be it in plain format or root folders a
compromised laptop means easy access to
these information that can be further
used to impersonate the victim regarding
Bank verification among other
things once a system is hacked it can
also be used as a mail server that
distributes spam across lists of victims
since the hack machines all have
different IP addresses and Mac addresses
it becomes challeng in to trace the spam
back to the original hacker with so many
harmful implications arising from a boot
Force attack it's imperative that the
general public must be protected against
such let's learn about some of the ways
we can prevent ourselves from becoming a
victim of Brute Force
attacks using passwords consisting of
alphabets letters and numbers have a
much higher chance of its standing built
Force attacks thanks to the sheer number
of combinations they can produce the
longer the password the less likely it
is that a hacker will devote the time
and resources to brute force them having
alpha numeric passwords also allows the
user to keep different passwords for
different websites this is to ensure
that if a single account or password is
compromised due to a breach or a hack
the rest of the accounts are isolated
from the
incident two- Factor authentication
involves receiving a one-time password
on a trusted device before a new login
is allowed this OTP can can be obtained
either via email SMS or specific tofa
applications like Ai and agis email and
SMS based otps are considered relatively
less secure nowadays due to the ease
with which SIM cards can be duplicated
and mailboxes can be hacked applications
that are specifically made for 2A course
are much more reliable and
secure captur are used to stop Bots from
running through web pages precisely to
prevent brute forcing through their
website since boot Force tools are
automated forcing the hacker to solve
capture for every iteration of a
password manually is very challenging
the capture system can filter out these
automated Bots that keep refreshing the
page with different credentials thereby
reducing the chances of Brute Force
considerably a definite rule that locks
the account being hacked for 30 minutes
after a specific number of attempts is a
good way to prevent Brute Force attempts
many websites lock account for 30
minutes after three failed password
attempts to secure the account against
any such attack on an additional note
some websites also send an email
instructing the user that there have
been three insecure attempts to log into
the
website let's look at a demonstration of
how Brute Force attacks work in a real
world situation the world has gone
Wireless with Fi taking the re in every
household it's natural that the security
will always be up for debate to further
tou the security index and understand
Brute Force attacks you will attempt to
break into the password of a Wi-Fi
router for that to happen you first need
to capture a handshake file which is a
connection file from the Wi-Fi router to
a connecting device like a mobile or a
laptop the operating system used for
this process is parot security a Linux
distribution that is catered to
penetration testers all the tools being
used in this demo can easily be found
pre-installed in this operating system
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more to start our demo we're going to
use a tool called airgeddon which is
made to hack into wireless network
specifically at this point it's going to
check for all the necessary scripts that
are installed in the system
to crack into a Wi-Fi and to capture the
handshake file we're going to need an
external network card the significance
of the external network card is a
managed mode and a monitor mode for now
the W lx1 named card is my external
network adapter which I'm going to
select to be able to capture data over
the air we're going to need to put it in
monitor mode as you can see above it's
written it is in managed mode right now
so we're going to select option two
which is to put the interface in monitor
mode and it name is now w0
monitor the monitor mode is necessary to
capture data over the air that is the
necessary reason why we need an external
card since a lot of inbu cards that come
with the laptops and the systems they
cannot have a monitor mode installed
once we select the mode we can go into
the fifth which is the handshake tools
menu in the first step we have to
explore for targets and it is written
that monitor mode is necessary to select
a Target so let's explore for
targets and press
enter we have to let this run for about
60 seconds to get a fair idea about the
networks that are currently working in
this locality for example this ESS ID is
supposed to be the Wi-Fi name that we
see when connect in to a network go24
recover me these are all the names that
we see on our mobile when trying to
search for the Wi-Fi this BSS ID is
supposed to be an identifier somewhat
like a MAC address that identifies this
network from other devices the channels
features on one or two or there are some
many channels that the networks can
focus
on this here is supposed to be a client
that is connected to one such Network
for example
the station that you can see 56 26 this
is supposed to be the MAC address of the
device that is connected to a router
this BSS ID is supposed to be which
wi-fi it is connected to for example
5895 d8 is this one which is the go24
router so we already know which router
has a device connected to it and we can
use our attack to capture this
handshake now that we it has already run
for 1 minute now that we press contrl
C we will be asked to select a Target
see it has already selected the number
five which is the ge24 router as the one
with clients so it is easy to run an
attack on and it is easy to capture a
handshake
for select Network 5 and we run a
capture
handshake it says we have a valid WPA
WPA2 Network Target selected and that
the script can
continue now to capture the handshake we
have have a couple of attacks a do or a
do air replay attack what this attack
does is kick the clients out of the
network in return when they try to
reconnect to the Wi-Fi as they are
configured that way that when a client
is disconnected it tries to reconnect it
immediately it tries to capture a
handshake file which in turn contains
the security key which is necessary to
initiate the
handshake for our demo let's go with the
second option that is the do air replay
attack select a timeout value let's say
we give it 60
seconds and we start the
script we can see it capturing data from
the ge24 network and here we go we have
the WPA handshake
file once the handshake file is captured
can actually close this and here we go
congratulations in order to capturing a
handshake it has verified that a pmk ID
from the target network has successfully
been captured this is the file that is
already stored a do cap file for the
path we can let's say we can keep it in
a
desktop okay we give the
path and the hand shap file is generated
we can already see a Target over here
same go24 router with the BSS
ID now if we return to its main
menu we already have the handshake file
captured with us now our job is to Brute
Force into that handshake capture file
the capture file is often encrypted with
the security key of the Wi-Fi network if
we know how to decrypt it we will
automatically get the security key so
let's go to the offline WPA wp2 decrypt
menu since we'll be cracking personal
networks we can go with option
one now to run the Brute Force tool we
have two options either we can go with
the air crack or we can go with the
hashcat let's go with air crack plus
crunch which is a Brute Force attack
against a handshake file we can go with
option
two it can already detect the capture
file that we have generated so we select
yes the BSS ID is the one which denotes
the go24 router so we're going to select
yes as well the minimum length of the
key for example it has already checked
that the minimum length of a Wi-Fi
security key which is a WPA2 psk key
will always be more than eight digits
and Below 64 digits so we have to select
something in between this range so if we
already know let's say that the password
is at least 10 digits we can go with the
minimum length as 10 and as a rough
guess let's say we put the maximum
length as
20 the character set that we going to
use for checking the password will
affect the time Tak into Brute Force for
example if we already know that or we
have seen a user use the password while
connecting to the router as something
that has only numbers and symbols then
we can choose accordingly let's say if
we go with only uppercase characters and
numeric
characters go with option
s and it's going to start
decrypting so how aircrack is working
right here you can see this P phrase
over here the first five or six digits
are a it starts working its way from the
end from the last character it keeps
trying every single combination you can
see the last the fourth character from
the right side the D it will eventually
turn to
e because it keeps checking up every
single character from the end this will
keep going on until all the single
characters are tested and every single
combination is tried out since the
handshake file is encrypted using the
security key that is the WPA2 key of the
router whichever pass phrase is able to
decrypt the handshake key completely
will be the key of the Wi-Fi router this
is the way we can Brute Force into Wi-Fi
routers anywhere in the world cyber
attacks are frequently making headlines
in today's digital environment at any
time everyone who uses a computer could
become a victim of a Cyber attack there
are various sorts of cyber attacks
ranging from from fishing to password
attacks in this video we'll look into
one such attack that is known as botet
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon never to miss an
update to begin with let's take a look
at some of the famous bot attacks the
first one is Mirai bot which is a
malicious program designed to attack
vulnerable iot devices and infect them
to form a network of bots that on
command perform basic and medium level
denial of service attacks then we have
the zoos bot is specifically designed
for attacking the system for Bank
related information and data now let's
see what exactly a bot net
is botnet refers to a network of
hijacked interconnected devices that are
installed with malicious codes known as
malware each of these infected devices
are known as BS and the hijack criminal
known as B holder remotely controls them
the BS are used to automate large scale
attacks including Data Theft server
failure malware
propagation and denial of service
attacks now that we know what exactly a
bot net is let's dive deeper into
learning how bot net works during the
preparation of a botnet network the
first step involves preparing the bot
net Army after that the connection
between the bot net Army and the control
server established
and the end the launching of the attack
is done by the bot Herer let's
understand through a
illustration firstly we have a b Herer
that initiates the attack according to
the control server commands the devices
that are infected with the malware
programs and begins to attack the
infected system let's see some details
regarding the preparation of the bot net
Army the first step is known as the
prepping the bot net Army the first step
is creating a B net is to infect as many
as connected devices as possible this
ensures that there are enough Bots to
carry out the attack this way it creates
Bots either by exploiting the security
gaps in the software or websites or
using fishing attacks they are often
deployed through troan
horses for the next step we have
establishing the connection once it
hacks the device as per previous step it
infects it with a specific malware that
connects the device back to the control
bot server a bot Herer uses command
programming to drive the bot's
actions and the last step is known as
launching the attack once infected a bot
allows access to atmin level operation
like Gathering and stealing of data
reading and rewriting the system data
monitoring user activities performing
denial of service attacks including
other cyber crime
now let's take a look at the botet
architecture the first type is known as
client server model the client server
model is a traditional model that
operates with the help of a command and
control center server and communication
protocols like
IRC when the bot Herer issues a command
to the server it is then related to the
clients to perform malicious
actions then we have peer-to-peer model
here controlling the infected Bots
involves a peer top a network that
relies on a decentralized approach that
is the BS are topologically
interconnected and acts as both CNC
servers that is the server and the
client to the hackers adopt this
approach to avoid detection and single
point
failure in the end we will see some
points on some countermeasure against
bot net
attacks the first step is to have
updated drivers and system updates
after that we should avoid clicking
random popups or links that we often see
on the internet and lastly having
certified antivirus anti-s spyware
softwares and firewall installed into a
system will protect against malware
attack the internet is an endless source
of information and data still in some
cases we come across some occurrences
like cyber attacks hacking force entry
which may affect a Time on the web hi
everyone and welcome to the simply La
Channel today we we will discuss a topic
that secretly records our input data
that is known as key loggers but before
we begin if you like watching Tech
videos subscribe to our Channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an
update to understand the key logging
problem better let's take a look at an
example this is June she works in a
business firm where she manages the
company's data
regularly this is Jacob from the
information Department who is here to
inform her about some of the security
protocols during the briefing she
informed him about some of the problems
her system was facing with which
included slow reaction speed and unusual
internet
activity as Jacob heard about the
problems with the system he thinks of
the possibility what could be the reason
behind these problems a system was
facing
with the conclusion that he came across
was the key logging
issue unknown to the problem her system
was facing with she asked him about some
of the details regarding
it for today's topic we learn what
exactly key loggers are and how they
affect our system what are the harmful
effects that key logging can bring into
the system to begin with we learn what
exactly the key logging program
is as the name suggests key logger is a
malicious program or a tool that are
designed to record key strokes that are
typed during dat input and record them
into a lock file then the same program
secretly sends these lock files to its
origin where they can be used for
malicious acts by the
hacker now that we know what the key
logging program is let's take a look how
they enter into the
system searching for a suitable driver
for a system can often lead to the
installation of the key logging program
into the system if we often visit
suspicious sites and uncertified soft
sofware are installed into our system
then if we use unknown links or visiting
unknown websites which come through
unknown addresses can also be a reason
behind the key logging issue entering
into the system and lastly there are
often cases where different popups that
we often see on social sites or
different media sites can lead to the
installation of key loging program into
our
system now that we know how the problem
gets into the system let's take a look
how to identify whether the system is
infected by the key logging
issue the key logging issue can be
identified if there are often cases when
a keyboard lags behind the system the
data that we enter sometimes is stuck in
between when we type through the
input then there are cases when the
system freeze occurs unknowingly to what
exactly could be the reason behind this
and also there are delayed reaction time
for different applications that run on
the system and lastly there are
different cases when we often see
suspicious internet activity on the
system that we don't know about this
could lead to the identification of a
problem into the
system now we'll take a look at
different types of key loggers that are
present on the net which can harm our
system differently
the first problem that key loggers
arouse is API based the most common key
logging case which uses apis to keep a
log of the type data and share it to its
origin for malicious purposes each time
we press a key the key logger intercepts
the signal and logs it then we have form
grabbing based key loggers as the name
suggests they are a based key loggers
that store the form data that is if we
often use web forms or different kinds
of forms to enter different data they
can be recorded into the system by the
program and send it to its
origin then we have kernel based key
loggers these key loggers are installed
deeply into the operating system where
they can hide from different antivirus
if not checked properly and they record
the data that we type on the keyboard
and send it to its
origin and lastly we have Hardware Key
loggers these key loggers are present
directly into the hardware that is they
are embedded into system where they
record the data that we type on the
keyboard now let's take a look how
hackers differentiate different type of
recorded data and exploit
them when hackers receive information
about the target they might use it to
Blackmail the target which may affect
the personal life of the Target and also
blackmail them for different money
related
issues then in case of company data that
is recorded by the key logging program
can also affect the economic value of
the company in the market which may lead
to the downfall of the
company also in some cases the key
logging program can also log data about
military Secrets which may include
nuclear codes or security protocols
which are necessary to maintain the
security of a country
now let's take a look whether mobile
devices get infected with the key
logging issue or
not in the case of hand devices
infection of key loggers are low in
comparison to the computer systems as
they use onscreen keyboard or virtual
keyboard but in some cases we often see
different types of malicious programs
getting installed into the hand device
if we often visit different certified
websites or illegal websites or torrent
sites and also the device that is
infected with the key logging issue or
different kind of malicious program can
often lead to the exploitation of data
that includes photos emails or important
files by the hacker or the Cyber
criminal that install the particular
malicious program into the
system now to prevent a system from
getting infected by the key locking
program let's take a look at different
points the first point includes using of
different antivirus softwares or tools
which can prevent the entering a
malicious program into the
system then keeping system security
protocols regularly updated is also a
good
habit and lastly using virtual keyboard
to input our sensitive data which may
include Bank details login details or
different passwords related to different
websites now that we have some
understanding about the topic of key
loggers let's take a look at the demo to
further increase the knowledge about the
topic for the first step we have to
download some of the important libraries
that are required into the
system which
is this library now we'll run
it the system says the library is
already installed into the system
now let's take a look what exactly
modules are required from the particular
library from this Library we'll
import the keyboard module which will
help us to record the data that we type
on the
keyboard now from the same we'll also
import key
module and The Listener module
and
also the logging module which will help
us to record the data into a log
file for the next part we'll write a
piece of code that will allow us to save
the data that is recorded by the program
into a text file that will be named as
key log text file along with the date
and time stamp let's take a look
now we'll provide it with the file
name that will be given
as key log do txt
file and also so the part where the
format of the data is recorded
put the brackets over here to contain
the file name now we'll write the format
in which the data will be recorded into
the log file which will be given
as the format would be the message and
the time stamp which would be given as
along with the time
stamp as
percentage and ending it with the
bracket now for the next step we'll
design two of the functions that will be
used into the program that will be
termed as while press function and while
release function let's take a
look while press
function would be a function that will
come into play when the keyboard key has
been
pressed
is pressed
and this would go for the format that we
designed in the above
line
and
logging the Pressed
key
info a string file to be
recorded into the lock file
now now we'll design a function that is
while
release that will come into play when
the Escape key has been pressed that is
the program will terminate itself and
the program will stop from
running and in the
end we require for the functioning of
the program to Loop these functions that
is while press and while release to
continue its cycle
that will be going for while
press
and
on release will contain while
release
function
as listen now
and now this part would join the
different threads and store them into
the log file now that we have completed
the code for the program let's run
it we have to wait for a moment so the
program runs it
now to verify the program let's open
Notepad
and on the notepad we'll
write hello
world which will be the basic whether
the program is working or not let's take
a
look and we'll go for the main page on
Jupiter notebook and refresh the page go
to the
bottom over here we see the key log text
that is a text file that we cre created
let's open
it and over here we have the data that
is created as we started with Note then
this is the hello world part that we
created just
now which shows that the program we
created is working properly now that we
have reached the end of the module let's
take a look at the summary firstly we
learn what exactly key loggers are then
we are understood what different modes
are present how the system get infected
with the key logging problem then we
learned how to detect the problem into
our system then we learn what different
types of key loggers are present on the
net we also understood how hackers use
the recorded data from the program and
we also learn whether mobile devices get
infected with the key logging problem or
not and lastly we understood what
different points can be taken to prevent
the entering of the key logging problem
in into the system and before we begin
if you're someone who is interested in
building a career in cyber security or
to become an ethical hacker by
graduating from the best universities or
a professional who elicits to switch
career with cyber security or ethical
hacker by learning from the experts and
try giving a short to Simply Larch
postgraduate program in cyber security
with modules from MIT schi College of
computing the course link is mentioned
in the description box below that will
navigate you to the course page where
you can find a complete overview of the
program being over before we learn about
the Pegasus platform let us understand
what spyware is and it's working spyware
is a category of malware that can gather
information regarding a user or a device
straight from the host machine it is
mostly spread by malicious links via
email or chat applications when a link
with the malware is received clicking on
this link will activate the spyware
which allows the hacker to spy on all
our user information with some spyer
systems even clicking on the link isn't
necessary to trigger the malicious
payload this can ultimately cause
security complications and further loss
of privacy one such spiv system that is
making the rounds in the tech industry
today is Pegasus the Pegasus is a
spyware system developed by an Israeli
company known as the NSO group it runs
on mainly mobile devices spanning across
the major operating systems like the
Apple's IOS on iPhone and the standard
Android versions this is not a newly
developed platform since Pegasus has
existed since as ear as 2016 a highly
intricate spy program that can track
user location read text messages scan
through mobile files access device
camera and microphone to record voice
and video Pegasus has all the tools
necessary to enforce surveillance for
any client that wishes to buy its
services initially the NSO group had
designed the software to be used against
terrorist factions of the world with
more and more encrypted communication
channels coming to the Forefront Pegasus
was designed to maintain control over
the data transmission that can be a
threat to National Security
unfortunately the people who bought the
software had complete control over who
how and up to what level they can put
surveillance limits on eventually the
primary clients became Sovereign Nations
spying on Public Information that is
supposed to stay private became really
easy with the service multiple devices
can be affect With the same spy system
to create a network information this
network keeps feeding data to the the
host to understand how a network can be
created let's know how a mobile device
can be affected by Pegasus we all
communicate with friends and family over
instant messaging applications and email
in some instances if you check your
inbox on a regular basis you must have
noticed that we received some spam
emails that the mail providers like
Gmail and Yahoo can just filter into the
spam folder some of these messages
bypass this filter and make their way
into a person's inbox they look like
generic emails which are supposed to be
safe the Pegasus pyware targets such
occurrences by passing malicious
messages and links which install the
necessary Spy software on the user's
mobile device be it Android or an iPhone
this isn't unique to the email ecosystem
since it's equally likely to be targeted
by SMS text WhatsApp Instagram or even
the most secure messaging apps like
signal and threa once the malicious
links are clicked a spy package is
downloaded and installed on the device
after the Spy is successfully installed
the perpetrator who sent the payload to
the victim can monitor everything the
user does Pegasus can collect private
emails passwords images videos and every
other piece of information that passes
to the device Network all this data is
transmitted back to the central server
where the primary spying organization
can monitor the activities at a granular
level this is not even surface level
since complex Spy software like Pegasus
can access the roof root files on our
mobiles these root files hold
information that is crucial to the
working of the Android and iOS operating
systems leaking such private information
is a massive blow to the security and
the privacy of an individual the
information that may seem trivial like
the name of your Wi-Fi connection or the
last time you ordered an item from
Amazon are indeed all valuable
information this exploitation is
primarily possible due to the zero day
vulnerabilities known as bugs in the
software development process the zero de
bugs are the ones that have just been
discovered by some independent security
company or a researcher once they are
found reporting these vulnerabilities to
the developer of the platform which
would be either Google for Android or
Apple for iOS is the right thing to do
however many such critical bugs make
their way onto the dark web where
hackers can use them to create exploits
these exploits are then sent to innocent
users with a link or a message like we
had discussed before Pegasus was able to
affect the latest devices with the all
the security patches installed but some
bugs are not reported to the developers
or just cannot be fixed without breaking
some core functionality these become the
Gateway for spyware to enter into the
system you can never be 100% safe but
you sure can give it all in protecting
yourself the one thing where Pegasus
stands out is a zero click action
feature usually in spam emails the
malicious code is activated when the
user clicks the malware link a user user
doesn't need to click the link in the
new version of the Pegasus and a few
other spyware programs once the message
arrives in the inbox of WhatsApp Gmail
or any other chat applications the
spyware gets activated and everything
can be recorded and sent back to the
central server the primary issue with
being affected by spyware as a victim is
detection unlike Crypt Miners and troons
spying Services usually do not demand
many system resources which makes them
tough to detect after they have been
activated since many devices slow down
after a couple of years any kind of
Performance Set due to such spyware is
often attributed to poor software
longetivity by the users they do not
check meticulously for any other causes
that is causing the Slowdown when left
unchecked these devices can capture
voice and video from the mobile sensors
while keeping the owner in the dark
let's take a moment to check if we are
well aware of the causes of such attacks
how do users fall free to such spyware
programs a by installing untested
software B by clicking on the third
party links from email and messages C by
not keeping their apps and phones
updated or D all of the above let us
know your answers in the comment section
below and we will rev the correct answer
next week but what about the unaffected
devices the vulnerable ones while we
cannot be certain of our security there
are a few things we can do to boost our
device be it against Pegasus or the next
big SP on the market let's say we are
safe now and we have the time to take
the necessary steps to prevent a spyware
attack what are the things we can go for
a primary goal must always be to keep
our apps and the operating system
updated the latest security patches the
vulnerabilities that the exploits Target
are often discovered by developers from
Google and apple which send the security
patches quickly this can be done for
individual apps as well so keeping them
updated is of utmost importance while
the most secure devices have fall pre to
Pegasus as well a security patch from
developers may help in minimizing the
damage at a later stage or maybe negate
the entire spyware platform alog
together another big factor is the
spread of malware is the trend of
sideloading Android applications using
do APK files downloading such apps from
a third party website have no security
checks involved and are mostly
responsible for adware and spyware
invasions on user devices avoiding the
side loading of apps would be a major
step in protecting us
we often receive spam emails or texts
from people we may not know on social
medias they are accompanied with links
that allow malware to creep into our
device we should try to follow the
trusted websites and not click on any
links that redirect us to unknown
domains spy is a controversial segment
in governance while the ramifications
are pretty extreme in theory it severely
impacts user privacy against
authoritarian regimes sufficient
resources and a contingent plan can
alter the false veale of democracy
altogether even if our daily life is
rather simplistic we must understand
that privacy is not about what we have
to hide instead it portrays the things
we have to protect it stands for
everything we have to share with the
outside world both theorically and
literally hey everyone today we look at
the hack which took the World by storm
and affected multiple governments and
corporations the solar winds attack the
global statistics indicate that upward
of 18,000 customers have been affected
potentially needing billions to recover
the losses incurred before we have a
look at this hack Make sure to subscribe
to our Channel and hit the notification
Bell to never miss an update from Simply
learn the date is December 8th 2020 f a
global leader in company specializing in
cyber security released a blog post that
caught the attention of the entire it
Community a software known as Orion
which was developed by solar wison
incorporator had become a victim of a
remote access trojen or a rat the breach
was estimated to be running since the
spring of 2020 and went virtually
unnoticed for months the reveal sent the
developers of the Orion software into a
frenzy as they quickly released a couple
of hot fixes for their platform in order
to mitigate this threat and prevent
further damage but how did this come
into existence we first need to
understand the platform which was
responsible for this breach soloin a
software company based in Texas United
States had developed a management
platform known as Orion entering to
corporate operations and governments
worldwide oryan was responsible for the
monitoring and management of it
Administration this included managing
the client servers virtualization
components and even the organization
Network infrastructure that bought the
platform solar winds claims they have
more than 300,000 clients including US
government agencies and several Fortune
500 companies this entire chain can be
classified as a supply chain attack in
this variant of cyber crime the hackers
Target relatively weaker links in an
organiz Ganz A's chain of control and
delivery these are preferably services
rendered by a third party since there is
no direct jurisdiction over it in this
case the Orion platform was the primary
target the culprit however was software
updates the update server for solar
Orion had a malicious version attached
with malware or a Trojan to be precise
this was made possible since the code
repository that handled the software
updates was breached once the update
server repository was compromised the
source code of the applications be came
open to modification and malicious code
found its way onto the software the
remote access troen was attached to a
potential update nicknamed the Sunburst
update this update gave hackers back
door access to any client that uses the
correct version on its release many
clients believed the update to be
legitimate since it came from the right
source and they had no reason to believe
otherwise American government agencies
were supposedly hit the hardest as the
list of victims included the US
Departments of Homeland Security treas
Treasury and health several private
companies like Cisco Nvidia and Intel
were compromised according to a list
published by the cyber security firm
trusk most of the companies had issued
quick updates to fix these
vulnerabilities introduced by the
software while the actual perpetrators
have never been found it is believed
that this was an act of crossborder
corporate Espionage conducted by state
sponsored hackers either from Russia or
China before we move forward let's take
a recap of the things we learned what
category of malware was responsible for
the solar winds hack was it one a virus
a remote access Trojan a spyware or a
worm let us know your answers in the
comment section right away and we will
reveal the correct answer in a week
coming to possible reparations the Biden
government has launched a full
investigation on the effects and the
repercussions of this breach there are a
couple of things that we as consumers
must always tend to when working our way
through the worldwide web using a
password manager is highly recommended
which can generate secure alpha numeric
passwords you must also use different
passwords for different accounts thereby
reducing the chances of a single point
of failure should one of those accounts
get breached usage of two-factor
authentication applications is also
encouraged since it acts as a safety net
if hackers directly get a hold of our
credentials clicking on unknown links
transmitted via emails is also a strict
no as is installing applications from
unverified sources the solar wind hack
is estimated to cost the parent company
nearly $18 million as reparations making
it one if not the biggest hacks in
cyberspace history as recently as of
July 2021 the hackers accessed some us
attorneys Microsoft 365 email accounts
as part of the attack criminal
organizations like the FBI and CIA are
determined to figure out the culprits
responsible for this debacle however the
intricacy and the full extent of the
breach makes it a way more complicated
job than it looks on paper the day is
26th February
2022 the world is hit with breaking news
that Russian State tv channels have been
hacked by Anonymous a activist
Collective and movement who have made a
name taking part in multiple Cyber Wars
in the past decade this was in response
to the Russian aggression on Ukrainian
territory in the hopes of annexation
Anonymous hacked the Russian State TV
networks to combat propaganda in Russia
and highlight the damage to life Meed
out by the Kremlin in Ukraine they also
hacked 120,000 Russian troops personal
information and the Russian Central Bank
stealing 35,000 files this served as a
clear indicator of how cyber War can
change the momentum in battle something
which people had never seen so closely
so what is cyber War a digital assault
or series of strikes or hacks against a
country is sometimes referred to as a
cyber War it has the ability to cause
havoc on government and civilian
infrastructure as well as disrupt
essential systems CA ing State harm and
even death in this day and age the
internet plays a bigger role than just
watching videos and learning content
it's where you have your personal data
and carry Financial transactions so
rather than resorting to physical
violence cyber War has become the new
means to cause Havoc considering the
vulnerability of the data passing
through the internet in most
circumstances cyber warfare involves a
nation state attacking another in
certain cases the assaults are carried
out by terrorist organizations or non
State actors pursuing a hostile nation's
aim in June 2021 Chinese hackers
targeted organizations like Verizon to
secure remote access to their networks
stuck net was a computer worm designed
to attack Iran's nuclear facilities but
evolved and expanded to many other
industrial and energy producing sites in
2010 since the definition of cyber war
is so vague the applying rules and
sanctions based on digital assault is
even tougher making the field of cyber
warfare a lawless land not bound by any
rules or policies there are multiple
ways in which these attacks can be
carried out a major category of Cyber
attack is espionage Espionage entails
monitoring other countries to steal
critical Secrets this might include
compromising vulnerable computer systems
with botn Nets or spear fishing attempts
before extracting sensitive data in
cyber warfare the next weapon in cyber
war is sabotage government agencies must
identify sensitive data and its dangers
if it is exploited Insider threats such
as disgruntled or irresponsible
Personnel or government staff with ties
to the attacking country can be used by
hostile countries or terrorists to steal
or destroy information by overwhelming a
website with bogus requests and forcing
it to handle them denial of service
attacks prohibit real users from
accessing it attacking parties may use
this form of assault to disrupt key
operations and systems and prevent
citizens military and security officials
and research organizations from
accessing sensitive websites but what
benefits does Cyber War offer in
contrast to traditional physical Warfare
the most important Advantage is the
ability to conduct attacks from anywhere
Global without having to travel
thousands of miles as long as the
attacker and Target are connected to the
internet organizing and launching Cyber
Wars is relatively less tedious Than
Physical Warfare people living in or
battling for a country are subject to
propaganda attacks in an attempt to
manipulate their emotions and thoughts
digital infrastructure is highly crucial
in today's modern world starting from
communication channels to Secure Storage
servers crippling a country footprint
and control on the Internet is very
damaging but what are some of the ways
we as Citizens protect ourselves in the
case of a cyber war in the unfortunate
event that your country is involved in
Warfare be sure to fact check every
piece of information and follow only
trusted sources in that frame of time
even conversations online should be
limited to a need to know basis
considering propaganda campaigns have
the power to influence the tide of War
drastically it is highly crucial to
follow basic security guidelines to
secure our devices like regularly
updating our operating systems
occasionally running full system
antivirus scans Etc if your country or
organization is being attacked having
devices segregated in a network goes a
long way in bolstering security
try to avoid sharing a lot of personal
data online in this era of Instagram and
Facebook divulging private information
can be detrimental to keeping a secure
firewall for your data the more
information an attacker has access to
the higher his chances of being able to
devise a plan to infiltrate def fsis
today we will explore the world of cyber
security with hacker GPD specialized
version of Chad GPD designed for ethical
hacking and cyber security in a digital

offers guidance on a wide range of
topics including security practices
ethical hacking techniques and scripting
for system security cyber crime damages
are expected to reach $6 trillion
annually making it a major challenge for
organizations and if we talk about some
of the breaches so in 2020 over 36
billion record reps were exposed due to
data breaches and the infamous Equifax
breach of 2017 where 147 million
people's information was compromised
highlights the importance of regular
security assessments and vulnerability

and just a quick info for you guys if
you are an aspiring cyber security
professional looking for online training
and certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security from Mi University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
a right choice for more details you can
use the link in the description box and
M comment so let's get started so guys
this is Chad GPT and this is the paid
version of Chad GPT 40 and what I I was
telling you is this is the explore GPT
section so here you can find all the
gpts that are created by Chad GPT open a
or the individuals or you can find the
companies who have created gbts so you
can found these are the recently used
and this is the most used hacker GPT you
can find other gpts also that is hacker
GPT and you could see that and they have
been used by 5,000 plus users and this
have been used by 10,000 plus users so
you can just search for ethical gbt here
and it has been rated 4.5 Stars 10,000
plus conversations and these are the
conversation status if you need any
assistance and the capabilities you can
see here and the ratings given by users
and more by the Creator who has created
this so we'll start with this we'll
start the chat here and I want to tell
you guys that chity doesn't answer non
ethical questions so if you try to
extract that information from chat GPT
that won't be possible but we can do a
bit like we can cross a bit line with
ethical hacker GPT but that should be
used for ethical purposes only so I will
show you guys how you can utilize this
GPT and one more thing guys if you want
to create your own gbt you can also
create that also you can go to explore
GPT section and here's the create option
click on Create and here you can start
creating your gbt if you click on
configure you can write the name of your
gbt description instructions and the
conversation starters as you just saw
with the hacker gbt ethical hacker gbt
and the capabilities what do you want to
be enabled you can do that and here in
the create section you could write the
prompts here and it will take that
information and use it for more purposes
and here you could attach more files
that could help create your GPD okay
guys so so here you could see the
configuration and the preview of your
GPT and you can finalize that so moving
back we'll get back to ethical hacker
gbt and start with our conversation with
him so starting with the first thing we
can do is we can ask him like how can I
perform a basic security assessment on a
web application so if I tell you guys
performing a basic security assessment
on a web application is crucial for
identifying vulnerabilities and and
ensuring the application is secure and
this process involves using various
tools and techniques to test the
application for common security issues
so you could ask him that how can I
perform a basic
security assessment on a web
application and just wait for a few
seconds and you could have the response
from ethical hacker gvd so you could see
that performing a basic security
assessment on a web application involves
several key steps and these are the key
steps number one is preparation and
information gathering and how you can do
that these are the steps identify the
scope gather information than is the
Second Step that is reconnaissance and
you can use the tools BB suit ncto and
others similarly you could see all the
steps here so I won't be guiding or I
won't be reading what responses are
generated by ethical heog GB
I have used that and he provides very
accurate like I would say around 95 to
96% accurate results here I want to show
you guys how you can utilize it so I
will show you prompts and what things
you can ask him so this was all about
repeat so this was about the general
security thing now we'll move to ethical
hacking and we can ask him how we can
perform a SQL injection attack ethically
on a test environment so these are the
prompts that you can write that would be
how do I perform a SQL
injection attack and that to ethically
if you write this that would be good on
a test
environment and if I tell you guys so
SQL injection is one of the most common
web application vulnerabilities and
understanding how to perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment can help you identify and
mitigate this risk in your own
applications and you could see he has
responded and he has provided you the
steps that you can set up a control test
environment first thing then preparation
and you could use these tools then you
have the manual SQL injection testing so
these are the methods that you could use
that is or or 1 equal to 1 for the
database and automated SQL injection
testing so this is the command for that
and you could verify vulnerability
documentation reporting so you could see
that this GPD is capable of answering
the basic questions as we have discussed
the basics question till now now we'll
move to scripting and automation so here
you could see how he respond to this so
we'll ask him can you provide a python
script to scan open ports on a
network so let's see what he
provides provide a python script
and that to to scan
ports on a
network so scanning open ports on
network is a fundamental step in
identifying potential vulnerabilities
and a python script that can automate
this process making it easier to
regularly check for open ports and
secure them so this is the python script
you can use any ID and Run net and you
could see that he's explaining the code
also yeah you can ask him like can you
explain the code line by line and this
hacker gbt will do that for you and how
to run the script that also he has
provided you and similarly we can also
ask him that how we can write a bash
script to Monitor and log unauthorized
login attempts and if you want I can
also run this prompt how do I write uh
bash
script and that to
Monitor and log unauthorized
access unauthorized login
attempts so we can monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and that
would be essential for maintaining the
security of your system so as you can
see he has written A bash script and
that can help you automate this process
and this will provide real time alerts
and logs for further analysis and you
could see that he's providing the
explanation and how you can run the
script and he's writing the note also
like you can write more prompts if you
have any doubts in any of the script or
any of the responses that hacker GPT has
responded and he will definitely provide
you with good responses so now moving on
now we'll ask this ethical hacker GPD
about some specific security tools
and we could ask him about BB suit and
so let's write a prompt can you
explain how to
configure and use BB
suit um or we can write for web
application
testing so if I sum you up so BB suit is
a powerful tool for web application
security testing and understanding how
to configure and use it effectively can
help you identify and address a wide
range of security vulnerabilities in
your applications so you could see he
has provided the initial steps that
would be downloading and installing BB
suit configuring your browser to use BB
suit as a proxy and then intercept and
inspect traffic and then you can use it
for testing purpose logging and
Reporting and tips for Effective testing
so this is the response for the security
tools and if we talk about incident
response we can ask him to write a
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so collecting system
logs is a critical part of incident
response and forensic analysis and this
script can automate processes that can
ensure that you have all the necessary
data to investigate security incidents
effectively so if I write here we can
ask this hacker gbt and I'm sure he will
provide the response for that and write
the script
so can you provide a
script to collect system
logs for forensic
analysis so as I told you this is the
critical part of incident response and
we have covered about the tools that is
BB suit we have asked him about the
automation process General cyber
security question ethical hacking that
would be SQL injection attack and the
python script tools scan open ports on a
network so he can write scripts also
automation task and he could response
with the general cyber security
questions also and if you see here for
the incident response he has writed the
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so I won't be
explaining this code as we're just
looking for the prompts that we can give
to ethical HGT if you want you could
just ask him also that explain this code
line by line and here he has mentioned
also the explanation that is directories
and files to collect and after that he
is collecting the logs and that would be
copied in the directory that is he has
mentioned it a variable that is output
directory archiving logs cleanup and how
to run the script so this was about the
incident response Now we move to some
Advanced topics and in advanced topics
what we can ask him is he how to perform
a man in the- Middle attack in a
controlled environment and remember this
that you have to mention some of the
keywords that would be in a controlled
environment and for that thing only he
will response or provide the response to
you so I will start here that how do I
perform um man in
the middle attack
in a control
environment so if you understand man in
the middle attack that works in a
controlled environment this can help you
develop better defenses against such
attacks and it's important to learn and
practice these techniques ethically so
you can see here that he's providing the
prerequisites and the step by-step guide
how you can conduct a man in the middle
attack so first is set up the control
environment then install necessary tools
enable IP forwarding perform ARP
spoofing and then capture and analyze
traffic clean up and restore the network
and conclusion so you could just follow
up with more prompts that I want more
information about setting up the control
environment just write this prompt and
this ethical hacker GPT will provide
more responses to you so he will provide
you how you can set up the control
environment so now moving on we will ask
some more prompts and that would be
about the reverse engineering so we
could ask him that can you explain the
processes of reverse engineering a
malware sample or we can also ask about
honey port to detect malicious activity
that could be how can I Implement a
honey port to detect malicious activity
or what are the techniques for securing
a Docker container so we'll ask him one
promt here let's see what he responds to
that so how can
I Implement
a honey port to detect malicious
activity so you could see that he
started responding to that and if I tell
you the sum so a Hy Port is a security
mechanism set to detect deflect or in
mechanism to some Manner and it
counteract attempts at unauthorized use
of Information Systems implementing a
honey Port can help you Monitor and
understand attack patterns and this is
the step byep guide to implement a honey
Port you can choose the type of Honey
Port prepare your environment install
and configure the honey Port software
and these are all the commands how you
can configure it then you can monitor
and analyze the honey port and regular
maintenance and updates and this is the
simple handb using honey you could
install that and run these commands so
with that guys and in the last we'll
also cover cyber security policies and
compliance so he could also answer to
those prompts also that you can ask him
that what should be included in a
company cyber security policy and you
could mention which type of company you
are running so I will ask him that so
you could ask him that what should be
included in know uh attech
companies cyber security
policy so let's
see so you could see here that creating
comprehensive security policy for an
atte company involves adding various
aspects
and that would be introduction first is
the purpose for cyber security policy
scope roles and responsibilities data
protection and privacy Network Security
application security user security
awareness and training incident response
and management compliance and legal
requirements physical security device
and endpoint security so similarly you
could ask him that draft me the
company's cyber security policy and
start with the introduction so he will
provide you all the introduction points
and then you can ask him that draft
roles and responsibilities he will draft
that also so you could like break it
into parts and ask the ethical hacker
gbt and he will respond to you as it has
some limitations of some words and some
of the responses so you could ask him in
the breaking parts and he will respond
to you hey there Learners welcome to
Simply learn today we will see the
starting journey in cyber security that
is super exciting but can be a bit
daunting so to help you out we are going
to talk about some common mistakes that
beginners often make and how you can
avoid them if you're just getting
started or looking to improve your
skills this guide will set you on the
right path so let's dive in and make
sure your cyber security career gets off
to a strong start so let's get started
and we'll see the worst beginner cyber
security mistakes everyone makes and
we'll start with the number one point
that is ignoring Basics so many
beginners rush into advanced topics
without mastering the basics which can
lead to confusion and frustration later
on it's essential to build a strong
Foundation before diving into complex
subjects if we talk about number one is
understanding networking networking is
the backbone of cyber security learn how
data travels across networks different
types of networks like Lan and Van and
basic networking protocols knowing how
Network protocol functions help you
understand how attacks occur and how to
defend against them then comes mastering
operating systems so operating systems
are another critical area whether it's
Windows Linux or Macos you need to know
how different o work and learn about
file systems user management and basic
command line skills so this knowledge is
crucial for tasks like manure analysis
and system hardening then comes the
basic coding skills so coding is an
invaluable skill in cyber security you
can start with a simple language like
Python and learn how to write scripts to
task analyze data and understand the
logic behind software vulnerabilities so
basic coding skills will help you
comprehend how attacks are carried out
and how to develop counter measures so
taking the time to master these Basics
will make advanced topics much easier to
understand and will set a solid
foundation for your career in cyber
security so remember it's a journey and
starting with the basics will ensure you
build strong lasting knowledge now we'll
come to number second point that is skip
hands on practice so this is also one of
the cyber security mistakes that
beginners make cyber security isn't just
about Theory practical experience is
crucial and many beginners Focus too
much on reading and studying without
applying what they have learned this
creates a gap between knowledge and Real
World skills so the number one point
here is setting up a home lab so create
a home lab with an old computer or
virtual machine to practice what you
learn install different operating
systems set up Networks works and
simulate attacks in a controlled
environment then comes real world
scenarios so use your home lab to
practice real world scenarios like
configuring firewalls and detecting
intrusions platforms like hack the box
and try hack me offer cyber security
challenges that mimic real life networks
and systems then comes building
confidence so Hands-On practice builds
confidence so solving real problems and
seeing the results of your actions make
you more comfortable with cyber security
tools and techniques and this confidence
is crucial when making quick informed
decision in this field so gaining
practical experience Bridges the gap
between theory and practice making you a
more effective and confident cyber
security professional so now we'll see
the third mistake that cyber security
beginners make that is lack of
documentation so documenting your work
is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect
of cyber security many beginners Focus
solely on learning new skills and
solving problems without keeping track
of their progress however good
documentation practices can
significantly enhance your learning
experience and by keeping detailed notes
on what you learn the tools you use and
the methods you apply you create a
valuable resource for future reference
and this habit helps you review and
reinforce your knowledge making it
easier to remember complex Concepts
additionally well documented work allows
you to share your insights and solutions
with others whether through blogs
presentations or team collaborations it
also helps in troubleshooting as you can
quickly revisit your steps to identify
where something might have gone wrong so
in the professional World documentation
is essential for maintaining clear and
efficient communication within a team
and by starting this practice early you
will develop a habit that will benefit
you throughout your career and now we'll
move to the fourth cyber security
mistake for beginners that is waiting
too long to start applying for jobs so
common mistake many beginners make is
waiting until they feel perfectly
qualified before applying for cyber
security jobs this approach can be
counterproductive the truth is you might
never feel completely ready and waiting
too long can cause you to miss out on an
valuable opportunity so start applying
for jobs early in your Learning Journey
the process of applying and interviewing
is a learning experience in itself it
helps you understand what employers are
looking for and it can highlight areas
where you need to improve so early job
applications also provide you with real
world feedback and networking
opportunities remember many entry-level
positions are designed for people who
are still learning and growing in this
field so employers often value
enthusiasm willingness to learn and
problem solving skills as much as they
do technical knowledge so by starting
early you can gain experience and build
confidence even if you are not yet
perfectly qualified and then comes the
next mistake that is trying to qualify
for for all jobs so in the vast field of
cyber security trying to qualify for
every job out there is a common but
misguided approach cyber security
encompasses a wide range of specialities
from network security and ethical
hacking to incident response and
security analysis instead of spreading
yourself thin trying to learn everything
focus on a key few areas and become
proficient in them specializing in
special Fields make you more valuable to
potential employers it's better to be an
expert in one or two areas than to have
superficial knowledge in many so by
focusing on specific skills you can
develop a better understanding and
expertise that sets you apart from
others so this focused approach also
makes it easier to stay updated with the
latest trends and advancements in your
chosen areas remember depth of knowledge
often outweighs bread when it comes to
career advancement and job
satisfaction so this was all about
trying to qualify for all jobs now we'll
see the biggest mistake that is it
Foundation fallacy so many aspiring
service Security Professionals believe
they need a deep it background to start
their career this is same as the number
one point but this is a misconception
while having a solid foundation in it
can be beneficial it's not a
prerequisite for success in cyber
security what you need are the specific
skills and practical experience focus on
learning about networks operating system
and security tools engage in Hands-On
practice through labs and simulations to
build Real World skills
cyber security is a field where
practical knowledge and the ability to
apply Concepts matter more than
theoretical it knowledge and many
successful cyber Security Professionals
come from diverse backgrounds including
those with minimal it experience so they
succeed by continuing learning and
adapting to New Challenges so don't let
the lack of deep it Foundation hold you
back concentrate on gaining the skills
and experience that are directly
relevant to the cyber security roles you
are interested in now moving to number
seven that is not attending cyber
security events so attending cyber
security events is one of the best ways
to stay updated and connected in the
field these events including conferences
webinars and meetups offer a wealth of
information on the latest trends tools
and threats in cyber security they
provide a platform to learn from experts
gain insights into industry developments
and discover new technologies
additionally these events are excellent
networking opportunities meeting other
professionals that can lead to job
opportunity ities collaborations and
mentorship building a network within the
cyber security Community can provide
support and guidance throughout your
career and many events also offer
Hands-On workshops and training sessions
that can enhance your practical skills
so by actively participating in these
events you can demonstrate your
commitment to continuous learning and
professional development make it a habit
to attend cyber security events
regularly to stay engaged and informed
so this was all about number seventh
point that is not attending cyber
security events now moving to number
eight that is obsessing or which
specialization to choose so when
starting a career in cyber security many
beginners obsess over which
specialization to choose this can be
overwhelming and counterproductive
instead of stressing about making the
perfect choice allow yourself the
freedom to explore different areas of
cyber security the field is diverse with
specializations like penetration testing
incident Response Security analysis and
more take the time to experiment with
various topics and see what interest you
the most this exploration phase is
valuable for gaining a broad
understanding of this field so over time
you will naturally gravitate toward
areas that align with your strengths and
interest so remember your specialization
can evolve as you gain more experience
and insights early in your career focus
on building a solid foundation and
gaining exposure to different aspects of
cyber security this approach allows you
to make an informed decision about your
specialization when the time comes
ensuring you choose a path that truly
excites and motivates you thank you guys
