yeah happiness hope you're doing good
so now i am here to explain
how to handle
general pathology in the most simplest
way okay so always do make a note okay
so your seniors have done well and there
was the result was extraordinary okay
and they have given so much of positive
vibes to all of you that anyone anyone
at any level
whether an intern from any sort of
college
can end up with great ranks so this was
proven by so many of your seniors
in the first attempt and few of them in
the second attempt okay so these are all
like positive vibes and these are ray of
hopes for your preparation
so this general path i'm going to start
with this
always keep in mind that this
preparation or this year
is going to be your best and last
preparation this is what the code i
always give to every student okay the
only thing is you keep your work
you keep your best work for this year
by which you can make this as the best
and the last preparation so you know no
need to repeat the exam again and again
to see betterment in your scores or in
the marks
so taking ahead of course general path i
hope you remember your general path
which you have done in the second bds
and i hope like most of us have done
general path in combination with
microbiology okay so because micro and
general path together are one
university paper for us during second
year and of course it is given least
importance at that particular point but
here as
as we go with an integrated preparation
okay so as we always go within a
integrated preparation general path is
always combined with oral path
is combined with
oral medicine
is combined with general medicine
is combined with physiology in majority
of the situations
so keeping all these subjects these
integrated subjects in mind and of
course most of your questions in the
examination hall will move in and around
these subjects so keeping that in the
mind okay i tried my best to segregate
few important topics which are
exclusively related to general pathology
so we are going to do these topics now
and whatever they are integrated with
whether it is with oral path whether
it's oral medicine general medicine or
physio we will try to do when when we
encounter those respective subjects at
that particular time
so first of all you try to focus on many
my main contents okay so try to focus on
the conquer schedule and try to finish
the tasks and uh
i mean the the the tasks of the goals
that are given for a specific date
on a specific time
okay i hope this is very clear so this
particular subject is going to get
integrated with many other subjects and
coming to the uh just a glance over the
blueprints of the neet and as well as
ini cdt or whether you're preparing for
any sort of
license exam throughout the world okay
so there are basic empirical rules that
you have to follow for this particular
subject of general pathology
so coming to the need okay the golden uh
the gold the gold standard examination
for most of the aspirants in the country
if you take need neet has clearly given
general pathology in combination with
microbiology is going to carry 14 marks
so general pathology alone is going to
carry seven to eight score of course if
it is being integrated to in any of
these four subjects it can be increased
but general path exclusively is going to
carry somewhere around seven to eight
marks in need
and coming to ini cet so
in ict they are not following a
particular blueprint okay sometimes you
see more repeats in inicd sometimes you
see less repeats in iict sometimes you
see more questions from general
pathology sometimes you see limited
questions related to general pathology
because in majority situations they'll
try to integrate general path with other
subjects so considering all of these i
can code somewhere around eight to ten
marks
for general pathology in ironicating but
more of preparation of need or ini cd or
any sort of national or international
license examinations is almost the same
okay means there will be questions
coming from the core concepts of the
subjects and of course if you take need
sometimes the repeats will be more
sometimes the repeats will be less and
same goes with ini cd okay reading a
repeat is completely a different
ideology
okay that which we are going to do in
the second round or in the last phase or
or the or the end part of each subject
now we are planning to discuss and
finish the repeats of so that your
scoring will be better in the final exam
but
learning the core concepts is same for
any sort of entrance or
at any mode of your preparation whether
you are reading the subject for the
first time or second time or third time
core concepts are always you should
master the core concepts so keeping core
concepts in mind and keeping the
strategy of integrated preparation of
mds conquer in mind i try to list out
few topics of general pathology which
has to be done thoroughly in the
upcoming 10 days i cannot give more than
a week or 10 days for general pathology
because its scoring is 7 to 8 in need
and hardly 8 to 10 marks in imic
so we tried our best
in providing
the refined filtered content in the form
of smart videos in the form of smart
notes in the form of a number of topic
specific and subject specific
questions with proper explanations and
of course evening activities will be
there pro live classes will be there
offline classes will be there according
to the plan which you have choosed so we
tried our best to provide you the
refined content and i want you to
you to finish this refined content in
the limited time and try to do and round
sub revision so that's the main goal of
the general path okay so coming to
general path okay
a proper proper
seven to eight days of preparation is
required for this particular subject
okay sometimes we we allocate like ten
day ten hour days in the first round and
probably five or six odd days in the
second round this is how we used to
handle general path in round one and
round two and these are the topics that
you have to finish from general path at
any cost and we'll try our best to
provide as much content as possible
related to the general pathology in the
form of smart videos and smart notices
so coming to the topics in detail
discussion coming to the cell adaptation
okay so in which you have to learn top
to bottom about reversible irreversible
injuries and all the
three or four types of cell adaptations
your hypertrophy hyperplasia metaplasia
hope you remember all of these which we
have learned okay so please do the cell
adaptations and try to focus more on the
examples and the differences between
different types of adaptation followed
by cell injury followed by cell necrosis
so your apoptosis your necrosis your
different types of calcifications
okay all these which we have done at uc
level has to be done thoroughly by
following the smart video session
then the second topic is the wound
healing okay and wound healing or the
tissue repair okay so this is a topic
where
we encounter this topic in many subjects
integratedly like general surgery the
topic is there oral surgery where we
will be focusing more on healing of an
extracted socket
okay and in oral pathology also we talk
about the healing wound healing and
everything and of course this is again
repeated in perio also
healing of flaps and all this directly
or indirectly the mechanism is almost
the same even in a endodontical surgery
micro surgery of endo we talk about this
wound healing and everything and try to
finish the basics of the wound healing
and tissue repair here
coming to acute and chronic inflammation
that is the mediators of acute
inflammation how it occurs and followed
by the chronic inflammation because we
have
questions in recent neet examination two
questions on chronic inflammation are
there simple and direct questions and
followed by i want you to finish
hemodynamic changes what are the changes
physiology that occurs leading to edema
okay amyloidosis is very very important
topic gene numbers
okay gene numbers and genetics and
pedigree pedigree charts okay and mode
of inheritance examples are very very
important autosomal dominant autosomal
resistor x-linked resistor x-linked
dominant and all these are very familiar
questions so they're going to give a
disease and they're going to ask you
what is the mode of inheritance of this
particular disease all of the following
are autosomal dominant except one
identify that one so these examples are
very very important and we tried our
best to provide these examples with lots
of mnemonics so that you can remember
the memory based content in the most
easiest way and i will try to provide
you a special examination on the
pedigree chats as well as the mode of
inheritance so that you can exercise
these memory based
contents
then goes with the neoplasm okay where
you need to learn about the
malignant benign
oncogenes respective genes or gene
markers responsible for occurrence of
a particular
carcinoma or a particular disease and
all these two things to be done so apart
from this there are many other minor
topics where the paper settlers are
frequently asking questions and all
these contents will be done in your
activities as well as in the pro-life
classes as well as in the offline
sessions so recently previously we never
used to have a a path histopathology
diagram based question but now you can
see this histopathology diagram based
questions which are very common and
familiar both in in ict as well as knee
so it's mandatory that we have to do
some or most of the histopathologies
related to the head and neck okay and
related to the lungs apart so they're
going to ask you very common questions
okay cirrhosis of liver histopathology
hepatitis histopathology lung carcinoma
that is squamous cell carcinoma
histopathology
small cell carcinoma histopathology
histopathology
amyloidosis histopathology tb
histopathology so such very familiar
things they are going to ask they are
not going to go the deeper contents
which mbbs students will because if it
is in a preparation of general pathology
for mbbs is so tricky because
you need to learn about the top to
bottom from head and neck so here we
have to focus more on head and neck and
followed by all very important organs
followed by their most common disease of
sister pathology has to be done and
which we are going to provide
a video in which we'll try to discuss
all these histopathologies and followed
by i am going to keep n number of exams
so that
you can
you can exercise them that is very very
important to identify these two
pathology questions and most of the
histopathology questions i know that
most of you have done uh books like
harsh mohan which is very very good book
but
paparazzi is the love to pick questions
directly from robinson
okay so whenever you want to read
histopathology content diagram based
content specifically rather than harsha
mohan i recommend you to go to robinson
so that you will you will get least
confused in the examination hall because
they love to pick questions from that
particular area whether it is neet or in
ict because previous questions were
directly taken from robinson
so coming to the book of reference has
already discussed robbins is the book of
the book of
reference for your
general pathology okay
as most of us are reading including me
we used to read from harsham there's
nothing bad okay you can keep like if
you have your book with you
whenever you require any sort of
reference or any sort of clarity nothing
wrong you can go back to harsha mohan
and you can
refer
refer and you can get back to the
content okay but
i want you guys to stick on to the
content of mds conquer because we tried
our best either the smart
smart videos
or either the smart notes or either the
mcqs
that we are
planning to provide for this particular
subject in a huge content and followed
by the pro-life students will have
pro-life access and offline students
will have offline access so basing upon
your plan okay so try to focus and
finish the checklist of
the contents checklist of contents for
each topic of general pathology and make
sure you use the website and app in the
most efficient way to finish these
contents as fast as possible okay i
still see there are students who are not
able to finish the contents within the
time
they are not able to allocate proper
time for the preparation okay don't no
need to write huge notes because the
video content of the smart notes content
will be available on your app
throughout your preparation phase okay
so there is no need to worry and i don't
want you to add heavy notes
heavy tables heavy descriptive part okay
heavy things
on the
on your notes you simply write for
example you are watching a video of
calcifications okay different types of
calcifications or the difference between
the calcifications okay you no need to
you don't need to write whatever that is
there as a slide or whatever that is
there as a written content on the video
to your notes you simply write okay 5
minutes 35 seconds
35 seconds time zone in a particular
video of cell injury
cell injury one table is there i have to
refer this table you keep you keep with
a different color coding okay red color
i have to refer this table
you write this in the notes
okay few things you have to write few
things tables flow charts lengthy things
or a descriptive part things okay if you
feel like your time is being congested
okay because there are students from
gdc's okay where they have heavy op or a
private call is having heavy op or the
private call is whenever you are being
posted in a departments like
conservative or departments like
prosthetics or different departments
like oral medicine radiology or oral
surgery definitely you will have
a better op you will have better opioids
more than a double op when compared to
departments like orthopedic perio or any
other department so whenever you're
posted you feel like okay i'm going
behind the schedule i'm not able to cope
up with the schedule in such cases don't
write heavy notes okay the main concept
of writing a notes is converting a
short-term memory to long-term memory so
writing notes is not only the method
where your short-term memory is going to
convert into long-term memory there are
many other methods even if you read five
times also
five times planned organized preparation
your short-term memory will be converted
to long-term memory but i see most of
the interns and most of you you're
writing notes but you're writing notes
with the burden so whenever you're
writing notes with a burden writing
notes without satisfaction your
short-term memory will not convert into
long-term memory so the main goal of
writing notes is to convert a short term
to long term memory which we are not
able to reach we are writing notes but
we are writing with lots of burden so in
such cases you can follow these simple
simple smart things in your preparation
so that
you can achieve the goal of converting a
short-term memory to long-term memory in
less possible time
because in terms few of your interns few
of you are working in the clinics you
have less time so use the time in the
most efficient way okay let's use the
time in the most smartest way and try to
implement these
suggestions which are given by me to
your preparation and you can see an
extraordinary changes within a couple of
days within a week or five days you can
see an extraordinary changes in your
preparation
okay i hope now you got a basic idea
about the general pathology so even if
you see the basic mcq books that most of
the dental students that read so general
pathology has an exclusive topic called
as blood
okay so what they discuss in this blood
they discuss about the disorders of the
rbc disorders of the wbc okay rbc
disorders wbc disorders and platelet
disorders
so which are what are important in rbc
disorders the anemias are more important
wbc leukemias are more important okay
right so all these contents rather than
doing in general pathology they have to
be done in combination with physio and
medicine in the upcoming few months okay
so what i'm doing is we have excluded
the blood blood disorders from general
pathology so whatever the pathological
futures whatever histopathological
diagrams of these diseases are very
important which has to be done
integrated with general medicine and
physio so i am excluding this blood
disorders
okay chapter from general pathology
because this chapter we are going to do
along with physio and medicine so apart
from that chapter i try to
include each and every content related
to the preparation
in
general pathology as of now okay so
don't come out and tell me sir this is
not included that is not included
everything is included here okay here
the reason is we go with an integrated
mode of preparation we don't go with the
subject wise mode of preparation of
course we ask you to do a particular
subject at a particular time but the
main advantage of being a part of mds
conqueror is whatever that is important
will be done in common we don't force
you to do blood here again
doing blood and physio again doing blood
in medicine again doing blood in
different different areas is going to
keep a burden and your concepts will be
diluted so i will give a decent time for
blood during physio and medicine where
pathology will be done along with the
physio and medicine but i'll make sure
that that you will be so strong in the
concepts so that if a question is coming
in the final exam around these chapters
it will be very easy for you to handle
so love learning with team mds conquer
if you have any doubts or anything we
are always open to help you out so this
is the contact number of mds conquer
which you can make it okay so take care
all the best and will be coming up with
a few
other updates
on your respective groups thank you
signing off dr srikanth from team mds
concur
bye take care
