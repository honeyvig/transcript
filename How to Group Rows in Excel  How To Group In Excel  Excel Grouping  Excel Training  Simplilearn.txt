let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to group rows and
columns in Excel now on my spreadsheet
you can see some data which is the sales
data of quarterly basis and the four
different zones that is North West South
East so you can you know make things
look better by hiding these columns and
if you hide these columns it's critical
for the end user to identify which
columns are exactly hidden right to make
things a little easier for your end user
you can select the columns and then go
to the data option and in the data
option click on the group option so this
will group these columns and you will
have this symbol of minimization which
will help you hide these columns
automatically and unhide these columns
automatically now let's also try to
group ghij columns
and there you go now similarly let's
also try to group the rows of North
and rows of West
then you have the rows of South
and rows of East
right now all these rows and columns
have been grouped now all you can do is
just click on the minimize button and
those will be minimized similarly the
rows right
and to unhide them all you can do is
click on the plus icon and they will be
unhidden
you can also try to ungroup the columns
and rows all you have to do is select
the columns and click on the ungroup
option similarly the rows as well
and that's how you can group and ungroup
rows and columns in Excel with that we
