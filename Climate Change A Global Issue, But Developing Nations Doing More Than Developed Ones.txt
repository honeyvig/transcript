all right I think this is probably one
of the most important conversations that
I feel um are integral when you talk
about uh what will be the shape and
future of a new world order because at
the end of the day it's the challenges
that need to be answered and climate
challenges I think one can safely say is
one that knows No Boundaries it most
certainly doesn't go according to gdps
and developed and developing status it
impacts every country and which is why
you need CH answers together and I'm
hopeful that we'll find some of those
today in this August panel a quick
introduction is in order we'll get Eric
solim as well he's the former minister
of climate and environment of Norway
he's joining us from Oslo uh Excellency
Lindy Cameron is here she's uh British
High Commissioner to India harit Singh
Global engagement director fossil fuel
non prif foration treaty initiative and
we have Mr shishir priad dasi who's the
president of the Clinton chinon Research
Foundation thank you so much all of you
for taking out the time and Eric is also
with us uh here uh let me start by
asking one thing which I think would
also set the context of why this
conversation is so important which is
the fact that um the speed with which we
are seeing climate catastrophes
happening around the world uh their
recurence is now um is is happening at
an alarming Pace um developed countries
are facing um extreme challenges but
that also gives an idea about the fact
that if uh the largest countries are
struggling then the extent of impact for
developing and poor countries is I think
frankly unimaginable because they don't
have the framework the solutions and
response as well so that's one question
I feel that all of you should answer in
terms of when you talk about climate
catastrophes uh their impact their speed
how does that uh play into the urgency
with which governments need to find a
solution ma'am let's start with
you thank you I think you're absolutely
right I think the lived experience of
climate emergencies helps people to
understand why their governments need to
take policy action now and you nowhere
is that more evident actually than here
in India you know seeing the floods the
the landslides in in Kola and in Aisha
so I think it it is really helpful in
driving that sense of urgency and we
know that matter is not just in in
helping to build the global consensus
for policy change but also in helping
people to invest in what they need for
resilience so we've been really proud
for example to be a Founder member along
with India um of cdri the Coalition for
disaster resilient infrastructure you
which is helping to ensure that best
practice from India is actually
delivered in the global Sou to ensure
that infrastructure is built in a
resilient way and we know that we know
that is really good value for money we
know that every dollar invested in
resilient infrastructure you know pays
off four times over so it is important
and it is really urgent we're also
really proud of what the UK government
is doing I mean my new government takes
climate change incredibly seriously um
it was one of the first speeches that
our new foreign secretary gave
highlighting the importance and the
urgency of the climate and nature crisis
and we were really proud for example
that we've literally just closed the
last UK Coal Fire parate
on our journey to to uh carbon free
electricity by
2030 okay all right sir you want to
respond and then I get it Mr P as well
yeah I totally agree uh with um The High
Commissioner uh that
this series of disasters that we have
seen uh which are not only affecting
developing countries but also developed
countries are serving as a wakeup call
and many countries are stepping up uh
but I also see a risk and I must
highlight here uh that as rich countries
are going get more and more affected by
climate change which they did not
imagine just a couple of years ago they
were thinking that only developing count
something that only happens to other
parts of the world it a happening here
and most vulnerable countries who are
going to be struggling uh with impacts
uh who also have very less capacity to
deal with it uh they did not really uh
invested enough domestically uh in
preparing for resilience we have seen in
Germany we have seen in the UK in the US
so now the challenge is going to be and
that's the risk that they're going to
start looking a lot more inwards which
means they are going to be far more
cautious about the resources that they
invest in the international cooperation
they're going to start using it
internally and that challenge remains so
on one hand it serves as a wakeup call
but on the other hand it may impact the
flow of Finance to developing countries
I hate to give a comparison to that it's
reminding me of the covid vaccines
unfortunately that you know you start
looking more inwards than if you know
ensuring that some of the other uh most
affected Parts also are brought into the
amb of uh protection Mr
Pria thank you uh and a very good
morning to everyone uh look while it's
true that the kind of uh uh you know
disasters we are seeing are spread all
over the world but I think we shouldn't
shy away from saying that it's impacting
far more those who were historically
much less responsible for the State of
Affairs that we are in today you know we
we try and talk that it's fairly uniform
across the globe it's definitely not not
sure in terms of natural disasters it
may be but if you look at the kind of
migrations that are happening within
countries because of the extreme heat
that is being generated it's much more
in the most vulnerable and developing
countries that's one but the second
Point again it's it's like it's like a
point of caution that while the
narrative must be on
sustainability for a lot of developing
countries and I think India included
very strongly in that that narrative
should actually become a three-prong
narrative we fight on sustainability but
we don't at all lose our emphasis on
economic growth and energy security for
a country like India we've got to ensure
that every single Nook and corner of
this country has reliable and affordable
I think the key word is Affordable
energy we must also not forget the fact
that India is aiming to be a developed
country at
2047 all three must go hand in hand
indeed and and that's a question I'm
going to come to in a bit after giving
Eric Johns to come up with opening
comments which is about the trust
deficit and also the fact that you can't
have the same Finishing Line If you
don't have the same starting point and I
think that's the fundamental point in
terms of the trust deficit that exists
on issue related to climate But Eric
come in there on the fact that uh uh
will these unfortunate incidents that
are happening very regularly become a
catalyst towards a more concerted action
towards these climate
challenges I agree to what everyone else
in the panel said about the seriousness
of the climate crisis and I also for
sure agree that not we should not blame
India or or the developing world look us
emissions up to today per capita are 25
times Indian so no one should blame
India but the game changer is not this
the game changer is something
fundamentally different and that is for
the the first time in human history it's
possible to see environment action and
climate action as an opportunity not
just a problem climate change is a huge
problem but it's also an enormous
opportunity and let me give you one
example and the Indian state of good out
has now set the target to 100 gwatt of
renewable energy by 2030 and in the
combination of the good leadership from
prime minister mod at the center the
leadership from the state of fut of and
engagement of AD and Reliance and all
big industrialist I'm pretty confident
that we'll reach these go and look it's
enormous that is for instance 20 times
the entire energy grid of Nigeria which
is the biggest nation in Africa H if
guat reaches this aim it will put guat
only the state of G not India but state
of good would then be the eighth biggest
Nation in the world when it comes to
Renewables so this is big big big and
it's an opportunity for prosperity for
jobs for income for driving the state
towards towards development so G is not
seeing climate change just as a problem
but as an enormous opportunity and the
same spirit is there with prime minister
Mi and is there in many other states of
India like tamad or with the new
leadership of Andra Pradesh and can
mention a lot more and the old days
where the discussion was do we want to
take care of Mother Earth or do we want
to develop that's gone now we can
develop and take care of Mother Earth by
seeing it all as an opportunity all
right uh you want to respond you want to
come in there in terms of what he's
saying okay uh then then let me come to
the other bit which I think is
fundamental to being able to solve the
climate uh puzzle so to say which is
which is around the trust deficit where
I say that uh developing countries say
historical polluters uh now want
everybody to have the same Finishing
Line when we didn't start at the same
time we can't be paying for sins of uh
developed countries that's essentially
the Crux of the argument and that's
where it boils down to uh ma'am I want
you to respond to how do you bridge that
trust deficit before making any
meaningful progress so I think you've
got a real Point our foreign secretary
said in his speech that he had heard
that develop devel countries didn't
believe the system worked for them um
and it's really important we recognize
that but it's also important to
recognize we all live in the same Planet
so ultimately we do all live in the same
world and it's therefore important that
both countries like the UK commit to the
ambitious goals we've committed to for
example you know Net Zero by 2050 you
decarbonized electricity by 2030 you
it's incredibly important we do that you
know to address our responsibilities
it's also important that we ensure the
scale of climate Finance is available to
help India and other countries grow grow
at the pace they want to create that
lowcost you know low carbon electricity
that allows for the incredible ambition
India has you in a in a way that doesn't
increase the the risks for the planet
and I think that potential is there
there's a lot we can do as governments
we're committed to MDB reform for
example to making sure there is more
affordable Finance we're also committed
to making sure that the city of London
as a center for Global Finance helps to
unlock the potential of the private
sector for this and indeed we're working
here in India on you know technology and
research to ensure that supporting those
incredibly ambitious goals I really do
think after 6 months in India that you
know India is the place where this is
going to happen it is the country that
matters most for the future of the
planet and for climate change because
India's ambition for development should
not in any way be constrained by the
responsibilities of the
planet indeed um I I want to take both
of you your opinion on on what uh mam
said on what ma'am said in terms of uh
the fact that developing countries need
to uh find that fine balance in terms of
funds and also shouldering some of the
responsibility how far back can you go
in time when you need to look forward in
terms of the climate challenges and also
how do you find those Innovative new
green funding models that work both for
investors and for
governments so uh I'm I'm really glad
that the High Commissioner uh talked
about both developed countries taking a
lot more action back home and also
finance and um and we really welcome the
new government as climate activists
because we have been missing uh the role
of uh the UK over the last 10 years or
so we've seen a lot of backtracking and
and you know the trust deficit is
because of a reason uh when we see as as
India and other developing countries
facing tremendous pressure to move away
from fossil fuels and we must but the
reality is when you have millions who
don't have access to energy you need
that support whereas developed countries
is continuing to expand fossil fuels
Eric is here from Norway and I must
mention here when you look at the global
fossil fuel
expansion Australia Canada Norway UK and
the US put together are responsible for
more than 50% of fossil fuel expansion
between now and 2050 that's where the
trust deficit come from and they open
some of these plants in the last couple
of years as well exactly when they face
pressure so I agree that the trust
deficit is real and then you don't even
deliver on finance so of course there's
a change in the government and now uh in
the UK they've decided not to issue any
new licenses but hundreds of licenses
being uh you know allowed over the last
few years is going to cause damage uh
for the next uh you know several decades
I would say if you really look at the
emissions uh coming from that extraction
so trust deficit is an absolutely real
issue because rich countries have not uh
acted based on their historical
responsibility and fair share while they
are continuing to put put pressure on
developing countries to do more without
even providing finance and technology so
we need to solve that puzzle uh of
really seeing that leadership real
leadership coming from developed
countries based on their uh historical
obligations and supporting developing
countries to do more indeed Mr let me
also ask you about the fact that uh a
lot of a lot of your experience at the
WTO uh where some of these negotiations
took place a couple of decades back it
was the same convers ation the context
may be different which was more trade
and less climate but the but the
conversation was the same which is
around uh you don't know the starting
point but the Finishing Line has to be
the same for all nations put together
talk to us about that experience in
terms of being able to bridge some of
this trust deficit because at the end of
the day it's about negotiations and and
breaking that uh
deadlock thank you gory look uh this is
not the first time a globally issue is
being discussed
multilaterally and I think the way the
trade agenda was set in the
1990s has perhaps a lot of uh uh a lot
of lessons for us in the way we set the
climate agenda you know one of the
biggest reasons that the trade agenda
and by the setting up of the WTO in 1995
led to a huge trade deficit was for two
reasons one is because developing
countries and mass were promised huge
amount of gains if they simply opened up
their markets this was the by line lower
your tariffs and you know Heavens are
going to open up but the second was very
often and this happened for the first 10
years in WTO others kept telling you
what you need to do we know what's best
for you you follow this path and I think
that resulted in a huge deficit of trust
and I think that is something we must
avoid when we are setting the climate
agenda let me just quote two things one
let me quote what David Cameron said
yesterday he said very clearly two
wrongs don't make a right I totally
agree but that is subject to a wrong
being done by me and a wrong being done
by you what about two wrongs being done
by the same side and that is something I
think we absolutely need to avoid when
we setting the climate agenda and trust
me the developing countries are doing
far more I India India is committed to
$2.5 trillion of investment between 2015
and 20130 that's huge it probably was
you know absolutely Unthinkable many
years ago but yes we do need to be met
halfway and the reason G is and I
probably would often would give this
example in WTO and you know with the
permission give it here we are prepared
to drive down the highway towards zero
emission absolutely with you but we have
going to do it at our speed you do not
tell us the speed at which we drive down
that Highway and you don't tell us these
are your restricted number of pit stops
that you can do we will get there
exactly the starting point is there and
the goal we will reach but yes give us
the flexibility because of very very
different conditions and support but I'm
certain if you look at the path in the
last 15 years it's towards much more
trust so I hope that that deficit will
soon be a thing of the for gotten pass
thank you great uh Eric let me also then
uh ask you on this fact uh we mentioned
about developed countries the fact that
they're still looking at ways of
revisiting some of the uh older
mechanism in terms of fossil fuel for
powering the energy needs at a time when
there is global conversation around
pressurizing or asking developing
nations to do their bit coming on that
we've mentioned some of those factors
here I mean absolutely but the change on
climate will not come from the
multilateral system and as you said in
your conversation with kishani earlier
today the United Nation is so weak and
basically nothing of substan is
happening in the climate talks what will
change is the action which particularly
developing nations are taking for their
own interest look China is now 60% of
all green develop Vel Ms on planet Earth
solar wind hydrop power electric cars
electric batteries high speed rail Metro
what every you can mention tree planting
China is 60% of the global development
One Nation alone move on to Indonesia
Indonesia has brought deforestation down
to zero in the second biggest rainforest
nation in the world fantastic
development and then which is the topic
of today I listened to was in Amed Abad
very recently with prime minister mod
and listen to his speech he spoke for
one hour he only spoke about the
opportunities for India in the green
transformation how India can capture
jobs and prosperity by going green look
if India replaces oil and gas with solar
and wind the sun is Indian the wind is
Indian well it saves money H it saves
money which can be used for education
andal
and today solar and wind energy is
cheaper than fossile fuels in the past
of course if you wanted to go renewable
it was a cost because coal was much
cheaper but that was the past now sou is
the cheapest energy you save money if
you turn to to Renewables and that's why
India and China and Indonesia and Brazil
and so many other developing nations are
now in the lead 10 years ago if anyone
asked me where should you go to see
climate action I would say please go to
Brussels please go to Berlin and to
Paris if you ask the same question today
I would say please go to Beijing please
go to Delhi and please go to Jakarta and
by the way this is also why this
agreement now between India and China is
so important because these are the two
drivers of climate action and
environment actions in the world they
can work more closely together trade and
create jobs by Mutual investment that
would be a major driver of the green
transformation absolutely so when you're
talking about climate action plan we are
here in New Delhi and that that could be
the starter then uh the question that
comes is that is global South
essentially going to provide those
Solutions Eric mentioned solar uh and
that is not just the cheapest safest uh
and and most easily replicable model of
being able to provide Basic Energy needs
the larger question is is global South
essentially going to lead the way for
finding climate Solutions is is is that
now going to be uh the fact that has to
drive Global negotiations there's cop
around the corner that's going to happen
next month in Baku uh is it time to let
Global South do that bit now so I have
to say I think India is going to lead
the world in this um I think India has
the scale The Innovation the technology
uh but also in the need you know that
aspiration to get to developed India by
2047 requires that real level of
ambition to to to match that pace and
scale but also India has the ability
then to create a generation of lowcost
technology which actually very few other
countries um have got the ability to do
and then to export that technology for
the benefit of of countries in the
global South so I am looking forward to
Decades of Indian leadership in this
space which I think is incredibly
exciting and something we're really
proud to be working on we're proud to be
a um a founder remember again of the
international solar Alliance which I
think is a fantastic opportunity to
drive the ability to take solar to scale
at low cost in a way that has massive
opportunity for other countries and I
think part of it is just it's a
different challenge decarbonizing your
economy is one thing but actually
working out how you get lowcost um low
carbon growth is a different and in many
ways more exciting opportunity so I
think there is there's an opportunity
there not just for governments but also
for the private sector this is an area
where I expect to see not only private
flows but also frankly private profits
as a result of that's a really good
thing in fact and that brings me to the
part which is around technology uh I I
don't consider myself to be someone who
understands Cutting Edge technology but
from a Layman point of view and I speak
for most people here in the audience
barring my boss of course which is that
uh technology could find solutions that
uh that could really break this puzzle
about climate funding because you know
uh if you look at the numbers in terms
of funding last year's climate Finance
uh the number was about 100 billion
about1 110 billion dollar uh hurricane
Helen alone the damage is 160 billion so
you cannot solve this by just garnering
more funding it's not going to come
technology needs to find those solutions
for us how do you go about addressing
that and and how do you break that uh
aspect yeah so before I come to that I
very briefly let me add to what the High
Commissioner said totally uh developing
countries as you asked um provide huge
opportunities also because a lot of
infrastructure is yet to be built and we
don't need to repeat the same mistakes
that developed countries have so we can
make sure that all our sectors are
decarbonized uh in a manner that we
don't really create the same system uh
that got created in the last 150 years
now and again as you said the role of
finance and technology is going to be
extremely important but when we talk
about technology I would argue that most
of the technology is already there when
we talk about solar and wind and that's
what Eric was also underlining so we
don't have to invest a lot in now
finding new technologies yes in certain
cases like steel industry and cement and
aluminium hyren that's where it's a at a
nent stage we and battery storage there
are areas where we have to invest but I
think we can massively scale up the
current technology so I would argue that
we need more Finance right now for the
existing technology and and also ensure
that those that production is happening
locally and that's where the role of wtu
and trade comes in that should not
become a barrier why only India and
China who should lead I would say
production should happen in kenas and
malais and Nepal of the world as well if
we we need to look at climate emergency
as an emergency it's a crisis right we
should not just look at making money
know there are other sectors where we
can make money we should make climate
technology as a public good if we really
want to deal with the existential crisis
that we are facing right now so I think
technology is still becoming a barrier
even with the ones that we have really
cracked the code of particularly solar
wind and and even battery storage Mr
Pradesh you want to come in on that in
terms of both the technology aspect and
the fact that some of what we already
have uh can be replicated with India
leading the way uh look I I think India
is already showing the way and again
it's not because the three of us sitting
on the panel are saying so look at the
figures look what India has done in the
last 10 years and you also asked about
what the global South is doing you know
India added about 200 gwatt of
additional capacity in the last 10 years
out of which more than 150 that's 75% of
the additional capacity came from
Renewables so we added about 175 gwatt
of additional renewable capacity and
this we did because yes continuously
technology more adaptive more reasonable
more more replicable is coming in but
still somewhere G and perhaps you know
depending on time available have to quot
that we also need to change the global
narrative about what the global South is
doing you know irrespective what uh what
India has done and I I with your
permission and that's why I'm delighted
that NDTV is now also doing an you know
a global Channel because we need to get
the story out I'll just quote two
headlines one most recent you know the
was published by the telegraph 2024
which is this year it says International
leaders Express
dissatisfaction with India's voting
patterns concerning climate initiatives
now for me that's terrible look look
what we are doing and yet what what is
being highlighted is our voting patterns
and if you look at a NGO report of just
a year back it says an NGO published
finding criticized the gap between
India's Environmental prise and its
action in transitioning to Green
resources come on you got to give me a
break the adani group Itself by 2030
would have contributed 50 gwatt to Green
energy I mean India's taken actually
Quantum steps but yes we really need to
highlight that we need ambassadors like
Eric there we need the high
Commissioners there we need activist
here but we need most importantly Global
Channel global news channels like NDTV
pushing the story thanks yes indeed sir
and uh let me Eric then come in there
that uh at the end of the day it also
comes down to the global narrative uh as
as as Mr PRI also pointed out that uh
developing countries countries like you
know India at the Forefront of being
able to deal the the the issues apart
from the challenges that they are
dealing with around growth around
funding still they are at the Forefront
of being able to at least address those
despite that look at the narrative that
is shaping it how do we go about fixing
that sh is of course absolutely right I
mean the arrogance of the vest
is
unbelievable unbelievable arrogance
where people believe that Europe is
leading or America is leading when India
is far ahead I mean look there is a
poster by ad there just at K in the in
garat the Adon group will now establish
the largest combined solar and Wind
Facility in the entire world is 30 Gatt
is as much as all hydr power in my
nation Norway combin and we have 100%
fuel by hydrop power atares in Mad
Pradesh we have the largest floating
solar anywhere in the world the state of
Tana has increased Tre cover by
7% and I can go on and go on simply but
this India story is not told at least
not to extent where people really
understand it in or grasp it in the
United States and Europe so together
this panel and andv and others let's
tell the India story more and better so
that people in the West can get out of
this absolutely horrendous arrogance all
right we have to leave it there thank
you so much all of you for taking out
the time and joining a conversation
which I think matters to the present and
the future Generations uh something that
I'm hopeful of we'll be able to find
solutions to and at least get that on
that road map which is most needed the
solutions are what we need issues we
know challenges we know I think it's
about finding those next steps and
Global Leadership which is what the
whole point is thank you so much all of
you and thank you to the audience
