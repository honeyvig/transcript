everyone welcome back to another video
by simply learn in this video we will be
discussing cognizant interview questions
we'll go through different types of
interquestions that are often asked
during the interview process at
cognizant
so in this video first we will learn
about cognizant then we'll understand
cognizant recruitment process
then we'll go through different
interview rounds
then we'll understand cognizant
technical intro questions for freshers
after that we'll learn about cognizant
objective interview questions then hr
intro question for freshers and many
more topics like that
before we begin make sure to subscribe
to our youtube channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
so before moving ahead let's understand
about cognizant
so cognizant helps business streamlight
process reimagine customer experiences
and modernize technologies to keep up
with the constant changes in business
environments
its technology offers the tools and
flexibility necessary for each person to
develop their best self
whether changing the companies that the
world relies on or helping you build
your best self
in addition to information technology
security consulting i.t and bpo
cognizant also offers services in
education and government cognizant has
three key areas of focus digital
business digital operations and digital
systems and technology so this was about
cognizant now let's understand cognizant
recruitment process
so cognizant believes in employing
people that are driven to succeed and go
above and beyond to contribute
significantly with their digital
expertise
their hiring method takes into account
the fact that students have varying
levels of it experience
they are offered jobs depending on the
skills and interest in technology
the process for freshers happens in two
ways
that is on-campus recruitment off-campus
recruitment
the recruitment of experienced
candidates take place through job
portals like naukri monster jobs
linkedin indeed employer referrals etc
so this was the recruitment process now
let's understand different interview
rounds at cognizant
interview rounds are divided into first
aptitude test then technical interview
then hr interview
so first understand the aptitude test
if you are a fresher you must take the
aptitude test first
candidates can take the test on an
online platform
usually freshers apply for the agency
position in cognizant
the gen c interview questions are
divided into the following that is
quantitative ability then logical
reasoning and english comprehension
while the experienced candidates have to
take skill based assessments
this test is based on previous
experience and technologies
now let's understand the technical
interview round
so
technical round is standard for freshest
and experienced candidates it is one of
the crucial and difficult rounds in the
entire process
the questions can vary from data
structures databases system design ui ai
ml etc now moving on to hr interview
questions
hr interview round there is not that
much to prepare
hr will usually check your attitude and
organizational fitment
so that is what you need to prepare for
that round
now let's have a look at some cognizant
technical intervention for freshers
so our first question is explain the
concepts of pointers in c
so it is an important concepts
so the answer would be a pointer is a
variable that stores the address of
another variable it is used to point to
the variables indirectly
it makes it possible to manipulate the
values
so this is how you can answer this
question
now moving on to our second question
which is
can you explain memory leaks
so a memory leak occurs when object
available in a heap are not utilized
the garbage collector fails to remove it
from memory
hence these objects are kept in memory
unnecessarily
memory leaks can lead to performance
issues and are bad for applications
health
so this was the explanation of memory
leaks
now
our third question is
how does garbage collection work
so garbage collection is a very
important concept as we all know
so garbage collection is the automatic
memory management technique used in java
to free up the memory it locates items
that are no longer needed by the program
and deletes or removes them
there are various garbage collection
algorithms used by a garbage collection
system
now
moving on to our fourth question
that is explain the mark and sweep
algorithm
so the mark and sweep technique is known
as tracing garbage collector because it
traces out the whole collection of items
that are either directly or indirectly
accessible by the program
it works in two phases
so in the first phase the algorithm
detects the unused objects in the memory
while in the second phase these objects
are removed from the memory to reclaim
the wasted space
the main drawback of the mark and sweep
method is that regular program execution
must be suspended while the garbage
collection algorithm runs
now
moving on to the next question which is
is a dangling pointer so pointers that
are not initialized with a valid address
are called dangling pointers
it occurs during the object destruction
phase
the object is destroyed by memory but
the pointer's address is not changed so
this is dangling pointer
now moving on to the next question that
is what is recursion
so it is a very popular concept we all
have heard about this
a recursion algorithm calls itself with
smaller input values and returns the
result for the current input by carrying
out basic operations on the return value
for smaller input
generally if a problem can be solved by
applying solutions to smaller versions
of the same problem and the smaller
versions shrink to readily solvable
instances then the problem can be solved
using a recursive algorithm
now coming to the next question which is
what is a data type
so a data type is a characteristic of
the data
it helps the machine understand
how machine will use data in the code
coming to the next question which is
explain malloc function
malloc function is used for memory
allocation
this function is used to allocate the
memory dynamically
and here's the example
ptr
equals cast type astrosix sign malloc
byte size
so this was malloc function now moving
on to the next question which is
can you explain a string
so the string is a data type it is used
to represent a sequence of characters so
we'll now discuss in different languages
how string is declared so in c plus
language it is declared like this like
string hello world in c language it is
declared character str name size
in java language it is similar to that
of c plus language that is string hello
world
now in python it is hello world hi
so you can declare string in different
languages like c plus plus c java by
different methods
now moving on to our next question which
is
what is an integer
so the integer is a data type it is used
to represent numbers
in c language it is used as int a then
in c plus plus and java it is used as
similar to that of c language then in
python it is declared as a equals 10
that there is no data type we can see
now
coming to the next question which is
what is an array
so the array is a collection of similar
elements stored in the continuous memory
block
the data stored in the memory can be
accessed by index
arrays are used to sort large amount of
data in the memory this was array
now coming to the next question which is
what are the primitive data types
so there are eight primitive data types
in java
these data types have no additional
methods
it only mentions the size and type of
the variable's value
and these primitive data types are
byte short int long float double boolean
character
so these were some primitive data types
in java
now our next question is
what is the difference between int and
integer in java
so let's start with int first
so int is a primitive data type
on the other hand integer is a wrapper
class
int has no additional methods whereas
integer has additional methods and
flexibility for storing and manipulating
the data
int is not a class but integers on the
other hand is a class
so this was a basic difference between
int and integer now moving on to our
next question which is what is a
bootloader
so the bootloader is an essential
component in the booting process of the
operating system
it is also called the boot manager it
places the operating system in the
memory
next is
explain the difference between
interpreter and compiler
so let's start with the interpreter
first
so interpreter translates one line of
code at a time
whereas compiler scans the entire piece
of code and converts it into machine
code
interpreter is faster than compiler in
analyzing the program whereas compiler
is slower to analyze program but the
overall execution time of compilers is
faster than interpreter
interpreter are memory efficient whereas
compiler on the other hand are less
memory efficient than interpreter
the examples of interpreter are python
and ruby and the examples for compilers
are c and c plus java now
coming to our next question which is
what is oops concept
so oops stands for object oriented
programming it is about writing a code
in functions and procedures the idea is
about reading the code in a minimalistic
way that reuses code
the oop follows abstraction inheritance
encapsulation and polymorphism
so this was the oops concept now
moving to the next question which is
explain inheritance so inheritance is
the mechanism that allows
one object to acquire all the
characteristics and properties of
another object
a class used for inheritance is called
the base class or superclass
while the class that inherits is called
a derived class or subclass
like it can be understood from a simple
example like the sun inherits all the
properties and characteristics of his
parents
and you can create multiple objects
using template of parent objects now
coming to the next question which is
explain encapsulation o encapsulation is
used to protect the data from the
outside world
encapsulation means shielding the data
it is done by wrapping it under a single
program or function
the data in an encapsulated class is
hidden from other classes by making the
data private in nature so this was
encapsulation now moving on to the next
oops concept
that is
explain polymorphism
so polymorphism means taking multiple
forms
the object in the program can act in
different ways depending on the message
or the event occurring
a very good example of polymorphism is
that a man can have different roles like
father son or uncle yet he is the same
person polymorphism also means many
forms
so now coming to the next question which
is what is a constructor
so the constructor is used to initialize
the object it is similar to the method
every time a class is instantiated
constructor is used for it
during the instantiation the memory
required for the object is allocated
there are two types of constructors in
java that is default constructor and
parameterized constructor
now coming to the next question which is
explain destructor
so a destructor is used to destroy the
objects that are created while the class
was instantiated
it is a special method that gets called
when the object life cycles comes to an
end
it can remove the object from the memory
and reclaim the space
the destructor also releases any locks
held by the object and closes the
database connections
now coming to the next question which is
what is constructor overriding oh an
answer of this question would be you
cannot override a constructor in java
the constructor is similar to a method
but it does not work like a java method
if you try to call a superclass
constructed in a subclass the compiler
treats it as a method and will throw a
compilation error now coming to the next
question which is what is constructor
overloading
so constructor overloading can be
defined as having multiple constructors
with different parameters so that every
constructor can perform a different
activity
in java these constructors must have
unique signatures and for error free
compilation different sets of arguments
must be passed to these constructors
so here we can see an example
so in this example we are creating two
objects of a class
one with zero parameters and another
with
one parameter
so when we create an object constructor
of class gets called here we have two
constructors one with no arguments and
other with one argument
creation of person one object will call
person
constructor and person to object we'll
call person int constructor this is
constructor overloading
so this is a fine example of constructor
overloading
so as we have understood now what is
constructor overloading now we can move
to the next topic which is explain
virtual functions
so a virtual function is a member
function that is declared in the base
class and it is overwritten by the
derived class
so virtual function helps in achieving
runtime polymorphisms
rules to keep in mind for virtual
functions are
it cannot be static
then it should be accessed using a
pointer for reference to the base class
then third would be a class can have
virtual destructor but not a virtual
constructor
so this was virtual functions
now moving on to the next question which
is what are dml statements
so dml is also known as data
manipulation language
these statements are used to manipulate
the database objects inside the database
following are included in dml
first is insert
second is delete and third is update
now coming to the next question which is
what are ddl statements
so ddl is also known as
data definition language
so these statements are used to define
or modify objects in database
and following are included in ddl that
is create
alter drop truncate
so now moving on to the next question
which is what is sql so sql is known as
structured query language
it is the language used to manipulate
the database sql includes various
categories like ddl
dml and tcl
now
coming to the next question that is
we have to write a program to find
the power of a number you can have a
look at this example this type of
questions are also are during the
interview process
so in this example we are taking two
inputs
n and base
then we are taking a while loop which
validates if n is equal to 0 in loop we
are taking the product of result and
base till n equals to 0.
for example if n equals to 5 and base
equals to 2
then we will multiply 2 5 times that is
32
so this is how
you can solve this problem
now moving on to the next
coding problem
which is write a code to reverse a
number in java you can have a look at
this example first so in this example we
are taking n as an input
and a while loop which is validating if
n
more than zero
in while loop we are first finding last
digit of 1
so then we are using that last digit and
adding it to a product of 10 and sum the
sum is storing the digits of reversed n
finally we are deducting the last digit
from the number
and by dividing n by 10
for example if n equals to 12 then r
equals to 2
then sum would be 0 into 10 plus 2 which
is equal to 2
and n equals to 1
then again when r equals to 1
sum equals to 2 into 10 plus 1 which is
equals to 21 that is the reverse number
so this is how we can reverse a number
so as we have covered the technical
interview questions now let's understand
cognizant objective interview questions
so our first question is
a 300 meter long train
running at the speed of 150 kilometer
per hour crosses the second train
running in the opposite direction with
the speed of 120 kilometer per hour in
nine seconds
what is the length of the second train
option a is 370 meter option b is 400
meter option c is 375 meter and option d
is 372 meter
you can take some time to solve this
question
you can also pause this
video in order to figure out the correct
option
meanwhile we will discuss the correct
option
so the correct option is c 375 meters
so the train is running in the opposite
direction
then the total speed would be 150 plus
120 which is equal to 270 kilometer per
hour
and if we will convert it into meter per
second then it becomes 75 meter per
second
now let the length of another train be l
meter
now
300 plus l that is the length of the
other train
divided by 9 equals to 75 meter
this becomes distance upon time equals
to speed that is 300 plus l divided by 9
equals to 75
now 75 is the speed that is 75 meter per
second now by solving this equation
l that is the length comes out to be 375
meter
all right
now moving on to the next question which
is
assume
a x equals to b y then
option a
log a
by log b equals to x by y option b is
log
a by b equals to x by y
option c is log a divided by log b
equals to y by x
option d is
log b divided by a equals to x y
now you can again pause this video to
figure out the correct option meanwhile
we can go ahead with the right option
so the correct option is
c that is log a
divided by log b equals to y by x
now moving on to the next question which
is
sum of two numbers is 80 and the product
is
then what is the sum of the reciprocals
it is a very basic question function a
is one option b is two option c is one
by four and option d is one by two
now you can take your time
by pausing this video
meanwhile the correct option is option d
one by four
so given a plus b equals to eighty that
is the sum of two numbers equals to
eighty and a into b that is product of
two numbers is 320
then sum of their reciprocals as we know
the formula that the sum of their
reciprocals is equal to a plus b divided
by a into b that is equal to
a plus b that is the sum divided by the
product which comes out to be 80 divided
by 320 that comes out to be one by four
so one by four is the correct option
that is an option d right guys now
moving on to the next question
so our next question is how many seconds
will a 300 meter long train moving with
a speed of 83 kilometer per hour take to
cross a man walking at a speed of three
kilometer per hour in the direction of
the train so option a is 13.5 seconds
option b is 14 seconds option c is 13
seconds or option d 14.5 seconds
so you can pause this video again and
try to solve this question on your own
meanwhile i'll
speak the right option now so the
correct option is a 13.5 seconds
so
the train and men are moving in the same
direction
so the relative speed will be 83 minus 3
which is equal to 80 kilometer per hour
now we know that we have to convert it
into meter per seconds so we'll convert
80 kilometer per hour into meter per
second by multiplying it with 5 by 18
which comes out to be 200 by 9 meter per
second
and we know that time equals to distance
upon speed
so our distance is 300 and our speed is
200 by nine so we will divide 300 by 200
by nine and our answer would be 13.5
seconds so yes the correct option is
13.5 seconds that is option a now
moving on to the next question
so a set sum of money amounts rupees
three thousand in two years and which is
3400 in four years
find the sum and the rate of interest so
our option a is inr two thousand and
thirteen percent a two thousand is the
sum and rate of interest is thirteen
percent
option b is twenty six hundred and seven
point seven percent
option c is fifteen hundred and twelve
point five percent and option d is
sixteen hundred and twelve percent
now i'm gonna tell the correct option
so the correct option
is option b
that is twenty six hundred and seven
point seven percent
so the interest paid in two years would
be thirty four hundred minus three
thousand which is four hundred for two
years
now so for one year we will divide 400
by two so it comes out to be 200
then for two years it would be 400 for
one year it would be 200 then the
principal sum at the beginning is 3 000
minus 400 that is 400 for two years so
we'll uh subtract 3000
minus 400 which comes out to be 2600 so
2600 is the principal sum at the
beginning now if we apply the formula of
rate of simple interest that is 200
divided by 2600
that is the
sum at the beginning into 100 then it
comes out to be 7.7 percent so the
correct option is option b
six hundred and seven point seven
percent
now moving on to the next question
what is the anthem of vindictive
so you can select from these options
option aks option b for giving option c
revenge full option d
refined
so the correct option is option b that
is forgiving
now moving on to the next question
what is the antonym of peculiar
option a is normal option b is exception
option c is unique and option d is
specific
again i'm going to speak the correct
option so the correct option is option a
normal
now again next question
what is the antonym of prejudice
option a bias option b injustice option
c impartial option d judge
the correct option of this question is
option
c impartial
so these are some antonym that you can
prepare or some more antinoms or
synonyms that you can prepare on your
own
now
moving on to the next question
photometer is to mileage then compass is
to you have to select from distance b
direction
c speed or option d gravity
now
the correct option is option b direction
automator is to mileage then compass is
to direction
all right
now again we will move to the similar
question like that
a marathon is to raise then hibernation
is to
option a sleep option b awake option c
dream or option d animal
now the correct option is option a
that is sleep
marathon is two days then hibernation is
to sleep
they are pretty easy questions next
question is window is to pane then book
is to option a page option b cover
option c author option d inc
direct option here is option a page
now the next question
cup is to coffee then bowl is to
a water b noodles c bread or d soup
correct option here is d soup
now cup is to coffee then bowl is to
soup
it was pretty easy
now moving on to the next question
vikas plants six separate saplings a b c
d e f in rows number one to six
according to the following conditions he
must plant a before b and e
he must plant b and d
the third has to be c
which sitting arrangement is acceptable
now this type of question doesn't really
need any explanation
so here are the options option a
a f c b e d this is the arrangement
option b
a b d e c f arrangement
option c
dba cfe arrangement or option d
c e f b a d arrangement
so you have to select the correct option
among these
and now i'm gonna tell you the correct
option which is option a
that is
a f c b e d
so this is the correct option
now we can move to the next question
which is
when rahul saw aditya he recalled he is
the son of the father of my daughter
who is rahul
option a
brother option b
cousin option c father-in-law or option
d brother-in-law
take your time by pausing this video
now i'm gonna tell the correct option so
the correct option is
option d that is brother-in-law
next question is
which of the following is synonym of
catechize
option a query option b silence option c
walk away or option d sync
the correct option of this question
would be option a query
now moving on to the next question
so which of the following is synonym of
luth
option a love option b play option c
hate or option d dance
so the correct option is option c that
is hate
now
the next question would be
which of the following is synonym of
receipt
option a attack
option b retreat
option c dodge or option d complain
now the correct option of this question
is
option b retreat
all right
now moving on to the next question
so which of the following is the synonym
of spurious
option a real option be genuine option c
fake or option d excellent
so the correct option of this question
would be option c fake
now
again a similar type of question
which of the following is synonym of
pudgy
option hrb
option b skinny option c ugly or option
d beautiful
the correct option of this question
would be
option a chubby
all right now the next question would be
if v j can be written as
x k l c a
then what can
r c t k u be written as so you need to
solve this question with pen and paper
then only you can figure out the correct
option
so the options are a paris b param c
pairs
d plans
now i'm gonna tell you the correct
option so the correct option would be
option a that is paris
now the next question would be
after walking 11 kilometers towards
south a man turns right
he walks two kilometer to the left and
seven kilometer to the right
after that he walks three kilometer
straight back
where is his starting point now
so again you have to do this question
with pen and paper
so option a is southwest option b is
south option c is northwest option d
north correct option of this question
would be option d that is north
now coming to the next question consider
some digits between 10 and thousand such
that when each number is divided by 6 7
and 11 it leaves 5 as the remainder in
each case
what are the original numbers
option a 535 option b 400 option c 462
option d 135
the correct option of this question
would be option c that is 462.
now moving on to the next question
in the 800 meter race
a gives b a start of 5 second and beats
him by 25 seconds
in another race a beats b by 15 seconds
the speeds are in the ratio
so the ratios are option a 10 ratio 11
option b 9 ratio 8 option c 8 ratio 9 or
option d
eight ratio eight
this one is pretty easy question and
now i'm gonna tell the correct option so
the correct option would be option b
that is 9 ratio 8.
now
moving on to the next question
if 1 raised to power 3 plus 2 raised to
the power 3 plus 3 square 3 up to so on
10 raised to the power 3 equals to 4 0 5
0 then find the value of
2 raised to the power 3 plus 4 raised to
the power 3 plus 6 raised to the power 3
up to so on 20 raised to the power 3.
so here are our options like a 10 000 b
32 400 option c
42 350 or option d 32 000
now
i'm gonna speak the correct option so
the correct option is 32 400
so we have given that 1 raised to the
power 3 plus 2 raised to the power 3
plus 3 raised to plus 3 up to so on 10
raised to 3 equals to 4 0 5 0. so we
have given the value of these
now we have to find the value of 2
raised to power 3 plus 4 raised to the
power c up to so on 20 raised to power
3.
so first of all we'll take the common
so we'll take two respawn 3 common out
of these
so it would be like 2 raised to the
power 3 in the bracket there would be 1
square 3 plus 2 raised to the power 2 3
plus 3 raised to r 3 up to so on 103
10 raised to 3
all right so we know that 2 raised to
the power 3 is equal to 8
now
and the rest of it we have
the value like 4 0 5 0 so we will simply
multiply 4 0 5 0 into 8
then it comes out to be 32
400.
you can try this question on your own it
is pretty easy
all right
now moving on to the next question that
what will be the most significant number
which divides 37 59 74 leaving the
remainder 2 3 and 4 respectively
option a would be 7 option b would be 9
option c 10 and option d 5.
now i'm going to tell the correct option
so the right option would be option a7
so these were some cognizant objective
interview questions
now coming to the hr questions for
freshers
so those that make it through the
technical round will advance to the
final round
which is the cognizant hr interview
candidates will have to face interaction
with cognizant's hr manager in the stage
during the hr stage candidates may also
be interviewed by a panel more than
in which there are more than one
interview
so participants will be asked things
about their personal history
academic qualifications interest
strengths weaknesses professional
experience and so on
finally if candidates are chosen in the
in this round they will now be recruited
for the job description for which they
have applied
all right now let's move on to the
questions part so the first question
which is also very common would be tell
us a bit about yourself
so this topic is typically asked to
initiate a conversation and to gain a
basic understanding of the candidate
candidates typically begin with their
current academic qualifications
technologies learned family history
projects completed in the final academic
semesters internship programs completed
and in what role
the internships are etc
now to answer confidently to make the
best impression on the interview
the manner in which you conclude your
answer can set the tone for the next few
questions
now
let's move on to the next question
so how do you increase your knowledge so
this is
an important question
so you need to prepare for this question
so you can answer like learning does not
come to an end ever like the interviewer
will want to know if you are a critical
thinker who challenges yourself to grow
you can respond to this question by
saying that you are aware of current i.t
trends and that your knowledge will not
only help you advance in your career but
will also be beneficial to the company's
growth
all right
so this is how you can address this
question
now moving on to the next question
so what are your qualifications so you
must serve an example how you differ
from the other candidates
tell them about your abilities that will
help you to make a beneficial influence
at work
operating in a new environment is not
really a problem for you and
you can say a lot of similar things like
that
check that you match the job description
and explain how you believe you could be
a good fit based on your strengths
all right so this is how you can answer
this question now we can move to the
next question which is
assuming you are employed how long do
you anticipate working for us
all right so no employer wants
an interviewee who will leave the
company after only a few years
so they anticipate that the candidates
will be a good fit for the company for
like seven to eight years
and even if you are unsure you must tell
them that as long as the job you do
challenges and leads to a profitable
company it will help you grow
so in this way you can answer these
types of questions
now the next question
why do you believe you are qualified for
this position
so now remember why you applied for this
specific rule when answering this
question tell the interviewer about your
qualifications and how
they make you eligible for this position
in addition emphasize uh how you can add
value to the current workforce
all right
now tell us about some of your strengths
this is again a very common and
important questions
so again it's uh critical to research
the job requirements before attending
the interview
make a list of your areas of strength
and say the ones which
this role requires
all right now the next question would be
tell us a little about your weaknesses
all right so do not give a weak point
that will directly impact your selection
but also do not claim that you don't
even have a weakness
so the best way to respond this question
is to flip one of your strengths into a
shortcoming but you believe it is an
important to function in this way
another option for answering this
question is to provide a totally
unrelated weakness that is that will not
affect your work in the company
all right now moving on to the next
question that would be
what do you like to do in your spare
time aside from study
all right so candidates must respond to
this question by discussing their
hobbies or extracurricular activities
like just don't say that outright that
you enjoy reading books watching
television and playing sports since the
interviewer will ask you what genre you
love to read and why as well as the
technologies of the sport
so ensure you answer this question
honestly and only if you have such a
knack for doing so in your spare time
so
these were some cognizant hr interview
questions
now let's understand
how to prepare for these hr interview
questions
all right
so
to prepare for these hr interview
questions you must participate regularly
before actually taking the test
make sure you have a good comprehension
of the topic and enough practice
reading good literature or registering
for a suitable online course can help
you clear your doubts now the second
point would be make sure you review your
coding test papers and practice
programming principles like c c plus
plus in java
as well as other computer essentials
like oops concept
and databases and networking
and the third point would be ensure all
the information on your cv concerning
your prior projects and internships is
correct and that you understand
everything
you will be questioned on your past
projects and work experience as well as
what technology you used and what you
have achieved so our fourth point would
be ensure that you are updated on the
technological developments
you should be familiar with the recent
technology advancements etc
so you must be updated with the latest
trends in technology as well so these
were some tips to prepare for the
cognizant hr interview questions
