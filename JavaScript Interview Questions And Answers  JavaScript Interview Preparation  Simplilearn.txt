hello everyone and welcome to top 25
JavaScript interview questions at simply
learn so guys let's straight dive in but
before that do not forget to hit the
Subscribe button and click the Bell icon
for further updates so guys let's get
started so our first question is what
will be the output of the following code
and why so our code is console.log 0.1 +
0.2
then there are three equal to signs
which is equals to 0.3 it is a pretty
tricky question but you can pause this
video and think for a while so guys I'm
in vs code as you can see now let us try
to run this code and see the
output so as you can see the output is
false now let us explain this code that
why it is coming false so because in
JavaScript you know that the numbers are
stored in a format called Flo in point
which sometimes can't represent decimal
numbers exactly so when you add 0.1 and
0.2 the result is not exactly 0.3 but it
is
0.300 than some other decimal value and
that's why when you compare 0.1 + 0.2
with 0.3 it returns false it's a kind of
tricky question but if someone asks you
next time then you will be probably able
to answer that now let us move to our
next question so guys here's our next
question the question is explain the
concept of hoisting in JavaScript with
example now guys as we know that
hoisting means that JavaScript moves all
the variables and function declarations
to the top of their scope before the
code is done but if it doesn't move the
value just a declaration so that is
referred to as hoisting I'll repeat once
again that basically in the scenario
what you have to do guys all the
variables and function declarations you
know you have to add it to the top of
the scope before your code is run so
I'll give you an example uh say suppose
we have declared a variable a equals to
say
five
and so here what I want to say that
suppose console do log
a and I have written this piece of code
or state print at the top and it is kind
of undefined right
now so here the variable a is hoisted to
the top but its value five isn't so when
you are trying to print before assigning
it a value you get undefined so next
with an example suppose in the similar
way say we created a function called
greed okay and it is uh
not calling anything now here we have
our function declaration say function
greet and here say with console.
logit and here we can say
hello now in this case the whole
function greet is hoisted to the top so
you can call it before it appears in the
code so this is basically called as
hosting I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding hosting now let us
move to our next question our next
question is what is closure in
JavaScript and provide a practical
example of its use so guys a closure in
JavaScript means that an inner function
can remember and access the variable of
its outer function even after outer
function has finished running example
can be something like this so guys as
you can see all over here I have created
a function create count and here I have
initialized count equals to zero now
then there is inner function which is
return function and it is incrementing
the count by one and finally returning
the count so now in the next thing what
we are doing basically we are creating a
counter okay then now it's basically
console. loging the counter and you can
see the output will be something like
one and two so guys in this example even
though create counter is done the inner
function still has access to the count
because because of the closure closures
are useful basically in this scenario
when you need to keep some data private
so I hope so you have got brief idea
regarding closures so basically at the
end of the day it is an inner function
that can remember and access the
variables of the outer function okay
even if the outer function has finished
running so that is basically a closure
and I have shown you an example so you
can run this code also so as you can see
in the output the answer is 1 and two so
it is remembering these value which is
created by this function so these are
closures now let us move to our next
questions so guys our next question is
how does this keyword work in JavaScript
so guys the value of this depends on how
the function is called it refers to a
object that is currently executing the
function for example in the global
context you can get something like this
say you are printing console.log this so
with respect to browser so if you type
this in the browser this refers to the
window object in terms of method context
if I tell you say suppose we created an
object with name as Alice and there's a
function so guys in context of the
object like method context you can get
something like this suppose I have
created object with the name Alice greed
function and I'm calling this do name so
I'm trying to access this value so guys
in context of the arrow function you can
create something like this say object
name Charlie then in terms of GD you are
applying the arrow function and it is
printing this do name which is accessing
the value Charlie so this is how this
works in this context so I hope so you
have got a brief idea regarding this
that how you work with this now let us
move ahead with the next question so
next question is can you implement a
simple debounce function in JavaScript
and explain how it works so guys a
debounce function makes sure that a
particular function is not called too
often it waits for some time after the
Last Action before the calling function
so for example you can do something like
this say you have the function debounce
and in which you have given an argument
Funk and delay then you are creating a
variable let time out and you are
returning a function with arguments as a
spread operator now you're clearing the
timeout and next you are setting out the
timeout and finally you are putting
inside the function the rest operator
which is ugs and finally the delay so
basically what this piece of code is
doing guys this function delays the
running Funk until after the delay of
milliseconds have passed without any
more calls so this is how debounce is
working it is basically useful for
actions like resizing a window or typing
a search bar so this is a simp sample
example where I have used de bounds so
in a lot of ways you can use debound
guys now I hope so you would have got an
idea regarding debound now let us move
ahead to our next question so guys our
next question is what is the event Loop
in JavaScript and how does it works so
guys the event Loop in JavaScript allows
to perform non-blocking operations even
though it has only one thread which
means that that it can do one thing at a
time basically it helps JavaScript run
asynchronous code like timers promises
and event handler so that is all
referring to the event Loop basically
all the non-blocking operations which
can be like suppose you are fetching
anything from any data okay or using any
API call back you are doing in your code
so these are the non-blocking operations
basically so you can do and and it means
also that you have to perform only one
operation at a time so that is what is
event loop I hope so you would have got
a brief idea regarding this so for
asynchronous operation we use event Loop
now let's move ahead to our next
question that is just quick info for you
guys if you want to accelerate your
career as a certified Java fullstack
developer and acquire essential industry
skills such as react angular springbot
hibernate and GSP while also mastering
MVC and web services to craftly then
simply learn has got you covered you can
join the course the course link is
mentioned in the description box hurry
up and join now so guys let us start
with our next question that is how would
you deep clone an object in JavaScript
so guys deep cloning means creating a
copy of an object where even nested
objects are cloned they are not just
referenced by it so one example I will
show you so consider this example guys
where I have declared a variable called
Original and here are the nested objects
now I'm trying to create a clone of this
using the structured clone so this is an
example of deep cloning where I'm
basically creating an object of an copy
of an object where even nested objects
are also present so this can be a very
good example now let us move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys our
next question is what are promises in
JavaScript and how do they differ from
callbacks so guys A promise is an object
that represents the eventful result of
an asynchronous operation promises
provide a cleaner more readible way to
handle asynchronous operations compared
to the traditional callbacks where if I
talk about callback Skies you can pass a
function to another function and it is
called once till the task is done this
can get messy and lead to a call back
hell so here comes the promises which
allows us to chain operations and handle
errors in more readable way so guys this
is what a difference between promises
and call backs is now let us move ahead
and discuss our next question so guys
our next question is how do call apply
and bind methods work in JavaScript so
basically call calls a function with a
this value and arguments provided one by
one in the JavaScript where if I talk
about apply it is similar to call but it
also takes an AR argument as an array
and if I talk about Bindu it creates a
new function that when called has its
own set provided by the value unlike
call and apply it doesn't immediately
call the function so let me show you an
example of the same so guys as you can
see all over here this is call so this
function is taking user as an argument
and it is printing this string called
hello now similarly with the apply it is
taking a variable as an argument and it
is taking a as a second argument now if
I talk about bind guys what bind is gu
doing it is basically creating a new
function so that when it is called so
you know this has its own set of the
provided values so constant greed greed.
bind so here it is user and this is
calling the Greet user with this value
so this is how the difference between
this is and this is pretty different
than call and apply I hope so you have
got a brief idea regarding this now
let's move ahead and discuss our next
question so guys our next question is
what is the difference between double
equal to and triple equal to operators
in JavaScript or basically I would say
what is the difference between lose
equality operator and a strict equality
operator so guys if I talk about the
lose equality operator here it compares
the values after converting them to the
same typ and if I talk about the strict
equality it Compares a value without
converting the types so both value and
type must be the same so guys I will
show you an example all over
here so if I
say
5 = to 5 then this will be true okay
because this is converted to a type
number then this is giving equal to this
but if I just add one more then this is
a strict equality and here the answer
would be false
so means it doesn't converts a type so
this is a difference between strict
equality and lose equality operator I
hope so you have got a brief idea
regarding this now let's move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys how
can you implement inheritance in
JavaScript using prototypes so very nice
question guys so basically in JavaScript
inheritance can be achieved through
prototypes so every object in JavaScript
has a prototype and objects can inherit
properties and methods from their
prototypes so in this way they can
achieve inheritance I hope so you have
got an idea and example could be
something like this so guys as you can
see all over here we have the function
animal okay and here it is taking name
as an argument and I'm creating a
binding for this then I'm using animal.
prototype dopak and this function this
is basically printing this do name the
name of the animal and it makes sound
now the function dog is coming which is
inherited from this now here I'm calling
the name and the breed so animal do call
this. name okay this calling the
Constructor and here I am adding this
this. breed equals to breed okay now
here I'm creating the object for it okay
and uh I'm creating the Constructor like
I'm fixing the Constructor for the dog
okay to add this next argument also and
uh finally what we are doing we are put
a method called bark all over here with
the help of prototype and with the name
it is just printing Bo so this is how
inheritance is Achieve one small snippet
okay with the help of prototype you can
achieve something like this I hope so
you would have got a brief idea
regarding this now let's move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys our
next question is what are Arrow
functions in JavaScript and how do they
differ from regular functions so guys
Arrow functions are a shorter way
basically to write functions in
JavaScript and they were basically
introduced in es6 module Now Arrow
functions are more concise so suppose we
are adding something like this suppose
we are adding two numbers A and B and
I'm taking this argument and with the
help of Arrow function I'm just
returning this a b parenthesis = to a
plus b so regular functions have their
own of this basically what we do if we
have to do with the regular function say
we are going to create an add function
we are declaring it and then we are
going to do the parenthesis is going to
be a pretty long way so this is pretty
short a way to write uh and this is how
it differs from the regular function in
terms of the syntax so whenever an
interviewer asks you this question what
you can do you can give a snippet code
and then you can try to explain this now
let's move ahead and try to discuss our
next question so guys our next question
is how do you handle asynchronous
operations in JavaScript and for hint I
have given you can compare call backs
promises and a Synco weight so basically
you have to give this answer something
like this so there are three main ways
basically to handle asynchronous task
the first one is callbacks where you
pass a function that gets called when
the asynchronous task is done like the
problem can be a nested code for example
call back H so say suppose we are
fetching a data all over here and in
this case we can use it so guys you can
take an example of the call call back
all over here so where basically what
I'm doing I'm passing a function that
gets called when the asynchronous task
is done suppose I'm trying to fetch a
data so you can see this snippet of code
so this is call back now if I talk about
promises guys it is in cleaner and
alternative way to the callbacks you can
chain do then for success and do catch
for errors something like this for the
same code I have written F data do then
result then use Arrow function process
result result. catch error then handle
error pretty simple now next if I talk
about a synovate so basically this is
built on promises but it looks like a
regular synchronous code you can use a
wait to wait for a sync tasks now you
can see all over here suppose I'm trying
to fetch something and here I'm using
the try and catch and here I'm storing
the result this is awaiting to fetch the
data okay then when this uh data has
come up then basically I'm storing this
result in the processed result and if if
not then I'm handling the error so this
is how we are using async and weight
basically it's looks like more of a
synchronous code but it is pretty
different from that so this is how call
back's promises and Ayn ofate differs
from each other I hope so you would have
got a brief idea regarding this now let
us let's move ahead and discuss our next
question so guys our next question is
when you would use one or another if I
talk about arrays versus objects so if I
talk about arrays guys arrays are order
list of values that are indexed by
numbers starting from zero and it just
goes on basically you can use an array
when you need to store a list of items
in an order and you want to access them
by their position or index so for
example we have fruits and and we have
name as apple banana and Cherry and I
want to access the Apple so I can
directly use console do log and I could
use a variable name fruits and then
access by it index zero now if I talk
about object Skies objects are
collection of key and value pairs okay
each key which is a property is a string
and the value can be anything so
basically you can use object when you
want to store data with named Properties
or when you need a quick access to
values by a unique identifier that is so
in that scenario you can use this I hope
so you would have got brief idea
regarding this now let's move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys our
next question is how can you prevent
cross-side scripting attacks in
JavaScript applications so guys
cross-side scripting attacks can happen
when hackers inject malicious script
into your web applications to prevent
this what you can do guys you can
sanitize user input ensure that any
input from users like for example form
submissions is cleaned up so you can use
libraries like Dom purify to remove
dangerous scripts next what guys you can
do you can use content security policy
you can set up security headers that
restrict the loading of script from the
untrusted sources this can be one of it
so guys by using these techniques you
can prevent the cross- side scripting
attacks now let us move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys our
next question is proide and code EX
example demonstrating promise chaining
so guys basically promise chaining is
like involving multiple promises
together so that the subsequent promises
wait for the previous one to settle
which is either fulfilled or rejected
now I'll explain You by this example
what does it exactly means so let us
open our text editor so guys as you can
see all over here so I'm using this
variable let promise which is equals to
new promise and it is doing resolve and
reject and then again it is using an
arrow function and here it is resolving
the hello reject and basically it's
resolving hello JavaScript so as you can
see all over here that what we are doing
it is linking one promise to the another
so that is what basically promise
chaining is I hope so you have got a
brief idea regarding this now let's move
ahead and discuss our next question so
guys our next question is what is even
delegation in JavaScript and how does it
improve performance and manageability so
guys even delegation allows ows you to
add a single event listener to a parent
element and it handles events for its
child elements even if the child
elements are added later which basically
improves performance and reduces the
need to add multiple event listeners so
guys instead of adding an event listener
to each individual element you can add
it to the common parent so guys when an
event happens on a child element it
bubbles up to the parent and the event
listener then catches it but this is how
event delegation works now if you talk
about performance it reduces the number
of event listeners especially in a large
list or table so guys this is uh one
example of this I hope so you would have
got a brief idea regarding even
delegation now let's move ahead and
discuss our next question that is what
are generator functions in JavaScript
and how they differ from regular
functions so guys generator functions
are a special type of functions that can
be paused and resumed the return an
iterator which allows you to yield
values one at a time instead of
returning all the values at once so this
is how they differ from regular
functions so basically you use the
function syntax and yield keyword to
pause and resume the execution you will
run from start to finish without pausing
so this is how it differs in the syntax
in comparison to the regular
functions so guys this is how you can
answer this question so guys let us
start with our next question
that is what is the difference between
map filter and reduce methods in
JavaScript so guys if I talk about map
method it creates a new array by
applying a function to each element in
the original array so guys you will use
this function in a scenario where you
want to transform every item in an array
whereas if I talk about filter guys
filter creates a new array with only
elements that pass a certain condition
like in a scenario where you want to
filter out specific items from the AR
then you can use the filter method then
reduce if I talk about reduce guys it
reduces the array to a single value by
applying a function that combines all
the element you can use it in a scenario
where you want to accumulate values or
calculate something from all items in an
array I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding this now let us
move ahead and discuss our next question
so guys our next question is what is
prototype chain in JavaScript and how
does JavaScript use prototypes to
achieve inheritance so guys in
JavaScript objects can inherit
properties and methods from other
objects and this is done through the
Prototype chain so guys every object in
JavaScript has hidden length to another
object it is called prototype and this
is how inheritance works when you try to
access a property on an object
JavaScript first looks for the property
of the object itself if it does not find
it it looks up to the object's prototype
and so on up the chain until it reaches
now null so in this way it achieves this
for example in this code
guys as you can see in this code we have
function animal okay and here we are
using Constructor for this so we are
binding name property all over here
similarly I am creating a prototype for
a speak where this function is printing
this makes a sound similarly for the dog
here two arguments are given name and
breed now similarly using the dog
prototype I'm creating the object for
this then I'm fixing this Constructor
for the dog with the help of prototype
and I am also creating a function bar
okay so I'm taking this object Prototype
all over here and I'm printing this
console.log this.name box so this is how
inheritance is working in this scenario
I hope so you would have got some rough
idea regarding this like what is
prototype chaining now let us move ahead
and discuss about our next question so
guys our next question is what are
immediately invoked functions
expressions in JavaScript and why they
are used so guys an immediately invoked
function expression is a function that
is defined and executed in a right way
as soon as it is created it doesn't want
to be called later why you want to use
iif the first reason that comes up to my
mind is because of encapsulation because
it creates a new scope so that variables
inside the function won't interfere with
other codes in the global school next is
also avoiding Global pollution which
helps in preventing the creation of
global variables by keeping them in
private inside the function so this is
why they are used I hope so you would
have got a brief idea regarding this now
let us move ahead and discuss our next
question that is explain currying in
JavaScript and how does it differ from
partial application so guys currying is
a process of transforming a function
that takes multiple arguments into a
series of function that each take one
argument at a time so for example in
this code so guys as you can see in this
code I have created a function add a it
is returning a function B then it is
returning a function C which is
returning a plus b plus C now I'm trying
to print console log add 1 2 3 but the
output will be six so guys here add one
returns a function that expects B so
then it adds add 1 and two which is
returning another function which expects
three and finally it adds a sum of 1 + 2
+ 3 which is equals to 6 so guys this is
how it works so I hope so you would have
got a brief idea regarding currying in
JavaScript now let us move ahead and
discuss about our next question so guys
next question is about what will be the
output of the following code and here is
our code console. log 0.1 + 0.2 = toal
to 0.3 then is
these are two parenthesis okay then
parenthesis and a curly braces then a
curly braces and a
parenthesis so what will be the output
let us try to run this in visual code so
guys here is this required code all over
here let me Zoom
this now if I try to run this guys now
the first one is giving false because we
have discussed this earlier so 0.1 0.2
because of a floating Point okay this
value is not equals to exactly 0.3 the
second one what we are getting all over
here is an object of object okay now let
me try to explain you so when you try to
add this and this is basically an empty
string in JavaScript so when you try to
add two arrays they are first converted
to Strings and empty arrays are
converted into empty screen so the
result is an empty string okay now if
you see this the third line which is
parenthesis and a curly brace so it
returns object object okay why because
empty array is converted into an empty
string and then empty object is
converted to the string so it is object
of object so when you concatenate them
the result is object object so that's
why and the same reason goes all over
here so basically this is giving an
answer for this now if you see the last
one we have this parenthesis and this so
this will also return the object which
is same concept which I have told you so
m empty is going to convert into empty
string and then empty object so that's
why it's giving object object so this is
some of the interesting question which
can be asked in the
interviews so guys this is one of the
thing now let us move ahead to our next
question so guys let us discuss our next
question that is what is spread operator
in JavaScript so guys the JavaScript
spread operator allows us to quickly
copy all the part of an existing array
or an object into another object so
suppose we have arrays say a number one
1 2 3 we have arrays number two 4 5 6
and there is number combined so I want
to copy all these values so I can take
as spread operator number one and number
two so these are value will be copied in
all over here so combin will be value of
1 2 3 and 4 5 6 so basically it is an
easiest way to quickly copy all the part
of an existing array or an object into
another object or an array so guys this
is very simple example of spread op
operator now let us move ahead and
discuss our next question so guys what
are symbols in
JavaScript so guys symbol data types if
I talk about in JavaScript are new type
of primitive data type that were
introduced in the es6 version of this
language they are used to represent
unique values that can be used as
identifiers or keys in the object they
are also used to create private
properties and methods in classes
symbols are unique and immutable so they
can be used as unique identifiers in
objects and classes symbols can can be
used to create private properties and
methods in classes symbols are also
useful for creating constants that can
be shared across different parts of our
code so guys this was a simple
definition of symbol so guys that was
