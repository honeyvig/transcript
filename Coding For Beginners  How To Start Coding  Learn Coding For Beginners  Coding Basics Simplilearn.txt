the present world is developing and
improving its technology all the
technology and the growth is coming from
i.t and software the main reason behind
it and software is coding and
programming these coding and programming
skills hold a key in developing all
those technologies hey everyone welcome
to yet another exciting video from
simply learn in this session we will be
discussing coding for beginners however
before we begin the session make sure
that you have subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to click that
bell icon so you can never miss an
update from simply learn let's look at
the agenda for today's topic first we
will begin with learning what is coding
then we shall discuss why one should
learn coding then we will walk through
which language we should learn first
after that we will discuss some basic
examples and quotes after that we will
learn and discuss the best websites to
learn coding followed by that we will go
through some tips to improve coding and
finally we will wind up the session by
discussing jobs to be expected on coding
so without further ado let's get started
with our first topic in this session
what is coding computers do not
understand the human language so we must
use some languages for communication
that require coding to communicate with
the computer coding is the best way of
passing and translating the instructions
for communication with a computer it is
used to program and design websites
applications and lot other technologies
coding tells the computer which action
should pass and instructs the computer
what to do and how to do it using some
programming languages
now let's have a look at why one should
learn coding the present world is
dealing with a large number of
applications the growth and demand for
software is increasing rapidly at
present most of the applications and
technologies are dependent on coding and
programming the applications and every
implementation is developed using coding
and are helpful in every sector and
provide solutions even for complex
problems learning coding also has a huge
demand and impact on career growth most
of the jobs at present are from software
and id and these skills help get a job
quite easily learning to code helps to
improve communication and collaboration
skills learning to code enhances
technical skills and give you a new way
to approach the work these are a few
reasons why one should learn coding now
let's have a look at which language to
start with there are many coding and
programming languages available in the
modern generation like cec plus python
and java every coding and programming
language has unique features when we are
ready to learn anything we have to know
the basics of the concepts when it comes
to programming the basic language and
the platform is c it covers some basic
concepts of the programming languages
and helps to have a good base for
getting more knowledge on coding once
you understand the concepts and basics
of c then it will be helpful for you to
learn other coding and programming
languages c programming covers all the
major topics like data types storage
classes operators functions memory
management file handling and many others
it is easy and possible to learn other
coding and programming languages once
you have good command and good skills in
the c language
now let's have a look at basic examples
and codes before being ready to
implement the code we must have to
specify the header files these header
files are used to perform specific tasks
in c programming we mostly use header
files like hash include stdio.h
and hash include con io.h once the
header files are mentioned in the code
we must take care of the main function
the main function serves as the starting
point of execution it executes the
program by calling other functions it is
like int main as shown in the video once
the header files are mentioned in the
code we must take care of the main
function the main function serves as the
starting point of execution it executes
the program by calling other functions
the main function contains the
instructions to tell the computer and
perform a specific task let's have a
look at a basic example of c program so
this particular program is a simplest
example designed in c programming
language you can see the red colored one
is hash include stdio.hs and header file
and followed by that we have a main
function with integer written type and
inside the function we have a simple
print statement which prints a message
welcome to simplylearn's youtube channel
and then we have return 0 which
indicates that the main function returns
null value and here you can see we have
the brackets which basically provide a
structure to the main code now let's
have a look at some of the platforms to
learn coding and the first one in the
list is skill up by simply learn skill a
platform is offered by simply learn
