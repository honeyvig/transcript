hey everyone
welcome back to another video by simply
learn this is anubhav and in this video
we will be learning about rest api but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and
press the bell icon so you will never
miss any update from simply learn
so without further ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you
first we'll see the introduction to rest
api
after that
we will see what is express js
moving ahead we'll see what is rest api
and then we will see http request types
and in last we will create a simple
restful api from scratch
rest api are the standard way to send
and receive data for web services
client sends a request which goes to the
rest api
then to the database
to get or put the data
after that it will come back to the rest
api and then to the client
using an api is just like using a
website in a browser but instead
clicking on the buttons we write code to
request data from the server
it is very flexible and can handle
multiple types of requests
restful api is very popular and very
commonly used to create apis for
web-based applications
what is express.js
expressjs is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
and cross-platform mobile applications
it is used as a server-side scripting
language
express js is high-performance fast
lightweight and unopenated
we'll see what is rest api but before
that what is rest and what is api
rest means
representational state transfer
rest is a popular architecture which is
used to create web services
now
api is an application programming
interface it is a code that allows two
software programs to communicate with
each other
rest api is a software that allows two
applications to communicate with each
other with the help of internet and
various devices
now
we will see the http request types
first one is get it is used to request
data from the server but mainly this
method is used to read data
next one is pac
it is used to update the data or to
change or replace it
next is
post
post method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data
after that
it is delete
delete method is used to delete the data
completely from the server
now we will see the complete
architecture of http request type
in this
client sends a request in the form of
json file
and with the help of http request
which are get patch post and delete it
will go to the server
and then
sends back the response to the client in
the form of message
to tell what happened to the request
and now we will create a simple restful
api from scratch

description to know more
first you need to open your editor for
this i am using vs code
for this
you need to open your
folder
created one folder in the
c drive
express js
for this
you need to have node.js installed
first
open your terminal by clicking on
terminal new terminal
first
we'll write npm
in it
hyphen y
press enter
this will create a json file
for us
now let's
install express.js
for that
we'll write npm
install
express
press enter
installing express js
this will add
all the dependencies
for now we have only one express
installed we need a file here
to write our code
so we'll create a file called index
dot js
enter
in this file we will write all our code
open index.jsjs
first we'll write
cons
app
file
express
in this line we have imported the
express package
which itself is a function
so we'll write parentheses here
to initialize it
now
we'll get the port number i'm writing
4000 here
this will call a variable
which is 4000
till now
our api hasn't defined any endpoints
this app.listen tells the server to
listen on specific port
which we have defined already as a
variable
4000.
now
in app.listen
we will write a second argument as
callback to tell us the api is working
or not
then we'll write
port
comma
we'll write the callback function here
function
console
dot
log
backtick
it's
running
on
http
closed
which will come under curly braces
now we can run this app by writing the
command on a terminal
first save this file
terminal
now we'll write a command
to run this file
index
node
file name
index.js
so it's successfully showing us it's
running on http port
4000
options your
chrome or anything
i'm using chrome here i'll write
localhost
4000
enter
closed enter
can't get
now
if you open this url you will see
this message
can't get
this is because we don't have any api
endpoints as of now
but express js is still responsing with
error message
you can add an api and call it
and with this we have reached the end of
