hello everyone
welcome to this tutorial on classes and
id in html by simplylearn
in this tutorial
we are going to learn about the classes
and id in the html and how to use them
so without further ado let's get started
so
what is an html class
an html class attribute is used to
specify a single or multiple class names
for an html element
the class name can be used by css and
javascript to do some tasks for html
elements
you can also use this class in the css
with a specific class with a period
character followed by the name of the
class first selecting elements
so let's jump on to the demo to
understand the classes and id better so
we are on our sublime text editor
add the standard boilerplate of html
we'll give the title as
classes
and id in html
let's start with the basic example
we'll see how to define an html class
so inside the body tag
we'll add one h1
and we'll give this
the class name of
head one
will add some text here this
is
the heading one
now you can copy this part because we'll
need it
enough for the line
so for the h2
this will be the heading 2
for h3
this will be heading 3
and let's add one more h4
this is the heading 4.
so as you can see we have used the same
class name in all our h1 h2 h3 and h4
so if you save the file and
go to the page and refresh
you'll see the headings are there on the
page this is the heading one heading to
heading three and heading four
now let's learn how we can use this
class name for our styling purpose
so we'll open the style tag here
and you will mention the
class name by
period followed by the class name so
head 1
open the parenthesis
and let's set the color to
light sand
and we'll set the font family to
set quit cursive
keep the background color to black
okay so you can see we have mentioned
the class name dot head head one for
styling purposes and we have given the
color of font family and background
color for it so just save the file and
go back
refresh
now you can see we have designed this h1
h2 h3 and h4 using our class tag
now let's use another example with a
different class name
so
here only will make the changes let's
name this class as h2 this h3 and let it
be h4
now you can style them separately for
the head to
we can set the color
to say light
pink and we can set the font background
color to
red
okay
now
similarly for the h3
dot
head 3
set the color to
[Music]
i don't know what color this is let's
say fujisa
and set the background color
to
let's say blue
okay save the file and go back to the
page
now you can see we have designed our h1
h2 h3 and h4 using the different class
name
this is the example of using the
multiple classes on the same code
and one thing you should note that these
class may must be separated by the space
there are a few points you should know
while working with the class
so the first one will be the class
attribute can be used on any html
element
like any html element can have a class
name
the second point will be the class name
is the case sensitive
head one
and
if we change here to say
we'll keep this h as kept capital so
this will be wrong the style won't be
implemented on the page now if you
refresh
you can see the style is not implemented
so the class names are case sensitive
let's change this back
refresh and now you can see our design
is back
so this was all about html classes
now let's move on to the id attribute
so the html id attribute is used to
specify the unique id for an element of
the html document
it allocates the unique identifier which
is used by the css and the javascript
for performing certain tasks
in cascading stylesheet that is css we
mention an element with a specific id by
using the hash symbol followed by the id
let's work on an example to understand
this better
so we'll use the same previous example
we'll mention the h1 and this time we'll
use the id
so id and we'll name it as head one
this is the first heading
for h2 also
we'll mention the id name as head one
only
head one
this is the
second heading
now to style the heading we'll go back
here
we'll open the style tag
and we'll use the hash number to mention
the id so hash
head one open the parenthesis
we'll set the color to
light green
we'll set the font family to cursive
and we'll set the background color
to black
okay
now save the file and go back and
refresh
so you can see this works in a similar
manner to the class apart from it that
we use the hash symbol to mention the id
name
so
now let's change the example and use the
different id names for different h1
so this can be h1
this can be h2
let's add one more
we'll name it as id
head 3
okay
so
we'll style the
head to
we'll set the color to red
for head tree
we'll set the color to
yellow
let's use green yellow okay
save the file go back
and refresh
now you can see we have the different
style for different ids
so in this way you can use the different
ids
to design your html page
so that's it for this tutorial i hope
