distribution like normal distribution
andess and CIS the second is inferential
stat understanding hypothesis testing
confidence intervals P values and
statical significance the third one is
probability Theory basic probability
concept conditional probability and
based theorems and man the fourth point
is linear algebra and calculus
fundamental concept that underpin many
statical algorithm so you guys can learn
these topics from our simply YouTube

for statical analysis like scipi and
Stat models for performing statical test
and modeling and in our like basic
syntax like data types and structures
data manipulation like DPL yr T yr the
third point is statical analysis Bas R
function and package like GG plot 2 or
data visualization so you guys can learn
these topics from our simply YouTube
