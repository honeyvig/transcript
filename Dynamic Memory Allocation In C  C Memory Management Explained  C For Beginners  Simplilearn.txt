hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about memory
management insane but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update so now without any further
delay let's begin
this session will help you to understand
what is memory management in c
later we will discuss dynamic memory
allocation and function used to allocate
memory dynamically with the help of
syntax and examples
so now let's begin with what memory
management in c is
as we all know in c programming the
memory is automatically allocated to all
the program variables during compile
time
so sometimes to reallocate the memory or
to change the size of an array we must
allocate memory during runtime and we
have two ways to locate memory
and they are static memory allocation
and dynamic memory allocation
in static memory allocation the memories
are located during compile time and the
fixed size of memory will be assigned to
the variables
moreover there won't be any change in
the memory size and location and in the
case of dynamic memory allocation the
memories are located during runtime
so now let us try to understand more
about dynamic memory allocation
to manage the memory more efficiently we
use dynamic memory allocation
unlike static allocation the memories
are located during run time in dynamic
memory allocation
and the allocated memory is not constant
or fixed we can allocate the memory
blocks from the hip whenever required
when the memory block is no longer in
use we can also return the block of
memory to the hip for reuse by another
program
and in addition to this we can also
reallocate the block of memory space
when required to allocate memory
dynamically c provides a set of
functions and they are emblock clock
reallock and free functions that are
defined in the stdlib dot hedge that is
standard library header file
let's look at the syntax and examples of
this function
first when we use the mlog function the
continuous block of memory will be
allocated and the point of variable will
hold the address of the first element
now let's look at the below given syntax
the mlog function take one argument
memory size for example
if we require 10 bytes of memory size we
can mention 10 or we can mention the
size of int
the mlog function will first checks
whether the continuous memory is
available on the hip and if free memory
is unavailable the function will return
a 0 or a null value
else it will allocate the memory as per
the requested size if memory is
available
and the pointer will point to the
address of the first element in the
block
next we have clock function
the syntax is pointer variable is equal
to c log of number element comma memory
size for example we have 10 as a number
element and the element size is the size
of int
clr function is similar to the mlog
function but in case of clr function
multiple blocks of memory of the same
size will be allocated which holds 0
value by default and it takes 2
arguments that is number element and
element size
up next we have reallock function
first let us look at the syntax
pointer variable is equal to reallock
pointer variable comma memory size
in real lock function we pass point of
variable as an argument and the memory
size for example
real lock pointer variable ptr comma the
size of it
so sometimes it becomes very difficult
to change the array size when we have to
store new values into the array or to
copy into the larger size array so in
that case we use real log functions to
change the array size without losing the
data in short the real of function will
change the size of the previously
allocated block of memory
i hope you got a good understanding of
why we use real log function
moving ahead we have free function
syntax is simple we pass pointer in free
function like for example free ptr the
free function is used to deallocate the
memory space occupied by the previously
allocated by mlog c a lock or rear lock
functions
in order to use the memory more
efficiently and to return back the
memory to the hip once done we use free
function
once we free the memory other programs
can use that block of memory if required
now let's run simple program using this
function
so in this particular example we have
included the standard library header
file
that is stdlib.h and then mlog function
and using if condition we're gonna check
whether memory is available or not and
if memory is available it gonna locate
the memory and print the value of 10.
and finally we have used free function
to deallocate the memory so now let's
run it
as you all can see the value 10 is
printed successfully
now using same program let's use clock
function so instead of mlog let's give
cllo
and since we have passed only one
argument that is sizeof end let's
execute the program and see what would
be the
error as you can see the error
it says that too few arguments to
function see alok
it means that the clock function will
take two arguments so let's give the
number element
so save the program
and
run it
and here we got the output
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on c memory management i
hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
