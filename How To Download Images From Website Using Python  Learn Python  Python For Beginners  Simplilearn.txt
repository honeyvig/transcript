hello and welcome to this session on
python projects
and today we are going to discuss about
how we can leverage python as a
programming language
in order to automate downloading of
images
from a web page or google search
so we will see what all python libraries
and utilities are required in order to
perform that activity
so this is primarily an automation
activity which you can perform in python
where you want to download
certain amount of data certain images we
are taking images as an example over
here so how can you scrap
a web page download the images
automatically in a particular folder
now
what we are going to do is we are using
the selenium utility the selenium
package
in python in order to perform this
activity
so what we are going to do is we do we
are going to import selenium package
and then
from selenium
we are going to import these libraries
web driver
by then we are going to import request
io
import image and time
okay so these are the relevant libraries
which we are going to use in this
particular example
now for executing this example you need
a particular chrome driver as we're
going to use
chrome
we're going to download this chrome
driver so in order to download the
chrome driver
you need to go to this url of
chromedriver.chromium.org
downloads
and please download the latest version
if you respect
depending on what operating system
you're operating on so i'm using chrome
driver win32 so i'll download the
windows driver
and unzip it at the relevant folder so
wherever you're going to unzip the
chromedriver.exe 5 please give the path
over here
and then initialize that
using the web driver utility which you
have imported
okay
this is the initialization and you can
see a chrome browser has got open
now we are going to create a function
called
get images from google
and
we are going to write a
internal function which will scroll down
which will scroll through that
particular browser to a particular
position and
at a particular delay it will start
downloading the data
now
as a sample what we have done is we have
embedded a tree search a tree image
search google search in my url
so this
so this search will automatically get
opened from my python script
automatically so you'll see that
and
then
i'm going to run that in a loop and put
that
image urls as a set
now i'm right i'm going to write a loop
how many images i want to download by
that i'm gonna run a while loop on the
particular function
and
write the piece of code in order to
download
till the time my max images have been
reached
now
i will
find elements by class name q4 luwd
okay
now for images in thumbnails i'll start
clicking that image so i'm using the
selenium utility over here i'm clicking
the image and then i'm getting the
source attribute of the image urls and
then downloading it so this entire
function actually allows you to download
the
image
and then i have a function which is the
download function
now i'm going to download images
from the web page i want four images
now
please make sure
that
you have
provided a path
so i have created a folder called c
drive
images folder
in which i am gonna download my
images
now my script is running it is
downloading the images
and if i go into the images folder
see the images have started to get
download and four images the parameters
which i have passed are getting utilized
and if i want to quit it
now my program has got quit so if you
see this
the
browser
from where
the uh images were starting to get
downloaded
got opened automatically and now as i
have quit the program it got closed
and here are the four images randomly
which has been picked from that
particular search and added
so i've killed the connection so this
way that's why this error is coming
