hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel kosel this said
and I hope you guys are doing well it is
rightly said that you can Master a
programming language only by programming
in it and it's also correct that if you
want to code then there's no better
thing to do than to work on projects so
in this video we'll take you through
some of the best projects you can work
on if you are a Java Enthusiast but

miss any updates from Simply learn so
let's go through the agenda for today's
video we'll start this video with an
introduction to Java programming
followed by the skills and salary of a
Java developer we'll then move on to the
Java development kit and the process of
installing Java in your systems these
topics are discussed to make everyone
comfortable with the version of java
that is being used in today's video then
we'll move on to the top 10 project
ideas for 2024 once we finish all these
topics we'll start with some basic
pattern programs in Java and then we'll
move on to the main Java projects where
we'll create applications like a
calculator app and an ATM application
with Java following that we'll also
cover the advanced Java projects using
spring Boot and finally if you also want
to become a Java developer you should
know the questions you might tackle in
an interview speaking of interviews we
have covered you along with the most
frequently Asked Java interview
questions to help you crack the most
challenging interviews also if you want
to become a successful software
developer and gain handsome salary
packages then look at this wide range of
software development courses by simply
learn in collaboration with the top
universities across the globe by
enrolling in any of these certification
programs you will Master modern coding
techniques with boot camp level
intensity becoming a fullstack Java
technologist these programs lay the
foundation for crafting fullstack web
applications so what are you waiting for
hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more details so without any further
delay let's hand over this session to
our training experts in today's era the
internet and smartphones have become an
integral part of our Lives we use our
phones for almost all of our day-to-day
tasks earlier we used to shop at malls
queue up in front of Banks and make our
travel bookings at Travel ageny
but now we can do all this in the
comfort of our homes using smartphones
all of this is possible because of a
highlevel programming language called
Java hi guys welcome to this video that
will tell you everything you need to
know about the class-based object
oriented programming language Java Java
is an object-oriented programming
language that is used in a distributed
environment on the internet it is a
highlevel language that is easy to read
and understand Java is popularly used in
console graphical user interface web and
mobile applications game development and
also to make embedded systems apart from
these Java is also used to develop
software for devices it is used not only
in computers and mobiles but even in
electronic devices like televisions
washing machines air conditioners and so
on online forms Banking and shopping are
possible because of java Java is a
computer-based programming language
invented by James Gosling and Sun
Microsystems in 1991 he had a single
Moto while creating the language it was
right once run anywhere this meant that
the code would have to be written only
once but it could be used anywhere they
named this language Oak because of the
oak tree outside goslings Office later
it was named to Green then to Java
Coffee which was named after the coffee
from Indonesia and finally to Java in
1995 there are three editions of java
each programmer can learn any of these
Edition itions based on the application
they want to make firstly we have Java
standard edition this Edition contains
core libraries like java.lang java. Etc
secondly we have Java Enterprise Edition
this Edition has apis like JMS ejb JSP
servlets Etc and lastly we have Java
micro Edition which is used to program
Java in cellphones setup boxes handhelds
and so on Java is an object-oriented
programming language based on C and C++
however it is improved and simplified to
solve the errors in programming Java
files are converted to bit code format
using a compiler and then executed by
the Java interpreter the whole Java code
is run on the Java virtual machine which
provides a runtime environment now the
main Concepts in Java are its methods
and classes a method is a block of code
that performs a task only when it is
called consider this example while
watching TV you use the T TV remote to
change channels each button on the
remote performs a different task methods
in Java are the same we can have methods
to add two numbers or email a person or
to convert kilometers to meters a group
of methods make a class classes are used
to organize code just like how fruits
vegetables and clinical products are
divided into different sections in a
supermarket there are a lot of features
in Java let's start by looking at them
one by one it has a simple syntax and is
very easy to understand and learn Java
language is robust it eliminates errors
that occur in the C and C++ languages
Java also has features like garbage
collectors and exception handling this
makes Java very unique the most popular
feature of java is that it is platform
independent here compilation happens in
bite code and because of this Java can
run on any machine it is a very secure
language as it contains no virus Java
has a feature of multi-threading the
feature of multi-threading helps Java do
multitasking Java is a portable language
as it can run on any platform and data
type sizes are set permanently so Java
program has a fixed size of the code the
last of all Java is not as fast as C and
C++ but provides higher performance than
any other language now let's see oops
Concepts in Java Java has four Concepts
abstraction encapsulation inheritance
and polymorphism
in Java we use objects and classes
related to the real world that makes the
code easier to make and understand
abstraction means showing the relevant
information that is needed for a task
encapsulation makes the Java code secure
data is stored within the classes and it
is not easy to access the data the next
feature is inheritance as the name
suggests the attributes and
characteristics of one class can be
inherited by another class because of
this coders take less time to create the
code lastly we have polymorphism which
means using the same method for
different tasks in Java we can use the
same object or variable in two different
places where their tasks will differ who
is a Java
developer so Java developer basically is
a professional computer software
developer who uses Java programming
language to build the
software now Java developer mainly uses
Java to build software for desktops
mobile phones and also develop software
for similar electronic devices such as a
smartphone tablet Etc now to become a
Java developer we need to have at least
a bachelor's degree in relevant stream
preferably computer science later you
might want to join an internship or a
training exercise that involves a
project or some highly recognized
certification like Oracle certified Java
developer then your dream job in in your
dream company so this was a simple walk
through or road map to become a Java
developer now moving ahead we have our
main topic for today's discussion that
is the skills required to become a Java
developer now we shall categorize this
into two stages one is the beginner and
the other is the professional we shall
discuss each one of them separately so
first we will start with the beginner so
these will be the basic skills that any
interviewer will be EXP expecting out
from a pure beginner so in the beginner
section the first skill that we will be
discussing is related to the
objectoriented programming Concepts in
Java so for a beginner the concepts of
object-oriented programming in Java play
a very important and vital role for an
interview so he or she should be having
a strong rip over the object-oriented
programming Concepts in Java so followed
by objectoriented programming Concepts
in Java we have the next important
Concept in ja Java which is the file
input and output operations and
serialization so serialization is
another way of executing your code from
a different place for example if you
write a code and you want it to execute
the same code in a different place in a
different computer all you can do is
just serialize your code to that
particular system and there the same
code will be executed so followed by the
second point the third important skill
we need to have is the good
understanding of data structures in Java
data structures or Java Collections are
the most crucial parts of programming so
for a beginner it's really important
that you have a good grip over all the
Java Collections so followed by that the
next important skill you require is to
learn how to handle exceptions so
exception handling plays a vital role in
real-time programming so you better have
that next after exception handling we
have the good understanding of jvm and
memory
management so jvm basically is the Java
virtual machine so what happens in Java
is you write a code and that particular
code is compiled and converted into bite
code so this bite code will be
transferred to jbm and then jvm executes
your bite code and results in an output
so you need to have the good
understanding of jvm and the memory
management Concepts in Java for a
beginner level so followed by that the
next important thing is multi-threading
and synchronization in Java so all those
were the basic and important crucial
skills required by a beginner if you're
attending for an interview because these
are the basic skills that every
interviewer will be looking out in a
beginner so let's have a quick overview
of the skill set again so for a beginner
level the major skill sets that you
require are to have a good understanding
of objectoriented Concepts in Java next
the file input and operations and
serialization Iz ation Concepts in Java
good understanding of data structures or
collections in Java exception handling
jvm or Java virtual machine and memory
management and finally multi-threading
and synchronization so these were the
major skills that are required by a
beginner now followed by the skill
set we will have another slide that
depicts about the IDS that you must be
comfortable with so for a beginner these
are the basic idees that you should be
comfortable with which are intellig
eclipse and net beans and also these are
the mainly used IDs in realtime
programming as well so if you are
comfortable with these three IDs then it
will be an added way to your resuming so
followed by the beginner we enter into
the next level which is the experience
level so this is really important so we
have multiple skills required by an
experience level candidate so the first
one amongst the important skills
requireed ired by an experience level
candidate are a good knowledge of big
data and artificial intelligence Yes you
heard me right artificial intelligence
there is a major misconception that R
and python are the only languages that
are built for artificial intelligence
and data science but in reality even
Java can perform the artificial
intelligence data science and machine
learning jobs using the new libraries
which are dedicatedly written for the
purpose now for an advanced or
experience level candidate the knowledge
of these libraries and the workflow is
really important so followed by that the
next important skill required by an
experience level candidate is a good
understanding of blockchain next after
the blockchain there are multiple Big
Data Frameworks out there which you need
to
learn next after that we have
microservices spring Boot and scripting
languages such as angularjs reactjs and
JavaScript so let's have a a quick
overview of the skill set required by an
experience level candidate so those are
Ai and ml libraries in Java good
understanding of blockchain harup and
Big Data Frameworks spring Boot
microservices and finally Advanced
scripting programming languages like
angularjs JavaScript and
reactjs now these skill sets might look
big complex complicated and hard to
digest but Java developers are
categorized into multiple streams of
development just for example we can see
Java developers working over web
development Android development full
stack big data machine learning
artificial intelligence and many more
now let us consider three most popular
streams where we find Java developers
which are the web development areas
Android development areas and finally
the full stack development areas so
first we will discuss the skill set
required by a web
developer
so for a web developer these are the
major skill sets required which are the
good knowledge of java serlet Pages or
JSP popular markup languages such as XML
HTML and next after that we have model
view controller so one should have a
good understanding of model view
controller or MVC architecture followed
by that we have good knowledge of web
Technologies like CSS and JavaScript and
finally Java applets so the important
Frameworks for a web developer to be
well versed with are Apache struts play
Google web toolit and finally GRS so
these are the popular Frameworks that
are currently in Trend and used by Java
web developers so followed by the web
developer next we have is the Android
developer so an Android developer is a
software developer who specializes in
designing applications for Android
Marketplace the Android market place is
a direct competitor to Apple's App Store
this means most of the Android
developers job revolves around creating
apps that we use on our smartphones and
tablets now the skill sets required by
Android developer are good grip over the
Android SDK or software development kit
next the Android testing followed by
that a better understanding of Android
API and database database connectors
like jdbc and Android security and
finally get Version Control now get
Version Control will be really helpful
to keep your code updated now followed
by the skills required by an Android
developer we will go through some
important Frameworks and user interface
development software tools required by
an Android developer in real time first
let us discuss the user interface
development tools like flut and reactjs
which are the most popular ones amongst
the others so reactjs is an open source
frontend JavaScript library for building
user interfaces or UI components it is
maintained by face Facebook and a
community of individual developers and
companies react can be used as a base in
the development of single page or mobile
applications so next after reactjs we
have the flutter flutter is an open
source user interface software
development kit created by Google it is
used to develop applications for Android
iOS Linux Mac Windows Google and many
more from a single code
base so next we have the solar 2D solar
2D is a free and open-source
crossplatform software development kit
and then we have the Android Studio that
is another popular development kit just
for Android now next in the docket is
the Java full stack developer a full
stack web developer is a person who can
develop both client and server software
in addition to mastering HTML and CSS he
or she also knows how to program a
browser like using JavaScript jQuery
angular and view so now the major skill
sets required by a full stack developer
are having a good understanding of
software design and architecture
understanding of devops knowledge of
microservices apis and libraries design
patterns in Java react and angular
scripting languages and finally should
be capable to work on front end and back
end so these were the major skills
required by a fullstack developer so
followed by this we should also discuss
the major Frameworks required by a
fullstack developer
so these are the major tools Frameworks
and scripting languages that are
supposed to be known by a fullstack
developer we have the integration tools
such as genin and devops related tools
like kubernets and docka and scripting
languages like angular and react and
Frameworks like spring and testing tools
like
junit so with this we will move ahead
into our next important topic that is
the roles and responsibilities of a a
Java
developer so first we will discuss the
roles and responsibilities of a Java
developer at beginner
level so the important roles and
responsibilities for a beginner are to
be able to define the objectives by
analyzing the requirements of the
clients followed by that to be capable
enough to complete the assigned job
before the deadlines designed and test
basic codes resolve the reported issues
in time and troubleshoot the code Improv
Prov the existing code quality and
finally support the user with proper
documentation of the code so these were
the important responsibilities of a Java
developer at beginner level now let us
advance to the next level where we will
discuss the roles and responsibilities
of experience level
candidates so the roles and
responsibilities of an advanced level or
experienced level candidate are all the
basic responsibilities of a beginner so
followed by the basic responsibilities
an advanced level level Java programmer
should be having a thorough knowledge of
system functionality and features
followed by that the experience level
Java programmer should be able to design
and develop user interface enhance the
reputation of the company recommend
updates based on the performance Ure the
best possible responsiveness and finally
explore and add value to the
achievements of fellow
co-workers so these were the important
roles and responsibilities of a Java
developer both both at beginner level
and experience level now let us check
out the companies which are looking for
Java developers there are many companies
that are looking for Java developers in
the current IT industry some of the
major mnc's looking out for Java
developers in the current IT industry
are cognizant in foris Oracle Cap Gemini
Dell Amazon weo emphasis and Accenture
now that we have discussed the companies
hiring Java developers let us take a
step further and and discuss the salary
trends of the Java developers in the
current it
Industries now let us discuss the salary
trends of Java developers in India first
so the salary trends for a Java
developer who is going through the
beginner level or an internship level
start from 2 lakh to 4 lakh rupees perom
similarly for an experience level Java
developer the salary Trends start from
five lakh and go up to 10 lakhs and
above based on your experience level and
skill set now let us go ahead and
discuss the next country which is the
United States of America so for a Java
developer at beginner level America
offers $55,000 to $80,000 per anom
similarly for an experienced level
candidate America offers $885,000 us to
$125,000 per anom based on the
experience and skills set now finally we
have the United Kingdom the United
Kingdom offers £45,000 to £60,000 for a
Java developer at a beginner level and
similarly for an experience level Java
developer United Kingdom offers £65,000
to £85,000 per anom so these were the
salary trends of Java developers in
multiple countries so if you wish to
join the right training exercise that
covers the complete skill set according
to the standards of top mnc's created
and explained in a detailed manner by
real time industry experts then simply
learn would be the right choice if you
visit the simply learn official website
for Java related training then you can
find the simply learn has beautifully
organized all the major topics of java
in a result oriented manner that will be
helpful for both beginners and
professionals so the key features of
java training offered by simply learn
will have 70 hours of Blended training
Hands-On coding and implementation of
two web-based projects it also includes
hibernate and spring Frameworks 35
coding related exercises on code Java
and lifetime access of self-based
training and finally the flexibility to
choose your own classes so the benefits
of java certification training offered
by simply learn will have the following
you can achieve your designation of
becoming a Java architect Java developer
database administrator or web developer
with the certification from simp learn
on Java so the average salaries for a
Java developer with certification will
be varying from 16 lakhs as minimum and
will also reach up to the maximum of 27
lakhs perom the Java certification from
Simply learn is been recognized by
multiple multinational companies and
some of the major MNC companies that are
hiring Java developers with the
certification of java are vs Faro Oracle
accenta City Bank and many more now we
have the three varieties of training
options which are self-based learning
online boot camp and corporate
training so what is Java it is a fast
reliable and secure programming language
that can be used in several websites and
applications it can be used to create
applications in a single computer or one
that could be distributed across several
servers and clients Java can be used in
several scenarios independent of the
system that it is used on so let's look
into what Java development kit
means all the Java applications and
applets are developed using the Java
development kit that is jdk now the jdk
consists of the Java runtime environment
an interpreter a compiler an archiver
and a document generator and a few more
tools that go into developing a Java
program so now let us have a look at the
components of jdk java runtime
environment J JRE primarily is a part of
jdk and it can also be termed as Java
RTE the jdk provides the minimal amount
of requirements needed to write and
compile a Java program JRE consists of
the jvm supporting files and the core
classes the jvm is key to both jdk and
the JRE because it is embedded into them
now whichever Java program is being run
the jvm is that component of java that
exec Utes a program line by line thus
giving itself the work of an interpreter
we are now in a position to Deep dive
into the process with which jdk JRE and
jvm work let's take a source file and
save it with the extension do Java this
file is compiled and converted into a
set of bite code which changes the file
extension into do class this is done
specifically by the jdk now here are the
steps that follow class loader it makes
sure that all the necessary classes are
loaded in the time of the execution of a
program Next Bite code verifier that is
jvm the bite code verifier checks the
code for errors or irregularities based
on access rights on objects or
implementation of pointers it makes sure
that the code fulfills the
specifications of jvm and does not break
the system integrity and finally
interpreter which is jvm now while
running the program The Interpreter
loads checks and runs the code the
implementation is made by the JRE which
is the final process the latest release
is jdk9 and it was released in October
2017 but it was in jdk8 that a new
feature called the Java Lambda
expression was introduced that changed
the face of java now Java Lambda
expression is a kind of function which
does not need any class to be created
Creed it has been included in the latest
version of jdk as it provides a clear
concise way to pass functions around
this also replaces earlier bulky
Anonymous classes and reduces code
verbosity that is the length of the code
the Syntax for the Lambda expression is
this argument list arot token
body now the syntax consists of three
components which are argument list this
can be empty or non-empty next the arrow
token now this is used to link argument
to body and finally body this contains
the statement that works with the
function let us now just see an example
of using Lambda expression and
contrasting it with how code would have
been written with Anonymous
classes this is the old
method and this is the new method with
Lambda
expression just have a look at how
Lambda expression syntax has been used
over here the jdk9 has been released
recently and it seems promising with
respect to new features and abilities
here are some of the
features the first one is Java platform
module system this module allows strong
encapsulation and declare explicit
dependencies next jshell with the help
of jshell one can directly start writing
the code on the console and execute them
improved Java doc Java docs have got the
search right in the API documentation
and as an added bonus the output is also
compliant to HTML 5 next stream API the
stream API also introduced in Java 8
allows programmers to easily paralyze
code for improved concurrency and
introduces functional programming
abilities to the language the stream API
in conjunction with Lambda Expressions
also comes in handy while iter ating
filtering and extracting large amount of
data the release of multi jar makes it
possible for codes to be run on the
newer versions of GDK to be released so
now let's download Java let's go to
Google and search for Java download
we'll go to the link we see here
rack.com so now here we have the web
page here we can see Java se13 so this
is version 13 but this isn't the one we
are going to download we going to
download the eighth version version 8
which is here now we're doing this
because 8 is one of the more commonly
used versions of java so let's click
this and here we'll go down we need to
accept the license agreement before we
can download it now we have two versions
here x86 and x64 now you can download it
depending on what version your operating
system is now if you do have a Windows
10 operating system it's highly likely
you have a 64-bit version of Windows now
if you do have a 32-bit version of
Windows you can take the x86 so let's
download this so we've actually already
logged in so we just need to run the
installer file now let's go to downloads
and run the file so here we have the
installer we go to the next
step we'll select this to next here we
can see where the file is being
installed to we'll go to
next now if you want to change where you
want to install Java we can press the
Change option I'm just going to keep it
here we'll press next and let's commence
with
installation and there we go the
installation is now complete so we don't
need any tutorials or API documentation
so we'll just finish off and go to close
now to see if Java is installed in your
system we can go to command prompt and
type the term Java C which refers to the
Java
compiler now as you can see here this
shows a number of different options you
can choose from this also indicates that
Java has been successfully installed in
your system now if the installation was
not successful you'll see something like
Java C is not recognized as an internal
or external command operable program or
batch file but since we've done it
successfully this is what will be shown
now and now we going to set an
environment variable now what exactly is
an environment variable now assume you
have a file which has a Java extension
this environment variable tells the
computer that the Java program needs to
be called to run this particular file so
to set the environment variable we'll
need to go to control
panel here go into system in
security go to system and select
Advanced system settings and then this
shows up now before we go into
environment variables we'll need to go
to where the Java file was installed so
let's go to this PC C drive program
files
and here let's go to
Java so let's go to jdk which is the
Java development kit let's go to bin
here and copy this
path we'll go back to environment
variables select path here and then
press on
new paste this and okay now we'll go
back and go to JRE to the path of JRE
which is Java runtime environment you
click on this
pin again and copy this
path select this
one new and paste
that and there we go the environment
variables are now set now let's talk
about running that simple program I told
you about now this is possible with the
help of an IDE an IDE or integrated
development environment will give us a
platform to code Java we will be using
eclipse and intellig as they are popular
and commonly used that being said there
are several other IDs that are available
in the market so now let's work with
Eclipse let's go to Google and search
for
Eclipse we'll go to this
link press download and then this shows
up let's click on download now we've
already downloaded the software so I'm
just going to directly go into the
install phase downloads and select
Eclipse with this you can see that there
are multiple options for you to choose
from so we're going to select Eclipse ID
for Java developers now you have other
options like for CN C++ JavaScript PHP
and so on let's go to the first one and
here you have the details you can change
them if you want but I'm just going to
go ahead with installation now press
accept
now here we remember accepted licenses
and press
accept and then here as well we'll
remember accepted certificates select
this one and accept
selected and there you go the
installation is now complete let's click
on launch now so here we setting up a
directory as a workspace uh I'm not
changing it here so I'm just going to go
with
launch here we have the eclipse
workspace now let's close this first and
here we have the package Explorer now in
case this doesn't show up you can go to
window Show view and select on package
Explorer so now let's go to file new and
Java project we need to set up a project
name I'm going to call it my project
one go to next we'll go to source so
this is where the source code for your
program is going to be stored then let's
finish and now we'll click on my project
one go to Source I click new and create
a class we'll claim I'll name the class
my
class and create it and here we have it
so now let's write a simple program to
multiply two numbers so now let's write
the main main
function
Open
Bracket now we're going to initialize
the first
number now the second
one and finally the output and finally
the variable that will store the output
but now we'll just give them a simple
print
statement now let's run The Code by
clicking this option here
using my class. Java and there we have
it here the product is shown to be 100
indicating that the program is running
successfully now we're done with Eclipse
now let's move on to the other ID I was
talking about which is intellig so for
that again we have to go back to Google
so that we can download it search for
intellig download go to this link here
so here you can see that we have two
options the ultimate edition and the
community version now here the ultimate
version has way more more options as you
can see here but it's a paid version and
only has a free trial now the community
version is free so that's what we're
going to take so we'll click on download
here so I've already downloaded the
software so I don't need to do it again
so I'm going to go downloads and so here
we go let's just click on next select
the location where you want to install
it press next now we will add a 64-bit
launcher shortcut on the desktop and
create associations so basically this
means that these are the different file
extensions that this will support so
java. gry and now let's go to the next
step we'll install now and we'll wait
and there we go the installation is now
complete let's not import any
settings we'll accept the privacy policy
we'll set
defaults now let's create a new project
so here make sure your project SDK is
set to the version of java you've
installed make sure this is in blank
we'll go to next here you need to select
this option which is the create project
from Tex template and we are now going
to create a command line
application press next name the project
which I'm going to call my proo two you
can change the location if you want I'm
just going to keep it the way it is and
then click on
finish so now we're going to create a
simple program through which based on
the users's input we can determine
whether a number is even or odd so first
we're going to import the package
scanner through which we can take the
users's input
next let's go inside here let's create
the varable
reader now let's ask for the users
input
enter a
number we're taking in the value now in
the variable
num
reader do next int so this is with which
we'll be taking in the value from the
user so we're going to set up a
condition to determine whether the
number is even or not so if the
number when when divided by two provides
the remainder zero it indicates that
it's an even number we'll show them
then now for the else case
the number is not
even or in this case
odd there we go we're done so let's run
this
program so let's enter 12
12 the number is even and there we go we
have a successful output this indicates
that the program is running successfully
now we'll move ahead from beginners to
advanced level Java projects so let's
start with the first Java Project online

and gain handsome salary packages then
look at this wide range of software
development courses by simply learn in
collaboration with the top universities
across the globe so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more details now let's quickly begin
with our session first of all we will
discuss the right angle triangle
pattern
so basically the right angle triangle
star pattern looks something like this
as it is shown on my screen so to
resolve this problem statement and print
the pattern we must assume that this
particular star Arrangement is made in
the form of a matrix where the first row
has single star and the second row has
two stars third row has three stars and
so on now to execute this particular
code we might need two for Loops so the
first for Loop Loop will be for printing
the rows and the second one will be for
printing The Columns now let us execute
a practical program and see how does it
work don't worry about the codes that we
will be executing here because I have
formatted a draft about all the codes
that I will be executing today and that
particular file will be attached in the
description box below on my screen you
can see the particular pattern which is
a right angle triangle star pattern so
as discussed before we will have the
first outter for Loop which will be for
printing the rows so inside the outer
for Loop we have the second for Loop
which we will be using for printing the
colums you can see I have defined the
row value as five which means we will be
printing the star pattern for five rows
and we have used a counter variable
which is I which is assigned the value
of one and the comparator operator is
used here which is I should be less than
or equal to the number of rows declared
and followed by that we have a
pre-increment operator and once the
condition is true the control will be
entered into the second for Loop where
we have the next counter variable which
is J so we have assigned J is equals to
1 and the comparator operator which is J
should be less than or equal to I which
is the value here which is in the outer
follow Loop and followed by that we have
the pre-increment operator once the
condition is true the control will enter
into the inside for Loop and will print
a St
so here just let us assume that the
value of I is one and the statement is
true so the control will enter into the
second for Loop and it will see the
conditional operator here so J is less
than or equal to I so value of 1 is less
than or equal to 1 and the star will be
printed after that we have the
pre-increment operator so here the J
value will be incremented to 2 now if
you compare the values 2 is not less
than or not equal to 1 so the condition
fails here so it will not print a star
again it will come out of the inner for
Loop and it will see the next statement
which says it should print in the next
line whereas in the inside followe you
can see we just used print not print in
the new line so it will come to the new
line and go back to the follow loop
again and the increment of I will be
taken place and the same runs again now
let us try to execute this program and
see the
output so you can see that the program
got successfully executed and the right
angle triangle star pattern is print
successfully now let us go into the next
type of
program so the next type of program is
the inverted right angle triangle star
pattern so similarly according to the
previous example we also consider this
one in the form of a matrix so you can
see that in the first row we have five
stars in the second row we have four
stars similarly so on now let us try to
check out the code and learn how does it
work and how to print the star pattern
on our screen we are back in the
Practical mode again so the kind of
pattern that we want to print is this
one which is a little bit similar to the
previous one but only thing it is
inverted so the code is pretty much the
same but the only changes that we need
to do are related to the comparator
operator in the previous example we
chose that I should be less than or
equal to 1 and in the next stage we used
pre-increment operator in here we are
using a different one which is pre-
decrement and inside the the follow Loop
we have the J comparator operator in the
same way so here we have declared the
row value as five and inside the for
Loop we will equate the counter variable
equals to rows which is five and
followed by that the comparator operator
Compares if the value of I is greater
than or equal to 1 and followed by that
we will use the predent operator once
the condition is true the control will
enter into the inside fall Loop and here
here the counter variable J is assigned
to the value one and the condition is J
should be less than or equal to I and
followed by that we have the
pre-increment operator which is Plus+ G
so once the condition is true it will
print the value of a star and followed
by that it will again continue the loop
so here the follow Loop will work in the
following way in I is equal to 5 I is
great greater than or equal to 1 which
is true and pred decrement so the
condition is true so the control will
enter into the inside for Loop where it
will again compare with value of J J is
equals to 1 and J is less than or equal
to 5 and followed by that we have the
post increment so the control will enter
inside the followup and print a star and
followed by that in the next instance
the value of J will be incremented to
two so 2 is less than or equal to I
followed by that pre-increment and in
the next iteration it will print a star
again so this will continue until the
condition is true once the condition
fails the control will exit the fall
Loop and Print in the next line you can
see that we have print in the new line
here which is unlike the print function
which is inside the fall Loop so this
will continue until the statements are
true now let us try to execute this
program and see if the desired pattern
will be printing or
not there you can see that the program
got successfully executed and the
pattern which we desired for is printed
on the screen now let us move ahead into
the next type of
pattern so the next type of pattern is
the arrow-shaped pattern and this almost
looks familiar to the previous two
programs the only difference is we have
combined them together to form an Arrow
pattern now let us try to combine the
previous two programs and print
this so now you can see on my screen we
have our desired pattern which looks
like an arrow so as discussed before we
are trying to combine the two programs
that we executed before so the first
half of the program is designed for the
first half of the pattern which is
completely similar to our first program
so the second half of the pattern is
from our second program but the only
difference here is we have considered
the value of rows is row minus one
because we don't want another extra row
to be printing here in this way so you
can see if we used I value is equals to
rows then the pattern would be something
like this we will not have a pointed
Edge so to get a pointed Edge we will
use row minus one to get this pattern we
desired
for now let us try to execute this
program and print the
output now let us enter the number of
rows we want let's enter
five so there you go let me expand my
output screen yeah there you go we have
the pattern which we desired for and
don't forget that we need to use row
minus one in the next stage which is the
second half of the program
so this is how the arrow pattern is
printed now let us move further and see
the next type of pattern in our list so
in the next pattern we have the right
angle triangle which is completely
similar to the first one but the
hypotenuse is on the other side as you
can see this is the difference between
the first program and this program so in
the first program we had the hypotenuse
in this direction and now we have the
hypotenuse in the opposite direction
now similarly to the first program we
shall consider this one as well in the
form of a matrix so you can see if we
consider this pattern in the form of a
matrix we have four spaces followed by a
star similarly in the second row we have
three spaces followed by two stars in
the third one we have two spaces and
three stars and so on so the main point
that we need to consider here is first
we we need to print the spaces followed
by that we need to print the Stars to
get this pattern now let us execute a
practical program and see the output so
back in the Practical mode you can see
on my screen the desired pattern what we
are looking for is this so here the only
difference is we have to print this
spaces first so for printing the spaces
we will be using this follow loop with
the condition Jal to 2 into n minus I
and J should be greater than or equals
to Zer and J decrement which is a post
decrement operator so what is the value
of n n is nothing but the value of row
so the value of n is declared in the
main function and N is equals to 5 after
that we will be calling the print Stars
function which is over here and the
value of n will be carried over here and
then the counter variables I and J will
take care of the for loops now let us
try to execute this program and see the
output so you can see that the program
is successfully executed and the desired
pattern is printed successfully so this
follow Loop will be run until the
condition is true once this for Loop
fails we will enter into the next for
Loop which is particularly designed to
print the
stars now after this let us move ahead
into our next type of
pattern so the next type of pattern is
an inverted right angle triangle pattern
which is opposite to the second type of
program that we dealt
with now similarly let us consider this
in the same way as we considered all the
other programs that is in the form of a
matrix so here we have five stars in the
first row four stars in the next one and
one space followed by that we have two
spaces followed by that we have the
three stars and three spaces two stars
and so on now let us see a practical
program and try to print this particular
pattern so we are back in the Practical
mode so you can see that the desired
star pattern is this and it is
completely similar to our previous
pattern so the only difference is we
tried to print spaces first in the
earlier pattern and here we are trying
to print the Stars first so that's the
only
difference and we have the same for
loops so the first follow Loop is for
rows and it will print spaces and the
second follow Loop is for stars which
will print the stars as you can see we
have the row values and the column
values here as the comparator operator
and we have the comparator operator
which finds if J is greater than I in
the first case the loop will fail
because the value of J and I are
completely similar because we have
declared I is equals to rows in the
first out of the for Loop and same J is
equals to rows in the second inner for
Loop so obviously the condition has to
fail and it will not print any space
here it will directly enter into the
next for Loop and will print the star
pattern and followed by that we will
enter into the next line so this
followup will print the number of stars
in the first row according to the row
number for example if we give five as
the row number then it will print five
stars in the first row and it will exit
the fall Loop and it will enter into the
next line and the same pattern will be
continued now let us try to execute this
program and see the
output now let us give five as the
number of rows needed so there you go
you can see the star pattern here so
this is how this particular star pattern
will be generated now let us move
further and check out the next type of
pattern program in our list so the the
next type of pattern program in our list
is Arrow so this arrow is completely
similar to the previous one the only
difference is it is in the inverted way
which is it is pointed towards the left
side now let us check out the Practical
program and learn how to execute
this back on to Eclipse IDE so you can
find some similarities between the
previous two programs and this
particular program in the previous two
programs we we Tred to print the first
half of the pattern and followed by that
we have printed the second half of the
pattern now we going to just combine
both the programs and print this
particular Arrow
pattern so here the first half of this
particular program is concerned with the
top portion of this pattern which is the
right angle triangle followed by that
the second half of the program
where we have the conditions
placed so this particular segment of the
code takes care about the second half of
the program which is the inverted right
angle triangle now let us try to execute
this program and see the
output so let us specify the number of
rows as five completely similar to the
previous two programs now let's press
enter now there you go let me expand my
my
console so there you go you can see the
arrow
pattern so this is how you print an
arrow pattern pointing towards the left
side we have also discussed an arrow
pattern where the arrow will be pointing
towards the right side as the program
number
three again don't worry about the codes
all the programs that I'm going to
execute in this session are drafted in
the form of a text document and that is
linked in in the description box below
you can take that source file and
practice the programs for yourself no
worry now let's move ahead and check out
the next type of
program so the next type of pattern that
we have in our list is the pyramid we
also call this an acute angled triangle
star
pattern now let us understand the logic
for
this now you can see without the Matrix
format this looks completely similar to
our first program but only the
difference is we have a space which is
obvious but there is a small difference
let us check out what's the difference
is if we look this program in the form
of a matrix you can see there are
variations in spaces in the first row we
have two spaces one star followed by
that again two spaces in the next row we
have alternate space and star space and
star and similarly in the third row we
have a star space star and space so this
is how the Matrix continues according to
the number of rows provided so let us
understand how the logic exactly works
for this
program okay so you can see the pattern
that we desired is in the form of an
acute angle triangle or pyramid now we
have two counter variables which is I is
equal to 0 in the out of for Loop and J
isal to n minus1 which is inside the for
Loop so the value of n is equals to 5
which is the total number of rows that
we needed in our particular pattern now
you can see in the outer for Loop we
have the condition which is I should be
less than n so I should be less than the
number of rows which is equals to five
followed by that we have the post
increment operator I ++ so the condition
will be true because 0 is less than 5
and it will enter into the inside for
Loop where we have J which is equals to
5 5 - 0 followed by that we have the
condition so 5 is greater than one so
the resultant of this particular
statement is five so five which is now
the value of J is greater than one
followed by that we have the post
decrement operator which will decrease
the value of J in every iteration so
once the statement is true it will try
to print a
space
so it will print the spaces until the
condition is true so once the first for
Loop fails the control will enter into
the next following for Loop where we
have J is equals to z and j should be
less than or equal to the value of I
which is currently equals to zero and
followed by the conditional statement we
have the post increment operator which
is j++ so this particular for Loop is
used for printing two two things which
is the first one star followed by that
we have a space so once this follow Loop
gets executed the control will exit it
and will print in the new line so this
is how the program works now let us try
to execute this program and see the
a there you go the program got
successfully executed and the required
spaces and the stars are been printed
here so as you can see we have spaces
followed by that we have a star
similarly
space spaces on to the left a star and
the second
star so followed by the previous program
we have the next program which is also
considered to be like a pyramid but the
only difference is it is in an inverted
format now let us check out the logic
behind this program and try to execute a
practical program so logic wise it's
completely similar to the previous one
we have star followed by that we have a
space and again a star space and a star
next row we have alternate space and
star and finally we have two spaces star
and two spaces so the number of spaces
and stars is based upon the number of
rows we provide now let us try to
execute a program and see the output
don't worry this is completely similar
to the previous one but the only
difference is it is printed in the
inverted fashion so there will be minor
changes to the code let's try to look on
those changes so here we are back in
Eclipse so the desired pattern is here
which is an inverted pyramid and the
preium program was a regular pyramid so
here is the logic and we have The
Following fall Loops so the first fall
Loop is dedicated for printing the
number of spaces we require so inside
the exterior for Loop we have the
counter variable I is equals to 0 and I
should be less than or equals to the
number of rows minus one and followed by
that we have the post increment operator
i++ so let us assume that we have
provided the number of rows to be five
and according to the logic I is equals
to 0 and followed by that 0 is less than
or equals to 5us 1 which is four and
followed by that we have the post
increment operator which will increment
the value of I to 1 once after the fall
Loop first iteration is finished so once
the exterior fall Loop
condition is true the control will enter
into the second for Loop which is the
internal for Loop and we have the second
counter variable which is J is equals
to0 followed by that the comparator
operator which says J should be either
less than or equal to the value of I
followed by that we have the post
increment operator on J so this
particular code segment or the first
part of the program takes care about the
number of spaces where require in our
pattern followed by that we have the
second for Loop which will take care of
the number of stars we print and the
number of spaces we require after the
star
pattern now let us try to execute this
program and see the
output now let us provide the number of
rows we need let's provide the value as
five now there you go according to the
logic provided in the program this star
patterns are successfully generated
followed by this
spaces now moving ahead we have the next
type of pattern which is the combination
of first and second pyramids now let us
understand the logic and print this
pattern now you can see the desired
pattern is the combination of the first
pyramid and the second pyramid so the
first half of the program is derived
from the first perimet pattern and the
second part of the program program is
derived from the second pyramid pattern
now we have combined them together and
now we are trying to print the rhombus
pattern now let's try to execute this
program and see the output let us
provide the number of U rows as five and
there you go so here you can see the uh
desired star pattern has been
successfully executed so according to
the input we have the first five rows
and followed by that we have the
inverted star pattern where we avoided
the first row and printed the following
four rows so that we have a proper
Rubik's pattern now moving ahead we
shall see the next type of pattern in
our list so followed by the previous
pattern we have the next type of pattern
which looks completely similar to the
previous one but the only difference is
we have printed the second type of
pyramid first and then the first type of
pyramid which makes it look like an our
glass now let us understand the logic
and print this
pattern so here is the desired pattern
what we are looking for and this was the
previous pattern what we
printed now followed by the first
segment we have the second segment which
is dedicated to print the second half of
the pattern which happens to be the
first type of pyramid which is a regular
pyramid but the only difference is
inside the first follow we are using the
rows minus one command because we don't
want an extra star so if we add in an
extra star this pattern will look a
little abnormal so let us try so this is
what it looks like if we had an extra
star there so let us remove
it so this is how our pattern should
look like so that's the reason why we
are using row minus one here now let us
try to execute this program and see the
output now let us enter the number of
rows we want let us input
five enter so there you go you can see
the program got successfully executed
and the desired star pattern has been
printed on the console now let us move
further and have a look on the next type
of pattern in our list so followed by
the our glass pattern we have the next
pattern where we need to print a
diagonal star
pattern now if we look at the logic it's
just a single line which is placed in
the form of a diagonal now let us check
check the logic behind
it so you can see we have printed stars
in the form of a diagonal of a matrix
now we have the first four spaces
followed by that we have a star and
similarly three spaces provided by a
star then a space and so on now to print
this pattern what's the logic let's go
back to eclipse and try to print this
program so this is our desired pattern
now let us go into our program now in
inside the program we have two counter
variables which are one I two is J so
the first for Loop is I is equals to 1 I
is less than or is equals to 5 which is
the row number then I post increment so
when the logic is true which is 1 is
less than or equal to the row number
five the control will enter into the
second for Loop so once the control
enters into the outer for Loop we have
the second for Loop where we have our
second counter variable which is J J is
equals to0 and J is less than 5 - I
which is 5 - 1 which is a current value
of I which is four so 0 is the value of
J currently so 0 is less than four
followed by that we have the post
increment on J counter variable so once
the condition is true the control will
enter into the second in a for Loop and
will print space so this Loop will run
until the condition is true once the
condition fails it will come out of the
inner for Loop and will print a star in
the new line followed by that it will
continue to start the out ofall loop
again so this is how the flow goes ahead
now let's run the program and see the
output so you can see the program got
successfully executed and the desired
pattern is printed now let's move ahead
and understand the next type of patter
pattern in our program so the next type
of pattern is a little bit similar to
the previous one so in the previous
pattern we had one diagonal right now we
have two diagonals which have formed the
shape of X so we can consider this as an
next pattern now let us check out the
logic and next after that let's execute
the program so according to the logic
when we consider this particular pattern
in a form of a matrix we have the Stars
printed in in the first row followed by
that we have three spaces and then again
a star so this is continued in the same
way with alternate spaces and in the
third row we have a single intersection
point with one star so this is how the
pattern should look like once the
program gets executed now let us check
out the program and see the
output so you can see on my output
console this was our previous pattern
now what we're going to do is make a
similar pattern in the opposite
direction and make sure
they intersect each other now you can
see our program has two segments the
first segment and the second segment
they both look a little similar because
the first segment will print the upper
part of the pattern that is the first V
and then the second segment will print
the lower part of the pattern which is
the inverted V now let us check out the
condition we have the first outer loop
which has the first counter variable
which is I equal to n n is nothing but
the number of rows that we want in our
pattern then I should be greater than or
equal to 1 followed by that we have the
post decrement operator where we will
decrease the value of I then if the
condition is true then the control will
enter into the next statement where we
have the inner for loop with second
counter variable that is J is equals to
I then the condition is J should be less
than the value of rows provided then
post increment of J and if the condition
statement is true then it will enter
into the inner for Loop and it will
print a space similarly for printing the
star we have the next segment inside the
next segment the condition is a little
trickier because we don't want to print
any stars in The Space Between the x
pattern we provide this condition where
J is equals to 1 and J should be less
than or equals to 2 * the value of I
which is the aut ofall Loop minus1 if
this condition is true the control will
enter inside the follow Loop where we
have F else condition if J is equals to
is equal to 1 or Jal to isal to 2 into
IUS 1 then we should print a star else
we should print a space so this will
print the upper part of the pattern and
similarly we have another segment which
will print the lower part of the pattern
which is the inverted V pattern now
let's execute this program and see the
output
as you can see the program got executed
now let us provide the value of n let us
provide five and there you go you can
see that the program printed the desired
pattern so this is the first half of the
pattern which is the proper V then this
is the second half of the program which
is the inverted V so this is what the
flow of the program is now let us move
further and check out the next pattern
in our list so the next pattern in our
list is the inverted V pattern
now let us check out the logic behind it
if you see this in the form of a matrix
then you can recognize this we had
already discussed similar program which
was the third one where we had printed
the pyramid shape but the only
difference is we have missed out the
star in between which makes it look like
a inverted V now let us go back to
eclipse and execute a program based on
this to print this pattern as you can
see we have our desired pattern on my
screen which is an inverted V so if we
check out the logic we have outside Loop
and inside loop so we have two for Loops
so the first outer for Loop has out is
equals to 1 out should be less than or
equals to the number of row size then
post increment of outside
variable if the condition is true we
enter into the inner for Loop where we
have inner loop is equals to 1 inner
loop should be less than or equals to
the row size into two then we have
increment operator which is a post
increment so if this particular
condition is true then we enter into
another statement where we have the IFL
statement so if in value is equals to is
equals to control X or in is equals to
print control y then we should print
star else we should print a space now
let us try to execute this program and
see the
output now let us provide the row side
which is five so as you can see we have
got our desired pattern now let us move
ahead and execute the next type of
pattern which is the V pattern now let
us understand the logic behind
it it is completely similar to the
previous program but the difference is
the pattern is in inverted position to
the previous one which is in the proper
V format so now let us try to check out
the code and execute the program and
print the pattern so on my screen you
you can see the desired pattern what we
are looking for which is V now the
previous program was to print an
inverted V so the complete program is
same but only there is a minor change in
the logic where we have replaced I as
greater than or equals to
zero and there is some change in the
second segment as well now let us try to
execute this program and see the
output so you can see the program got
successfully executed and the desired
pattern is printed here the value of n
or row size is equals to 5 which we have
declared here in the main part now let
us get back and check out the next
pattern to be executed in our
list so the next pattern is the
combination of both an inverted V and a
normal V which will result in the form
of a Rus now as you can see this is our
previous program now we have two
segments in our code where we have the
first segment to print print the
starting or the top position which is an
inverted V format and the second segment
of the code is designed to print the
second half of the pattern which is the
normal V pattern so we will combine
these two and print the rombus
shape now let me provide the number of
rows which is five so there you go you
can see the desired pattern now let us
move ahead and check out our next
pattern so the next pattern is
completely similar to one of the
previous ones which is a pyramid pattern
but the difference is this pyramid is
hollow or in other words this looks like
an accute angled triangle now let us
understand the logic behind it so if you
look at this Matrix then you can find
that we are going to print the stars in
the form of a side of the triangle which
is we will print the stars in the shape
of a triangle and nothing inside the
Matrix now let us understand the program
and print this pattern so as you can see
the desired pattern is has been located
here which is a triangular pattern now
inside this we have three particular
follow Loops so the first fall Loop is
the outo fall Loop and the rest two
follow Loops are the internal fall Loops
so the first internal fall Loop is
dedicated to print spaces where we don't
require stars and the second internal
follow Loop is dedicated to print Stars
where we require them also we have an if
condition which decides where to print a
star and where not to now if you look at
the condition I should be less than or
equal to the number of rows provided and
if the condition is true then we enter
into the internal for Loop and in the
internal for Loop if J is less than the
number of rows given then in that
particular location we need to print a
space once the condition in the first
fall Loop is failed the control will
enter into the next fall Loop where we
have the next counter variable that is K
is equal to 1 and K should be less than
or equals to 2 into IUS 1 where the
value of I is 1 at the current
stage and followed by that we have the
post increment of the value of K if K is
equal to equal to 1 or I is equal to
equal to the number of rows or k is
equal to equal to 2 Star IUS one then we
should print a star so this will give
the location in The Matrix where we
should print star to make it as a
triangle pattern if location is anything
else than the condition provided then we
should be printing space there now let
us try to execute this program and see
the
output let us provide the number of rows
as
five so there you go we have printed the
desired
pattern so the next pattern after the
triangle pattern is the Box pattern so
this particular program will be
completely similar to the previous
program the only difference is we need
to to find the locations where we need
to print Stars so that the resultant
pattern looks like a box so for that we
will make some changes in our program
and those changes will be related to the
rows and
columns now let us understand the logic
so as discussed before we need to look
at this pattern in the form of a matrix
and check out the number of rows and
columns so where the number of row and
column are equal we need to print a star
so let us now check out the program and
execute the program to print this
particular pattern so as you can see on
my screen we have the same program that
we used to print the triangle but now
here we have rows and columns so n is
nothing but the row and M is nothing but
the column so if the value of the
external for Loop that is I is equal to
equals to 1 and I is equal to equals to
the number of rows provided similarly J
is equal to equal to 1 which is the
internal for Loop counter variable value
and if J is equal toal to M that is the
column value then we should print a star
in that particular location and wherever
the location does not match we should
provide a space now let us try to
execute this program and see the
output so there you go we have our
desired pattern which is the Box
pattern now let us move ahead and check
out the next type of pattern in our list
so you can see the next pattern is
completely similar to our first pattern
the first pattern was our right angled
triangle now we have the same right
angled triangle but the only difference
is we have used numbers here now we will
use the numbers from our forur loops and
we will print the same values in our
pattern so that it looks like a right
angle
triangle now let us understand the logic
so we will see this pattern in the form
of a matrix now we will print the
numbers where we require them where we
don't require the numbers we will print
spaces now let us check out the program
and execute it to print the following
pattern now you can see we have got back
to our same program but the only
difference is here we are using the
values of the iner for Loop which is j
instead of a star previously we used
star symbol here and we are now
replacing it with the inner follow Loop
value let us try to execute this program
and see the
output now let us enter the number of
rows as five and there you go we have
the values of the internal fall Loop
making the pattern look like a right
angle triangle pattern now let us move
further and check out on our next type
of pattern in the list so here is
another right angled triangle in our
list but the difference is we are using
the numbers in a continuous manner which
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 to 15 this type of
triangle is also called as floid
triangle now let us understand the logic
so similar to the previous one we will
consider this in the the form of a
matrix and we will print the numbers
only way we require them that is to form
a right angle triangle where we don't
need the numbers we will try to print a
space there now let us check out the
program and execute it and print this
pattern now you can see we have got back
to eclipse and don't get scared about
the pattern it's completely similar to
the previous one only thing is we will
be using one extra counter variable
which is K so we have provided the value
of K is equal to 1 and where we are
supposed to print Stars we will add the
post increment operator to the counter
variable K so whenever the for Loop gets
executed we will be printing the values
of K which is 1 2 3 4 5 and so on now
let us try to execute this program and
see the
output so there you go the values of K 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 until 15 so this is how the
Floy triangle works now let's get back
and check out the next pattern in our
list so the next pattern in our list is
similar to the previous one which is
Pyramid so this type of pyramid is also
called as pascals triangle now let us
check out the logic the logic is
completely similar to the pyramid's
logic but instead of star we going to
use numbers so this type of triangle is
called as pascals triangle and the logic
is also a little bit different from the
regular pyramid let us understand the
logic through the code
so now you can see the program on my
screen so the logic and the follow Loops
used are completely similar to that of
the pyramid but only the difference is
we going to print the value of
number so the number is firstly
initialized as one followed by that we
have a formula for that which is number
is equals to number into IUS J / J + 1
which are the values of the counter
variables of out outter fall Loop and in
a for Loop respectively now let's try to
execute this program and see the
pattern so you can see the program got
successfully executed and the Floy
triangle has been successfully
constructed
here now let us move ahead and check out
the next pattern in our list so the next
pattern in our list is a box which is
made up of binary numbers now let us
understand the logic for it first so if
we look at this in the form of a matrix
we have binary number numers 1 and zero
which forms the pattern of a box now let
us check out the program and execute the
program to print this particular
pattern so you can see on my screen we
have the program to print that
particular box type of pattern using the
binary numbers so we have the external
for Loop for rows and the counter
variable I is equals to 1 and I should
be less than or equal to the number of
rows provided once the condition is true
we enter into the external for Loop
where we have the number number and
where we have the condition I modulus 2
is equal to is equal to 0 and the number
is equal to 0 and inside that we have
our logic to print the binary
numbers now let us try to execute this
program and see the
out now let me place the number of rows
as five and there you go we have our box
pattern using binary numbers now let us
get back and check the next pattern in
our list so the the next pattern is the
Ruby
pattern this is completely similar to
our program where we printed the Ruby
pattern using the stars now we'll use
the numbers and print that particular
pattern now the logic for this is
completely same that of the Ruby pattern
we used but the only difference is
instead of a star we'll be placing the
value of the counter variables now let
us try to execute this program and see
the
output so there you go the program
program got successfully executed and
instead of stars we have printed the
Ruby pattern using the numbers now
moving ahead we have our next pattern so
here the next pattern is completely
similar to the first one which is the
right angled triangle pattern but here
instead of numbers or Stars we will be
using alphabets so for alphabets we will
be using the ask values in the program
let us check out that program soon now
first let's understand the logic the
logic is also completely similar to the
right angle triangle which we followed
for stars and numbers now let's check
out the
program so as you can see the desired
pattern is the right angle triangle made
out of alphabets so the logic is
completely true but the only difference
is we are going to print characters
using asky values and alphabet
function now let us try to execute this
program and see the output so the
desired pattern is the right angle
triangle print using the alphabets now
the logic is completely similar to the
right angle triangle pattern but the
only difference is we are going to use
the S values so we have declared an
integer type variable alphabet with the
S value 65 which should start the
alphabets from capital A because the ask
value of capital A is
65 now let us run the program and see
the
output so there you go the program got
successfully executed and we have the
right angle triangle printed using the
capital alphabets now let's get back and
check out our next pattern so our next
pattern is a pyramid again so instead of
numbers and stars we are going to use
the alphabetical values now let's check
out the logic even here you can see the
logic is similar to The Pyramid logic
now let's check out the code and execute
the code and see the pattern now you can
even see the logic is also similar to
The Pyramid logic but here here the only
difference is we are going to use the
ask value that is 65 which is equivalent
to Capital a now in the print statement
instead of a star we are going to print
the alphabets and this particular follow
Loop is for spaces now let's quickly
execute this program and see the
output so there you go the pyramid
pattern has been successfully printed if
you want to become a successful software
developer and gain handsome salary
packages then look at this wide range of
software development courses by simply
learn in collaboration with the top
universities across the globe so what
are you waiting for hurry up and enroll
now a year of experience is preferred to
enroll in these courses so check out the
link mentioned in the description box
below for more details so in this
session we are going to focus on a
particular project and the project we
are going to focus is is about an ATM
application so you might have interacted
with different ATM Stores in your cities
where you go in you insert your card you
enter your PIN and then you can view the
balance you can withdraw some amount you
can also deposit some amount from the
ATM so we will try to look at it from
that perspective and and we will see
what kind of different uh Java and oops
Concepts we can use to build such ATM
application this is not a super
versatile application but this is just
to give you the idea of how to use those
oops Concepts to build a simple or a
complex Java application so let's start
from the options menu new class because
that will give us the understanding of
what kind of functionality I'm using and
here you will use that I using different
concepts which I have taught you so far
in this particular Series so for example
we are using the IU exception we are
using the hashmap class we also using a
scanner class which is used to take
input from the command
line so this option menu class is
extending the account class and I will
come to the account class in a while but
let's see what this option menu class is
doing this particular class has a uh it
is using a decimal format money format
class which is to denote what kind of
format of money you have then we have a
hashmap which is storing the couple of
uh Records of account number to pin
mapping so we create an map and inside
the get login method we add couple of
entries to the map here the first entry
the first in integer is pointing to the
customer number and the second integer
is pointing to the pin of the account of
this particular customer
number so if we call the get login
method this method will insert the
data after that it will ask the customer
to enter the customer number which has
to be one of these two if you provide
any other value then there should be a
logic in the application to reject the
input so whatever in a customer number
the customer inputs we pass that inside
this particular method called set
customer number again I will come back
to that and once you have provided a
valid customer number then this method
is going to ask you to enter a PIN
number and remember I told you this is
the customer number to the pin number
mapping so whatever customer number you
select from here you will be providing
the corresponding pin number and again
if you provide an invalid pin number you
will get an error so so that will all
happen inside this Tri block and if you
enter any invalid characters in the pin
number or the ATM uh customer number
then you will get an exception which I
am writing inside the catch block this
is all what we have seen so
far after the successful enter of the
customer number and the pin number I
fetch those values from these two
methods again I will talk about what
these methods are doing and again I'm
doing some basic validation checks but
things get interesting interesting in
this method so what we covered so far
was the get login method let me close
this method here so we covered the get
login method the second method which is
defined in this particular class is the
account type so here the we will ask the
once the customer has provided the
customer number and the pin number we
will ask the customer to provide the
account type this application supports
two different account types which are
checking account or a savings account so
whatever so the customer has to choose
one of them again we will be taking the
input from the command line using the
scanner class and then I'm using a
switch case if the customer entered one
then I will execute some code for the
checking account which is defined here
in the case one and if the customer
enter two then the case two will be
executed and if the if it enters three
then I will exit the application by just
printing ass sis out so here I'm using
the switch case construct to provide
different options to the customer
there's also a default case specified
here which says invalid choice so this
is what is happening in the get account
type
method the next method is if the
customer has used the option
one then we call the get checking method
so let's go to the get checking method
which is the next method which is
defined in this particular class so if
the customer has selected a checking
account then we provide the following
functionality to the customer which is
the customer can view the balance
customer can withdraw the funds customer
can deposit the funds to the checking
account or they can just exit the
application and again I'm using a switch
case here based on the customer types 1
2 3 or four the corresponding case block
will be executed for example if the
customer wants to view the balance then
this block will get executed and I call
the get account type
method if the customer selects the two
as the withdraw fund then get checkings
with withdraw input method gets called
and then get account type gets called
similarly if the customer enters three
then we deposit the fund and for that
also I have defined a method I will go
to the definition of these methods as we
go along but right now we are just
building the framework so the get
checking deposit input method will be
called whenever the customer selects the
option three and for option four we just
exit the
application so this is what is happening
in the get checking method now if from
the account selection if the customer
selected second option which was savings
account then we were calling get saving
method so this is where the get saving
method is defined and again it is
following the exact same format as we
saw in the get checking method where we
pres present the following options like
viewing balance withdrawing the funds
and depositing the funds in the savings
account and I have some methods defined
here for example get saving withdraw
input get saving deposit
input so we Define the switch case here
based on the customer choices here and
that is what is happening in the get
saving method so let me close this
method as well and that's all what is
defined inside the option menu class so
we ask the customer to enter the
customer number the pin number from this
get login method then based on that we
provide the customer the options to
choose the account type whether they can
choose the savings account or the
checking account and based on that
whatever account type they use we call
the get checking or get saving method
and inside this method we provide the
customer the other options to either
withdraw the money deposit the money or
view the balance that is what is
happening inside this option menu class
now let's go to the account class and
all the methods which we saw here will
be provided a definition in the account
class you also see this option menu is
extending the accounts class so an
inheritance concept is being used here
let's go to the account class now so
this is the account class where I have
defined some private member variables
like customer number so now you will be
familiar with the customer number pin
number which I just described and also
with the checking balance and the
savings balance you can also divide this
account class into two child classes
where you have a savings account class
and a checking account class but for
Simplicity I've kept it to one class I'm
initializing a scanner input which will
be used at multiple places and then I
have the Setters and Getters for these
four member variables so you see set
customer number get customer number if
you remember this set customer number
was called in the option menu class if I
go back to the get login once we ask the
customer to enter the customer number we
call the set customer number which gets
called here
here similarly we call the set PIN
number which gets called
here similarly once we have said that we
then we were fetching the values using
the get customer number and the get pin
number and that is that is also defined
here in terms of the Getters get pin
number and get customer
number similarly we also have the
Getters for the checking balance and the
saving balance member variables we do
not have the Setters for them because
they are not technically Setters but we
have to calculate the balance it's not a
simple Setter where you can just return
the
value so now let's look at some of the
business functions of the account class
how do you deposit how do you view the
balance how do you withdraw the balance
Etc so you see these two methods which
are specifically when the customer is
trying to withdraw the money from their
account and these methods are basically
called internally by other methods so we
will come to that let's just understand
that we have two methods for calculating
the withdrawable amount or executing the
withdraw transaction for the checking
account account and the savings account
similarly I have two more methods here
which are calculating the depositing for
the checking account and calculating the
depositing for the savings account and
then we get the the bigger methods which
are using these calculation methods so I
defined four calculation methods so far
calc checking withdraw calc saving
withdraw calc checking deposit and Cal
saving deposit basically withdrawing and
deposit for both of the classes and then
we have these business functions called
get checking withdraw input and get
saving withdraw input get checking
deposit input and get saving deposit
input so these getter methods are
something which were being called from
the option menu cloud class if you
remember if you go back to the option
menu class and if you chose the checking
account you get these options and let's
say you chose option two which was
withdraw funds or option three which was
deposit funds then the corresponding
methods which were being called were get
checking withdraw input and get checking
deposit
input and this is the exact same method
get checking withdraw input and get
checking deposit input so if you see
what is happening inside this particular
method is couple of sis outs then we
take the scanner input amount and we we
convert that amount to the double after
that we check if the amount which the
customer wants to withdraw is smaller
than the checking balance or not and I'm
running this condition to check that if
the amount is smaller than the checking
balance then we call the calc checking
withdraw method which was defined right
here remember I told you that these four
Cal methods will be used and this is how
they are used so here I'm actually
subtracting the value so whatever amount
the customer wants to withdraw subtract
that from the main balance and then
return the new main balance that's what
you do right if you have 1,000 rupees
and if you want to withdraw 500 you
subtract 500 from th000 and then you
send back the remaining balance so that
is what is happening when we call this
method and then we print the new
checking account balance that is what is
happening in the get checking withdraw
input method similarly if you chose
option three which was depositing funds
to the checking account then get
checking deposit input gets called and
it is defined right here get checking
deposit input and here instead of
subtraction we are doing the addition so
here I'm again doing a condition check
that the current balance plus the new
amount which has been supplied by the
customer from the command line the total
sum of it should be greater than zero
what if the customer entered an amount
minus 5,000 I should not allow that so
that's the reason I'm putting this
condition in place and if the current
balance plus the new amount which is
supposed to be deposited to the account
the sum of it is greater than zero then
call the cash C checking deposit
method and this is where the calc
checking deposit method is present and
where I'm just doing present balance
plus the new amount and returning the
New
Balance that's all which is being done
here and you will see exactly similar
logic running for the savings account as
well if you look at the get saving
withdraw input which is used to withdraw
money from the savings account so I take
the input from the command line and I
run a condition check that the amount
which the customer wants to withdraw
should be less than the current saving
accounts balance if yes then call Cal
saving withdraw method which is defined
here where I subtract the amount from
the current balance and I return the new
balance and similarly you will see the
exact same functionality in the get
saving deposit where we add the money
instead of subtracting the money and
this is all what is defined in the
account class so we talked about the
option menu class we talked about the
account class and now we have the ATM
class which is the entry point which
basically initializes the option menu
class and calls the get login method
remember get login was the first method
which asked you to provide the customer
number and then get login called the
method to choose the account type and
the account type methods then call the
method to choose the option to withdraw
deposit or exit
so now we have built a fair
understanding of what is happening in
this application so let's run this
application so I just ran this
application and let me bring the console
here it's first asking for a customer
number so I will go to the option menu
class and I will pick up one of the
customer number which I have hardcoded
here so I will provide that customer
number and hit
enter then it asks me for the PIN number
so remember you have to provide the
correct pin number corresp responding to
the customer number so I'm taking this
pin number just copying it and pasting
it
here then this whole code got
executed and then it called the get
account type and the get account type
method provided you with these options
which you see here on the screen so
based on what you select the case block
will get executed and let's say I want
to go for a checking account so I press
one and I hit enter
once you select the checking account the
case one gets selected and it calls the
get checking method and the get checking
method again provides you with another
menu view withdraw or deposit or exit so
let's say I want to deposit funds so I
press three and hit
enter it says the current balance is
zero and enter the amount you want to
deposit let's say I want to deposit 500
and I hit enter you get the message
saying the new checking account balance
is 500 and you have successfully
deposited the money and that is what I
did for the checking account now let's
try to withdraw something from the
checking account so you again get back
the same option because inside the get
checking
method we call the once we have
successfully done the business operation
we again call the account type uh method
to display the menu again to the user so
let's see again select the checking
account class and this time I want to
withdraw the funds remember I've added
500 there so let's say I want to
withdraw so I choose the option two as
the choice current balance is 500 and
it's asking me the amount you want to
withdraw from the checking account so I
enter let's say 100 and I hit enter when
I do that the new checking account
balance becomes 400 so the 100 got
subtracted from the 500 and the new
balance is shown to your screen you can
do exactly the same thing for for the
savings account as well and let's also
run a negative condition so I again
select the checking
account and I want to withdraw the funds
I choose the option two current balance
is 400 and I I would like to withdraw
th what
happens if you do that we get a message
saying balance cannot be negative and
this is coming from the calc checking
method which which is defined here so
what is happening that I wanted to
withdraw draw the funds from the
checking account and here get checking
withdraw input what called here this
condition was checked so the checking
balance was 400 and the amount I wanted
to withdraw was 1,000 so 400 minus th000
is not greater than equal to zero so it
jumped into the L's block and it said
balance cannot be negative so this is
how you can also build some error
conditions in your code which are
mandatory and which should be built
otherwise your application will have lot
of bugs we can also exit the application
so if you just type three and hit
enter you will exit from the application
and it will again call the login method
where it will again ask you to enter the
customer number so this is how you can
run this application and this is this
was a simple use case for you to show
how you can use the different object
oriented Concepts like classes objects
methods Setters Getters switch case Etc
to build the application with the
correct business logic and this is all I
want to cover in this particular
session and in the next session we are
going to have a look at another
interesting core Java project just to
build our understanding more better
about the core Java concept let's get
started with walking through a core Java
project using all the different oops
concept we have learned so far so in
this example we are going to have a look
at a calcul application and this
calculator application supports
primarily four different operations like
addition subtraction multiplication and
division so let's see how do we build
that app so in front of me right now is
open the main class so I have a main app
class here which has a public static
void main method and the first thing we
see is a read input class which is
calling a read method so if you go to
the read input class
it has a simple static method here which
is the read method and it is using the
scanner class if you remember I talked
about the scanner class which is used to
take inputs from the command line from
the user so we initialize the scanner
class and we start taking the inputs and
whatever the user inputs in terms of the
expression let's say the user entered 4
+ 5 or whatever that whole expression
gets sent back into this input line as a
Str Str and that comes back here in the
input expression once we have captured
the input expression the next thing we
do is divide the input expression in the
numbers and The Operators basically an
expression would be either something
like 4 + 5 into
3 / 2 let's say let's say the user
entered this expression so this has
either numbers or operators so so that's
what we are doing here we are using the
split method of the string API the
string class basically and this split
method is going to split the numbers and
operators into two different string
arrays and here I'm providing the split
expression that split at every time you
encounter one of these symbols so this
when you execute this particular
statement it is going to return a
numbers array which will be uh created
based on this expression so you will get
an array with 4 5 3 and 2 and similarly
in the operator array you are going to
split or pick out the elements every
time you receive a number so this
operator array is going to hold this
plus sign this multiply sign and this
divide sign hope you get the
understanding that we are just splitting
the whole expression into two different
arrays where first array is holding only
the numbers and no mathematical
expressions
and second array is just holding the
mathematical operators and no numbers
and we'll see why we need to do that in
the upcoming
lines once I've created the string array
I just want to store or convert these
string arrays into a q so I convert this
array into a list by calling the array
do as list so this expression is going
to return a list and then I'm going to
convert this normal list into a link
list and then going to store this link
list into the que of numbers and I'm
going to do exactly the same thing for
the operator array as well converting
this into a generic list converting that
generic list into a link list and then
storing this link list as a queue so I
have an operator's queue and I have a
numbers CU both of them have been stored
into a que now and then I'm using the
poll meth method if you remember the
poll method of the que is used when you
want to fetch the first front element
the head element of the Q so whichever
element is sitting at the head of the
que will be taken out the moment you
call the pole method so I fetch the
first number from the numbers Q so in
this case four will be fetched here in
this variable and after that I run a
loop on the numbers q and I'm going to
run this particular Loop till this
particular Q is not empty if you see
there's a negation here so I'm going to
pick up numbers one by one from this
numbers Q till the number Q becomes
empty and inside the loop I do the exact
same pole operation for the operations
que so this operations SK is holding all
these mathematical operations like plus
star and divide so I'm going to pick the
head of it so in this case plus will be
picked up and will be stored in this
variable called op and then I'm going to
run a switch case on this opr basically
as I told you in this particular
calculator application we are supporting
four operations which are addition
subtraction multiplication and division
so I Define a case for each of the
mathematical
expression so you see there are four
different cases here and for each case
I'm initializing a class if it's a plus
sign then I'm initializing the add class
if it's a minus sign then I'm
initializing the subtract class for
multiplication I have a class called
multiply and for division I have a class
called divide let's have a look at what
these classes are
containing so if I go to the add class
first of all it is implementing an
interface called
operate and and this operate interface
has just a single method called get
results which is accepting a variable
argument array if you remember I told
you that you can also use a v ARG array
this is called a v ARG expression this
means that this numbers will be an array
of arbitrary length it can be a one
element array it can be a two element
array it can be a Four Element array or
whatever you supply but it is still
going to be a fixed length array but the
length is going to be dependent upon how
much argument you supply to this
particular
method so that is what this interface
operate is doing it just has one method
declared which is called get result
which is accepting an array of numbers
so if the ad class is implementing the
operate interface then it has to
override the get result method and here
it is just doing a summation of all the
numbers which have been supplied so if
you supply four numbers it is just going
to add up those four numbers and return
the sum and the exact same kind of logic
or similar logic will be seen in other
operate classes so if I go to the
subtract class it runs the exact same
operation but it subtracts the values if
I go to the multiply class it is also
implementing the operate interface and
in the get result it is just multiplying
all the
values similarly in the Divide
class it is also implementing the
operator interface and it is dividing
all the numbers one by one so it's doing
pretty much the same thing in terms of
the expression and the logic the only
difference is whether you using an add
operation or a subtract or multiply or a
divide so we have checked all these
classes and the operator interface as
well and let's go back to the main app
now now you also see that I've defined a
reference of operate here and each of
the uh switch case block I'm assigning
the object type to this interface
reference so I'm using the concept of
dynamic binding which we talked about
when we talked about interfaces that we
can also do Dynamic binding where we can
assign an object to an interface type
and the object type will depend upon the
expression so once we have filled that
based on the case while filtering out
this expression and picking up plus star
and divide sequentially then we go to
the next line outside the switch case
block which is to pick the next number
from the que remember we already did one
poll here so as for this example four
was here in this rest and now when we do
this number do pole
again five will be picked up because
that will be the next head of the queue
so we pick up five here and then we call
operate do get result now this get
result will be called based on the
expression which was en counted first in
the Q again looking at the example the
first expression encountered will be
plus so the expression was plus so the
operate type object is of add type and
when you call operate. getet result the
get result method of add class is going
to get invoked and it is going to sum
four and five this rest is holding four
right now based on what I described here
numbers. pole and this num is holding
the the second upper hand basically
basically five here so 4 + 5 gets
evaluated here in this case and then it
again goes back here and it checks if
the number Q is now empty no it is still
not empty because we still have three
and two left there so again it does the
operations do pole and it picks up
multiply sign here then it again runs
the switch case since it's a multiply
sign it will go here
and it will initialize the operate
interface reference as the object of
multiply class then coming here it will
do a numbers. pole and this time the
numbers. pole is going to pick up three
so three will be picked up here and then
the current value of result which is
already 9 4 + 5 was 9 the current value
of result will be updated here so rest
will be nine here and num will be three
here and when you call operate. get
result the multiply classes get result
will get called and it will say 9 into 3
which will become
27 it will again go back here to this
particular line and it will check again
if the numb Q is now empty no it is
still not empty because we still have
one element
left then it pulls uh the Q of the
operations where the expression divide
is present there which is the only
element left in this particular
operations q and since we we have the
opr value as divide this case block gets
called and the New Divide class gets
initialized the Divide class basically
gets initialized and we come here and we
do numbers. po now the last number which
is available in this queue is two which
gets picked up here and then we again
call operate. getet result this time
since the operate object ref object uh
operate reference type was of divide
class type so when we call operate. get
result The Divide operation or the get
result method of the Divide class
basically this method will get invoked
and it will divide the current value of
result which was 4 + 5 9 into 3 which
was 27 so it is going to divide 27 by 2
which was the last value of the numbers.
pole it is going to execute 27 by2 and
whatever value it gets it is going to
store a value back into the rest
variable and then it is again going to
go back here and again going to check
the condition if the numbers Q is not
empty but now the numbers Q is empty
because two was the last element so it
is going to come out of the loop and it
is going to print the final result that
is how this whole program is working now
let's try to see this in action and
we'll try to execute the exact same
expression
so if I right click and go to run as and
run this as Java
application and I Supply an expression
saying 4 + 5 Star 3 IDE
2 and if I now hit enter I get the value
as 13.5 which is exactly what we ran
through because 4 + 5 will be evaluated
first which will result into 9 then 9
into 3 will be 27 and 27 / 2 will be
13.5 exactly so this is how this whole
program is running where we first take
the inputs and then we divide the input
into numbers and operation arrays or in
fact cues and once we have those cues
built up then we pick up the first
number and we keep running this Loop
till the numbers Q is not empty inside
the while loop at each step we pick up
the first expression or the operator we
check what is the operator whether it is
an addition subtraction multiplication
or division operator and whatever kind
of operator we have we initialize the
corresponding class of it and then we
fetch the next value in the numbers q
and then we call the get result based on
the expression and whatever result we
get from the get result we store it back
into the rest variable so we keep
updating the rest variable at every step
that's the reason the result of 4 + 5
gets stored in the rest and next time
you are calling the get result for a
multiply operation here the rest value
is 9 now and it says 9 into three again
in the next time the rest value will be
updated to 27 because we are storing the
result back into the result
variable so this is all I want to cover
in this particular session where we
looked at an example of a calculator
application purely from the console
standpoint obviously there can be lot
more stuff which we can do into this
particular application make it more
error free and cover a lot of corner
cases like validating the inputs Etc
also looking at or putting some
conditions around the exception handling
handling the divide by zero scenario Etc
which is not here but this is just to
show you the basic idea of how you can
build simple to complex CLI applications
using the core Java Concepts so in this
example we are going going to have a
look at a calculator
application and this calculator
application supports primarily four
different operations like addition
subtraction multiplication and division
so let's see how do we build that app so
in front of me right now is open the
main class so I have a main app class
here which has a public static void main
method and the first thing we see is a
read input class which is calling a read
method so if you go to the read input
class it has a simple static method here
which is the read method and it is using
the scanner class if you remember I
talked about the scanner class which is
used to take inputs from the command
line from the user so we initialize the
scanner class and we start taking the
inputs and whatever the user inputs in
terms of the expression let's say the
user entered 4 + 5 or whatever that
whole expression gets sent back into
this input line as a string and that
comes back here in that input expression
once we have captured the input
expression the next thing we do is
divide the input expression in the
numbers and The Operators basically an
expression would be either something
like 4 + 5 into 3 / 2 let's say let's
say the user entered this expression so
this has either numbers or operators so
that's what we are doing here we are
using the split method of the string API
the string class basically and this
split method is going to split split the
numbers and operators into two different
string arrays and here I'm providing the
split expression that split at every
time you encounter one of these symbols
so this when you execute this particular
statement it is going to return a
numbers array which will be uh created
based on this expression so you will get
an array with 4 5 3 and 2 and similarly
in the operator array you are going to
split or pick out the elements every
time you receive a number so this this
operator array is going to hold this
plus sign this multiply sign and this
divide sign hope you get the
understanding that we are just splitting
the whole expression into two different
arrays where first array is holding only
the numbers and no mathematical
expressions and second array is just
holding the mathematical operators and
no numbers and we'll see why we need to
do that in the upcoming lines once I've
created the string array I just want to
store convert these string arrays into a
q so I convert this array into a list by
calling the array do as list so this
expression is going to return a list and
then I'm going to convert this normal
list into a link list and then going to
store this link list into the que of
numbers and I'm going to do exactly the
same thing for the operator array as
well converting this into a generic list
converting that generic list into a link
list list and then storing this link
list as a queue so I have an operator
queue and I have a number queue both of
them have been stored into a queue now
and then I'm using the poll method if
you remember the poll method of the
queue is used when you want to fetch the
first front element the head element of
the queue so whichever element is
sitting at the head of the queue will be
taken out the moment you call call the
whole method so I fetch the first number
from the numbers Q so in this case four
will be fetched here in this variable
and after that I run a loop on the
numbers q and I'm going to run this uh
particular Loop till this particular Q
is not empty if you see there's a
negation here so I'm going to pick up
numbers one by one from this numbers Q
till the number Q becomes empty and
inside the loop I do this exact same
pole operation for the operations SK so
this operations SK is holding all these
mathematical operations like plus star
and divide so I'm going to pick the head
of it so in this case plus will be
picked up and will be stored in this
variable called opr and then I'm going
to run a switch case on this opr
basically as I told you in this
particular calculator application we are
supporting four operations which are
addition subtraction multiplication and
division so I Define a case for each of
the mathematical expression so you see
there are four different cases here and
for each case I'm initializing a class
if it's a plus sign then I'm
initializing the add class if it's a
minus sign then I'm initializing the
subtract class for multiplication I have
a class called multiply and for division
I have a class called divide let's have
a look at what these classes are
containing so if I go to the add class
first of all it is implementing an
interface called operate and this
operate interface has just a single
method called get results which is
accepting a variable argument array if
you remember I told you that you can
also use a v AR array this is called a v
AR expression this means that this
numbers will be an array of arbitrary
length it can be a one element array it
can be a two element array it can be a
Four Element array or whatever you
supply but it is still going to be a
fixed length array but the length is
going to be dependent upon how much
argument you supply to this particular
method so that is what this interface
operate is doing it's it's just has one
method declared which is called get
result which is accepting an array of
numbers so if the add class is
implementing the operate interface then
it has to override the get result method
and here it is just doing a summation of
all the numbers which have been supplied
so if you supply four numbers it is just
going to add up those four numbers and
return the sum and the exact same kind
of logic or similar logic will be seen
in other operate classes so if I go to
the subtract class it runs the exact
same operation but it subtracts the
values if I go to the multiply class it
is also implementing the operate
interface and in the get result it is
just multiplying all the values
similarly in the Divide class it is also
implementing the operator interface and
it is dividing all the numbers one by
one so it's doing pretty much the same
thing in terms of the expression and the
logic the only difference is whether
you're using an add operation or a
subtract or a multiply or a divide so we
have checked all these classes and the
operator interfaces as well and let's go
back to the main app now now you also
see that I've defined a reference of
operate here and each of the uh switch
case block I'm assigning the object type
to this interface reference so I'm using
the concept of dynamic binding which we
talked about when we talked about
interfaces that we can also do Dynamic
binding where we can assign an object to
an interface type and the object type
will depend upon the expression so once
we have filled that based on the cas
case while filtering out this expression
and picking up plus star and divide
sequentially then we go to the next line
after outside the switch case block
which is to pick the next number from
the que remember we already did one poll
here so as per this example four was
here in this rest and now when we do
this number dot pole again five will be
picked up because that will be the next
head of the queue so we pick up five
here and then we call operate do get
result now this get result will be
called based on the expression which was
encountered first in the que again
looking at the example the first
expression encountered will be plus so
the expression was plus so the operate
type object is of add type and when you
call operate. get result the get result
method of add class is going to get
invoked and it is going to sum four and
five this rest is holding four right now
based on what I described here numbers.
pole and this num is holding the the
second upper hand basically basically
five here so 4 + 5 gets evaluated here
in this case and then it again goes back
here and it checks if the number Q is
now empty no it is still not empty
because we still have three and two left
there so again it does the operations do
pole and it picks up multiply sign here
then it again runs the switch case since
it's a multiply sign it will go here and
it will initial the operate interface
reference as the object of multiply
class then coming here it will do a
numbers do pole and this time the
numbers. pole is going to pick up three
so three will be picked up here and then
the current value of result which is
already 9 4 + 5 was n the current value
of result will be updated here so rest
will be nine here and num will be three
here and when you call operate. get
result the multiply classes get result
will get called and it will say 9 into 3
which will be become 27 it will again go
back here to this particular line and it
will check again if the numb Q is now
empty no it is still not empty because
we still have one element left then it
pulls uh the Q of the operations where
the expression divide is present there
which is the only element left in this
particular operations q and since we
have the opr value as divide this case
block gets called and the New Divide
class gets initialized the Divide class
basically gets initialized and we come
here and we do numbers. Pole now the
last number which is available in this
queue is two which gets picked up here
and then we again call operate. getet
result this time since the operate
object ref object uh operate reference
type was of divide class type so when we
call operate. get result The Divide
operation or the get result method of
the Divide class basically this method
will get invoked and it will divide the
current value of of result which was 4 +
5 9 into 3 which was 27 so it is going
to divide 27 by 2 which was the last
value of the numbers. pole so it is it
is going to execute 27 by2 and whatever
value it gets it is going to store the
result value back into the rest variable
and then it is again going to go back
here and again going to check the
condition if the numbers Q is not empty
but now the numbers Q is empty because
two was the last element so it is going
to come out of the loop and it is going
to print the final result that is how
this whole program is working now let's
try to see this in action and we'll try
to execute the exact same expression so
if I right click and go to run as and
run this as Java application and I
Supply an expression saying 4 + 5 Star 3
IDE 2 and if I now hit enter I get the
value as 13.5 which is exactly what we
ran through because 4 + 5 will be
evaluated first which will result into 9
then 9 into 3 will be 27 and 27 / 2 will
be 13.5 exactly so this is how this
whole program is running where we first
take the inputs and then we divide the
input into numbers and operation arrays
or in fact cues and once we have those
cues built up then we pick up the first
number and we keep running this Loop
till the numbers Q is not empty inside
the while loop at each step we pick up
the first expression or the operator we
check what is the operator whether it is
an addition subtraction multiplication
or division operator and whatever kind
of operator we have we initialize the
corresponding class of it and then we
fetch the next value in the numbers q
and then we call the get result based on
the expression and whatever result we
get from the get result we store it back
into to the rest variable so we keep
updating the rest variable at every step
that's the reason the result of 4 + 5
gets stored in the rest and next time
you are calling the get result for a
multiply operation here the rest value
is 9 now and it says 9 into three again
in the next time the rest value will be
updated to 27 because we are storing the
result back into the result variable so
this is all I want to cover in this
particular session where we looked at an
example of a calculator application
purely from the console standpoint
obviously there can be lot more stuff
which we can do into this particular
application make it more error free and
cover a lot of corner cases like
validating the inputs Etc also looking
at or putting some conditions around the
exception handling handling the divide
by zero scenario Etc which is not here
but this is just to show you the basic
idea of how you can build simple to
complex CLI applications using the core
Java Concepts let's get started with
spring Boot and how we can build a
simple applic application using spring
boot before we go further let's
understand why we need spring Boot and
the basic idea of spring boot is to
build restful web services if you want
to know more about what are restful
services please you can read about the
restful concept as a concept what does
rest stand for but the basic idea is
that if you are accessing anything over
HTTP then that particular component can
be built as a restful component and
spring boot is the most popular choice
for building restful web services today
and even in fact micr Services which you
might have heard about so you can build
microservices which also run on https
using spring boot so what I'm showing
you right now is the official guide of
spring which you can use to build an
application with spring boot it will
list down all the requisites which you
need in terms of the uh jdk
installations Maven on and how to
complete this guide etc etc you can
again use use the same spring
initializer which I talked about in the
previous session you can use this to
generate a spring boot project for you
specifically so all those options are
available here so I've already done that
and I'm not going to repeat what I just
did in the previous session and we'll
directly jump to an IDE where I have
created a sample spring boot application
and the structure here you can see the
structure would look very similar with
one change that in the previous example
when we were dealing with MVC we had an
SRC Main resour sources folder and that
SRC main resources folder was having all
the web components or all the htmls but
since in restful web services you do not
render the HTML but you just send back
the response the response can be the
response body can be pure XML or it can
be pure Json but you do not send back an
View and that's the main difference
between spring MVC and spring boot that
in Spring MVC it will you are required
to return a view technology like in the
in the previous session we sent a d my
LIF template which is basically an HTML
you can also return a GSP but with
spring boot you do not deal with the
view technology and that's the world we
are living in today when you write
spring boot you do not have to worry
about how this is going to be rendered
on the web page whether it is going to
be rendered using HTML or what not what
you need to take care of using spring
boot is to return the right response
body the exact text of the response and
that's it so with that in mind the
spring boot was Bor and the structure
apart from that the structure would look
very similar there's a pom.xml here
which will provide all the list of jars
and dependencies which are required for
this particular project so you can see
all the dependencies here pretty much
the similar ones we have a starter web
we have a starter test and we have a
spring boot Maven plugin and we have an
application file which is the entry
point again having a public static void
main method me so you need to put the at
theate Spring boot application at the
top of the class to make it an entry
point if you don't do this spring boot
will not run this class and spring boot
will even not run your application so
what we are doing as part of this
example that we are just printing all
the beans which are provided by Spring
that's all we are doing like I said it's
a very lightweight and a introductory
session so we will keep the Logics to
minimum and I'm just getting all the
bean definitions sorting the bean
definitions and just printing them one
by one how do you get the bean
definition you get that with this
application context class which is
returned when you run the application
and how you run the application is
basically using this line where you say
Spring application. Run and you supply
application. class with any command line
arguments which you might want to use
once you do this it is going to return
an application context object to you and
the application context object can be
used to get all the the bean definitions
by calling this method which says get
bean definition names so that's the
basic logic which is being run in the
main class now we also have a controller
but this time it's not a web controller
but it's a rest controller so you see in
the previous example we just had written
something like this it was just a pure
controller but here we have become more
specific we are saying that hey this is
not a simple MVC controller but this is
a spring boot controller or technically
a rest controller so spring provides a
separate annotation for that which is at
theate rest controller so you write that
particular annotation on the on the top
of the controller class which you're
creating and then you provide a request
mapping similar to what we did in Spring
MVC but while you return it you do not
return a view technology you just return
the raw response here I'm just returning
a string but you can return a Json
object you can return an XML object or
whatever you want to but not a view
technology that's what I'm doing like
like you can see there's literally
nothing I'm doing in this it's just a
simple uh string return statement which
I have printed here and that's all the
code I have right now here I just have
these two classes okay so that was all
about what I have written in the project
and now it's time to run the project so
I have just reached to the location on
inside my terminal where the project
pom.xml was present and if I just do an
LS you will see that there is a pom.xml
available here and all the code
directories are also available here so
now I will just run this application and
to run this application I'm just going
to type mvn spring hyphen boot colon run
and hit enter once I do that the spring
application is going to Spring boot
application is going to get started and
let's go back to uh the controller and
actually the main main end point and see
what we were doing there I did a sis out
here which said let's inspect the beans
provided by Spring Boot and then I was
printing all the bean names and if I go
back to the output I will see the same
line being written here which was around
let's inspect the beans so you can see
that message which says let's inspect
the beans provided by Spring Boot and
then all the beans which are available
in the application context are printed
here so that's that's the basic idea
which I want to give you that you can
actually build a spring boot application
and you can write your rest controllers
return a string body from it and once
this is run then you can also run your
application
for from the web browser as well so
let's try to hit that particular URL
which I wrote here so the URL of hello
country so for that let me just open a
new Cognito window and our application
is already running so if I just say HTTP
Local Host 880 SL I get this message
here which says greetings from Spring
Boot and this is the message which we
were sending from the rest controller so
this validates our understanding that we
can invoke a rest controller which is a
spring boot rest controller via the same
method but this time we are not getting
an HTML but we are just returning this
particular string now you can use the
string in any ways you want so it
depends upon the consumer so that's all
I want to cover uh as part of the spring
boot now spring boot is a huge huge
topic and we can spend hours and hours
talking about spring boot but since this
is more of an introductory session so I
just wanted the concept to get
introduced and remember the value
proposition of why you would need spring
boot the basic idea is to build restful
web services or build restful
microservices that's the basic idea
behind using spring boot in your
applications and also remember the
difference between web MVC spring MVC
application and spring boot application
spring MVC is for building web
application spring boot is for building
restful applications which might not
have a web interface integrated with
them at that moment let's get started
with a demo of of a project which is
using spring boot to build a restful web
service so a restful web service is
nothing but any endpoint which you can
access or you can consume the data from
via an HTTP layer or via a simply a web
layer because most of the web traffic
which we deal with is built on HTTP so
to take an example if you go to any
website where you sometimes see on the
top right corner you see today's weather
so how is that today's weather coming in
it's coming in via AR rest web service
the website which you are accessing is
basically hitting an HTTP endpoint uh
which is uh where the where the weather
application is sitting and it asks for
the weather data and the rest web
application just Returns the data and
that's how the website is able to show
you the current weather so restful web
services are everywhere and they are the
most popular way to build applications
today where you just build your restful
web service and you expose an HTTP URL
and then the consumers need to just
access that HTTP URL to consume the data
from your application and you see this
makes it very easy because there is no
data type restrictions there is no tight
coupling here it's just an HTTP endpoint
so that's the basic idea and we will
look at a project where we will be using
spring boot to build a restful web
service and then we will try to run that
web service to save some data and also
to return some data so here on the on
the package Explorer you see I have
created a project called rest service
and let's just walk through the
structure of it and then we'll go into
the details of it so we have an SRC main
Java where I have a package and I have
bunch of classes here and before we go
to the classes let's first also access
the dependency file because every
project needs some dependencies some
jars to execute it for example spring
itself is basically a jar so you need to
include the spring jar in your project
so that your project can become a spring
project and there are generally two
dependency tools one is maven and one is
Gradle in this particular project I am
using Maven uh dependency tool for
downloading and managing the
dependencies which are needed to run
this project successfully and the way
you will find if it's a maven project or
if it's a grel project for a maven
project you will see a file called
pom.xml pom.xml and if it's a gridle
project you will see a gridle file
that's how you can spot whether the
project is using Maven for dependency
management or it is using gridle for
dependency management so let's open open
the pom.xml since it's an XML file it
will be a bit verbose but uh if you just
read it piece by piece it will become
easier to understand first of all since
this is a spring project I need to
include the parent dependency which
brings lot of good defaults sensible
defaults from Spring boot automatically
and this is the jar name this is the
artifact ID which is spring boot starter
parent so any spring boot project you
are starting do include this parent this
parent is basically bringing all the
dependencies from some mother jar and
you can make your project as a as a
child of this particular parent so all
the spring boot projects have this as a
parent as a standard practice after that
you provide your own details in terms of
what is the package name how do you want
to see the jar name and what is the jar
actual name what is the jar version etc
etc you also set the minimum required
Java version to run this application and
then you in the dependency sections you
provide all the jars which you need to
run your project successfully both
compile and run your project
successfully so we added the spring boot
starter web dependency which basically
brings all the dependencies around
making a controller or making a
repository context component scan all
the interesting features which spring
provides get wrapped up inside the
spring boot starter jar and you can
actually go to the mvn repository and
and have a look at what all classes it
provides it's a lot of classes so I'm
just telling you in a brief that it
provides all the restful functionality
then you have the next dependency as
spring boot starter data jpa which is
going to enable this project to also
have a database and if it has a database
then you need Java to talk to the
database and the Way Spring suggests to
talk to the database is via using the
spring boot data jpa Library we will see
this how this Library can be used but
basically this provides ways to
represent your Java object in the
database and then you need to also add
the actual dependent of the database and
in this case we are using an inmemory H2
database so I'm not using an external
database like MySQL or Oracle or post
SQL because that will just make more
configurations more complicated I just
wanted to keep it simple and generally
you in this H2 database you can easily
access by adding this dependency and it
will be an in-memory database created
for you then I've also added uh string
boot starter test here uh which will be
used whenever you writing unit tests and
you must write unit test for your
project and then we need to add the
plugin so that spring boot can run this
project that's all I have in the pom.xml
now let's move to the interesting part
the Java section part let's start from
the main class so this is how the main
class looks like where you have you just
create uh any any name with the class
and then you add a public static void
main method inside the public static
void main method you call Spring
application do run and this run method
is basically going to run your
application and you just provide the
same class name which you just wrote
here so you just say Do class and if
you're supplying any command line
arguments it can interpret that command
line arguments as well if you want so
you always need an entry point in an
application and this is the entry point
which spring boot supports and this is
if you see this code this is just normal
code to make spring be aware about this
class being treated as an entry point
you need to add at theate Spring boot
application annotation on top of the
class this is one of The annotation
which is coming directly from the spring
boot Library you can see this import so
once you add this then only spring will
be able to treat this class as an entry
point otherwise spring doesn't know
where to start from so when you run
spring it will it will try to find a
class with an annotation spring boot
application and then inside the class it
will try to find a public static void
main method and once it has found both
of them then it'll just run the
application so very simple nothing fancy
here and what we are dealing with here
is a student object so we will try to
insert a student object and we will try
to retrieve the student object so if you
ignore these annotations which I've
added it's just a pure pojo it's just a
plain old Java object you create a
student class Let's ignore this field as
well for now I'll just come back to this
annotation in this field but this is
just a student class it has three Fields
as name age and address an empty
Constructor and a parameterized
Constructor and some Getters
intentionally I have removed the Setters
because generally whenever you are
building any Enterprise grid application
you would like to keep your objects
immutable means once they have been
created you would not like somebody to
allow to change the values of the object
this just makes programming much more
easy if you treat all the objects in
your application as immutable that's why
I have not added Setters here it's just
considered a good practice so apart from
the standard things which we have
already seen there are two things here
which I want to talk about let's first
talk about this one so ad theate entity
is The annotation which is coming from
java X persistent entity persistence
entity and this makes spring boot save
this particular object into the database
this is The annotation which you need to
put on your class so that spring boot
knows that this class represents a table
in the database so you need to add this
to make sure that this represents a
table second thing a table will have a
ID it will have sort of a primary key so
I've created a new column called ID
which is basically representing the
students row number or something or
maybe a registration number and here I'm
using couple of more annotations if you
see these annotations are also coming
from java X persistence library and
these annotations will basically allow
the a new ID to be created every time
you create a student object so you don't
have to specify the value of this ID
variable spring boot will automatically
generate a new ID value every time you
create a new student object and how does
it generate you you can provide the
generation typee as well so currently
I've just set that set it as automatic
but you can set it as identity sequence
or or controlled by table you can also
see the explanation of each of these
here but I've just kept it as Auto which
basically uh let the uh persistence
provider pick any appropriate strategy
for the particular database in our case
the database is H2 so that's about the
entity class let's call this as entity
class now let's move to the repository
so you need a repository class class
like I explained in those in that three
tier architecture you always need a dow
layer or a repository layer to store
your student object into the database so
we have enabled the student object to be
saved but we need a Handler which can
save this particular file this
particular object into the data base and
the repository classes are the classes
which will allow you to do that so you
create a very simple interface you you
name whatever you want to name your
interface as and then you say extends
jpa repository the type of the object
and the unique identifier of the object
so the type of the object is student
here and the unique identifier of the
student object is the ID which is of
type long so you need to just Supply the
types type of the object type of the
primary key or the type of the unique
identifier and this annotation is coming
from Spring boot you can see
specifically spring boot data Li Library
which we added so you just need to
create an interface extend it from JP
repository and make sure that you add
this an anotation as well springing
heavily uses the concept of annotations
and this will help spring understand
that this is a repository layer class
and it will apply some more metadata to
this class while this class is running
in the jvm so what happens here you just
created an interface you did not provide
any method to create or any method to
delete or any method to get a student
object because all of that is
automatically provided by Spring boot
via the jpa repository class if you go
inside this class and if you scroll down
you'll see the find all method find all
find all by ID save all flush save and
flush delete Etc and if you go further
up this also extends the paging and
sorting repository which provides
pagination and sorting facilities but
the interesting one is that paging and
sorting repository again extends a crud
repository and if you go to the crud
repository you will find all the basic
methods to save an entity save multiple
entities find an entity by the ID that's
why it needed that long type to make
sure this that it can execute this
method you can check the existence of an
object find all the entries find all by
ID count them delete them so all the
basic crud functionality so we call them
as crud because the reason it is called
crud because create read update delete
that's the basically the uh generic
acronym so because uh this cred
repository provides all the methods and
their implementations automatically we
do not need to write any code at all so
that's why spring boot is so awesome and
that's why spring board is very popular
because it's zero code in the repository
and you still get all the crud
functionality so that's about repository
now we have covered the entity class we
have covered the repository class we
have covered the entry point class now
the only thing which is remaining is the
is the uh endpoint the HTTP endpoint
which I talked about and that you can
create by creating any class generally
try to suffix it with the controller so
that your code developers can easily
find this class and make sure that you
put at theate rest controller annotation
on top of it this annotation will allow
spring to treat this particular class as
an endpoint class then you can Auto the
student repository so if you remember I
talked about the whole dependency
injection and inversion of control so
here dependency injection is in action
so here you're just telling student
controller to Auto wire the student
repository and now what will happen that
at run time student controller or
actually spring will automatically
create an object of the student
repository and Supply that object of
student repository to student controller
so you as developer do not have to
create an object of student repository
explicitly that's the benefit and that's
how the dependency injection is working
because you inverted the dependencies
now the dependencies is just injected
into the class and as a developer you
don't have to uh take control of
creating the objects it's the spring
which will automatically read the auto
word annotation and will automatically
Supply an object whenever ever it is
required then I have two methods here
since we are talking about HTTP
endpoints so I have represented a post
method here and a get method here the
way you will write a post method is via
adate post mapping annotation and then
you can provide the URL path on which
somebody should call your endpoint to
save something so for example somebody
can call it HTTP Local Host 8/ student
SLC create whenever they hit that URL
the control or that request will
directly hit this particular method
method why because you have provided the
URL mapping here in the post mapping
annotation so since it's a post method
they would be request body what is the
actual request body which the client is
sending and you can represent that
request body with the at theate request
body annotation and you can provide the
type of the request body and here I'm
saying that hey if you want to access
this particular URL yes all good but you
need to supply me with a a text
representation of the student object or
a Json representation of the student
object and then I inside the method I'm
calling student repository Dove which is
going to save the student object which
is coming in so you see there's lot
going on here I will I will show you how
the student is represented in the
request body as well and then I will
come back to how it got converted from
Json to to Java but this is how you can
store this particular student object you
can hit this API as many times as you
want and keep inserting a new student
object every time then if you want to
fetch a particular student then you can
do that by supplying the/ student and
then in the curly braces there's an ID
written here so basically you can supply
the value of the ID of the student so
generally there would be another method
here which would be find all to see all
the students uh uh and with their ID and
then you can pick a particular student's
ID Supply that student ID value here
dynamically that's why the curly braces
curly braces supports Dynamic value so
here it can insert 1 2 3 or whatever the
student ID you want to fetch the value
for for you provide that value in the
student SL ID and all good then some if
somebody is hitting the URL with saying
Local Host 8/ student SL1 then student
with the ID 1 will be returned from the
request and you need to put adate get
mapping to make sure that this method is
treated as an HTTP get method and you
can provide the type you can set say get
student and here this Dynamic value is
captured with the at theate path
variable because you need to know the ID
right whatever ID somebody has supplied
it in the URL you need to capture that
IDE and then use that IDE for calling
the repository so that's you can do that
by using the ad theate path variable so
here I'm just saying whatever ID is
coming in I will store that value inside
this IDE once I've done that then I can
again call student repository. findind
by ID which is again a built-in method
provided to me by the crud repository I
can supply the ID and this actually is
going to return an optional object which
is uh which which is an object which may
or may not contain a value so it's a
just a types a defensive programming
style so this will return an optional
and you can call a get method to return
the actual student object this will
return an optional of student so
optional of student means that this
optional object may have a student or
may not have a student why did spring do
that because the ID somebody's supplying
that ID can be invalid also right so
optional object takes care of that that
if there is no student found then you
will not get a null pointer exception
and if there's a student found you can
return that so it's just a defensive
programming style which spring has
adopted by returning an optional of the
student object rather than directly the
student object but if you're confident
that this particular optional of student
object does contain a student object
then just call optional. getet which
I've called here which will return the
actual student object sitting inside the
optional object you can read more about
the optional object and its usage uh
from the official Java do and there are
tons of examples available on it on
internet so this is about the controller
we have covered all the classes now it's
time to run the application so you go to
the command prompt you go to the
particular uh file folder location and
there you just say mvn spring hyphen
boot colon run so I just hit enter and
this is going to run the application
it's going to spit some logs here and if
everything is fine you will not get an
error and you will just be getting a
message saying that application got
started and it's running on Tomcat Local
Host 8080 with no context URL so this is
not a web application this is a restful
web service right this is a restful
service this is not a web application so
there is no web interface so how do you
access this you just have an HTTP URL so
you can use any of the rest client
available on the internet there are
probably hundreds of different rest
clients available on the internet you
can choose any one of them I am using
Advanced rest client which you can also
install as an extension from the Chrome
Chrome browser itself so if you just if
I just open the Chrome browser and I
just say rest client if you just write
this and hit enter you will get many
different options and the first option
you get is from uh Google Play storees
App Store so you can go to the App Store
basically the Chrome web store not the
play store but the Chrome web store and
you can just install this since this is
already installed you can click on
launch app and it will open this
interface for you so this is pretty uh
this is not a tutorial for advanced rest
client so I'll just be quick here you
can choose the method type which you
want to hit so let's say I want to do a
post and then you can provide the URL
here so remember the URL which we put
here in the controller method this has
to exactly match so HTTP Local Host /
student SLC create should be the URL so
let me just copy paste this one here
okay so the URL is good here it's a post
type of method which I want to do and I
want to hit this particular URL now I
need to supply the content type and the
body so in the content type you can
choose application Json because I'm
going to supply a Json object and in the
body this is how the Json object looks
like Advanced risk client also provides
a nice visual interface to basically uh
create this Json if you are thinking
that Json creation is very tough it's
not actually tough It's just curly
braces and then you put key and value
key value comma let me just put an enter
here so that it's more readable so you
just put curly braces starting and end
and then you just put key value you put
a key which is the variable name and the
variables value variable name variable
value and these Keys have to exactly
match the students properties so the
student. Java had this name age and
address right so it has to exactly match
otherwise this will request will fail so
this is all good now I can send this
particular request when you click Send
it is going to hit my uh spring boot
application which is running on Local
Host at80 it is going to call the
student SLC create method it is also
going to convert this Json into into a
Java object because here I'm supplying a
Java object so it will convert the Json
which I'm sending from here to Java
object automatically and it is going to
automatically save it here because I've
called the repository. save method so
let's hit send here once I hit send I
get a 20000 okay it means everything
went fine and in the response header I
get the object back because I have
returned the object here you see this
save method is going to return the same
student object which you created uh so
everything is good here my object has
been stored here and now it's time to
fetch the object so it has already been
saved in into the H2 in memory database
and you can obviously go and connect to
the inmemory H2 database and have a look
at it but for Simplicity I'm just going
to do this here and let's say the first
object is generally return uh added as
the id1 by default by the H2 database so
let's hit this particular URL when I hit
this URL it is going to hit the student
controller here and in the student
controll controller it is going to hit
the get student method which is having a
student slid URL and it is going to find
the database with that ID and if it
finds an student object with that ID it
is going to return that so let's confirm
that now let's hit this particular send
button and it is going to hit a get
request with this particular URL
springbot is going to find if a student
with the id1 exists in its database so
once I hit send I get a 200 okay and you
see in the response header I get the
same student object back which I added
let's try with two now let's see what
happens I see two and I get 500 internal
server error because there is no object
stored in the H2 database of the spring
application with the id2 yet because we
only inserted one object that's why only
one student object is there and the
first ID which H2 database created for
it automatically was one so when you hit
for get request with a student ID one
you get the object when you put any
invalid value and you hit this you get a
500 internal server error you can also
make it look nice by not sending the 500
internal server error and sending a nice
exception from the back end so from here
you can also send a nice exception that
if this object is not found you can say
something like that or else throw which
is again an optional object and here you
can supply a particular type of
exception which you want to supply
instead of just throwing 500 internal
server error but that's just additional
thing additional defensive programming
you can do you can add more and more
validations and constraints into this
project as you build this project in a
more complex uh Paradigm so this is
basically what I wanted to show you that
uh and that we have created a spring up
boot application we have connected it to
a database we haven't created also an
HTTP endpoint with student controller we
ran that application we used any random
rest client in my case I used Advanced
rest client and we first did a post
request we provided the exact URL the
URL has to exactly match with the
controller URL and then the body the
request body also has to exactly match
with the student objects property
especially the case of the names have to
exactly match so if this all this
matches then you will get a response
back that the object has been created if
you want to fetch the value of the
object you're going to use the HTTP get
method and you again provide a URL which
has to exactly match to some method in
some controller in the spring boot
application which is running on Local
Host and if you provide the right ID you
going to return get a valid result if
you provide an invalid ID you're going
to get a 500 internal server error and
from here on you can make this
controller as robust and as mature as
you want you can add find all method you
can add a update student method you can
add a delete student method you can have
all different kinds of filters like for
example return to me all the students
starting with the name a or return all
the first students with the rule number
one and 100 or between one and 100 so
you can write as many end points as as
you want and build this application in
as with as much maturity and as much
complexity as you
want we all know that Java is one of the
most sof programming languages in the
current IT industry there are multiple
multi-million dollar companies which are
using Java till today so this video is
completely dedicated to help out the
Java developers and the beginners in
Java programming language to crack the
most frequently Asked Java interview
questions so without further Ado let's
begin with our interview
questions at first we will start with
the beginner level interview questions
so in the beginner level interview
questions the first question we have is
what is
jit so the answer for this question
is jit is an abbrevation for Java in
time compiler it increases efficiency of
The Interpreter by compiling the bite
code in the
runtime jit or Justin Time compiler
compiles code to Machine level directly
for higher speed of code
execution so basically just in time
compilation is a feature added to The
Interpreter of java so this involves
conversion of the code directly to
Machine level during the compilation
stage this improvises the speed of
execution of a Java program now after
the first question the second question
in the docket is
what is a class loader now let's discuss
the answer for this particular question
so basically class loader is the first
file to load when you execute any Java
program so the Java class loader is the
integrated part of java virtual machine
so the functionality of class loader is
to load the class to the Java virtual
machine while it is demanded to execute
a
class Java has both strap extension and
application type of class loaders so the
third question in the docket is what are
the memory allocations available in Java
so the answer for this particular
question is Java provides multiple types
of memory allocations but the five major
types of memory allocations which are
most frequently used are class memory
Heap memory stack memory program counter
memory native method stack memory so the
next question in the list
is will the program run if I write
static public void main so basically we
write public static void main but in
case imagine if I write the program as
static public void main will the program
execute properly so the answer for this
question is yes because Java does not
follow any specific rule for the order
of specifiers you place in your program
so when you execute the program with
such pattern in your specifiers then the
program will compile successfully also
it will run successfully so the next
question we have
is what is the default value stored in
local
variables so in C programming language
when you declare a local variable or a
global variable or any type of variable
then the first value which is stored
inside that variable will be a garbage
value unless you initialize the variable
with a personalized value for example if
you declare a variable I equal to Z then
you storing a value in that variable I
that is zero if you just declare it as
in I then the value stored inside that I
variable will be a garbage value so
similarly when you declare some kind of
local variable in Java then what will be
the default value stored inside it so
the answer for this question is neither
the local variables or the global
variables or any Primitives or any
object references do not have any kind
of default value stored in them so
followed by the fifth question we have
the sixth question so what would be the
output of the following code segment is
the sixth question so this might happen
sometimes so basically what happens is
your interviewer will throw a question
at you which has a code segment so all
you need to do is decode that code in
your mind and provide the output so this
would be the code that we will be
dealing
with so you can see our question has two
prin of statements the first one has 100
+ 100 plus a string which is simply
learn and in the second printer
statement we have a string that is
e-learning company plus 100 + 100 so
what will be the output of these two
print of
statements so the answer for this
question is really
simple so we'll be having 200 simply
learn as the first output and e-learning
Company w 0 0 1 0 0 as the second output
why let's check out the code segment
once again so when you see the code
segment once again so the first prin of
statement has 100 + 100 plus simply
learn so jvm here understands 100 as an
integer value and the plus symbol as an
addition operator here so followed by
the addition operator we have another
integer value so what jvm does is it
adds the two numbers 100 + 100 so
followed by that we have another plus
symbol here so followed by the plus
symbol we have a string value so here
the jvm considers the plus symbol as a
concatenating operator but not as an
addition operator so that's why the
first two numbers got added and the
result was 200 and the next two values
were concatenated so it became as 200
simply learn similarly in the second PR
statement the jvm encountered with a
string value so it considered the plus
symbol as a concatenating operator
similarly it happened with the second
plus symbol as well so that's the reason
we had e learning 1 1 0 as the second
output now followed by the sixth
question we have the seventh
question what is an
association so the answer for this
question is an association can be
defined as a relationship that has no
ownership over the other so to
understand this definition we can
consider a simple
example consider a person associated
with multiple Banks so consider person X
who has got accounts in Bank a bank B
and Bank C and similarly a bank is
associated with person X that is a bank
a bank B and Banky are associated with
the person X but no one has ownership
over the other a person X who is an
account holder with all the three banks
that is a b and c does not possess any
kind of ownership over the three Banks
similarly Banks a b and c who has the
customer which is a person X but the
banks do not possess any kind of
ownership over the customer so the
relationship between the person X and
the banks ABC can be considered as an
association now followed by the seventh
question we have the next question that
is the eighth
question Define copy Constructor in Java
so the answer for this question is as
follows a copy Constructor in Java is a
Constructor that initializes an object
through another object of the same class
a copy Constructor in Java is really
helpful because when you want to copy a
complex object that has several Fields
or when we want to make a deep copy of
an existing object then the copy
Constructor is the one which will help
you out in this
situation so followed by the eighth
question we have the ninth
question what is a marker
interface so the answer for this
question is an empty interface in Java
is referred as a marker interface
serializable and clonable are some of
the popular examples of marker
interface so basically a marker
interface is just another interface but
normally in interface we provide some
signatures so these signatures belong to
particular methods so in normal
interface we just have method signatures
but not the complete implementation or
at least we'll be having some variables
but in a marker interface we do not have
any kind of data manipulating method
signatures any data members nothing they
have special functionality unlike a
normal interface so followed by the 9th
question we have the 10th question what
is object
cloning I guess the word object cloning
is completely self-explanatory yet the
answer for this question is it is an
ability to recreate an object completely
similar to the existing object this
process is known as object cloning in
Java Java provides a bu an function or
method that is the Clone method to clone
an existing object offering the same
functionality that of the original
object so followed by the 10th question
we have our 11th question why is Java
not completely objectoriented so this
question might be a little confusing but
it's true Java is not completely
objectoriented but what's the reason yes
I'll explain you why Java is not
completely
objectoriented so the answer for this
question is Java is not considered as
100% object-oriented programming
language because of the data types it
uses it still makes use of eight or more
primitive data types which are int float
double and few others so this is the
only reason why Java is not considered
as completely 100% objectoriented
programming language so the next
question is Define rapper classes in
Java so the answer for this question is
in Java when you declare primitive data
types that is the int float double Etc
then the wrapper classes are responsible
for converting them into objects or
reference types just as we discussed
before Java is not 100% objectoriented
programming language just because of the
primitive data types it uses so when you
include such primitive data types then
raer classes are the ones which convert
them into objects or reference types for
the ease of compilation and execution of
programs without any issues so followed
by this question we have the next
question Define single turn classes in
Java so the answer for this question is
in Java when you make the Constructor of
a class as private then the particular
class can generate only one single
object this is the reason why such type
of classes are called as Singleton
classes so followed by that we have our
next question that says find package in
Java so if you use some of the popular
idees that is the integrated development
Enterprises such as in TJ or Eclipse
then you might be familiar with projects
packages source files and then the class
file so basically you create a project
first and inside the project you will be
having your Source folder and then you
will be creating your own package using
the source folder and inside the package
you will create a class file and inside
the class file is where you write your
Java program so here the question is
Define package in Java so the answer for
this question is as
follows package is a collective bundle
of classes and interfaces along with
necessary libraries and jav files the
use of packages helps in code
reusability so basically when you create
a specific package inside that package
you will store all the class files that
you will be using in your jav a program
so not only class files in case if you
use any kind of connectors or any kind
of Jar files or any kind of dependencies
for your Java program you will include
all those inside the package so that the
requirements and the class files are
bundled together and this helps out in
code reusability making sure that the
program files or the Java files or any
dependencies are not juggling between
one package to to the other or one file
to the other so using a package is
basically a good
practice so followed by this we have our
next
question can you implement pointers in
Java program so if you remember C
programming language we had pointers
there so we use pointers to directly
access the
memory so similarly can you use pointers
in a Java program this is a little
tricky question for beginners but
basically it's really
simple now the answer for this question
is no because Java virtual machine
personally takes care of memory
management implicitly so Java's major
Moto was to keep programming simple so
accessing memory directly through
pointers is not a recommended action so
the answer is a big no you cannot
Implement pointers in Java
program
so followed by that we have our next
question differentiate between instance
and local variables so the answer for
this question is really simple instance
variables are declared inside a class
and the scope is limited to only a
specific object inside which an instance
variable is created so followed by the
instance variable we have the local
variable so the local variable can be
anywhere inside a method or a specific
block of code also the scope is limited
to the block of code where the variable
that is the local variable is declared
now followed by the 16th question we
have our next question explain Java
string pool so the answer for this
question is a collection of strings in
Java's Heap memory is referred as Java's
string pool so for example you wanted to
create a new string consider your name
so your name might be some XYZ so if you
wanted to create XYZ string then you
provide that particular code to your jvm
so what does jvm do it will not directly
create that particular string first it
will search for the XYZ string in your
string pool if that is already existing
in your string pool then it will provide
a reference to that particular string in
case if XY Z is not there then the jvm
will create a new string that is the XYZ
string so followed by this we have our
next question that is what is an
exception so the answer for this
question is an exception in Java is
considered as an unexpected event that
can disrupt the normal flow of the
program so for example just consider
that you are going to write a program
for division operator so after you
finish your program your evaluator might
want to test your code to the extreme
levels so instead of providing a proper
number imagine that your evaluator is
providing a wrong input such as special
symbols sometimes zero or any other sort
of input so if this kind of input is
provided to your program then your
program might crash so you can avoid
this kind of Crash by using exception
handling so basically you can use try
and catch blocks so you can embed your
code inside the try block and and say to
your program that if any kind of wrong
input such as special symbol or zero is
provided by the evaluator then send a
message saying wrong input or divide by
zero exception so this kind of approach
will provide an output but this kind of
approach will avoid your program from
crashing so this is how exceptions are
handled in real time so followed by this
we have our next
question what is is final keyword in
Java so the answer for this question is
the term final is a predefined word in
Java that is used while declaring values
to variables when a value is declared
using the final keyword then that
particular value of that particular
variable will remain constant throughout
the execution of program so sometimes if
you include a normal variable and
provide an operation on that particular
variable then the value of that
particular variable will change after
the execution of program but when you
declare the same variable using final
keyword then no number of operations or
any kind of manipulations Applied onto
that variable will not change the value
of that particular variable so that's
the speciality of final keyword in Java
so followed by that we'll dive into the
next question that is what happens when
the main method is not declared as
static so the answer for this question
is when the main method is not declared
as static then the program may be
compiled perfectly but ends up with a
serious ambigu and throws a runtime
error that says no such method error so
when you basically declare a main method
don't forget to specify the static
keyword so with this we finished the
beginner segment of questions followed
by the beginnner segment we have the
next segment that is the intermediate
level segment so the first question in
the intermediate level is what is jdk
and mention the variance of
jdk so the answer for this question is
so jdk is basically an abbreviation for
Java development kit this is a combined
package of JRE that is the Java runtime
environment and developer tools used for
Designing Java application and applets
Oracle has the following variants for
Java development kit so the first one is
the jdk standard edition which is
normally used by beginners and
intermediate developers next after the
jdk standard edition we have the Java
development kit for Enterprise so this
particular Enterprise Edition is used by
professional Java developers for
developing Java based applications and
Frameworks now the last one is the Java
development kit micro Edition now
followed by 21st question we will dive
into the next question that says brief
access specifiers and types of access
specifiers in Java so the answer for
this question is as follows basically
access specifiers are predefined
keywords used to help a Java virtual
machine to understand the scope of a
particular data member or data
manipulating method third within a class
or outside the class so in Java we have
four types of access specifiers the
first one is Public Access specifier so
when you declare a data member or a data
manipulating method as public then that
particular data member or method can be
accessible by any class or object
throughout the package followed by that
we have the private access specifier so
unlike the public access specifier when
you provide the the private access
specifier then the accessibility of that
particular private data member or the
data manipulating method will be
provided to specific classes and
specific objects only and finally we
have the protected access specifier so
the protected access specifier is a bit
more secure than the private access
specifier so the access for this
particular protected data member or
protected data manipulating method could
could be a little more difficult to
access unless you are going to implement
everything which is present in that
particular package so basically if you
are trying to access the protected data
member or protected data manipulating
method of a different package then you
need to First import the package into
your existing package so that's how the
protected access specifier Works
practically so finally after the major
three access specifiers we have the
default access specifier so default
access specifier will be provided by the
Java virtual machine so in case if you
declare a variable or a data
manipulating method without using any
specific access specifiers that are
public private and protected then jvm
implicitly considers the default access
specifier so there is no much of a
difference between the public access
specifier and the default access
specifier both have the same
functionality and access ability so
followed by this question we enter into
the next question that is can a
Constructor return a value so the answer
for this question is as follows yes a
Constructor can return a value it
basically Returns the current instance
of a class implicitly you cannot make a
Constructor return a value explicitly
but automatically it Returns the
instance of a
class so the next question is explain
this keyword in Java so in Java we do
have a keyword which is called as this
so what does the keyword this mean in
Java is the question so the answer for
this question is the term this is a
special keyword designated as a
reference variable so the term this
keyword is used to refer to the current
class properties like data manipulating
method instance data member and
Constructors so followed by the 24th
question we have our next question that
says explain super keyword in Java so
the answer for this question is as
follows the term super is a special
keyword designated as a reference
variable so similar to this keyword even
super keyword acts as a reference
variable but the difference is super
keyword is used to refer to the
immediate parent class object so
followed by the 25th question we have
our next question that is explain method
overloading in Java so basically method
overloading and Method overriding Etc
are the concepts of polymorphism so now
let's have a correct answer here so the
process of creating multiple method
signatures using one method name is
called as method
overloading so for example consider that
you wanted to include an addition
operation in your program that performs
addition operation so the first method
will be having the name add and inside
the method parameters you'll be having
two integer types of parameters
similarly you wanted to perform another
addition operation with the same name
add so here you will provide the method
name completely same to the first method
but inside the parameters there is a
difference you are adding three
parameters here so when you pass the
value vales to the add method then which
method to be overloaded that's the
confusion right so should I overload or
should I execute the first ad method or
the second ad method so this completely
depends on the number of parameters you
pass if you are passing two parameters
then the first method will be executed
if you are passing three parameters then
the second method will be executed so
this is how the method overloading
happens in Java so the process of method
overloading can be achieved by using two
different ways the first way is to
change the number of arguments so that's
what exactly I've discussed before now
the second way is varying the return
type of the method so with this let's
enter into the next
question can we overload a static
method so as discussed before the values
of the variables or data manipulating
methods will not be changed when we have
used the keyword static in front of it
so the question is can we overload a
static method now let's discuss the
answer for
this the answer is no Java does not
support overloading of static method the
process would through an error reading
static method cannot be referenced so
followed by this we have our next
question so the next question is Define
late binding the answer for this
question is binding is a process of
unifying the method call with the
method's code segment laid binding
happens when the method's code segment
is unknown till the method is called
during the runtime so followed by this
we have our next question Define dynamic
method
dispatch so the answer is the dynamic
method dispatch is a process where the
method call is executed during the
runtime the overridden method is called
through a reference variable of super
class so this process is called as
runtime
polymorphism now we have our next
question why is delete function faster
in link list than an array so basically
link list and array are the Java
Collections or in other words it's also
considered as data structure so to
answer this question you need to
understand the analogy of Link list and
array so basically an array is a
complete memory block of consecutive
memory locations so consider that your
memory location starts from 100 and your
array has 10 locations so it's a
complete reserved block of from 100 101
102 to
one9 so you have 10 memory blocks so in
case if you wanted to add a number or a
delete a number then you had to make
changes to the comp compl memory block
but when you come into link list you
have the memory blocks used from the
memory Heap so basically what you do
here is you basically connect the notes
through addresses so in case if you
wanted to eliminate a number then what
you do is just to manipulate the
addresses so the address of the
consecutive node will be changed so
that's the only change what you make so
now this is the reason why the delete
function or any kind of manipulation
function is faster in link list compared
to array so now let's have a brief
answer on this delete function is faster
in link list as the user needs to make a
minor update to the point of value so
that the note can point to the next
successor in the list now followed by
this we have our next
question give a briefing on the life
cycle of a thread
so the life cycle of a threat includes
five stages which are as mentioned below
newly born state runnable state that is
it provides the jvm with a feedback that
I'm ready to run now followed by that
the running stage where the thread is
actually running followed by that the
block stage so basically the thread will
be blocked for some reasons for some
intermediate output or something if the
thread is waiting for an input from
another source or some something similar
so that's where the blocked State comes
to existence and finally the dead State
once after everything is processed the
threat is eliminated by gvm now followed
by this we have our next question that
says explain the differences between the
operators provided here so the operators
might look similar but they are
different now let's understand about
these operators in a much better way
through the answer so the answer for
this question is although they look
similar but there's a huge difference
between them so the first operator which
looks like two greater than symbols
perform the operation of right shifting
so when you provide a binary number or
binary value then the bits will be
shifted towards the right and the second
symbol or the second operator which is
having three greater than symbols is
used to shift out the zero filled bits
so this is the functionality of these
two operators now follow Follow by that
let's have the 33rd question brief the
life cycle of an applet so the answer
for this question is the life cycle of
an applet basically involves the
following stages the first stage is the
initialization stage next is the start
stage third is the stop stage fourth is
destroy and finally we have
paint now the next question is why are
generics used in
Java so the answer for this question is
compile time type safety is provided by
using generics in Java so this approach
allows the users to catch unnecessary
invalid inputs at the time of
compilation generic methods and classes
help programmers to specify a single
method declaration a set of related
methods or with a single class
declaration a set of related types so
followed by this we have our next
question
explain externalizable
interface so the answer for this
question is the externalizable interface
helps with the control over the process
of serialization the externalization
interface incorporates read external and
right external methods so we have
listened to a new term here which is
serialization so what exactly is
serialization serialization is a process
of sending your Java code or Java
project from one computer system to a
different computer system so basically
if you wanted to execute some kind of
java program from a different location
then you serialize this particular code
to a different location where you
actually want to execute and this
particular process of transferring your
code is called as
serialization now the next question is
explain demon thread so the answer for
this question is the demon thread can be
defined as a thread with least
responsibility the demon threat is
designed to run in a background during
the process of garbage collection in
Java the set demon method is used to
create the demon thread in Java
programming
language so we have our next question
now explain the term enumeration in
Java so the answer for this question is
enumeration or enum is an interface in
Java enum allows the sequential access
of elements stored in a collection in
Java now the next question is why is
Java considered as a dynamic programming
language so the answer for this question
is Java was designed to adapt to an
evolving environment Java programs
include large amount of runtime
information that is actually used to
resolve access to the objects in real
time so this is the reason why Java is
considered as dynamic programming
language now followed by this we have
our next question
can you run a code before executing the
main method so the answer for this
question is yes we can execute any code
even before the main method we will be
using the static block of code in the
class when creating the objects at load
time of the class any statements within
the static block of the code will
execute it once while loading the class
even before the creation of objects in
the main
method now the last question in the
intermediate section is how many times
the finalized method is called so the
answer for this question is the
finalized method is called by the
garbage collector so for every object
the garbage collector calls the
finalized method just for
once now with this let's enter the
advanced segment of interview questions
based on
Java so the first question in the
advanced segment is can the keywords
this and super we used together so the
answer for this question
is no this and super keywords should be
used in the first statement in the class
Constructor so the following code
segment will give you a better idea so
you can see that we have used the
keyword super and this in the class
Constructor with that is the first class
Constructor now this is how you can use
super keyword and this keyword together
in case if you wanted to use so with
this let's continue with the next
question in the advanced level so the
next question says explain JSP page so
the answer for this question is JSP is
basically an abbrevation for Java servet
page so the Java serlet page consists of
two types of text the first is the
static data and the second one is Java
serlet page
elements now the next question is
explain
jdbc so the answer is jdbc is an
abbrevation for Java database connector
jdbc is an abstract layer used to
establish connectivity between any
existing database and to a Java
application next question is explain the
various directives of
JSP so the directives are instructions
processed by JSP engine after the JSP
page is compiled into a svet directives
are used to set page level instructions
insert data from external files and
specify custom tag libraries directives
are defined between the following
symbols so these are the symbols that
are used to specify the directives in a
JSP page the different types of
directives are shown us below there are
three types of directives they are
include directive page directive and tag
lab directive
so include directive includes a file and
merges the content of the file with the
current page the page directive is used
to define specific attributes in the JSP
page like error page and buffer the tag
lip directory is used to declare a
custom tag Library which is used in the
JSP page followed by that we have the
next
question what are Observer and
observable
classes so the answer for this question
question is objects that subclass the
observable class maintain a list of
observers when an observable object is
updated it invokes the update method of
each of the observers to notify that The
Observers that it has changed its state
The Observer interface is implemented by
objects that observe observable objects
might be a little confusing but you need
to read this answer once again you can
pause it and you can read this answer
once again so that you can and get a
brief understanding of
this followed by that we have the next
question what is session Management in
Java so the answer for this question is
a session is essentially defined as the
dynamic stage of a random conversation
between the client and the server the
essential Communication channel includes
the string of responses and requests
from both sides typically the most
popular way of implementing session
management is the employment of a
session ID in the communicative desk
course of the client and the
server the next question is brief about
spring framework spring framework is
basically the framework of Frameworks
now the answer for this question is
spring is essentially defined as the
application framework and inversion of
control container for Java basically the
chief purpose of spring framework is to
create Enterprise applications in Java
also it is especially useful to keep in
mind that the central features of the
spring framework are essentially
conductive to any Java
application so the next question is
explain jca in Java so the answer for
this question is jca is basically an
abbrevation for Java cryptography
architecture so jca provides a platform
that gives architecture and apis for
encryption as well as decryption JC is
used by the developer to combine the
application with the security measure it
also helps in performing the third-party
security rules it uses the hash table
encryption message digest Etc to
implement the security so the next
question is explain jpa in Java so the
answer for this question is jpa stands
as an abbrevation for Java persistence
API the jpa is enabling us to create the
persistence layer for desktop and web
applications jpa deals with the
following Java persistence API query
language Java persistence criteria API
object mapping metadata Etc so the last
question in our list is explain the
different authentications in Java
servlets so the answer for this question
is authentication options available in
servlets are as follows the first one is
basic Authentication
so the basic authentication consists of
username and password provided by the
client to authenticate as the user the
second one is form based authentication
in this particular type of
authentication the login form is made by
the programmer by using
HTML followed by that we have the third
type of authentication that is digest
authentication digest authentication is
similar to basic authentication but in
this the passwords are encrypted using
hash formula this makes that just more
secured and lastly we have the client
certificate authentication the client
certificate authentication requires that
each client accessing the resource has a
certificate that it sends to
authenticate itself this requires SSL
protocol and with that we have come to
