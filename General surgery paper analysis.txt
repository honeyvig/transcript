hi Venus welcome back to pepper analysis
of general surgery and I'll be giving
few more suggestions and feedbacks which
you need to implement for the next
subject so going into this question
pepper this question paper is for final
length well marks and this question
paper is a combination of the questions
of both need and aims pattern because
your regular knit pattern will have only
one mode of question that is select the
best option among the four whereas your
aims has already discussed we have
different patterns as we have included
few aims pattern questions the question
for each the score for each question is
going to be very so with that the
scoring was 512 ok we have few matchings
each matching each each matching is
going to carry 4 marks in Mile scoring
system ok so that's the reason by for
120 bucks we got fire in the 12 mark
this was posted as doubt by many
students and I feel like this is not
area to be focused unnecessarily I feel
like we are wasting time on such
unwanted things we should be focused
more on the subject and the concepts
rather than unnecessary things this is
this has very less weight as in the exam
sucky scoring systems understanding the
scoring systems and everything is waste
of time according to me ok let it be so
with some key Corrections and some
errors or any NEX why should I I
concluded the score as 496 so how much
you score for 496 is a question so the
professor analysis for this particular
paper is easy questions were somewhere
around 65 easy questions means questions
which were exposed to you either in the
daily exams either in the PDFs what we
have shared on the groups or either from
the basic mcq books what you are being
learning or being exposing or either
from the from the videos what we have
what we have posted on the website or
either from the classes either from the
classes or either from the discussions
either from the textbook reading they
are direct questions direct direct means
is this very sweet to identify the right
option among the four such questions are
somewhere around 65 the next one the
easy questions so easy questions require
a little bit application you already
read them you're done with them but you
need a little more application of
presence of mind a little more
application is required for the medium
based questions the next comes is the
most difficult part that is a difficulty
questions means with the knowledge with
the presence of mind now you need to
apply some elimination based concepts or
some extra knowledge from your basics or
from other subjects you have to apply
some logics to come out with the right
answer for difficult questions so such
questions for somewhere around 12 in
this particular exam the last but not
the least is unknown questions means
unknown questions you're not you're
completely unknown of the particular
concept or particular area for example a
question on a tumor half hydrant neck
which you have not covered either in
your mcq books or either the discussions
are either anywhere such questions were
somewhere around 9:00 and of course
there is one other question so totally
you you can consider that unknown
question says tendon number so what
professor analysis says is it's very
simple that you have sure a minimum
accuracy of 95% s for easy questions so
easy questions you have to show 95% test
accuracy means means you have to hit
minimum 60 right answers out of 65 in
this paper for easy questions so your
score will be 240 right 240 of course
you will get minus 5 negative marking
with this because you lose 5 questions
and and I'm giving these five questions
as a human error
you're no man either we will spoil some
questions you know but you spoil okay
I'll give you some techniques to
decrease the human error also the second
monarch medium based questions okay
means you need a place on power right
your your knowledge presence of mind
something so in this you need to
maintain an accuracy of at least seventy
five percent is a minimum accuracy of 75
percentage is required so you have to
score a minimum 25 right answers out of
33 a minimum of 75 to 80 percentage of
accuracy is really required for a medium
based questions because these are the
questions which has good chance of
deciding your rank so your score will be
hundred furthest of course you will get
minus eight marks okay the next one is
difficulty questions okay so in
difficulty question if I feel like 60
percentage of accuracy should be
maintained 60 percent is at least like
you need to go with 60 percentage of
accuracy at least you need to make seven
to eight questions right out of 12 so 7
force is 28 and you'll go with minus
five score again hit next one is unknown
questions even for unknown questions the
main reason is I'm just pointing you to
give full latent right so main reason
even for unknown questions you have to
maintain and you have to come out with
an accuracy of at least 40 or 50
percentage of accuracy should be
maintained means you need to hit at
least like out of this 10 you need to
hit minimum for answers so till four to
four 316 marks and you'll get minus six
score so this is what the analysis of
the professor says so your score on an
aggregate it's going to be three hundred
and forty plus forty so it is 380
I think it's 384 I'm not wrong just 384
so your rough analysis is 384 out of 384
24 are wrong 24 hour negative marking so
360 I feel it's not cut off mark it's
not cut off mark but I feel like 360 is
a minimum score that every student who
were part of MDS conquer doing all the
tasks working vigorously from the last
10 days with general surgery concept
videos daily exams doubts X why should
we have done lots of work so this is a
minimum score that you should attend you
should attend to be in the competition
360 is is is a cut-off according to me
ok so the competition zone will move
around 360 means it will be 380 to 340
or 330 will be the computations on most
of the people but if you cross 360 I
feel like you'll be in the safe safest
part particularly to this to this
examination but if you are at high end
that is my range is 380 to 340 if you
are at this end anything about 380 in
this paper there are high chances of
getting or being selected for government
until chorus 360 is good but 380 plus or
anything about 380 or 380 is a safe zone
to be injudicious
ok so anything below 300 I want you guys
to think over where you are going wrong
where you're bad at because you need to
identify this because this question
paper I can 100% is analysis is it's not
tough it's not too easy it's not tough
it is a good range it is good range but
you need to maintain and
mm score of 300 for this paper according
to me if you're not up to this level if
you have the reason like I'm not I have
not done this completely however read
this properly I was have started the
preparation in the middle acceptable but
if you are there from day one and if you
are reading without wasting a single day
in this last 10 days for general surgery
and if your score is below 300 or below
280 you need to think over you need to
come out immediately with the solution
if not I feel like you are not up to the
mark in giving example working is
different getting scores in the exam is
is the most important thing rather than
working okay so guys you need to think
about this so next comes is some some
positive things and some feedbacks some
some questions posted by the students
and the solution for them so whatever it
may be like whether it's good or bad
first always first take good leave the
bad leave the bad from everything always
take good so always take positive
feedbacks into consideration which are
really required for you to be more
confident in the preparation so
advantage of attempting all the
questions okay so I'm reading sorry this
is already discussed with you so now we
are in the practice section okay so now
we are in the practice area for example
if you think this practice section as a
net practice like you're practicing
there is a final match and you are
practicing every day in your grounds and
everything for example if it is a
cricket so in net practice we don't
leave balls
we don't leave we don't leave anything
we play we learn we learn from that
practice so in final exam you have to
judge what to be left and what to be
taken so if you start applying that
negative marking concept and leaving
questions your brain will be your brain
become numb day by day okay so if a new
question comes your brain will not work
so it is mandatory and it is a request
person request from my said that all
students of MDS concur should attempt
all questions until you reach the mock
exams mock exams I let
no like what to be questions which has
which you have to left or what you have
to leave like we'll have a special class
on that and we will start applying the
negative marking concept before we take
now before we start the mock exams in
the last phase that will be in the
number four now I request everyone to
apply your your logic or your common
sense your presence of mind and
attempting all the questions so this is
practice session you need to attempt all
use your brain exercise your brain force
your brain that make sure your brain
should come out with the right answer
for every known unknown or difficult
question and second one most of the
students in the last one or two days
were more worried about the drift in the
ranked ranks will always be dynamic
because every month the new students are
going to come they're going to read
vigorously the first few days right
so every year to come every every month
or every day in MDS conquer the
competition will be drifted similarly
you can compare this through all through
all the people who are preparing in the
need in throughout the country right so
the computation will be dynamic you
cannot be the same situation like a you
may read well this this week or you may
spend more time well in this week but
maybe your competitor is reading more
vigorously double then you triple the
news giving 300 400 percentage of time
of them apart from the regular
competitors who read more you don't know
about the regular competitors who read
more there'll be new competitors that
are adding to your schedule every day
every week every month so all these all
are going to increase your increase the
computation levels and make your rank
dynamic may be you may get 10th rank or
11th ranked in the last weekend but you
may be drifted to 40 or 50 this weekend
because the competitors are doing more
valid valid work the new competitors
were added so the new competitors were
not done with the previous subject guys
they're not done with the previous
subject but they're done with the
present subject perfect better than you
it doesn't make it doesn't mean that
your rank is
is going to be 60 or 70 always it will
be dynamic it may move further like when
you move to the mock exams it may move
further better so don't consider your
dynamic rang grants ok so dynamic ranks
depends upon different factors which we
cannot change and next one and this is
what I am stressing I'm talking about
okay things will be different for
different people at different situation
giving exam on on a single subject is
easy giving exam on four subject is
going to be difficult
giving exam on 25 subjects like final
exam is going to be more difficult okay
so this has to be taken into
consideration you should not be too
overconfident like I have seen people
who are being more confident getting
good scores in one exam it should be
maintained for the next exam it should
be maintained for group of exams it
should be maintained in the mock exams
and final exam so that continuity should
be required so if you feel you are
confident enough to handle things okay
you need to think about this this is a
single exam can you do the same
performance in multiple exams then you
cube do the same performance in the
market seems a question don't compare
with your friends okay because none of
the seats will be shared okay no sharing
business in the need okay so your friend
will have his life or her life and you
will have your life so don't ever
compare your lives or your mode of
preparation or your scores with your
friends that is the main reason why we
don't post the scores on the group okay
you once you're done with the exam you
will get your rank you will get your
analysis in the website the website is
made in such a way so that's the reason
why I don't compare your scores with
your friends okay so don't ever do that
and don't compare your performance of
this subject to other subject okay how
well you are in general surgery first
row however you are in general surgery
second round can be compared how well
you are in the previous subject which
may be easy or difficult so few subjects
will be easy
a few individuals will be difficult for
few individuals okay so I don't want you
to compare any subject scores with this
sir last week I got this core this week
I got this core no how can you compare
last week it is a different subject this
week is a different subject next week is
going to be different subject okay so
don't ever do that it always says
revision is always key for scoring if
you're scoring if you feel you're
scoring ZAR bad
the first etiology can be revision so
first question if your scores are not
optimal question yourself that whether
your revision is proper or not whether
you have completed the syllabus first
round followed by you have done proper
revision for the second round or not
before you take the examination 90
percentage of the cases will fall in
these two cases are you done with the
syllabus or not no okay I had it done
with the syllabus or not yes have it
done with the revision or not s No so
most of the people who are not up to the
mark will be will be in these two
questions like not done with the
syllabus not done with the proper
revision so if you're done with the
syllabus and if you are done with the
proper revision it is very easy for this
particular question paper to cross that
three hundred score so always says okay
winning is the only option left for US
Congress try to be as confident as you
can because being positive is the most
greatest thing that anyone can do in
their preparation phase because I have
been talking with so so so many people
because I spend most of my time in
talking to the people and just analyzing
their mindsets this is what I regularly
do in my last five to six years so I
feel like more than 70 to 80% of the
people are not positive
lack of positivity lack of confidence
they don't trust themselves okay so if
you start implementing this first trust
yourself you are the boss of your life
you are the king of your
you are the hero of your film okay so if
you trust yourself then you will be
turning to an individual with lots of
confidence trusting yourself being bold
you will get the conference once you are
confident everything whether it is a
negative or positive you will take into
positive consideration so if you do this
it's very easy to survive in this
competitive world exam is different
right and not bothered about X M exam
anyway you will be successful because
you are working to good and to better so
to be successful in the life the most
required thing is confidence and
positivity and of course trust on
yourself signing off for now team MDS
conquered all the best guys for the next
subject
