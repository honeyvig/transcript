that fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further relay let's
get started now let's quickly open the
powerbi window so we are on the powerbi
window right now so here we can see we
have already loaded the data we have the
filters visualizations Etc and we have
the canvas over here right so in the
visuals section if you closely observe
you have the kpi over here right so you
can either select and drag it onto the
canvas or you can just simply double
click and create a kpi but before that
what exactly is a kpi right it's the key
performance indicator right it's a full
form of kpi so what exactly is key
performance indicator let's say we have
the sales dashboard over here sales data
set over here right now we have region
wise sales we have country-wise sales we
have region wise profits we have region
wise uh discounts we have quantity right
so it's like a visual it's like a number
clear literal readable number right on
top of your dashboard right so if you
just want to have a quick glance of how
many number of sales you made how's the
profit happening how's the sale
happening how's the discount that you're
getting right and how many number of
quantity of certain product has been
sold in a segment right so those are the
key perform perance numbers which will
be available right on top of your
dashboard so that's exactly what you
call as a kpi now how do you create a
kpi so one way is you can just hold the
kpi and drag it onto the canvas or so
this is one way of creating the kpi
let's remove this now another simplistic
way of creating a kpi is just double
click anywhere on the dashboard or the
canvas and you will have this so so just
write what kind of kpi you want to
create so I want to create kpi for sales
just create that and you have your kpi
there now another one kpi
discount just click on that you have the
kpi for discount double click once again
kpi for profits you have the kpi for
profits now kpi for
quantity there you go that's how you
create kpis in powerp should you need to
arrange the kpi sizes or color or
background you can also do that by just
simply playing around the sections over
here right the background or the the
outline section over here you can just
play with it you can increase the size
decrease the size add a background you
have a setting over here you can do
anything that you want right so that's
how you create kpis in power pi and with
that we have come to an end of the
