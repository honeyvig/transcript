hey everyone i am viva kandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
insertion sort algorithm
we shall begin our session by
introducing insertion sort
then we will discuss insertion sort
algorithm after that we will implement
the insertion sort algorithm in the code
editor
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn's
youtube channel so without any further
ado let's get started with an
introduction to insertion sort
insertion sort is basically a sorting
algorithm in which each item in the
final sorted array is sorted one at a
time
and it is significantly less efficient
than more sophisticated algorithms like
quick sort heap sort or merge sort on
larger data sets
now let's discuss the algorithm of
insertion sort
let's say we have an array
we will start with traversing the array
from index 1 to n minus 1.
while traversing we will compare
elements at the current index to its
predecessor
if the data at the current index is
smaller than its predecessor then we
will compare it with the element before
that
after that we will shift bigger elements
to an index up to make space for swapped
elements then we will shift the bigger
elements to an index up to make space
for the swapped element and then we will
iterate the same steps again to sort the
complete array
we have now introduced the insertion
sort and its algorithm
now let's implement this algorithm in
the code editor
we will start with creating a function
to sort an array using session sort so
void
insertion sort
we will give it argument as int array
arr
comma int
size
we will declare variables and i
comma key
comma j
now
we will create a loop for loop
from i is equals to
1
to i less than
size
i plus plus
here we are traversing this array from
index 1 to the size n minus 1.
so key
is equals to
arr
at i
and j is equals to
i minus 1
now we will move the elements of ar 0 to
i minus 1
that are greater than the key to one
position ahead of the current position
so while
j
is greater than equals to
zero
and
arr at j
is greater than key
and we will swap these
so a ir
at j plus 1
is equals to a r r
f j
and j will be equals to j minus 1.
and then we will assign arr j plus 1
is equals to key
now we will write a function to print
this array
of size
void
print
array
we will give its argument as end
array
and
size size
we will declare end i is equals to zero
for loop
i is equal to zero
i less than size
i plus plus
c out
arr
arr
bracket i
and see out
handle
now we will write the main block
so end
arr
is equals to
12 comma
11 comma 15
comma 9 comma 6 comma 7
and
size is equals to we will find the size
using size of
so size is equals to
size of
arr
divided by size of
arr at index 0.
now we will print this array without
sorting
so c out
unsorted array
we will print
array
error comma size
now we will call insertion sort
arr comma size
see out
we will print this
array
sorted
now we will again call print
array
argument as arr comma
size
now let's print this
as you can see our function is working
flawlessly it has sorted this array
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned from this session
first up insertion sort is efficient for
arrays with small data sets
next up insertion sort require a
constant amount of extra memory
next insertion sort can only sort a
single element at a time
and finally insertion sort has the worst
complexity of big o of n square
and this was all for today's session
