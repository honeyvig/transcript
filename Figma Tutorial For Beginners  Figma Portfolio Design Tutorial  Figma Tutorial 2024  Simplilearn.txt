so let's move on to the demo so to begin
with make sure you signed into your FMA
account now if you don't already have an
account you can create one for free and
once you're logged in now navigate your
draft section and create a new design
file by clicking on new
design this will open up a blank canvas
where we'll be designing our portfolio
website so now let's take a moment to
familiarize ourselves with how FMA Works
figma operates using frames which are
like individual Pages or sections of
your design so everything you create
sits inside these frames so let's go
ahead and create our frame for the
photography portfolio website and by the
way for this demo we'll be creating a
photography portfolio website right so
let's get started so go to the leftand
toolbar and select the frame tool or
simply press F on your keyboard for a
shortcut now in the properties as you
can see on the right side you'll see
different preset frame sizes like
mobiles tablet desktop so since we are
designing a website for desktop view
select the desktop
option yeah so this is around, 1400
pixels wide this will be be our canvas
for the photography portfolio so it's
always important to start your design
with a correct frame size this ensures
that your layout will be responsive and
function correctly across devices now
before we dive into adding images or
text we need to set up the structure of
the layout so the key to a well
organized website is a well planned
layout right the photography portfolio
website we are designing today will have
three main sections the header with
navigation links the portfolio Gallery
showcasing our images and a footer with
social media links and a contact Section
so you can use a rectangle tool or press
R in your keyboard to create a large
rectangle at the top of your frame like
this this will be the header where we'll
add the site title and navigation links
now next create another large rectangle
below the header so this is where we'll
be placing the portfolio Gallery which
is a central focus of for website so you
can just copy this
rectangle paste it move it downward
and increase the size because this is
the central
part you can also increase the size of
the frame like
this okay now let's zoom
in okay and finally create a third
rectangle at the bottom for the footer
which will hold the social media links
and a small contact form again you can
just paste
it yes perfect
now we are not worried about the exact
sizes right now so we'll adjust
everything later as we add content for
now just ensure you have three sections
laid out on your canvas now structuring
your layout before getting into the
design details keeps you organized and
ensures a smooth design process so about
focusing on details too early this will
save your time and prevent you from
getting lost in the finer points of the
design so now that we have blocked out
the basic structure of the portfolio
let's add a grid to ensure that all our
elements are perfectly aligned so in web
design basically a grid system is used
to maintain visual consistency and
provide structure so most websites
follow a 12 column grid system and we
are going to use the same for this
photography portfolio so here you can
select the main frame which is the
desktop so in the right hand panel look
out for the layout
grid option and click on the plus sign
to add a grid so by default figma
applies a square grid but we need a
column based grid so click on the grid
icon and you can select
column and set the number of columns to
12 yeah so now we need these columns to
be Center aligned so let's just change
this
type to
Center yeah and adjust the column width
to 75
pixels perfect so now that our grid is
set you'll notice that each section we
created is divided evenly by these
columns this makes it easier to place
images and text ensuring everything is
aligned neatly within the design so a
grid system not only helps with
alignment but also improves the
readability and flow of the design using
a grid ensures that your website feels
balanced and consistent across devices
so now let's move on to the header
section let's just zoom in a bit yeah
now this will have the site title and
navigation links like home portfolio
about me and contact will also give this
header a transparent look over a
background image so first you have to
select the top rectangle which is the
header section and adjust its height to
around 150
pixels so here you can change the height
into 150 pixels this will give us enough
space to include the title and
navigation length now next we'll add a
background image to the header so how do
we do that so first select this
rectangle go to
fill let's
just close
these just a second
yeah go there select an image choose an
image let's choose this
image and yeah and you can also you know
change the
exposure
contrast
saturation you can do all these settings
now as you can see this is a very light
image I think it's visible it's like
raindrops I want to keep it subtle so
that's why I've kept it this way you you
can add images of your choice now next
let's add the site title so now select
the text tool the shortcut of which is
T and click within the header
section yeah and type the photography's
name for example this is SN
house
photography and we'll use the Google
font play fair
display so here you can
go and change the
font and we can give the font size at
48 I think this is pretty decent and
align it to the left side of the header
so let's align it to the left side now
as you can see we won't go beyond this
grid as you remember this grid is for
our reference and we are not supposed to
add anything with this side and this
side so
let's
yeah think this is fine now let's add
some simple navigation links like home
portfolio about me and contact so you
can create each of these links using the
text tool and align them to the right of
the header again just use the
shortcut
here you can give an about
this you can keep
it the font size is
18 think this is more than
enough you can keep it 20 I
guess yeah so we'll align everything
later we'll just add right now the text
that we need
home and let's keep just one mod which
is contact right now will align all this
towards the right yes and again I'm
reminding you to use the
grid yes see how simple it was for me to
give equal spaces among these right so
always keep your header design clean and
simple especially for portfolio websites
like this because our main focus is on
the work right so now that we have a
header in place it's time to work on the
gallery which is the main focus of the
design so this section will showcase the
grid of your best photography work so
here you have to go to the section of
the frame the larger rectangle that we
have now we are planning to create a
grid of two rows and four images in each
row so to do this we have to use the
rectangular tool R and then we'll
duplicate it just draw a
rectangle we'll give it white color so
that it's
visible
yep now let's
we duplicate
it keep it
here and we
can get it up I think it's fine just a
second yeah now it's fine now you can
just duplicate it by you know selecting
alt
option I'm bringing it down like this
perfect so we did not need this to be
this big so let's
just adjust the
section yes so now we'll replace these
placeholders so this is basically the
placeholders where we are going to place
our images so we are going to replace it
with actual images so you can simply
Click on each rectangle go to fill
select image fill and upload images one
by one example here you can go to
fill
image you can go and choose your
image see fantastic so you can do this
one by one
so when designing a portfolio Gallery
it's important to maintain a clean grid
based layout this allows the images to
shine without distractions giving them
the space they need to stand out so now
let's add a subtle gradient background
to make the portfolio image pop so here
you have to select the portfolio Gallery
background
go to the fill section and change the
background from solid to linear
gradient so this is gradient option now
you have to choose a dark tone on one
side of the gradient and a lighter tone
on the other
hand so for example start with black at
the bottom fading to dark gray at the
top yeah let's do it this way
we can even change the color I think we
can keep
it shall we keep I think this is
better this is more better so let's keep
it this
way now this will as you can see this
has created a smooth
transition so as you can see a subtle
gradient can create a sense of depth and
dimension it ensures a portfolio stands
out
now let's go and design the footer
section so let's just decrease the frame
because we don't need this much just a
second let's select the
frame we're having the footer here of
course I'm just giving you a basic idea
on how to use the
features and as you can see I just added
the images over here but then you can
write text create a text field
and you can explain what the image is
about and everything and make it more
interesting so now select the bottom
rectangle which is the
futter and change its color to black or
dark gray let's change it to
Black this will contrast nicely with the
rest of the site so you can easily find
free SVG icons online at resources like
icon finder or flat icon so you can
download icons for platforms like
Instagram Facebook LinkedIn and drag
them directly into the FM canvas so now
in the footer section you'll be giving
your contact details like your social
media links social media accounts and
also your email phone number and in
whichever way they can contact you right
basically that's why the footer is used
for every website so here we can just
give an email
ID so we can keep it towards the
left and always try to keep your font
size and font
style so here I have just added the
email address for contact you can also
give your phone number and also if you
have social media accounts what you can
do is you can actually download social
media icons from you know websites like
icon finder or flat icon and you can
download those icons as SVG format and
upload them so now let's talk more about
Auto layout one of figma's most powerful
tool for keeping elements organized and
perfectly spaced so Auto layout is
essential when you need Dynamic resizing
and consistent spacing here's how it
works so you can select any set of
elements that need to be evenly spaced
or grouped for example the images in
your portfolio
Gallery so we can select these
elements and test shift a to group the
elements in Auto layout you'll notice
that figma automatically spaces them out
evenly and you can also adjust the
padding and GAP values in the right hand
panel to control the spacing between
ments this is especially useful if you
want to maintain equal distances between
your images also you can use effects
like shadows and gradients so this goal
is to add subtle depth without
overwhelming the content so now that we
have designed the entire portfolio
website it's time to zoom out and review
everything so you can just zoom out and
I haven't added anything much this is
just a basic idea that I have covered so
you can zoom out and check how your
website looks and you know check the
alignments spacing and everything so one
thing that you must make sure is that
the text and images must be balanced so
if necessary you can go back to any
section and adjust the size of spacing
of elements using Auto layout or manual
alignment tools and finally you can just
you know remove this grid and see how it
looks so right now you know you're
viewing it with the grid so you might
not get a complete idea so for removing
the grid what you can do is go to the
layout grid and here you can see a
symbol just switch it off so this is how
your website will look like without the
grid so that was it in this video I hope
you got a basic idea on how to create a
website from scratch without using any
coding in figma so I hope you enjoyed
