it is the most popular programming
language in the world netflix candy
crush facebook and uber all these
websites and apps are based on this
language you guessed it right we are
talking about the king of all
programming languages javascript and if
you thought we were talking about java
are you living under a rock
welcome to the new series on everything
you need to know about javascript
javascript not to be confused with java
was developed by brendan ike in the year
1995 and since has been synonymous with
the rise of the internet itself
back in 1993 when the first web browser
with gui was released which by the way
played an enormous role in the growth of
the current world wide web netscape
thought of making the boring static web
pages a bit more dynamic
they hired brendan ike to create a new
scripting language with syntax similar
to java and c plus and within 10 days he
developed a new language which he
originally named mocha
what is with people relating programming
with coffee and beans java mocha hello
am i missing something here
let me know in the comments later to be
renamed live script and then javascript
created out of necessity ninety five
point two percent of websites on the
internet use it pick any popular website
or web app netflix facebook ebay youtube
they wouldn't exist without javascript
such is its importance
but this wasn't the scenario all along
javascript didn't start out well as
companies thought it was more useful for
a designer than an engineer but in
reality this ui fix or ui glue coined by
the folks at the time is what led to the
expansion of the internet
so it was clear that this language
needed to be properly maintained and
managed as it was growing rapidly and
this is when ecma also known as european
computer manufacturers association was
approached by netscape to standardize
javascript in 1997 and has been
maintaining it ever since but what was
it that led to its immense popularity
fast forward to 2005 a paper released by
jesse james garrett introduced ajax
asynchronous javascript and xml a
revolutionary technology that improved
the user experience by a mile
it became a developer's dream as now you
could do tasks that weren't possible
before like update a web page without
reloading the page send data to a server
in the background request and receive
data from a server after the page has
loaded in 2009 common js project had a
goal to make use of javascript outside
of the web browser this paved the way
for node.js as an environment to run
browserless javascript
now the language that ran the front end
of the internet was able to tackle the
servers behind the scenes as well coming
to the present day we have a bunch of
javascript frameworks and libraries such
as angular react vue and ember that
allow powerful and complex web
applications to be written by small
teams within a short time span it has
been adopted worldwide in different
organizations in various forms and this
is what has made it the most popular
programming language javascript has come
a long way from its rocky start and
there's no stopping it whatever the
future holds for javascript one thing is
for sure it's going to stay here for
many more years to come
and that concludes our video on getting
up to speed on javascript
