hello everyone welcome to this
comprehensive overview of calculus by
simple learn in this video we will
methodically examine the foundational
Concepts and principles that underpin
this pivotal branch of mathematics We
Begin by defining calculus itself a
field concerned with rates of change and
accumulated values calculus consists of
two primary subdivisions differential
calculus and integral calculus
differential calculus deals with rates
of change explaining how quickly
something changes at any given moment
we'll explore important ideas like
limits which describe what happens as a
value approaches another value we'll
also learn about continuity and
derivatives which measure instantaneous
rates of change integral calculus on the
other hand focuses on adding up or
accumulating values over an interval we
will Define different types of integ
definite integrals that calculate total
accumulated values and indefinite
integrals that represent anti-derivative
functions additionally we will cover
techniques and formulas for evaluating
different integrals throughout this
video we will use ample real world
examples and graphical representations
to illustrate and clarify these abstract
mathematical concepts by the end you
will have a thorough grasp of the
foundations of both differential and
integral calculus before we commence

introduction to
calculus in this lesson we are going to
explain the concepts of calculus Define
differential calculus examine the limits
continuity and derivative ative of a
function Define integral calculus and
list down the differential and integral
formulas basics of
calculus what is calculus calculus is
the study of change it provides a
framework for modeling systems in which
there is change and ways to make
predictions about such
models calculus is one of the key areas
of mathematics that deals with
continuous change it is is based on two
key Concepts derivatives and integral it
is also referred to us infinite decimals
calculus or the calculus of infini
tmals the amounts that are virtually
equal to nothing but are still not quite
zero or known as the infinite simol
numbers by a large old style calculus is
the investigation of continuous change
of
functions derivatives versus integrals
the derivative of a function is a
proportion of a pace of progress of a
function which helps in finding the
slope of a curve on the other hand
integral of a function is a proportion
of the area under the curve of the
mathematical function FX plotted as a
function of X derivatives explain the
function at a specific point while
integral collects the discrete benefits
of a function over a range of value
differential calculus
differential calculus is a part of
calculus that deals with the study of
rates at which quantities change
consider a scenario where X and Y are
two real numbers such that Y is the
function of X that is y equals to F
ofx if f ofx is the equation of a
straight line that is a linear equation
then the equation is represented as y =
to mx + b where m is the slope of the
line and B is The Intercept on the Y
AIS change in y over change in X is what
represents or helps in determining the
slope or M of this
line it can also be written as Delta y
by Delta X the Delta y over Delta X is
also represented as d y by DX this is
the derivative of y with respect to X as
well well as the rate of change of Y per
unit change in
X the slope of a curvature of the graph
which varies at various points
represents the slope of an imaginary
straight line like this line which we
I'm drawing over here through the small
graph segment X1 y1 and X2
Y2 limits in mathematics limits are
defined as the values that a function
approaches as the input approaches a
certain value the limit equation is
expressed as limit as X approaches C of
function of x equals
a
derivatives derivatives are defined as
the varying rate of change of a function
with respect to independent
variable the derivative of a function
can be expressed as limit as X
approaches H for difference between
function of x + H and function of x / H
equal a derivatives are used to measure
the sensitivity of one dependent
variable with respect to another
independent
variable continuity a function is
continuous when there are no gaps or
breaks in the graph however in calculus
we need to be a bit more specific in our
definition of continuity in Calculus if
function is said to be continuous at x =
2 a if and only if three of these
conditions are
met first the function is defined at x =
2
a that is function of a equals a real
number the limit of a function as X
approaches a
exists and the limit of the function as
X approaches a is equals to the function
value at x equals to a differential
formula
formulas differentiation formulas can be
applied to basic algebra expressions
trigonometric ratios inverse
trigonometry and exponential terms for
example the first derivative of x to the
power n with respect to X can be
calculated as n multiplied to x to the
power n minus
one this can also be read as d by DX of
x to the power n = to NX the^ n minus1
similarly d by DX of a to the power x =
a to the power x log of a d by DX of a
constant is always Zero D by DX of e to
the power x = e to the power x d by DX
of sin x is cos x and D by DX of c x is
- cosec s x these are few examples of
differential formulas integral
calculus integral calculus assigns
numbers to functions to describe
displacement area volume and other
Concepts arising by combining infinite
decimal
data let's consider a function f of real
variable
X at an interval of A and B of the real
line the definite integral is defined as
the the signed area of the region in the
X Y plane Bound by the graph of F that
is this
part the x
axis and the vertical lines at xal 2 a
and xal to
B so integration is about finding the
area under or enclosed within these
points an integral value is the inverse
of a differential and vice versal
an integral calculus equation can be
expressed as integration for limits A to
B of function of X DX over
here definite integral a definite
integral is the area under the curve
between two fixed limits that means it
has a specific limit for the computation
of the function the first fundamental
theorem of calculus allows definite
integrals to be computed in terms of
indefinite
integrals if the uppercase F is the
indefinite integral or also called as
the
anti-derivative for a continuous
function f
ofx then a definite integral of the
function f ofx in the interval A and B
can be given as integral A to B of f ofx
DX equals anti-derivative of B minus
anti-derivative of he
indefinite integral an integral which is
not having any upper and lower limit is
known as indefinite
integral mathematically if uppercase F
ofx is any anti-derivative of lowercase
f ofx then the most General derivative
of f ofx is called as the indefinite
integral here C is the constant of
integration which can be any real number
and is considered as a constant function
integration
formulas integral formulas can be
derived from differentiation formulas
and are complementary to differentiation
formula for example integral of x the^ n
DX = to x ^ n + 1 / n + 1 + C integral
over 1 DX = 2x + C or integral over e
to^ x DX is equal to e to^ x + C the
differentiation of sin x was cos x hence
the integration of cos x DX is given as
sin x + C here are a few other examples
of these integration formulas key
takeaways differential calculus is the
part of calculus that deals with the
study of the rates at which quantities
change
integral calculus assigns numbers to the
function to describe displacement area
volume and other Concepts that arise by
combining infinitesimal
data a definite integral has a
particular limit or cut off for the
computation of the function derivatives
