to find the perfect data analytics
program that fits your experience and
areas of Interest now without further
delay let's get started so let's get
back onto the data set so now we are on
the Excel data set so this is the data
which we used in our previous data
analytics using chat gbd so the only
catch is the previous version what we
used was the chat gbd 3.5 the globally
available freefor use chat gbd correct
so that version of chat gbd had to be
gone through few personas remember we
created a persona for chat gbd there we
went into settings and we explain chat
gbd to think From perspective of a data
scientist or a data analyst and these
will be your approaches for the answer
right for the question these will be
your style of answering to the questions
but here we might have to follow the
same or you can also give chat GPD your
own prompt for explaining what kind of
approach you should follow and coming
back to another difference the major
difference here so chat GPT 3.5 gave us
steps to create a piver table paper
chart or steps to follow to create a
visualization on the bi tools like
powerbi and tblo correct so for a quick
reference you can also refer to that
video CH GPD 3.54 an this simply learn
and today we are dealing with the
premium version of chat GPD which is the
pH so the difference is you just have to
tell chat GPD to think From perspective
of a data scientist or data analyst and
then give the data set and ask it for an
Eda just tell it give me an exploration
data analysis on this particular data
set and luckily CH gbd4 will create an
entire endtoend report on the explorat
data analysis based on this particular
available data and it can also give you
the charts which are completely
downloadable it will give you data
visualization charts graphs Maps
whatever possible from this data set and
you are free to download them and create
a PowerPoint presentation out of it and
give it to your stakeholders or your
managers so that's the icing on top of
the cake for your data analytics when
you are using CH gbd pH so let's quickly
go through our data set and quickly
switch to chat gbd4 and share this data
with chat gbd4 and extract the insights
that we're looking for great so the data
set that we have here is based on some
uh Superstore so we have Pro ID or
writing dates right and we have um
country we have region we have category
subcategory product name sales quantity
discount and profit so there are a
number of possibilities you can look for
country sales you can look for Zone wise
or region wise profits and you can also
generate some Scatter Plots where you
can identify the impact of discount on
profits the impact on discounts on sales
right and you can also identify which is
the top country which has been giving us
maximum profits and what is that country
looking for what kind of products what
kind of category or what kind of
subcategory is giving us maximum profits
from that country right and if there is
some product or if there is some
category which is underperforming then
can you kind of uh so you can identify
some categories which are
underperforming and apply some discounts
and uh you know push out the stock in a
better way so these are the few insights
that you can get out Char gbd for the
premium version now that we have a clear
idea about what is the data we are
dealing with what kind of Eda that we
can expect out of charge4 let's proceed
with charge4 quickly let's switch to it
there you go we have switched to
chbd 4 now um you can as usual like the
previous session you can also go into
settings you can build a persona for
your chat GPD telling it uh the kind of
answers of the kind of approach you
should follow right you can do that you
can just simply also if you want it to
be done in a shorter simpler way you can
also just Ty you know like you don't if
you don't want to invest a lot of time
and if you don't want to complicate
things you just directly tell your chat
GPD the way you have to think right now
let me try that hi chat GPD just like
you're talking to your friend correct so
imagine you are an
experienced data
analyst a data
scientist having 10 plus years of
experience I need you to help me with
some
X
exploratory data
analysis correct okay you have built the
prompt now it is ready to understand
your requirements and also help you with
the Eda now okay let it give its report
or answer to my front let's not stop it
I think it's building itself out so it's
giving you some answer understand your
objectives okay we'll also give the
objectives let's say as discussed we can
also get the same objectives to it so
far so good Advanced analysis depending
on your objectives okay that sounds
pretty good now that we have cre the
foundation let's also give it the DAT
set so I'll give the Excel dat that we
previously discussed now I have this
objectives written in a clipboard let me
just quickly paste it so there we have
it help me with the exploration data
analysis on this data I'm looking for
the following inside sales Trend based
on month on month you can use a line
graph for that and uh region wise
different zones okay let's type it as
region different zones right different
regions and you can use a scatter plot
to give me an ed on sales versus profit
what was the impact and donut chart
subcategories yeah these are the ones
which I to explore and you can also add
on a different line in case if you
find anything more and you feel it could
be
critical in or
from a business
standpoint you can also let me know
about it just in case if you missed to
catch an important uh part of that
information Chad gbt is here to help you
brilliant right so that's my uh prompt
and that's my uh data View and
understanding of my objective so those
are my objectives so now let's quickly F
the square there you go done now just
wait it will give you everything that
you're looking for it might take a
little while but it's okay compared to
other parameters okay some error
analyzing it seems there was an issue
displaying okay it's again doing the
same thing it's trying to analyze
sometimes there might be some error in
the promp your writing or some some in
irregularity or some discrepancy that's
always you know to humanist error right
so let's try to give oneon-one
okay let me paste this here so uh there
you go we have received the answer from
chat gbd as a season data analyst okay
this was about the initial explanation
what we gave about chat GPT kind of a
Persona so here is the summary summary
statistics and initial observations so
sales performance analysis customer
insight
so you can also go through this
particular answer in detail most
importantly what matters to us is the
downloadable reports that it generated
for us so here's the first one according
to our request the monthly sales over
time so it has given us a line graph
followed by that it also gave us a
summary of statistical analysis there
you go and sales by category it also
gave us the sales by three categories
and subcategories sales by reasons it's
a completely detailed Insight that it
understood from the data and also gave
us the sales report so according to the
second request that we had these are the
ones bar graph from regionwise Sales
South Central East West and category
wise uh sales using a byy chart and
sales report this is the sales report
and the next one scatter plot so we
wanted to also analyze the impact of
discounts over profit so it also
generated as the scatter plot and it
also explains the observation it had so
there's a first step correlation High
variability in profit and outliners and
also some more insights so this is how
chat jpd premium version can be helpful
for you in a complete exploratory data
analysis for your dat sets and with that
