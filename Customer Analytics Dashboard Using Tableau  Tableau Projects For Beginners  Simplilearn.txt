below to find out a business analytics
program that fits your experience and
areas of Interest now without further
delay let's get started with the
customer analytics dashboard using T now
let us get back to the table dashboard
so here we have started the table public
and we will be creating a new workbook
right so for creating a new workbook you
might need the data right so we have a
lot of options here Microsoft Excel text
file Json Microsoft Access PDF spatial
file statistical file Etc right so we
will be working on a Microsoft Excel
file today and the data source that we
will be dealing with today is from
Amazon sales report from the year 20 and
21 so we have open kagle here and we
have here Amazon sales physical year
2020 and 2021 so we have order date
order ID status item Etc so we will be
having around 35 to 36 columns around in
this particular data set and it will
talk about multiple details about this
data right and I presume this has about
thousands of rows so seems like a good
data set to begin with now let's
download this particular data set and
begin working on that so here I've
already downloaded that particular data
set which is Amazon fy2 to 21 and I've
also extracted the same data set over
here so this is the data set that we
will be start ahead with that let's make
a copy of this and paste it in the Downs
folder and uh this is where we will be
accessing it let's change the data type
from CSV to a workbook and make some
minor data changes since we have the old
data
2021 it might seem a little old you can
just try to you know enhance The
Learning Experience just by changing the
dates so that you can have a feeling
that you are working on the latest data
sets right it can enhance your learning
experience so let's try to do that now
before we go ahead with that let's try
to save it as Excel work work save it
there you go and if you come back to
your month here yeah we have 2020 it
might take a little while because this
is a really huge data set for X so we
have 2020 copy so you can use find and
select
replace 2020 with 2022
maybe and replace all this will take a
little while you can see the cells being
getting replaced over here this will not
just only sell change the year value
here if you go to the month here you can
see that also is getting changed right
so both data types are month and date so
it might take a while and we will change
the 2021 number with 2023 it could be
you know give you an interesting feeling
that you're working on the latest data
set three lakh plus Replacements done so
pretty much this is a huge and good data
set to work with and now let's change
the year 2021 with
2023 replace all again it might take a
little while for
that so for being a data scientist you
need to know some of the data cleaning
operations to work with so for now I
presume the data is been completely
cleaned because I checked this
particular data set so I've already
worked on one of these data sets and uh
already created uh minor short um charts
and everything so I've checked this I've
cleaned the data set and everything but
if you are uh beginning with a new data
set trust me you need to know some of
the data cleaning activities where you
might have to prare some table
calculations you might have to write
some parameters you might have to create
some vins right so for example if you
have status over here and if you wanted
to perform some calculations on this
particular data set so this particular
status one will be into Dimensions but
not measures this is not a number let's
say you want you just have two values
here received or order cancelled right
you might want to create a new Tablo
parameter here and change the values to
one for received and zero for order
cancel right you might have to do some
calculations over there and then you can
drag that particular newly created
measure into the rows and columns and
create a new chart so you might have to
know some Tableau parameters Tableau
calculated fields and data cleaning
activities using some of the tools like
Excel so I would recommend Excel is U as
a good data cleaning tool which is Prett
it might take a while there you go we
have five L plus Replacements done
successfully and now I think you can get
started with the data you just quickly
save it as Amazon's FY 2021 and
2022 or we just made 2021
2023 and 2022 yeah that's the one okay
now everything is fine now you can just
quickly close this particular Excel file
because this might uh not be required in
the background you can just quickly have
a view of your data set on the table
window itself okay let's quickly save it
now and
close this particular Excel file and
don't worry for those who want to work
on this data set we will be leaving the
kagle link in the description box below
or if you want the exact same data set
that I am using right now after doing
some data cleaning activities that will
also be uploaded to our drive and we
will leave the Drive Link in the
description box below now let's go to a
new tblo window so this is my new tblo
window and uh let's quickly extract the
data from Excel file and go to downloads
I think it's here click on that
particular file just click open now it
might take a little while to load and
open that particular file because it
might have more than five lak rules as
we just made sure during the data
cleaning activity it might take a little
while yeah there you go we have loaded
the data
successfully elapsed at Time 5 seconds
for loading the preview that's given
some time let it take its own time and
work on
that yeah there you go the data set got
successfully loaded and here we have the
fields right so what are the column
headers we are having and what are the
you know we have the entire details of
that particular file over here which are
the measures which are the you know
Dimensions so where you can see an
alphabetical thing that comes under uh
dimensions and if you see a special
symbol like this one like a a symbol
that also comes in dimensions and if you
see a globe kind of symbol right where
you have this here country city state
and zip code these are also dimensions
and wherever you find a hash symbol that
is a measure which means it deals with
numbers and if you create a new
calculated field and you can recognize
that particular measure will be
indicated with a value equals to and
hashtag so you will have uh equal symbol
and hashtag symbol together which means
that that's a newly created calculated
field or user defined measures field
right and here you have some values in
your D set right some of might be blank
spaces like let's say you don't know the
C data cleaning operations let's say you
don't know Excel before we started off
with this particular video we discussed
about data cleaning let's say you don't
know to Cle data cleaning you don't know
the process of cleaning your data data
and there are some empty cells or empty
rows which you might want to get R but
you don't know how don't worry you just
load the data onto your tblo and the
tblo will have an option update now or
update automatically which will clear
off all the empty values or null values
or any of the invalid entries in your
data set and it will clean the entire
data for you so this is the data preview
that you can you come back any time and
look after and you can also have a good
look on your data C and try to create
your own storys right so here we have
various columns so we can create our own
stories or you can create your own ideas
what you want to expect or what you want
to create from this particular dat set
and get on with building your worksheets
and ultimately at the end we will
complete this particular sheets and we
will drag all those sheets onto one
single interactive dashboard on T so
that was the overview of this particular
tutorial today let's get started with
the first sheet here we have the first
sheet and let's go to the worksheet have
a very big data set right now here we
have uh the dimensions and here we have
the measures right we discussed about
this dimensions and measures now let's
get started so the first one we want to
create is region wise revenues so in
this particular data set we might have
about four to five regions in the United
States of America and we want to check
the region wise revenue for that just
drag regions to columns and here we have
Revenue named as total you can drag this
particular measure to row and you can
automatically see I did not even land
that particular field onto the rose it's
automatically considered as some
aggregation right it is calculating the
sum of total sales happened in each of
these regions and we have it here and if
you hold the control key or command key
and select that particular sum total and
drag it onto labels you will get the
labels what's the number of what's the
number of dollars or rupees or any based
on the area how much amount of Revenue
did you collect in individual regions
and if you drag this particular region
by holding control and land it onto
color you can see we will have
individual colors for individual regions
right there you go and you can name this
particular sheet as region wise
Revenue now we can create a new sheet
and here you can check the payment
methods done by various customers so you
can try to identify which is the highly
recommended or highly used payment
method for all the users we can use the
same sum tool and you can see a tableau
is automatically predicting the type of
chart you have a lot of charts available
here it is recommending you the best one
and in case if you are looking for any
modifications you can also do that and
now I would like to go with a pie chart
and it's here ready and you can see we
have a very small pie chart here that
can be changed you can just click on the
entire View and if you come back to uh
the tab over here you can see uh we can
add U the payment method onto the label
so that we can identify which kind of
payment has been done the most right and
you can also add U some total right
total value to label so that you can get
the you know numbers over here for a
better View view right you can also uh
do some uh detailing to this particular
chart right you can make some
modifications if you want we can change
the sheet name to
payment methods and you can see 42,000
it's 42 million 38 million 47 million so
bank alafa so this payment method from
bank alafa bank has been done the major
payment right so these are the things
you can uh make you know you can
consider and the next time you're you
know pushing some sale you can give an
offer out if you're paying from Bank ala
you can get some discount like say 5 10%
or if you want to boost some of the bank
payments let's say prounce settlements
here so we have a very less amount of
payments done you can also provide to
them if you're paying from Finance
settlement you can use some coupons
right so this is the way you can
identify and you can also provide some
insights to your you know uh higher
authorities now let's go on to the new
sheet and try to create a new one now
let's say we have a state here right you
can push down state and identify which
state has done the
maximum uh Revenue push it over here and
here you have it and if you want you can
create a map
click on the map and here you go and for
some reason I'm unable to get this
particular region over here maybe it is
because of the paid version since
Salesforce has taken over T I think uh
we might have some issues over here but
still this is how it works and uh I
think you can also get an option over
here to identify which particular state
has done what you can push the state
into the label option and you can get
get these labels here statewise
revenue and if you change it to this I
think you are getting over
here I think this should work for us we
can also get to know which state has
done what
right and now let's try to create a new
sheet now we can do another thing where
we can find out the monthon Monon sales
right you can just quickly drag this
particular month to
Rose and uh you can drag the total
revenue to columns and uh if you quickly
change these you can find out this
particular linear map and if you click
on plus you will get quarterly and if
you click on plus again you get monthly
sales so we don't want for you can just
drag it around we don't want that and if
you again to remove the year I think you
have month- on Monon sales over here and
if you want the data to be shown as
month you can quickly you know pull the
month to label here and it will give you
months there you go and you can also
change
colors
that's it and you can identify that uh
in the month of December we have a lot
of sales happening around USA so it's
due to the Christmas Eve right so uh
that's it and you can uh name it as
month on Monon revenue and now let's try
to create not a dashboard okay I think I
pressed on that wrong button we need a
new chart new worksheet and now we have
found out payment methods and uh status
right remember we had a lot of status
over there that's order cancel or
something like that let's see uh okay
before that we have another parameter
which was about category right we have
it in uh the dimensions here let's see
which category has highest sales or
which category has provided the highest
number of uh you know
Revenue you can identify we have mobiles
and tablets to provide the highest
number of Revenue you can also sort it
based on descending
order category
wise
Revenue there you
go and now let's try to
identify what category has highest
number of cancellations what category
has has highest number of gos deliv
right so let's quickly drag category
again to columns and Status two columns
and drag value and you can have a
detailed observation here change the
status based on cancellation and you can
drag status to color
there you go and try to arrange them in
descending order so highest number of
orders which were cancelled are from
mobile
applications completed are also from
mobiles and applications and received is
also from mobiles and applications good
so there you go we have uh category wise
status is
uploaded you can uh you know let know
the companies which are branding mobile
phones and tablets you can let them know
you can receive highest number of udit
but also be ready for highest number of
calculation cancellations from the
receivers now let's also discuss about
the discount percentage received from
every state so which was the state that
received the highest number of discount
percentage or highest discount amount
right you can uh take up anything maybe
ZIP code or yeah let's take the ZIP
code columns let's add all the numbers
you can also filter out based on your
requirement or if you don't want zip
code if that's confusing to you you can
just use city or state whichever you
want we also have City so let's go with
the state as
usual and add it into columns and
discount
amount can find
out
the highest discount was from California
Ca and if you want you can change the
uh
color and if you want to go with a new
type of chart you can also do
that
just push state to different colors and
there you have
it
right and if you just want to select one
single state let's say keep only this
can just directly get
that and if you want to select anything
else you can also do that state
wise
discounts that's it and let's also try
to create some more stories out of it
region wise discount value total or
quantity of orders so you can also try
to create a new
sheet highest
orders based on
region region
column quantity order to rows and you
can also put down category over there or
you can we have gender so we can
identify which gender was uh you know
keeping placing a lot of orders from
what region you can quickly
drag G and drop it to
columns there you go so uh you can
also drag the same gender onto color so
that you have some differentiation
between male and female and surprisingly
we have the west region to be leading in
the highest number of orders in the
female gender and just all the regions
have males ordering the highest number
of uh Goods so you can also dra Dr some
of quantity order to labels to know the
actual numbers there you go and let's
try to
calculate or let's try to
identify orders versus discounts so
let's try to identify if the discounts
are provided uh then does the amount of
orders or number of orders increase or
not right uh
discount this is orders right so now
we're taking the values from
the measures both the values of from
measures right in that situation you
might end up with some chat like this so
you might want to do some modifications
to your chart ask table to consider this
particular data set as a dimension and
this particular data as a dimension
again there you go you have some values
over there and and uh discount
percentage so it's considering from zero
you can change it you can go to
format R all
that
discrete go to filter and you can give
minimum percentage as 10% press okay
there you go and you can see whenever
there is a discount has been provided
you have a maximum ERS right so the
minimum 10% discount has been ordered
and one order was there and with the
increasing number of discounts here we
have 75% discount and the quantity Auto
is 31 three not 31 it's 371 there you go
so as the discount percentage got
increased the number of orders increased
that's good and uh let's let's try to
create some more stories out of
it so now let's try to calculate the you
know net gross and validity in valid so
uh you might want to know what is gross
so it's like the total amount of Revenue
spent or total amount of Revenue which
you collected and again net is something
which you get out after you know profits
and everything so let's try to calculate
that category wise so I will take the
total Value Place it in rows now that
particular data is available in the
column with the name
b standards and now let's pull
category you go you can sort
it push category to
Colors so that you have to different
colors or different categories right so
you have the data for gross amount net
amount inv valid you can even push some
total to label so that you can have
exact numbers over there that's pretty
much right
uh this is draw net and
valet category
wise there you go and now let's try to
find out what age groups are placing the
maximum number of
orders right now let's take the order
quantity to rows and I think we have age
somewhere in the
dimensions we have it in values
okay now we have a problem right so it's
taking as sum now you might want to
add it a
little if you go back to age here and
try to create some bins create a group
and uh the minimum bins let's give
10 okay so we have a new uh Dimension
created this was about the it right
initially when I was you know telling
you about the Ben and calculated Fields
this is about it so if we have the
measures and if you wanted to deal with
measures and uh then in those scenarios
you might want to make some
modifications to measures and improve or
create some calculated Fields bins
Tableau parameters and Etc to create a
new chart that you're looking for that's
exactly what we did here so we created a
age bracket and we created an AG B so
the age between 10 to 20 20 to 30 right
this is what we did and we have
okay let's hold control and label some
quantity order
to
colors you can also modify that if you
want so intensity of color provides that
highest number of orders made from that
particular age group right so I presume
the AGB 60 was making the highest number
of orders right so maybe their
grandparents who are trying to gift uh
their grandchildren and between age of
20 10 to 20 they purchasing the lease
and from 20 to 30 maybe they are
teenager you know youngsters which which
or parents they want to give their
children so that's what it is so we have
so far age okay let's name the sheet is
age wise so far we have uh few numbers
over here that's good now we can uh we
have some sh sheet over here we can
proceed with a new dashboard and then
now we can drag the sheets right and if
you want to change the dimension you can
also change the dimension let's go with
uh
maximum automatic
max if you want to increase it you can
also increase the you know
width there you go we have a perfect
canvas over here and you can push each
and every sheet onto the
you know dashboard and you can change
the way it looks like let's push the
payment and push it over here and then
go to state wise can also okay let's
push the region a little towards the end
right so if you want so these are the
filters right you if you want to look on
the data from middle west and for from a
particular payment method right you can
also get that we have payment method
statewise revenue regionwise
revenue and uh so we have region wise
payment and statewise now monthon Monon
Revenue let's check the month- on Monon
revenue and uh category
wise we have the category
wise or you can also if you want a
better look you can expand this right
you can do that
let's not do that we have a few more
sheets to add
right
uh state wise somewhere over
here highest orders somewhere
here discount versus uh orders place
here first net and AG
wise so that's how we created a new
interactive dashboard and if you click
on females and you get the only values
you want from the femals and if you
unselect that it happens and if you
scroll up your uh you know uh the
filters and if you want the numbers from
South Region you get that and if you
want to get the details of some Banker
laa you get here and if you want the
category wise sales let's say you want
to go with beauty and grooming products
you get the details over here
and you know that's how you create a
interactive customer analysis dashboard
using TBL and with that we have come to
an end of this session on the customer
analysis dashboard using TBL and if you
have any queries regarding any of the
topics covered in this session or if you
require any more uh insights from this
data set or if you feel like you need
