first understand the importance of an
internship

your first step towards the real world

domain you want to be operating in an
internship is an impeccable way to
dictate if the said domain is in fact

internship offer to launch your

our first tip to you is to contemplate
your qualifications and interests when
it comes to searching for an internship
one of the most common misconceptions
students have is they must bid to every
position that catches their eye to
increase their odds however instead of
doing this envision positions that might
be a better fit for you based on your
skills and education
for example if you have statistics as
your major then data science and tableau
are ideal domains for you to work on
after finalizing the domain you want to
work in the next crucial step in
securing an internship is to have a
well-crafted internship application
there are two key materials employers
ask for when it comes to internship
applications
the first one is a resume and the other
one is a cover letter
resumes are concise documents that
represent your personal information
education skills professional background
and extracurricular achievements you
need to have a good resume that catches
the recruiter's eye and one that sets
you apart from the other applicants

craft a cover letter a cover letter adds
auxiliary color and context to your
application

manifest your passion for the
opportunity and provide your adept
picture as a candidate
while writing a cover letter make sure
to research about the company to
showcase your knowledge of the
organization
explain why you think you are the best
fit for that specific job role and share
few propositions about how you would
contribute to the company if hired
