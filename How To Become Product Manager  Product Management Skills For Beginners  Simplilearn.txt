product from ideation to launch and
Beyond they basically act as a single
bridge between different teams such as
such as engineering design marketing and

let's understand each of the skills one
by one so guys our first skill is
strategic thinking so guys strategic

anticipate market trends set long-term
goals and align the product's Direction

they propos developing a smartwatch that
integrates health tracking communication
and entertainment features positioning
the company ahead of competitors so you

strategic thinking now let's understand
our second skill that is user Centric
design approach so guys a user Centric
design approach ensures that a product
is built around the needs and
preferences of its users this skill
requires empathy understanding of user
behavior and a commitment to solving
user problems by focusing on user
experience product managers can create
products that are not only functional
but are also delightful to use for
example guys a product manager at a bank
receives feedback that customers find
online banking app very confusing so
they conduct user interviews and
usability tests leading to redesign of
the app with simpler navigation and more
intuitive interface resulting in a
higher customer satisfaction so you can
see what is a task for a product manager
in the domain of user Centric approach
now let's move on and discuss our next
skill that is product life cycle
knowledge so guys product life cycle
knowledge involves understanding the
different stages of a product which goes
through for example introduction growth
maturity and decline each stage requires
different strategies for marketing
development and resource allocation the
skills helps product managers know when
to push for growth when to focus on
product maintenance and when to consider
consider phasing out a product for
example a product manager at a consumer
electronics company notices that a
popular smartphone model is reaching
Market saturation they decide to
introduce a new model with upgraded
features to keep the product line fresh
and maintain customer Interest next we
have the problem solving so guys problem
solving is the ability to identify
issues analyze the root cause and
develop effective Solutions the skill is
crucial for navigating the challenges
that arise during product development
and management effective problem solving
involves creativity analytical thinking
and the ability to make decisions Under
Pressure a product managers at a food
delivery company discovers that a
customers are frequently complaining
about the late deliveries and after
realizing the delivery process they
Implement A system that provides
realtime traffic updates to drive
reducing delays and improving customer
satisfaction so guys you can see this is
example which can be covered under
problem solving I hope so you getting a
where like how these skills are used by
product manager in their real-time job
so guys our next skill is prioritization
technique so guys prioritization is a
skill of determining what task of
features should be focused on first
based on their importance and impact
product managers often face competing
demands and effective prioritization
ensures that most critical tasks are
addressed in a timely manner they use
techniques like mosom method which means
must have should have could have won't
have have a rise reach impact confidence
effort these techniques can help in
making these decisions for example guys
a product manager for a social media app
has to choose between adding a new
feature for live video streaming or
improving the app security after
assessing the impact of both they
prioritize the security Improvement to
protect user data and build trust even
if it means delaying the new feature now
let us move on to our next skill that is
agile and scrub so guys agile and scrum
are the methodologies that promote
flexibility collaboration and iterative
development in product management agile
involves breaking down a project into
smaller and manageable Parts allowing
for continuous Improvement and a quick
responses to change scrum a specific
agile framework it uses time box Sprints
to achieve short-term goals with regular
reviews and adjustment for example guys
a product manager at a software company
uses scrum to manage development of a
new mobile app they work in two we
Sprints allowing the team to release
incremental updates gather user feedback
and make necessary adjustments before
the next Sprint next we have guys
performance metric analysis so guys
performance metric analysis involves
tracking and interpreting key data
points that indicate how well a product
is performing the skill is essential for
making data driven decisions and
optimizing the product metrics that
might include user engagement conversion
rates customer satisfaction or Revenue
growth growth for example guys a product
manager at Online subscription service
monitors customer retention rates when
they notice a decline they analyze the
data that find users are dropping off
and after a free trial they introduce
new feature and offer personalized
discounts to improve the retention so
guys this was how performance metrics
help in product management next let us
move on to effective communication so
guys effective communication is the
ability to clearly convey ideas
expectations and feedack back to various
stakeholders including team members
Executives and customers this skill
ensures that everyone involved in the
product development process is aligned
and working towards the same goals it
also involves active listening and the
ability to adapt messages to different
audiences for example guys a product
manager at a retail company regularly
updates the development team marketing
team and Company Executives on the
progress of a new e-commerce platform by
clearly communicating the timeline
challenges and next steps to ensure that
all the teams are coordinated and
working efficiently the next one that we
have all over here is stakeholder
management so guys stakeholder
management involves identifying engaging
and maintaining positive relationships
with all parties interested in the
product success this skill requires
balancing the needs and expectations of
different stakeholders including
customers team members investors and
Executives it is all about building
trust and ensuring that stakeholders are
kept informed and involved at
appropriate stages for example guys a
product manager developing a new
educational app involves teachers
students and parents in the design
process they give the feedback and
adjust product features to meet the
needs of all stakeholders ensuring broad
support for the app and finally we have
negotiation and conflict resolution so
guys negotiation and conflict resolution
involve finding mutually beneficial
Solutions when there are disagreements
or competing interests the skill is
vital for resolving conflicts within the
team with stakeholders or during
business negotiations a product manager
must be able to navigate the situation
diplomatically ensuring that the product
Success is Not compromised for example
guys a product manager at a
Manufacturing Company mediates a
conflict between a design team which
wants to use high quality materials and
the finance team which is concerned
about the cost they negotiate by
selecting materials that maintain
quality while staying within the budget
it ensures that the product remains both
affordable and wellmade so guys this was
the example which covers in negotiation
and conflict resolution so guys I hope
