hi everyone welcome to another video
tutorial on Python Programming by simply
learn in this video we are going to
learn about for Loops in python in the
previous video we learned about if
statements in Python but today we will
focus on for Loop in Python and look at
different code
examples so what is a for Loop in
Python a for Loop in Python is used to
iterate over the items or elements
present in a sequence the items present
in a sequence can be in the form of a
list tle dictionary or even a string a
for Loop in Python uses the range
function to iterate over a specific
number of
times now let's have a look at the
syntax of for Loop so here on the left
you can see the syntax of the for Loop
so we have the for keyword followed by
the iterator variable then we have the
keyword followed by the sequence it can
be a list you can use the range function
it can be a dictionary a tle anything
and after that you have your colon
followed by the statements that you want
to execute in the for
Loop and Below you have the rest of the
code and here on the right you can see
this is the flow chart of a for Loop so
you have for each item in sequence then
we check the condition if you have
reached the last item if that is true
you exit out of the loop but if it is
false you keep on running or executing
the statements that are present inside
the for Loop this will continue until
and unless you have reached the last
item in your
sequence
okay now let's head over to our jupyter
notebook where we'll see for Loop in
detail and we'll explore a lot of code
examples okay so here I am on my jupyter
notebook let's start by writing a simple
for Loop suppose I have a variable say s
and it has a value which is a string
let's say simply
loan okay
now the way to write a for Loop is I'll
say for I which is my iterator variable
it can be any valid variable name in
Python
in my variable that is
s so here s becomes my
sequence I'll say
print I so what this for Loop is going
to do is it will iterate over all the
characters that are present in my string
and print them one by one let me run it
by hitting shift enter you see here
using this for Loop we have iterated
over all the letters that were present
in my string that is simply learn and we
have printed them one by one okay
now the print function in Python
provides a parameter called end so by
default the value of the parameter is
back sln that is the new line character
now you can end a print statement with
any character or string using this
parameter which is end let me show you
what I meant so I'll again have my same
string simply
loan I'll say for I in
my variable or my sequence s I'll say
print I comma then I'll use my end
parameter equal to
and my end parameter will have a value
of
asteris now let me run this you can see
here this is sort of a pattern that we
have printed so between each letter in
my string simply learn we have an
ASX
okay moving
ahead let's see how to use for
Loop in a
list all
right I'll declare a list called
programming and this list will
contain a few programming languages
let's say we have Java and
then the next item we have in the list
is
python next we have Ruby and then we'll
have
HTML okay so I'm going to
print all the individual items that are
present in my list using the for Loop so
I'll use the same syntax I'll write for
this time I'll use my iterator variable
name as R which means
iterator for iterator or iter in my
sequence which is
programming I'll say
print
iter let's run it you see here we have
printed all the items in my list one by
one Java python Ruby and
HTML all right now let's see an example
how you can find the average of a list
of numbers using for Loop so I'll give
a comment saying find the average of
a list of
numbers okay so here first of all we'll
declare a list of numbers with variable
listor num equal to it will have a few
numbers let's say 20 25 10 50 and 40
let's make it
45 now to find the average of a list of
numbers first I'll declare a variable
called sum that will have a value of
zero so we have initialized the sum
variable to zero then I'll start my for
Loop for I in my sequence that is listor
num which is this
variable give a colon I'll write sum
equal to sum +
I so here just give a space to make it
more
readable so I'm adding all the numbers
in my list and we are storing the result
in the variable
sum then we'll say
print sum equal to
I'll pass in my variable that is sum
then I'll say
print
average equal
to now our average will be my variable
sum divided by the
length of my list that has all the
numbers let's run this you see here so a
total sum of all the numbers present
inside the list is
150 and the average of all this numbers
is 30 so 150 divided by 5 is
30 all
right now let's see how you can use a
for Loop using a
topple so let's declare a variable
called
num is going to a tle of
numbers and we have 30 45 60 50 and
let's say 70 as the numbers inside the
Tuple I'll say sum equal to
0 then we'll have our for Loop for I in
my sequence that is
num I'll say sum equal to sum plus I so
here we are just adding the the values
that are present inside the tle I'll say
print
sum so here you can see we
have
printed all the values present inside
the Tuple one below the other now if I
shift my print statement to here you can
see here this is my sum of all the
numbers that are present inside the
topple so make sure you have the current
indentation
now let's see how you can use the range
function in
Python okay so you can use the range
function to iterate over a range of
values or numbers using a for Loop the
way to do is I'll say for I in my
function range I'll give my first index
at one and my second index at or my end
index at 10 so this will go from 1 till
9 and exclude the 10th
index I'll say print I you see here for
I equal to range 1 to 10 we have printed
all the numbers starting from 1 till 9
so the last index that is 10 is
exclusive in the range
function now in the range function you
can also give a third parameter that
stands for step so that you can skip a
few steps and print the next value let
me show you what I mean say I write for
I in
range 0er which is my starting index 10
which is my end index and I'll have a
step size of
two give a colon I'll
say
print display
values with
uh
step size
of
two give a comma here and my variable
that is I let's print it there you go so
we have printed the values with
a gap of two so it starts from zero
then we are jumping two steps and then
we are printing two then again two steps
we have four 6 and 8 so we are skipping
one value and printing the next value in
my sequence ranging from 0 to
10 all right
now let's write a program to print a
table of a given number so I'll give a
comment
as program
to
print table of a given number all right
so I'll pass
my variable n which is going to be a
user input so I'm using the int function
and inside the int function I'll use the
input function to take the user input
I'll give my message as enter the number
I'll say for I in
range from 1 till
11 I'll
say multiply which is mul
here n ASX I so basically what I'm doing
here
is I'll take a user input of the number
let's say we want to print the table of
five so from
1 till 10 will have the product of the
numbers let me print it I'll say print n
comma within double quotes I'll give my
asteris comma
I
comma within double codes I'll say equal
to and then we'll have our
variable
mul let's run this enter the number I'll
give five and hit enter there you go so
here we have the multiplication table of
my number five so you say 5 into 1 which
is 5 5 into 2 is 10 then we have 5 into
7 35 5 into 9 is 45 then our last index
which ends at 10 so we have 5 into 10
that is 15
all
right this is how you can create a
simple multiplication table using for
Loop in
Python now we can also use the range
function with a sequence of items the
Len function can be combined with the
range function to iterate through a
sequence using indexing I'll show you an
example here let's say we have a list
called list two and here we have a list
of programming languages let's say
C++ you can either use a single quote or
a double code to represent the text
values in a list the next programming
language I have is
Java then let's say I have Python and we
have
R okay so I can write for I in range
here I can use the length function and
I'll say list two
give a colon then we'll
print
hello and I'll say list two of
I so what it does is my iterator will
iterate over the list of programming
languages I have here and it will keep
on iterating till the length of the list
and then I'm printing my message M as
hello and it will take each item from
the list using the index
number if I run it you can see here it
says hello C++ hello Java hello Python
and hello R
cool now let's see how you can use
nested for Loops in
Python I'll say nested for
loop as my comment let's say I have a
list of company name
my first company I have in my list is
Google let's say
apple
PWC and then we have
Uber so here I'll write for I
in
companies I'll say
print we will
display
each letter
of I'll say plus
I now I'll use my second for Loop sync
for letter in
I will print the
letter let's run it and see our result
there you go so here we have used two
for Loops so that becomes a nested for
Loop we have my outer for Loop and then
we have our inner for Loop so in the
outer for Loop we are just printing the
name of the company so here we see we
will display each letter of plus I which
stands for a company name Google so you
can see below we have displayed each
letter of Google using the inner for
Loop similarly we have for Apple you can
see a p e we have PWC and then we have
Uber so this is how you can
use multiple for Loops in
Python now let's see how you can use a
for loop with else Clause so I'll give a
comment for loop with else
Clause so I'll write for I in range 0a
10 comma I'll give a step size of
three I'll say print I and after this
python gives you the flexibility to use
an else
Clause after the for Loop so I'll write
else
print the loop
has
completed execution
so this is my message that we are going
to print after we have printed all
the elements that are present inside
this range function let's run it you can
see here we have
printed the value starting from zero
with a step size of three so we have 0 3
6 until 9 and then after that we have
our else block printed which has the
message the loop has completed
execution
cool now let me show you two
more important feature that you can use
while writing a for Loop one is called
the break statement the other one is
called the continue
statement so in Python you can break the
for Loop and end it before it has
actually run all the elements in the
itable using the break
statement so let me show you a simple
example if I write for just give a space
here I
in
range let's say from 1 to
10 I'll use an if condition saying if I
equal to equal to
6 then break and come out of the loop
next we'll print I so here what we are
doing essentially is we are iterating
over
all the values from 1 to 10 and whenever
the I value becomes six we come out of
the loop and
print all the values we have iterated so
far let me run it and we'll see the
result there you go so here our I value
started from 1 we printed 1 2 3 4 5 and
then our I value reached six then we use
the break statement to come out of the
loop all
right now you can also skip the
execution of further statements in the
for Loop during that iteration using the
Contin statement in Python so when a
continu statement is executed the for
Loop continues with the execution of the
next element in the iterable it does not
complete all the statements in the for
Loop body so again
we'll I'll give a
comment say
continue okay so I'll write for I in
range again from 1 to
10 give a colon I'll say
if my I
value is equal to equal to 6 then I'll
say
continue then we'll print
I let me run it and we'll see the result
okay so if you notice this output so we
have printed values from 1 to 5 and when
my I value became six we skipped
printing six and we moved on to the next
element in the itable which was seven
then we printed eight and nine so this
is how you can use the break and
continue statements in
Python all
right now we'll see a program to display
the total goals a player has scored so
here we are going to iterate over a
dictionary so I'll give a comment
program to
display the total goals uh player has
scored all right so first of all I'll
declare a variable saying player name
and let's see we have the player name as
Carmelo all
right I'll declare a dictionary called
goals and within curly braces I'll have
my
first player name
addition let's see addition has
scored 14 goals then we have let's
say
Burnet so Burnet is my key here and then
we'll have value in terms of goals let's
say three and then we have our third
player let's say
Carmelo and and Carmelo has scored let's
say seven
goals now I'm going to write my for Loop
so I'll write
for my itable name here is player in my
sequence name is goals so I'll
say
Goals I'm going to check
if my
player is equal to equal to player name
I'll say
print the goals scored by the player so
I'll pass my dictionary name and within
square brackets I'll say
player let's use the break
statement and then I'll say
else will print
my message would be no player
with that
name
found let's run and see the
result all right so here what we did was
initially I declared a variable called
player name that had the value Carmelo
and since Carmelo was present inside my
dictionary named ghouls you can see here
we have Carmelo who had SC seven goals
so I iterated
over my sequence goals and I checked if
my I trator that is player is equal to
equal to the player name which is
Carmelo since this carelo is present
inside my dictionary name so we printed
the goals that were scored by Carmelo
that is seven now let's say I changeed
this player name to we have let's say
Messi now since Messi is not present
inside my my dictionary goals if I run
this it will print no player with that
name found the reason being message is
not present
inside my dictionary called
goals
cool
now we'll see two more
examples this time we are going to print
the cube
of numbers using for Loop
all right so first of all I declare a
list which will have a list of numbers
let's say 2 5 7 4 8 and let's say
six
then I'll pass in a empty list so I'll
declare within empty square brackets
I'll say for I
in my sequence name that is num
I'm going to use my empty list Cube and
Then followed by the append
function and inside the append function
we'll have
our cubes of the number so I'll write
I I'll use the double asteris
operator and then I'll say
three after that we are going to
print my list name that is
Cube let's run it there you go so you
can see
here first we
have the list of the numbers here and
then we have printed the cubes of these
numbers in a pattern let's say
I bring this print statement here and
I'll run it again now this is much more
readable you have 2 Cub is 8 5 cube is
125 7 cube is
343 the and 4 cube is 64 8 Cub is 512 6
Cub is
216 all
right now coming to the last example in
our demo section of this for Loops in
Python video we'll write a program to
print a pattern I'll say pattern
printing all
right so we are going to
print a right angle
triangle for that I'm going to take my
first variable called n which is going
to
be a user input to enter the number of
rows so using the input function I am
passing the message enter
the number
of
rows I'll say for I
in range zero till my user input
[Music]
n give a
colon I'll use my inner for
Loop this is going to be the number of
columns so I'll say for J in
range 0
comma I +
1 give a
colon and
and I'll
print my star pattern so I'm using
asteris and I'll use my end
parameter I'll have my double
quotations and
then we'll
say
print the
pattern so here what I'm doing is I'm
taking the number of rows from the
user and I'm
iterating from zero till n which is my
user input and then we are assigning
another for Loop for the number of rows
so that ranges from 0 till I + 1 then
I'm printing my
star let's run it and see the output
let's say I'll enter the number of rows
as six if I hit enter you can see here
we have our right angle triangle printed
here so initially
my I value is zero so here my J value
becomes from 0 till 1 so we have just
one star
printed in the next iteration my I value
becomes 1 so
from 0 to 1 + 1 that is we have two
stars printed the next iteration my I
value becomes 2 so 2 + 1 is 3 again so
we have three columns here so three
stars printed so on and so forth all
right so with that we have come to the
