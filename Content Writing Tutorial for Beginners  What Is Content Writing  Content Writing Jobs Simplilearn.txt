about content marketing of which content
writing is an important part did you
know that the content marketing industry
is worth more than $400
billion which is going to grow to close

quite impressive numbers yeah among
buyers of B2B products and services more
than 90% consider content to be
worthwhile when they evaluate any
business so we spend on average seven
hours per day consuming digital content
and a lot of this content is being
consumed on blogs did you know that
there are over 500 million blogs on the
internet and on WordPress about 70
million blog posts are published each
month so these are incredible numbers
and we're going to be talking about that
yeah in this section in this module
we're going to be talking about a very
important part of content marketing
which is the actual creation of content
particularly when it comes to writing
right so let's get started what are we
going to be talking about in this video
we are going to be talking about many
things in the content marketing industry
did you know that content writing is one
of the fastest changing areas of content
marketing now you may wonder what let me
give you the answer to this that is
mainly because of developments in
artificial
intelligence if you use AI or artificial
intelligence tools you actually no
longer have to write the content you let
those tools write the content for you
and the only thing you will have to do
is to edit the end um the output of the
AI tool later I'm going to share some AI
tools with you that you can be using for
Content writing but to understand these
new tools it is important that you
understand the basics of content writing
so in this video we will look at what is
content
writing why proper content writing is
important we'll look at the different
types of content that you can write for
we'll look at how to write proper
content and that is a skill in itself
and I'm going to close with write giving
you some content writing tips and in the
process of going through these uh topics
I will be sharing with you some
interesting content writing tools as
well so let's start at the beginning
what is content writing many people when
they think about content writing they
think about writing an article however
writing content isn't just in for a Blog
yeah it is for many many topics many
other areas that you can write for you
can write for many different areas you
can write a script for your video you
can write for your email newsletter you
can write for the pages of your website
you maybe have to write a keynote speech
maybe for your social media posts you
have to write titles for your podcast
for your videos maybe you're going to
produce a white paper that you need to
write for or an ebook landing pages are
very important content that you have to
write for it could be the descriptions
for your videos remember we talked about
YouTube SEO and we talked about how
important the description of your video
is and writing for SEO purposes we
talked about that in other videos as
well put it in another way writing is
the foundation for pretty much any
content that you
publish so what then is content writing
content writing as we say on the slide
is the process of planning writing and
editing web content typically for
digital marketing
purposes so it can include writing a
blog post and articles a script for your
videos it could be writing the show
notes for your podcast and it can also
be content for specific social media
platforms the thing they have in common
you have to write it before you can
publish it and that is where the
challenges in content writing you need
to know how to write and many people
they don't think they know how to write
well for those people who are afraid of
writing content rest assured after after
this video you will be a lot less
anxious to get your pen or keyboard and
put your creative ideas on paper or on
the screen yes so that is what the basic
essence of content writing is now
remember content writing is not just for
a blog post as I mentioned earlier
content writing touches every aspect of
your digital marketing without good
written content your digital marketing
strategy will fail because it's the
content that will connect your readers
with you and that content that features
everywhere in your digital marketing and
I can't emphasize this enough I
mentioned that before it is on your blog
post it's on your video script it's in
your email newsletters it's in your
podcast title it's in your landing pages
in your YouTube video descriptions there
are so many places where your content
will feature and you can replicate the
content across those different platforms
so written once for one medium doesn't
mean you can't use it on other medium so
what is the goal then of content
marketing the goal of good writing of
content writing is to connect your
readers with your business and in such a
way that you communicate your message
effectively and efficiently and the
better you're able to do this the more
likely the reader will engage with you
so it's that engagement that turns into
trust and into loyalty so let me give
you an example you know the Michelin
tires in the early 1900s the Michelin
Brothers they started supplying nomatic
tires to automobiles in France now
automobiles were mainly used in Paris
and of course the michion and brothers
they wanted to sell their tires to more
automobile users to more car users
across the country cars weren't that
popular yet but they wanted to give it a
push so people would take their cars to
the countryside so michelan knew that to
grow their business to had to get they
had to get people to drive their cars
outside Paris and that's when the
Michelin guide was born yeah a book that
contained the rating systems for
restaurants all over France and also
included information about roads across
France where to find gas stations about
hotels and of course information about
how to replace flat tires or how to
repair them and other uh important facts
about using a car so this early example
of content marketing became a huge
success and they were able to build a
global brand based on the Michelin guide
and the Michelin guide is still being
used today so having talked about this
what is content marketing why then is it
so important let's have a talk about
that yeah the essence of content
marketing as I said earlier is to guide
the customer or your prospect through
their buying Journey yeah and content
writing is key to this remember your
content that you sh give to people or
share with people people when they don't
even know that they want to where they
want to go on a vacation for instance is
different than when they have already
made up their mind of going on a beach
vacation in uh in Barcelona yeah if I
don't know what vacation I want I want
to find content about what are holiday
uh Beach holidays what are city breaks
what are Adventure holidays yeah if I
know what I want to do where I want to
go then I want to know informa content I
want to see content about Barcelona
about hotels in Barcelona about what you
can do during Beach vacations yeah so
it's very important that your content
drives your customer or your prospect
through that buying Journey so you
create content for awareness purposes
great content that will go viral and
reach as many people as possible by
creating well informed well- written
well entertained ained and useful
content it will drive traffic to your
website and you will appear higher in
search engine
rankings next your content has to convey
information yeah where you capture those
in a Content those people that have seen
your content you want to make sure that
they want to see more of your content
yes so you need to give them information
that will persuade them to take a
certain action I want to download an
ebook or I want to know more information
about something I want to sign up for a
newsletter or sign up for a webinar or
simply buy your product or service in
doing that you use your content to turn
awareness into interest which will lead
to more sales and will lead to referrals
it's a very simple and effective process
in marketing terms we call this inbound
marketing where you're going to reach as
many people as possible online who will
then if they're interested come back to
you and engage with you as opposed to
outbound marketing where you will go and
get a list of telephone numbers and your
salesperson will call everybody one at a
time with a script now that script needs
to be written as well in fact that is
also content writing yeah but inbound
marketing is a much more coste efficient
way way of generating leads for thiss
for businesses these days so to
summarize instead of reaching out to
individual prospects you publish really
good content that drives traffic to your
website which will lead to more leads
and ultimately will lead to more sales
so let's talk about the types of content
and the types of content formats now
when people think about digital content
they mostly think about content for your
website
which is the text they see on the web
pages now that's very important but
there's a lot more to that let me show
you an infographic that puts content
writing into a
perspective yep so that is different
types of content so here is we'll share
the link to this in the um in the
description but here you see the
different types of content that can be
written for you have Tech teal writing
you have press release right writing
report writing and research writing SEO
content writing marketing and
communication writing instructional
design
writing CSR writing for social courses
editorial and publication writing
feature writing ghost writing is a form
of content writing as well where you
write for somebody else business
writing copywriting that is an
interesting form of writing yeah where
you look at um really competitive um uh
creativity that you need to create get
to have very strong headlines for
instance so a lot of different types of
content that you can be writing for so
let's focus on the different types that
we can use particularly for marketing
yeah let me go back to the slides
yeah so here is a summary of the
different types when it comes to e-
marketing we're looking at articles yeah
these are pieces that can be published
in a newspaper in a magazine or in an
online publication yep and that is a
very common type of content that can be
written for and that you will use for
your marketing purposes they can be the
traditional content like brocher or
product descriptions yes so a brocher is
like an advertising piece that include a
template a booklet or a leflet and they
have information about your products
about your services of course as your
differentiators and how people can reach
out to you so that is an important part
of content as well then a very important
part of content is content for your
website you had the pages on your
website the content in your website
needs to be written each page needs to
be written yeah there need to be written
what you see but also kind of needs to
be written what you don't see but what
the search engine
um spiders will see and that's of course
when we talk about search engine
optimization very important you write
content for emails like email
newsletters yeah or it could be just
email campaigns very important part you
have your headers or your titles of your
emails you have the description the
summary of your
emails press releases has been a a long
sort of uh type very important part of
content that we've been written for many
many years yeah where in the early pre-
internet days press releases were one of
the most important documents to reach
out to journalists now press releases
are just another type of content that
you can share with your uh your audience
and then finally ebooks is a very
important type of content ebooks were
also we call those lead magnets yeah
they are fantastic for adding to your
website where people when they're
interested can download them so that's
where the magnet comes in people are
interested they click on download to
ebook but before they download they have
to give them they have to enter their
email address and or their telephone
number so very important different types
of content that you can be focusing
on so here is the big question can
everybody write good
content yeah so a lot of people think oh
no I'm not good in writing so I need to
get a copywriter in now before I can
answer the question if everybody is good
in proper in content writing let's
discuss the difference between
copywriting and content writing often
they will overlap yeah and many writers
they act as both a copywriter and a
Content writer but then well there is a
difference it's a very subtle difference
copywriters usually focus on persuading
readers in selling a brand it's often
short form it appears on ads on products
on taglines and similar types of
marketing copy so it's short it's punchy
it's capturing the essence in a couple
of statements that's often what we call
copywriting content writing is usually
for longer form content focusing on
informing educating or entertaining the
readers it's content as we said earlier
that takes the reader through their
buying Journey so while it's true that
anyone can write it's not enough to just
put the words on a
page cont content writers and
copywriters must craft something
compelling something original something
engaging and ultimately something well
written and when you're able to do that
of course the quality when you're able
to do that producing high quality
content the benefits are huge yeah it
gives you something to use across all
your marketing channels yeah so you can
turn a blog post into an Instagram post
into a Facebook post into a tweet into a
blog post on LinkedIn yeah so lots of
different things that you can do with a
good piece of content good content
really helps you with search engine
optimization Google will reward you for
having new fresh content on your website
by giving you a higher search ranking
good content helps you establish your
Authority in your your in your Niche or
in your industry
thereby it helps you in establishing
your brand and also good content will go
viral it will go wide it will reach many
people and that means it will reach
potentially new customers so very
important to think about these benefits
that you will get from good proper
content writing and as I said everybody
can write content but your challenge is
to make sure your cop your copy that you
write is compelling original engaging
and ultimately well written but as I
mentioned earlier there are many tools
now and particularly in the artificial
intelligence field that can help you in
to turn boring content into very
exciting content so let me give you some
tips on how to write exciting content or
as I like to call it killer
content the first thing you need to do
is to Define your target
audience yeah who are you writing for do
you understand their needs do you
understand their interest do you
understand their
pains yeah a an ebook for a marketing
director will be different than an ebook
for a finance director so you need to
know who you're writing
for in digital marketing terms we talk
about customer personas yeah you need to
Define to create your customer personas
and here is a tool that I like to share
with you it is a tool from HubSpot make
my personas in HubSpot it talks about
what is a Persona what is a buyer
Persona you can learn about it but here
you also see build my Persona yeah so if
you click on that it takes you through a
simple process in a walkthrough mode
where you can create your own customer
personas you can also skip the
walkthrough mode and then here you see a
typical Persona the name job title age
their level of Education what social
networks are they using what is their
preferred method of communication what
are their responsibilities
what are their goals and objectives what
are their pain points their challenges
you do this for your most important
customers so if you're selling to
marketing directors this could be
marketing Jill yeah or Finance directors
it could be Finance Joe or Finance Mark
or if you're talking to women with
children who buy shoes yeah then it
could be um
uh family Jane yeah so very important to
create customer personas once you've
created those customer personas you're
going to look at your next step it's
where you're going to choose a topic
when you choose a topic you find a topic
that you're going to write about that is
relevant for your audience and it aligns
with your business and your organization
ation goals a really good tool that you
can use here to write proper content is
a tool called Google Trend Google Trends
yeah it helps you explore what the world
is searching for so let's say I'm going
to write an article about remote working
yeah then here I see the trends I want
the trends
worldwide and here I can see give me the
trends for for the past let's say 2004
till present and here I can see the
trends in the term remote working from
2004 to
2023 now these are the volumes of people
searching for the term remote working
and interesting that you can see here as
well how it develops and here you see
take for instance this Spike where did
this Spike come from guess what this was
the start of covid yeah so there was an
searge in people that had to start
working remotely and you see that it
keep finding you see that in the results
on Google Trends as well if this trend
would go down yeah so take for instance
a term like
um video recorder yep and we're going
back to Global worldwide and we're going
to do from 2004 till present yeah so you
see clearly very popular in the 200 10
but you don't want to write about video
recorders today because it is a dead
topic okay so that is the power of
Google search a very good tool to check
the topics that you want to write for
are they gaining are they popular are
they gaining in popular
or are they going down in popularity
once you've decided on your topic you're
going to do the next thing and you're
going to research the topic yeah so
you're going to gather information about
your topic from reliable
sources yeah you're going to check if
there is other people writing about the
topic can you learn from that can you
get some ideas from that so you can form
your own own opinion before you start
writing the content a really good tool
that you can use for this is a tool
called bus
Sumo in bus Sumo you can just analyze
content that has been published on the
internet yeah so let's look at working
or remote working yeah when I'm going to
search for that then bus Sumo is going
to give me an analysis of the most
popular articles on the internet at this
moment about the topic remote working
yeah you see how much engagement the
topic gets how many shares on Facebook
how much engagement on Reddit number of
links and here you see the total
engagement of that article yes so very
good to research articles if because if
this is a very popular article that and
you may want to read the article and get
ideas from that article okay so that is
how you analyze content the next thing
you're going to do once you've analyzed
the content you are or and conducted a
research you're going to create an
outline yeah so you're going to come up
with ideas you're going to look at the
structure of your content you're going
to look at the topics of your content
you're going to get some ideas about
titles for your content once you have
that outline like say five or six
bullets it helps you to stay focused and
make sure that your content flows
logically now and this is where
artificial intelligence comes in yeah
this is where you can use tools to help
you in creating that outline a really
good and easy tool to use here is a tool
called simplified doc
yeah in simplified.svg
a new document let me show you I'm not
going to demo the whole product but here
you can see the flow that you will go
through so the first thing you want blog
titles and
ideas yeah and there are templates that
I can pick for this yeah the topic is
going to be let's say uh remote
working yep and now I'm going to just
click generate and the tool is now going
to generate block titles for me yes so
seven ways to make remote working a
success for you and your company the top
10 benefits of working remotely eight
steps for a successful remote working
setup the benefits of working remotely
Etc so let's take for
instance um sort of the top 10 benefits
of working remotely what I'm going to do
I'm going to add this to my article
there we have it number one yeah and if
you look at the topics here here it can
also create your blog introduction the
section completer a conclusion paragraph
it can even put it into the um the
customer buying Journey framework so it
is unbelievable what these type of AIS
AI tools can do for you another very
powerful a very simple product that I
often use is a tool called
quillbot if I go to quillbot it's a
paraphrasing tool yeah and this is free
you can use standard and fluency for
free you just type in or paste the piece
of text that you want to rewrite and
then you click paraphrase yeah you can
increase the number of synonyms you can
make it fluent formal simple creative
expand and shorten the text a very
simple but powerful tool to paraphrase
content so watch this space yeah the um
artificial intelligence is taking the
digital marketing World by storm okay
once you've got your outline written
you're then going to write a very
compelling headline writing the
compelling headline is probably one of
the most important parts of your
copyrighting that people will
remember yeah so and that that headline
must summarize what the content is all
about but also it should grab people's
attention now there are many tools that
you can use to check your title yeah and
just search for tool to check title yeah
and then you will come up with a whole
selection of tools that you can use for
this also think about the paragraphs and
the bullet points it's very important to
break your content into short paragraphs
and to use bullet points to make it
easier for people to read and to scan
your article there's another reason why
short paragraphs and bullet points are
so important Google likes them and
particularly when it comes to um to
mobile search where Google needs to
place short content as answers to
queries that people have they prefer to
have bulleted content to actually use
for answering queries that people have
so finally there are a few more tips we
have subheadings subheadings are very
important and formatting is important
yeah headings are the first level of
your writing Masterpiece yeah so
headings is sort of the title of your
document they introduced a topic they
introduced a paragraph So The Heading
let the reader know where they are in
the document or the blog post they can
also include keywords yeah that relate
to the topic and again that's good for
your search optimization The Heading is
an essential part of the content that
you're writing because it tells the
reader what to expect from that piece of
text subheadings are the second level of
a document they introduce a topic or a
paragraph their function is to break up
longer sections into small
more manageable pieces sing give it as a
bullet point under your heading so
headings and subheadings are the sign
posts of your content they indicate the
summary of a section written under a
heading or subheading so it helps people
to quickly understand the section that
is following and then of course the
formatting is important to let pieces of
content come out as well like bold
italics underlining using different
colors that can make your content more
visually
appealing right so now that we looked at
how you can write proper content yeah
the mo the final piece is of course to
edit and proof read and proof read and
edit yes so constant editing is very
important you may want to have multiple
people contributing to your document
yeah so very useful to ask your
colleagues to have a look at the
document and maybe add their comments
add their ideas to the um the content as
well and then when your final piece is
ready make sure that before you publish
it you proofread it for spelling and
grammar
errors yeah and that's where word
processors these days of course they all
have spelling checkers so that's the
minimum you should do is to have a
spelling checker go through your
document now typos are very easy to miss
when you check it on your screen so my
advice is to print your
document yep and then read it on paper
that will give you a different view of
your document and you will see that you
often take out typos if it is a shorter
document a very powerful way to proof
read is to read it backwards yeah
because when you're reading it backwards
you're not thinking ahead of what the
sentence actually will be but you're
just analyzing each word by
itself good so that is all about writing
proper content let me close today's
session with some particular content
writing tips first of all not know your
purpose we talked about that make sure
that you know what you're writing you
know who you're writing it for do you
want your content to inform do you want
it to convince do you want it to
entertain yeah so what is your content
going to be about and who is it going to
be for so know your
purpose I always use a very simple
acronym kiss
keep it
simple sometimes I keep I use kiss with
two s's keep it simple and stupid use
Clear concise language and avoid jargon
or technical terms that may be confusing
to your audience ask your mom to read it
because if she doesn't understand it
then maybe some of your customers may
not understand it very simple to very
important to keep it simple and since
you're so involved in your product and
services for you the technical terms are
day-to-day language for your readers
they are probably not day-to-day
language use active voice yes so writing
active voice makes your content more
engaging yeah so it is you're not
talking about that day the people of our
company decided but you say that day we
decided yes so use terms like we like us
in your document so use the active voice
that makes it much easier to engage with
use images and media of course text is
the core element of your content writing
but you can spice up your document with
images and media or videos and other
forms of media
make it visually appealing people read
but people will remember what they see
and people will remember what they hear
so yes your content writing is important
but is up with good video good
images and other forms of media yeah now
when you use images or photos make sure
that you're using
royaltyfree video or photos or that you
pay royalties on the photos that you
want to use there's no better F images
to use than your own images yeah so use
your own photos do a photo shoot for
your products and create your own
library of photos if you want to use
royaltyfree photos one of my favorite
tools for that is a tool called
gratisography in gratisography there's
truly unique usually Whimsy photos
photos so they are slightly different
than the photos you would get from the
traditional uh photo
libraries yep so be aware make sure that
you use quoto photos of the best content
in your um in your content that you're
that you're
creating use formatting to your
advantage we talked about formatting use
headings bullet points Bolding color can
make it a lot easier to read so use that
to your advantage and then use the
storytelling technique now
storytelling is a term that has come
into
marketing a number of years ago
particularly when everybody started
talking about content marketing people
are naturally drawn to stories yeah and
there are lots of techniques that you
can use
to create stories to make your content
more engaging and more memorable so
storytelling is a concept that is now
adopted by most brands yeah that are
online because again people will
remember good stories so let me give you
my five C's of Storytelling the first C
is the Sea of circumstance so when you
create your content write the C
circumstance write the environment write
the situation that you're trying to
describe to
portray the next C is the SE for
curiosity people are curious so address
this curiosity feeling put questions
make people curious about the answers
that you're going to give them yes so
curiosity is a very important part of
your
storytelling the next SEA is the Sea of
characters people identify with
characters if you create a character in
your story use a character whether it's
a hero whether it's a villain yeah then
people will identify with those
characters and they often remember those
characters those characters have
conversations and that is the fifth the
fourth C of Storytelling people have
conversation so let your characters tell
stories have conversations with other
people and then the final sea is the Sea
of conflict and to me that is one of the
most powerful aspects of Storytelling it
is conflict every good story has a
conflict good movies have a hero and
have a villain good movies have
adversity and have good luck or have a
um a world without the adversity yeah so
it's conflict it is um two sides of the
of the coin yeah it's positive it's
negative it's here it's there so create
that conflict in your story one of the
companies that uses con um storytelling
at its best is a company
called Arab BNB you may have booked
through Airbnb but Airbnb is fantastic
in storytelling so here is a section of
their website it's called Airbnb
experiences Unforgettable activities
hosted by locals so this is where local
people who are having their
Airbnb
on who are having their
house or their Chalet or their um condo
on Airbnb where they share their stories
of things to do in the
environment that they um where they will
rent the house so very powerful in
content marketing and in storytelling so
have a look at this it is really good
okay so that is the telling your story
as a very important part of your content
marketing so the next thing you want to
focus in on is making sure that your
content has very strong goals to action
when people read your content make sure
that they have somewhere where they can
click to go to the next step yeah could
be registering for a newsletter signing
up for a a webinar
or getting more information or
downloading an
ebook goals to action are vital in
digital marketing because in the end you
want your reader to become a
customer and then it goes without saying
make sure that you have a consistent
tone and style throughout your content
so we call this a house style so many
Brands before they start creating
content they have a document which
summarizes their house style their tone
of voice their visual identity the
colors that they're using the fonts
they're using how you can use the logo
Etc it's all about creating a cohesive
and professional image and then there's
two more tips that I want to share with
you before we wrap up up make sure that
you keep your content up to date yeah
there's various reasons why you want to
do that to make sure that your customers
when they read your content read the
latest and the greatest second it helps
you to put new life in your document if
new things have happened in your
industry add it to your document and
republish it again so it meanss it means
that your document remains relevant is
accurate and Google like that as well
and then
finally as part of your storytelling use
examples and use anecdotes use real life
examples to help illustrating your
points to make your content more
relatable and more engaging and that is
where storytelling comes in that's where
your conversations come in that's where
your characters come in and often

talk about your product and can give you
examples in the content that you are
writing and that is a wrap yeah that's
