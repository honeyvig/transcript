hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about indirect function in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is indirect function in
excel now what is indirect function in
excel so the name itself come repeat so
the name itself conveys that it is
something
like a reference function right so it
refers to a cell which is present in a
particular sheet or the current sheet or
it refers to a particular range in the
current sheet or it can also refer to an
entire workbook in a current window
right so you can stay here on the sheet
number one and you can refer something
which is present on the sheet number 10
or 11. you can stay in this current
workbook and refer to something which is
around in a different workbook
altogether so that's exactly how the
indirect function in excel works okay so
i guess the definition was a little uh
difficult to get let me show you a
simple demo here so that it becomes a
little easier for you
so currently i'm in the cell number a
two right now here i will implement the
indirect function
press tab to select it and now i'll
refer to the cell
c2
and let's enter and there you go let me
properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so
equals to indirect and press tab to
select
now i'll be selecting the cell c2 and
inside c2 we have
e2 address
now the formula is fine i have
implemented the indirect function and
selected the cell e2 and now if i press
enter see the magic
there you go so in the cell e2 we have
the text hello world so when i use the
indirect function to refer which is
something in c2 it is indirectly
referring to another cell address that
is e2 which has the text hello world
now this one was a little pretty simpler
now let's check some complicated ones
and we'll move to sheet number one
here we have some student names and
their
you know
marks on the individual subjects that is
math science english computer science
and here and here you can see i'm
selecting the student names and
accordingly i'm getting their average
score and the total marks obtained right
seems interesting how did i do this so
this is done exactly using the indirect
function so let's do it again
so this is how you do it now here i will
be using
okay before we get into this uh we need
to do some fundamentals before we do it
right so the fundamentals are you need
to name your individual columns so here
i have brian and his marks so i'll
select entire marks of brian
ranging from b2 to b4 right click and
here you can see define name
and i'll be naming it as brian
it's already named we might get an error
so it's already name okay let's add
another one maybe
uh
jennifer
let's cancel this
so let's
add
jenny
and her marks will be 96
87 i'm selecting some random numbers
here
so 87
so
we have the new column here now we need
to name this column define a name and
it's general so excel has automatically
selected the name for this column so
let's press ok now we have our columns
ready now here if you see the drop down
we have amy banner brian brock emily
jenny john everyone over here right so
the columns are named the individual
columns are named so now the student
name so here you can use some simple
trick called data validation here select
the data option in the toolbar navigate
to data tools here select data
validation
and in this instead of any value select
list
and here give the source as
this particular set
press okay so that you get the drop down
menu over here you can also type the
individual names again when you type the
individual names you might go wrong with
the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so
here the average will be
equals to average
press tab to select now the indirect
function
indirect of
the cell address
and close the bracket first you might
get an error because currently it is
empty so select some name and you will
get your average score now same thing
applies to
you know total
you can press the sum function select
the sum function
and
type in the indirect function
and
the cell
be 11 close the brackets
and press enter so that's how you do it
so that's how you can implement indirect
function in excel with that we have come
to an end of this session on indirect
function in excel hope this session was
