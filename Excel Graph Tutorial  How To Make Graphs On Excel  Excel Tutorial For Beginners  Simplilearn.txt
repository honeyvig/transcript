one point agenda that is how to create
graph in excel now for this let's get
back to excel and look at some data
so now we are on excel let me expand my
screen a little bit
so if you look at my screen we have two
different columns one column is about
the years and the second column is about
the revenue now what we want to do is we
want to create a line graph where we
have year on the x-axis and revenue on
the y-axis and we will be generating a
line graph based on the data we have now
for that we have to select the entire
data what we have then we need to go
into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chat
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option select that and here
you can see 2d line graphs
now let's select the first one and there
you go you have the line chart here now
let's rename the title
and there is one problem with the chart
here you can see that the x-axis is not
actually pointing
the ears you can make a change to that
no worries
just right click
and then you can see the select date
option and there you go you have
the edit option here just edit it and
now select the range
i am selecting the ears now
let's select okay and there you go
you have the ears here you can just try
to expand it a little more
yeah
so now you have the
revenue on the y axis and year on the x
axis and this shows the growth of
revenue in your company so this is how
you create a line graph in excel so with
