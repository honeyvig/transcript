Network models before the data is ready
for its transmission over the network
channel it is important to process the
data with a specified services to reach
proper transmission standards and this
task is handled by the data link layer
of the OSI model hey everyone today we
will be learning everything that you
need to know about the data link layer
in the OSI model but before we begin if
you love watching similar Tech content
then subscribe to Simply learn and hit
the Bell so you are the first to get
notified when we host now without
further Ado let's begin with the plan
for today's session
first we will have a quick recap on the
OSI model then we will dive deep into
the core topic which is about the data
link layer moving on we will have a
detailed understanding of the major
functions of the data link layer finally
we will wrap up the session by
discussing the sub layers of the data
link in the OSI model let's get started
with the first heading what is the OSI
model
foreign
model stands for open system
interconnection Model A specifically
designed set of protocols and standards
governing the data's modeling and
conversion for proper transmission
The OSI model is divided into seven
layers which perform specific functions
and apply protocols to maintain data
quality without any error now let's move
on to the main topic for today's session
which is about what is the physical
layer
foreign
layer is responsible for maintaining and
terminating the established connection
between the devices over the network it
has two sub-layers the first one is the
medium access control which uses the Mac
addresses from the devices to transfer
data between them the second layer is
The Logical link layer which identifies
checks flow control and performs the
error check for the transmitted data
advancing let's take a look at the
functions provided by the data link
layer
but before we begin let's understand the
data flow between the data link layer
and other layers in the OSI model that
is to begin with the network layer we'll
share the data packets with the data
link layer the data link layer handles
these data packets by integrating them
with frame structure where the frame
acts as the header for the data packet
the data packet will contain information
about the destination address sender
address and other related Services the
final product of the data link layer is
known as the data frame which is then
transmitted to the physical layer of the
OSI model now let's take a look at the
list of functions provided by the data
link layer first is framing framing acts
as a header format for the data
then we have addressing which handles
the physical address of the data frame
next is flow control which is
responsible for maintaining proper data
exchange between the sender and the
receiver side continuing with access
control which handles the communication
link between multiple network devices
the last function is error control as
the name suggests ddl provides error
control services to the data
now let's take a closer look at all the
data link layer functions the first one
is framing the data packets received
from the network layer are encapsulated
in frames by the data link layer for bit
to bit sharing over the channel it is
also responsible for restructuring the
framed data in the network model and
each data frame is different from the
others followed by that we have
addressing the task of adding a physical
address to the frame in the header
format is known as addressing it acts as
the identification service for
transmitting the frames to multiple
Network models over the channel
the next one is the flow control during
the data transmission the data flow of
the sender or the receiver side may be
different causing Network congestion in
the channel the data link layer in such
situations acts as a flow control for
the sender side to prevent the Overflow
at the receiver's side
followed by that we have the access
control in this network model when
multiple devices share the same
Communication channel this leads to data
Collision in the model
to prevent such data collisions the data
link layer performs checks on the
devices with the same network channel to
avoid any data loss lastly we have error
control
during data transmission due to noise or
signal loss errors might occur in the
data being transmitted to minimize such
data error rate the data link layer
performs error detection and correction
techniques on the transmitted data error
detection is done by adding detection
bits in the header of the transmitted
data and the receiver site can check for
any error in the received data now let's
take a look at the sub layers of the
data link layer
in the OSI model the data link layer can
be divided into two sub-layers which are
logical link control this is the upper
sub layer of the data length layer
the second one is the media access
control or Mac which is the lower sub
layer of the data link layer but before
we begin with the details regarding the
two sub layers let's take up a quick
quiz to consolidate what we have learned
so far question
which of the following tasks is not
performed by the data links layer a
addressing b i p Services C framing D
Access Control you can give your answers
in the comment section below
now let's take a look at some points
related to each layer of the sub layers
the first one which is logical link
control this sub layer is responsible
for handling and maintaining the
communication repeat
this sub layer is responsible for
handling and maintaining the
communication between the other layers
of the OSI model
this layer also performs the task of
overseeing the data flow rate of the
channel lastly it is also responsible
for handling error messages and
reliability checks for the data
next we have the media Access Control
this sub layer manages framing of the
data received from the upper layers
this layer also handles the physical
media for the model and interacts with
the computer and IC it is also
responsible for data encapsulation and
media access control for the data
received with this we have discussed all
the important points and functions of
the data link layer in the OSI model if
you have any questions regarding the
topics you can ask them in the comment
section thank you for watching and until
next time stay safe and keep learning
