fun I'm doctor Muskaan from Team MDS
conquer in this video I will be
discussing about psychodynamic theories
of child psychology
so first of all child psychology and
behavior management they are a very
important part of PD on ticks and most
important of all it does not overlap
with any other subject you have to cover
this and feed only and the second thing
is that you are most likely to get one
or two questions definitely from this
part and I know most of you must be
thinking it is a very dull or boring
subject but you just need to understand
the crux of the theory and the part from
here where you get questions most of the
questions is first is the classification
of the theories then you have to
remember the scientist who has given the
particular theory the year in which the
theory was given the stages all the
stages that are covered in the theory
and a bit of the dental application of
the theory so to start with some points
to be remembered so the work of Darwin
on the principle of natural evolution
focused the scientists interest on human
development Mendel's contribution on
genetics in 1863 influenced certain
movements towards the study of children
Pavlov contributed on developing the
experimental technique of the
conditioned response through its work
had major influence in understanding
concepts of psychology so scientists
basically they are more important from
PGI point of view in these papers they
concentrate more on scientists so what
is the importance of child psychology to
better understand the child to know the
problem of the psychological origin to
gain the confidence of the child and the
parents and
produce a comfortable environment for
dental team to work on the patient so
there are different models there are
four models put forward to understand
the development of a child's behavior so
we have not got any question from these
models till now but you should know the
name of the model and the theories which
are based on these models so you should
know about these models so first is the
mechanistic perspective this is known as
the mechanical mirror model it equates
people with machines so according to
this humans they react to what the
environment makes out of them
so the social learning theories they are
based on this model next is the organism
make perspective which is not known as
organic lab model so according to this
humans initiate acts changes inherent
part of life which is internal rather
than external that is there is no
environmental influence on the
development so the gene page its theory
it is based on organic lamp model
according to this change is qualitative
and discontinuous next is the
psychoanalytical perspective it was
first developed by segment fluid so
according to these people they are
neither active not passive but they are
always in flux between the two states so
they are always in a conflict between
their natural instincts and country
constraints imposed upon them by the
society and Sigmund Freud's theory and
Erik Erikson Theory come under this so
next is the humanistic perspective so
this perspective sees people as having
ability to take charge of their lives
and to foster their own development it
emphasizes the individual
ability to do this in healthy positive
ways through the distinctive human
qualities of choice creativity
evaluation and self-realization so next
is the classification of psychology's of
child psychology this is very very
important so basically they are divided
into two types psychodynamic theories
and behavior theories psychodynamic
theories they include psychosexual
theory by Sigmund Freud psychosocial
theory by Erik Erikson and Jean Piaget's
theory of cognitive development next are
the behavioral theories they are the
classical conditioning theory by Ivan
Pavlov Skinner's operant conditioning
theory
bandura's social learning theory and
hierarchy of needs by Maslow now what
questions you can get from these they
can give you four options and they can
ask you which of the following is a
psychodynamic theory or which of the
following is a behavioral theory or all
of the following are behavioral theory
except so you need to know the names
know that class in which they fall and
know the year and the scientist who has
put forward that theory so first is the
psychosexual or the psychoanalytical
theory put forward by Sigmund fluid in
1905 so he attempted to explain by
understanding the mind at its different
levels its motif a motivation and
conflicts so through it describe human
mind with the help of two models first
is the topographic model and the other
is the psychic model or the psychic
triad now according to the topographic
model there are three levels of
consciousness first is the conscious
then is the preconscious and then is the
subconscious or unconscious conscious is
what we are aware of preconscious is
that part of the personality of which
the individual is not aware of at the
moment but can reconnect into awareness
without great difficulties so this
includes our stored knowledge our
experiences and subconscious or
unconscious part of the personalities of
which the individual is unaware of so
through it used a iceberg to depict
these three levels so this is the
conscious level which are our present
thoughts our perceptions this is the pre
conscious level which are our memories
are stored knowledge we can recollect
them at any moment when we want and this
is the unconscious level or the
subconscious level which includes of
inherent fears are irrational wishes our
selfish needs
so through it says that only 10% is the
conscious level and rest is the pre
conscious and the unconscious level and
we are not aware of it the other is the
psychic trial or the psychic model so in
order to understand this let's take an
example we like to make it easier let's
take example of a kid see this is a kid
okay he has a Devin on one night and the
angel on the other so the devil always
pushes the kid to do the wrong things to
take the wrong habits whereas the angel
always encourages to do good deeds now
if we see this devil as the eight the
child has the ego and angel as the
super-ego so it is first to develop in
life then comes the ego then comes the
super-ego now
what is it it is the selfish selfish
person in inside us which is based on
the pleasure principle that is all its
needs should be fulfilled instantly that
is it believes in instant gratification
what is super ego super-ego follows the
rules of the society now the ego is
always confused how to satisfy the needs
of the it while keeping in mind the
rules of the society so it is the ego
who acts and it is the ego who has to
face the consequences
it is the ego who has to make the
decision what to do so it it is present
at birth it strives for immediate
pleasure and gratification ego it comes
at two to six months delays modifies and
controls it impulses on a realistic
level and the next is the super-ego that
is prohibition learn from the
environment so it is our unconscious
mind ego is a pre conscious mind and
super-ego is a conscious mind now fluid
says that throughout the life a person
goes through five stages and during all
these stages there is a zone of errors
erogenous zone so there is a constant
struggle between it and super-ego and
ego has to balance it these are known as
the internal conflicts and the result of
these struggles the decisions of the ego
they decide the personality of a person
now Freud put forward the five stages
this is very very very important what
you have to know is the name of the
stage
the age group of the stage the zones of
focus gratifying activities and the
fixations now fixations are if the child
continues to struggle through a stage
then you develop certain fixed sections
so according to fluid most of the
personality it is completed by five
years of age that is in the first three
stages of life first is the oral stage
again age zero to one point five years
erogenous zone in Focuses mouth
gratifying activities nursing eating
mouth movements so if the insurance
needs are met like if the infant is
getting sufficient feeding then infant
develops into a better person but if
there is insufficient or forceful
feeding it results in fixation so what
will be the symptoms of oral fixation
later in the life they will be smoking
or nail biting or drinking so next is
the anal stage in this what you have to
remember each group is 1.5 to 3 years
and erogenous zone is anus and
gratifying activities are bowel movement
and build withholding of such movement
so during this stage the child goes
through the toilet training that is a
process through which type children are
taught when where and how excretion is
deemed appropriately by society next is
the phallic stage so the age is four to
five years erogenous zone is genitals
gratifying activities are genital
fondling so the key event in the child's
feeling towards the parent of opposite
sex together with any
and fear of the same-sex parent so the
symptoms of phallic fixation they will
be anxiety and guilty of feelings about
sex fear of castration and narcissistic
personality in men so it includes two
important points first is the DPS
complex in which the boys they become
more attached to their mother and
Electra complex it is the opposite of
the Oedipus complex in which the girls
they are more attached to their father
basically child is more attached to the
parent of the opposite sex so next is
the latency stage there it is from five
years to puberty and there is no
erogenous zone and during this time the
child sexual feelings they are
suppressed and much of the child's
energy it is channeled into developing
new skills acquiring new knowledge
playing and it is largely confined to
children of same sex next is the genital
stage it is puberty onwards and again
the erogenous zone is genitals and
interaction with the environment is that
three major sources of sexual arousal
results during this period are memories
and sensations from earliest childhood
period that is from the phallic stage
then the physical manipulation of
genitals and hormonal secretions now
what are the merits of fluid theory it
is one of the earliest theory it is the
most comprehensive theory of lifelong
psychological development then the D
merits fluid formulated this theory by
his extensive Studies on adult
psychological patients and hence its
extrapolation to children it is not very
much justified and it is based on the
obsessed observation of the psychologist
so basically what we need to remember
in this study is first it was given by
Sigmund Freud in 1905 second the two
models the topographic model and the
psychic model then it includes the five
stages the name of the five stages the
age the areas of focus and the fixations
so next is psychosocial theory by Erik
Erikson given in 1963 now
Erikson he extended the fluid in concept
of ego he developed functions by
epigenetic principle that is we
developed through a predetermined
unfolding of our personalities in eight
stages each of which depends upon
successful resolution of a turning point
or crisis so fluid and Erickson they
both assumed that development depends on
child's instincts and responses around
him unresolved issues for from early
stages of life
affect person's ability to deal with
subsequent stages so according to
Erickson a person has to go through
eight stages throughout his life which
decides about what kind of a person he
emerges to be now the first stage is
trust versus mistrust the age is 0 to 1
years and the basic strength is hope so
what we need to remember in Erik Erikson
theory basically is all the eight stages
then the name of the stages then what
are the crisis or the basic strength of
that age and how the person emerges
through that stage and the tender
implication of that stage so in during
the four
first year of the life the child is
completely dependent on his mother for
his needs so if the caregiver meets the
needs of the child child develops trust
in the later life but if the caregiver
does not meet the needs the child
develops mistrust in the later life so
what will be the dental implications of
this age so the child is basically
developed is dependent on mother for the
needs and is attached to mother and so
there will be separation anxiety in the
child if we try to separate the child
from the mother so if necessary to
provide the dental treatment our
discerning age it is preferably to do
with the parental presence and
preferably with the parent holding the
child because if once the child loses
the basic trust with the world then it
would be very difficult for the dental
staff to regain the confidence of the
child so next stage is the stage 2 which
is the autonomy versus shame and doubt
so the age group is 2 to 3 years so the
basic strength is the will now here
there is a determination to exercise
freedom of choice in face of society's
demand now the child starts to gain some
freedom gain some freedom of choice so
if the child is X is able to exercise
some degree of choice then the child
comes out to be a confident person if
the child's independence is thwarted
child develops feeling of self-doubt
shame in dealing with others so what
other important landmarks of this stage
I that like the child wants to choose
what to be or what to eat with which
toys he wants to play so so what are the
dental applications so since the child
is moving away from the mother but still
the presence of the patient is essential
because the child will retreat to the
parent during the threatening situation
and now the child wants more freedom so
the dentist must obtain cooperation from
him by making him believe that the
treatment is is his choice and not of
his parents or the dentist so the third
stage is three to six years which is the
initiative versus guilt basic strength
is purpose now the child expresses
desires to initiate new activities like
if the child will be forming will be
playing with new kind of toys will be
doing more kind of activities doing
drawing playing with blocks making
different types of things with the
blocks so if the child is appreciated
and is allowed to do it then he comes
out to be a better person to be a more
confident person but if the parents they
punish the child for this initiative the
child has a feeling of guilt and it will
affect self-directed activity throughout
the life so what will be the dental
implications that the child can be
encouraged to view this visit as a new
adventure why because now the child
wants to do new things in this stage so
if the child is encouraged then we can
genuinely accept expect a success in the
dental visit that is
can expect cooperation from the child we
can do the treatment in a better way
then but if the child fails to do so it
can lead to a sense of guilt in the
child and he will always run away from
the treatment so the next thing is that
the child is teachable at this stage so
the child can be taught about various
things in dental setup the next is the
stage 4 which is industry versus
inferiority that is 7 to 12 years and
the basic strength is competence now the
child develops cognitive abilities to
enable in task completion that is the
child indulging in playbook school
making new friends playing different
sports so if the parents or the teachers
they do not support the child's efforts
child and UPS feelings of inferiority an
inadequacy so what are the dental
implications that child drives for sense
of Industry and accomplishment
cooperation with treatment can be
obtained so cooperation at this stage it
depends on whether he or she understands
what is needed to please dentist or
parents whether the peer group is
supportive and whether the desired
behavior is reinforced by the dentist
next stage 5 that is identity versus
role confusion which is 12 to 18 years
of age and the basic strength is loyalty
now at this stage that now the child
grows into an adolescent and the major
question that is in the mind of a child
is Who am I so he indulges into
different social relationships develop
new friends new relationships goes out
so if there is a strong sense of
identity then the child faces
hood with certainty and confidence but
if there is identity crisis then there
is confusion of ego identity now what
are the dental implications that be
since the child is in adolescence so
first thing is that the approval of peer
group is very important the child is
more worried about what his friends will
say what his peer group is going to
react on his action so the approval of
the peer group is extremely important
any author under treatment should be
carried out if child wants it and not
parent at this stage so parental
authority is rejected child should be
given the freedom to decide what
treatment he has to undergo next state
six and it is in the early 20s and it is
intimacies versus isolation and the
basic strength is love now the child now
the person the adult is in indulging in
some productive work is establishing new
intimate relationships but if the person
is fails to establish relationships then
it leads to the isolation so dental
applications are that at this stage
since the person is getting into new
relationships so the appearances they
are very important so these young adults
they seek orthodontic treatment to
correct their dental experiences and
this is characterized as internal
motivation but alteration of appearances
can also interfere with previously
established relations so the treatment
options they must be fully explained to
and discussed with the young adults next
stage 7 which is met 20s and late
tee's so this is generativity versus
stagnation and the basic strength is
care now as the individual is growing so
he takes but he takes active involvement
in teaching or guiding the next
generation there is a need to teach
others there is a concern for the next
generation but if there is no outlet for
generativity then it leads to the
stagnation of the person next is stage 8
which is 50s and Beyond and it is the
dis integrity versus despair and the
basic strength is virtual now this is
the looking back stage that the major
question a person asks is that did he or
she live a meaningful life so integrity
is when a person can look back with
satisfaction yes I have had a very good
life I have achieved all the goals all
my personal professional every goal I
have my family settled and everything is
good but if the person reviews with
anger or frustration or they have gone
through bitter experiences or they are
committed some mistakes then the that is
despair so what are the merits of
Erikson's Theory it is based on age wise
classification of an individual it is
easy to apply at any stage of
development then it is simple and
comprehensive to understand the demerit
sorry that it is based on extreme ends
of personality so what we need to
remember in this theory is the name of
the scientist Erik Erikson year 1963
basically there are eight stages the age
of every stage the basic strength and
virtue of every every age every stage
and dental implications like you can get
a question that there is a one-year-old
child you have to treat so what is the
main thing you have to take care of for
example it is the separation anxiety
then they will ask you will ask the
patient to a parent to leave or they
will give different options like the
parent should be allowed in the
operatory parent should not be allowed
in the operatory so during the first
year of life you have to answer yes the
parent should be allowed into operatory
why because if the parent is not allowed
then the patient then the child may face
separation anxiety so these are the
different questions these are the best
different case based questions that you
can get so we have discussed all the
dental implications all the stages so
you can get a question mostly from any
of these parts what I have emphasized on
so next important theory is Jean
Piaget's theory of cognitive development
given in 1952 so Jean Padgett he
formulated this theory on how children
and intellisense think and acquire
knowledge so he directly observed
children by questioning them about their
thinking so according to Piaget the
environment does not shape child
behavior but the child and adult
actively seek to understand the
environment so basically there are four
stages in Paget's theory of cognitive
development so there are sensory motor
pre-operational concrete operational and
formal operational theory what we need
to remember is the eighth the age group
then the names of the name of the stages
and the developmental phenomena
data present in that very stage so first
is the sensorimotor stage it is / - 2
years so now during this stage the child
starts to experience world world through
and senses an action like he is using
his senses for example he is seeing the
objects he can touch the object he can
feel the object he can hear from his
ears so there the development of
phenomenal our object permanence and
stranger anxiety second is 2 to 6 years
of age so this is the pre-operational
stage now the child begins to give words
to the things to the audience that he
was seen earlier using intuitive rather
than logical reasoning next is the 7 to
11 years of age that is concrete
operational now he starts thinking
logically about concrete events grasping
concrete and loggers and performing
automatical operations then is the
formal operational stage status 12 to
adulthood there is abstract reasoning
now to make it simple let's see this
picture
first is the sensorimotor stage this one
that is birth to two years child can
hold the water child will drink the
water child can feel you know he can put
his finger and he can feel the water
that is the sensorimotor stage with his
senses next is the pre-operational stage
now the child can name yes this is water
so this is the pre-operational stage in
concrete operational stage the child can
fill the glass with water he knows that
how I can take half glass of water how
I can take quite a glass of water an
informal operational stage the child
knows the complete reasoning that if it
is half-full then it is half empty so
this is in simple words what is the
theory of cognitive development now
let's understand the dental implications
of each stage first is the sensorimotor
stage start is zero to two years now
since child begins to interact with the
environment so the child can be given
toys while sitting on a dental chair in
his hand to make him more cooperative
next is pre-operational stage that is
two to seven years so it has three parts
that is constructivist constructivism
now a child likes to explore things and
make own observations for example child
will survey the dental chair he will see
the airway syringe the air order and all
the equipments which have been kept
there then his cognitive equilibrium
that is child is explained about
equipment or instrument and allowed to
deal with it that is you can show the
child the mirror you can place the
mirror in his hand yes you can hold it
nothing is happening you can ask him to
hold a probe and keep it on his kneel
and say see it is not hurting so child
can take control of things he should be
taught and he should be allowed to
exercise some independence to understand
the thing so that he will allow you to
do the treatment and be moved operative
then this animism now the child will
correlate with other objects which they
are used to or accustom to for example
radiograph you a child does not know
what is a radiograph but yes he knows
what sort of picture because he has seen
a photograph a picture
at his home so he can relate yes it is
showing a toad so it's a tooth picture
yes they have taken me to he'll be more
cooperative with you then
is concrete operational stage one more
point you have to differentiate between
animism and euphemism animism is a part
of cognitive development it is where a
child can where a child can correlate
with the object and euphemism is a part
of behavior management in which
different words simpler words they are
used for the instruments and things in
the dentin operatory next is concrete
operational stage that is six to twelve
years now childhood understand the
concrete instructions like this is
retainer you have to brush like this
after we had the retainer at night of
the clean at every day a child can be
instructed how to brush like you can
show a mirror and then ask the child to
brush himself and child is teachable at
this stage so centering that a child is
allowed to hold mirror to see what is
being done on his teeth egocentrism
child has achieved level of
understanding and gets involved in
treatment for example the child can hold
the suction tube by himself for you next
is formal operational stage that is 11
to 15 years so again this this is this
coincides with your doll ascent stage of
Erik Erikson and so then there is more
of peer influence and abstract thinking
increases so though it displays
important ruling orthodontic appliances
and braces and the child they are more
getting more and more conscious about
their looks and how they appears they
react to their looks and basically again
this corresponds to the adults in stage
of erection so the merits of this theory
it is most comprehensive theory of
cognitive development the theory
propagated that we can learn as much
about children's intellectual
development from examining their
incorrect and correct answers to items
and the merit side and underestimate
styles abilities it overall estimates
age difference in thinking vagueness
about the process of change it
underestimates the role of the social
environment so the main things to be
remembered and Jean Piaget's theory is
the name of the scientist gene pager in
the year then the four stages the ages
at each stage and the phenomena that
development a phenomena taking place at
each stage and what dental implications
it is having and how we can make the kid
more cooperative by understanding yes
psychology at that particular point so
with this we finish with our
psychoanalytical theories hope you have
understood the subject thank
