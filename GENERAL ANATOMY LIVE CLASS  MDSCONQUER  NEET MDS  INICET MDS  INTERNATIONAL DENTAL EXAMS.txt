[Applause]
what are the for we going to see in the
cranial fosa right the anterior cranial
fosa this is the anterior cranial fosa
the anterior M and posterior M this is
the middle cranial posa which is many
many important for Amina and this is the
posterior cranial fosa is very deep okay
yeah now in the anterior cranial fosa
what you see here is the ethmoid bone
right which part of the ethmoid bone you
see here all those small small opening
that's the CRI form plate of ethmoid
right cribriform plate of ethmoid you
see any foramin in the anterior cranial
fosa this cribriform plate of EOD is
going to transfer the all Factory
rootlets of the first cranial nerve yes
once theyve asked foramin
seeum okay usually nothing passes
through it the foramin seeum is in the
anterior cranial posa right now coming
to the middle cranial posa what are the
bones that you get to see in the middle
cranial posa because once they like the
foramin is situated between which two
bones okay so you should know the
boundaries of the foramina bones
contributing to those boundaries yes so
the yellow color that you see see here
is the spinoid body of the spinoid
greater wing of the spinoid this is the
temporal bone okay petus part SAS part
the green color is the parial bone okay
so you can identify the bones now we'll
talk about the foramina yeah so between
the body of the spinoid and the Lesser
wing of the spinoid this is the optic
Canal just now we saw the optic nerve
and the Opthalmic artery passes through
it right okay now this one here I'll
take a different color this between the
Lesser wing and the greater Wing just
now we saw this is the superior orbital
fissure right now coming to the three
important for that you see here I'll
mark it with three purple color
one two and three what are they yes the
anterior most one this one is the for
rotend yes behind that oval in shape is
the foram
oil behind that is the foramin
spinosum now what is going to pass
through this foram and rendum yes you
can tell me for and rendum the structure
traversing is the maxillary nerve so
where is this maxy nerve going into from
the middle cranial posa where does it
enter it's going to leave the cranial
cavity and enter
the terop Palatine
fosa right it's going to enter the terop
Palatine fosa maxy nerve through the
foramin
rotend right coming to the foramin ovale
that you see here yes there's a
pneumonic right for foramin ovale m a l
e what is it so the mandibular nerve
accessory menial artery the Lesser petal
nerve and the Emissary vein now you're
going to tell me the mandibular nerve
right from that to where it's going from
the middle cranial posa is going to
enter the
infratemporal
PHA right so from the foram oil it's
going to enter the infratemporal fosa
very good Dr Richa
accessory Nal artery it's a branch
of maxillary artery the first part of
maxillary artery lesser petrosal nerve
to which gangon is it going any idea
lesser petal neres reaching
the infratemporal fosa what's the
ganglion that very good tic ganglia
which pared gland is it Rel I'm sorry I
told you the answer right which salivary
gland is related to to the oted gland
right yes very good now coming to yeah
the other foramina here behind the
foramin O that's the foramin PM what are
the two structures traversing
it nerous
spinosum that's a branch from which part
of the mandibular nerve sorry Dr
Kiki the what nervous spinosum right
very good very good doctor the nervous
spinosum is a branch coming from the
trunk of the mandibular nerve what is
the other structure accompanying it
middle menial artery middle menal artery
is again a branch of first part of
maxillary
artery right any doubt in this so the
middle cranial posa the forna very very
very important okay Forin rotend I told
you Max nerve entering the terop
Palatine posa foramin oil mandibular
nerve entering the infratemporal fosa
and foramin spinosum nervous spinosum
from the trunk of the Mand nerve
done and if you want to add here what
you see here is see foram and
laum either side of the body of this
speno here you see the upper opening of
the cored canal there's a better picture
in the base of the skull I'll be showing
you okay need not worry about it
right coming to the foramin in the
posterior cranial
posa
one two and this one for in Magnum okay
so what is this
interal acoustic Miatas so what are the
structures traversing the internal AC
right yeah the seventh
nerve eighth nerve and an Ary the
labyrinthine artery where is this artery
coming from yes this labyrinthine artery
is a branch of basar artery which Lies
Over the pawns okay so these are the
three things which are going to Traverse
the internal acostic Miatas now
as I told
you very very important one this forment
here what is it called
juga the jugular
foramin right yes the jugular foramin
again it's going to be divided into
three
compartments anterior
compartment intermediate compartment
posterior compartment okay in the
anterior and the posterior compartment
there is a Venus sinus right what is the
Venus sinus in the anterior
compartment
inferior
petrosal
sinus and in the posterior compartment
this one is the igv the internal juglar
vein which is a continuation of the
sigmoid sinus and interestingly this
interior petroil sinus is the first
tributary okay as soon as it comes out
of the sky it opens into the internal
jugler vein first tribut of internal
jugler vein now what is there in the
intermediate compartment three cranial
nerves what are
they 9 10 and 11 okay so jugular pamin
is located between which two bones
between the petus part of the temporal
bone and the oxit bone anterior and
posterior compartment a sinus Venus
sinus anterior compartment inferior
petosa sinus posterior compartment
sigmoid sinus is continuing as internal
jugler vein intermediate compartment 9
10 11 what happens in the clinical
aspect if you see here a fracture to the
base of the skull okay which involves
the jugular foramin 9 10 11 cranial
nerves can be involved right and you
know there's a name given to the
syndrome any
idea very good Dr arita and everyone yes
those who don't know please know note it
down it's the veret
syndrome right veret okay Doctor veret
any doubt in this we'll move
on now I want you to tell me which
foramin like the Forin rotum ovil and
spinosum which one you don't get to see
in the base of the
skull yes of the three yes very good
okay the foram and rendum it doesn't
open below it opens anteriorly into the
terop palatin fosa you can make out the
foramin oil you can make out the foramin
spinosum rotend doesn't open below okay
understood okay now uh same thing you
can see here can you tell me what is
this here that is the lower opening of
the coted
canal okay who's going to tell me what
is this foren that you see here this is
the styloid process
this is the mastoid process so the
foramin between the two what is
it yes the styom mastoid foramin what
does it
transmit the seventh nerve isn't it the
facial nerve it transmits the facial
nerve very good very good very good
where is a jugular foren now yeah can
you see here this is the oxy put and
that's the temporal so this is the area
of the juular foramin
okay now the styloid process any idea
how long is the styloid process normally
it's about 2.5
cm sometimes the styloid process can be
very long lengthy right it can be like P
to yeah about 5 cm or something yes and
then it can compress it can yeah
compress the ninth nerve producing pain
over the ear pain in the throat all that
yeah and that goes by the name very good
very good guys superb Eagle
syndrome okay very good very good Dr
anima yeah now few things that I would
like to see here yeah can you tell me
what is this here that's the incisive
Canal yeah the lateral incisive foram
what is it going to transmit yes from so
you have the greater palatin vessel that
is going to enter in right yeah
greater Palatine vessel and from the
nasal cavity one which is going to
Greater palatin is going to enter the
nasal cavity the one which is going to
leave the nasal cavity and come to the
palatin is see palet is the phop
Palatine nerve and vessels okay yeah so
these are the two structures traversing
the yeah and you can make out the
greater Palatine forine here this is the
greater palatin foramin transmitting the
vessels you can make out the Lesser
paltin here two small foramina lesser
Palatine
foramina now other few important one I
would like to tell here as I told you
here you can make out at empty space
yeah that's the foram
Lum the anterior aspect of the foramin
laerum you get to see one foramin what
is it this one
here yeah the anterior end of the
foramin leum is related
to yes the teroid
canal teroid canal which is also called
Vian yeah vian's Canal what is going to
pass through it the nerve of the teroid
canal right the artery of the teroid
canal is going to pass through it
another two small
foramina here you know this is the OM
right between the OM and the here uh
vaginal process of the OM and this the
this one here this is the omo vaginal
Canal luckily nothing passes through it
okay no significant structures are going
to pass through it you need not worry
and just behind that here this one here
this is the palatino vagina Canal
vaginal is part of the okay vaginal
process of the OM palatino vaginal Canal
what is going to pass through the
palatino vaginal Canal yes the ferial
vessels and
nerve okay base of the skull I would
like to repeat it again the take home
message foram and rendum of the middle
cranial posa the lower opening is not
seen in the base of the scal okay and
you have seen the skylom mastoid Forin
between the styloid process and mastoid
process through which the facial n is
going to exit the syndrome related to
styloid process is Eagle syndrome you
have seen the jugular foramin lower
opening of cored canal here I tried to
show you structures passing through the
incisive Canal greater Palatine lesser
palatin foramin and then we saw three
small foramin okay anterior you see the
foramin lerum anterior end of the Lum
teroid canal and between the Omar and
the medial teroid plate more in the
front you get to see the OM vaginal
Canal more proximal to it palatino
vaginal Canal these have been asked over
the previous years no problem in
identification the name of the canal of
pamin has been mentioned and structures
passing through you should be able to
tell
okay lastly about the foron foron Magnum
right now who's going to tell
me what is
the point in the anterior margin of the
foran Magnum called in the midline one
craniometric
point this this is the anterior magin of
foran Magnum right the midpoint of it is
called the
bason okay just remember since we are
talking about for and Magnum I thought
I'll mention it here structures in
through Forin me Magnum three membranes
anteriorly right what are they
epical ligament of
dense upper band of cruciate
ligament and one more what is it
membran
Toria okay other than that what are the
structures that are going to pass
through it you have the medula
the medula is going to be covered by the
three menes right with the two spaces
subarid space subdural space yes and
what are the arteries that are going to
pass through it anterior spinal
artery posterior spinal artery which are
branches from the yes vertebral artery
the fourth part of vertebral artery
passes through it okay and I'll take
another color yes what are the nerves
passing through it very good so the
plexus the sympathetic flues around the
vertebral
artery and the spinal part of the
accessory nerve one more one more
structure yes the tonsil of the cellum
okay so it's very very important just go
through it the three
ligaments the medula surrounded by the
menes fourth part of vertebral artery
along with the anterior spinal artery
posterior spinal artery sympathetic
fluxes around the vertebral artery final
part of accessory nerve the tonsils of
cell
