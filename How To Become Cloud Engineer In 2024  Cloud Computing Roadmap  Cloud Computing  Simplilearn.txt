hello everyone welcome back to the
channel today I want to take you on a
journey that could transform your career
much like how cloud computing has
transformed some of the world's most
Innovative companies imagine Netflix
once a DVD rental service transforming
into a streaming giant capable of
delivering high definition content to
millions of users simultaneously or
consider Airbnb which has used cloud
computing to manage listings and
bookings for Millions of properties
around the globe providing a seamless
experience for host and travelers alike
both Netflix and Airbnb utilized Cloud
Technologies to efficiently scale their
businesses manage large volumes of data
and Ensure High availability and
performance so by transitioning from
traditional costly and inflexible own
premises infrastructure to scalable
Cloud environments they significantly
reduce cost accelerated Innovation and
improved user experience in real time
now you might think that working on such
impactful projects requires years of
experience and advanced degrees but
there's the good news guys with the
right approach you can start a career in
cloudd Engineering in just 3 months even
if you are starting from scratch in this
video I will outline a clear actionable
plan that uses entirely free online
resources to get you there we will cover
the essential skills you need to learn
the certifications that can help
validate your knowledge and practical
projects that will make your resumes
stand out so if you're ready to dive
into the world of cloud computing and
perhaps one day contribute to the next
big thing in Tech so stay tuned guys so
let's get started and the number one
point you should start with is starting
your Cloud Journey so transitioning into
Cloud engineering may seem daunting
especially if you are new to this field
the first step is understanding why this
is a valuable career move the cloud
industry is booming with a projected
market value of $800 billion by 2025 and
the potential to grow even further this
growth means a constant demand for
skilled professionals making it an
excellent time to enter the field now
that we understand the industry's
potential the next question is where
should you start so you should choose a
cloud provider so choosing a cloud
provider is a critical decision as it
shapes your learning path and future
jobs opportunities so the three major
players are AWS Azure and Google Cloud
platform gcp so starting with AWS so AWS
that is Amazon web services is often
recommended for beginners because
because it has the largest market share
and a wide range of services which
translates into more job opportunities
now coming to Azure that is another
strong option especially if you're
targeting jobs in Enterprises that use
Microsoft Technologies now coming to gcp
that is Google Cloud platform and it is
gaining popularity and offers excellent
features especially in data analytics
and machine learning for beginners AWS
is popular choice due to its widespread
use and extensive document ation however
it's important to research the demand in
your local job market and consider your
own interest when making a decision and
with a cloud provider chosen the next
step is to build a strong foundation in
the fundamental technologies that
underpin cloud computing so now before
diving into Cloud specific Services it's
essential to understand the foundational
technologies that cloud computing relies
on these include number one comes
networking so understanding how data
moves across Networks is crucial for
setting up and managing Cloud
infrastructure then comes operating
systems familiarity with operating
systems particularly Linux is essential
as most Cloud environments run on Linux
servers then comes virtualization so
this is the process of creating virtual
instances of physical Hardware that's a
core Concept in cloud computing and then
comes databases so knowledge of
databases both relational and
non-relational is critical for managing
data in the cloud so with these
foundational skills in place you are now
ready to explore Cloud specific learning
parts so let's start with certifications
so certifications can validate your
knowledge and make you stand out in the
job market for AWS starting with the AWS
Cloud practitioner certification is
advisable this certification provides a
broad overview of cloud Concepts and AWS
Services it covers key areas such as
compute Services storage options
security measures networking
capabilities and billing and pricing
structures craving a career upgrade

certification offers everything think
you need to boost your skills and
credibility you can dive into engaging
learning modules Hands-On labs and
expert L sessions that make mastering
Azure a breeze so in this course you
will learn to manage Azure subscriptions

coming back while certifications are
valuable they need to be complemented
with practical hands-on experience to
truly demonstrate your skills Here Comes
building projects or Hands-On practice
so building projects is the most
effective way to apply what you have
learned and to demonstrate your
abilities to potential employers so here
are a few beginner friendly projects to
consider number one is setting up
virtual machines so start by launching
an ec2 instance on AWS learn about the
different instance types configurations
and the basics of server management then
comes the next project that is cloud
storage systems so experiment with
services like S3 for object storage and
RDS for relational databases document
the use cases and differences between
these Services then deploy a web
application host a static website using
S3 and cloudfront which will teach you
about web hosting content delivery and
the basics of DNS management with Route
53 initially you can use the AWS console
for these task but as you progress try
implementing these projects using
infrastructure as code tools like
terraform this approach not only deepens
your understanding but also aligns with
industry best practices in addition to
practical projects having some coding
knowledge can greatly enhance your
capabilities as a cloud engineer so now
we'll see how you can learn to code
while not always mandatory coding skills
can significantly enhance your
effectiveness as a cloud engineer
languages like Python and Bash are
particularly useful for scripting and
automation even a basic understanding
can help with tasks such as writing
scripts for Server automation managing
cloud services or resources
programmatically then implementing
infrastructure as code for those new to
coding check out Simply learn videos on
YouTube which offers excellent starting
points coding skills not only make you
more versatile but also open up
opportunities to specialize in areas
like devops or Cloud native development
and once you have built your skills and
some projects it's time to start with
the job hunting process that is building
your profile creating a strong online
presence is crucial when job hunting
your LinkedIn profile should clearly
reflect your new skills certifications
and projects so here are some tips
number one is optimize your LinkedIn
profile that is include a professional
photo an engaging summary and detailed
description of your projects then comes
network activity connect with
Professionals in the field join cloud
computing groups and participate in
discussions and then comes apply
strategically tailor your resume for
each job application highlighting the
skills and projects that align with the
job description applying for jobs can be
a number game so be persistent it's also
helpful to reach out to recruiters or
hiring managers directly to express your
interest in the role as you start to
gain experience in your first Cloud role
consider specializing in a niche area to
advance your career and then comes
specializing and continuous learning so
specializing in a particular area of
cloud computing can make you more
valuable and increase your earning
potential possible specializations
include devops that is it focus on
automation continuous integration and
continuous deployment practices then
comes serverless Computing work with
functions as a service that is FAS and
other serverless architectures and then
comes security specialize in Cloud
security to protect data and
infrastructure the cloud industry is
Dynamic with new tools and Technologies
emerging regularly so continuous
learning is key so stay updated through
online courses webinars and industry
news finally remember that the journey
into Cloud engineering is continuous and
ever evolving so we talk about resources
