hey everyone welcome to our simply
learns youtube channel today we will
talk about one of the interesting topics
that are dictionary hashtable and sets
but before we begin let me tell you guys
we have our daily updates on multiple
technologies
so if you are a tech geek in a
continuous hud for a latest
technological advancement then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon to never miss an update from simply
learns youtube channel
now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with what a
dictionary is
then
we will discuss the methods in the
dictionary
after that we will discuss what a hash
table is now we will dive into the
properties of c sharp hash table
then we will discuss the methods in c
sharp hash table
after that we will have a look at hash
sets
finally we will wind up this session
with the implementations of set
now let's get started with what
dictionaries are
in c sharp the dictionary class
represents a generic collection of key
value pairs
dictionary is a class defined in the
system.collection package
a generic namespace is a sort of a class
that can include any kind of data in the
form of keys and values
each key in collection must be one of a
kind
here's the syntax for declaring a
dictionary
next up let's discuss methods in the
dictionary
there are basically four methods we can
apply
in a dictionary
we can add an element
remove an element
find an element
or replace an element
now let's implement this in the code

let's start
we will start with
namespace
dictionary
class
program
static
void
main
with argument as
string
args
here we will create a dictionary with
the string key and in 16 value pair
so
dictionary
string
comma
and
16.
depth
is equals to
new
dictionary
string
and
16
now we will add elements to this
so
text
dot
add
then let's add a word
cart
and give it a value as 32
then
we can have
another element
in this dictionary
select add
and name it
talk
with number as
25
next check
dot add
3
comma
29
that
dot add
row
comma
21
select
dot
add
allow
comma
34
now let's write a statement to count the
words in the dictionary
so console
start
write line
count
in curly braces
0
comma
debt
dot
count
now
let's try to set a new item value
so
let's see ticked
i want to change the value
for element tree
and let's change it to let's say 9.
now if
not dict dot
contain
contains key
as
dog
then
we will change the value
for this
talk
as
20.
now let's say if
we want to get
an element using values
so we will not direct
contain
value
as
9.
and we will
have it as
console
dot
write line
as
item
found
now let's try to read all the items
so
console
dot write line
words
hall
item
now for each
key value pair
string
comma
and
16
word
and
that
so we will write
console
dot right
line key
0
comma
value
as one
comma
word
dot
key
comma
word
dot value
now
let's try to remove
subject
dot remove
and let's remove
tree
let's copy double
lines
after
deleting
tree
here we are printed again
now
let's remove all the element so
text
dot
clear
let's save that
and run it
as you can see
here
we are getting the count as 5
since we first
tried to find the count of the elements
then
we have printed
all the elements
then we remove the tree
so now
then we print it again so it is removed
again
let's get back to our slides
now let's discuss the hash table
a hash table in c sharp stores
keys values pair
where keys can find the storage
since it is immutable a hash table
cannot have duplicate
entries the collections dictionary entry
objects have two properties a key and a
value
the values of table can only be accessed
by defining a key object
here's the syntax for defining a hash
table
now
let's have a look at the properties of
hash table
first up
comparer it returns or sets the i
comparer to be used
next count
this returns the number of key value
pairs in the hash table
then
is ready only will return
a value indicating whether the hash
table is read only or not
after that item
it returns or sets the value associated
with the supplied key
then keys this will return the i
collection containing
the keys of the hash table
at last values
this returns an i collection containing
the value for the hash
table now let's discuss the method in
hash tables
a hash table contains the following
methods
add
which inserts a hash table elements with
the specified key and value
then clear this will remove all elements
from the hash table
contains key will indicate whether or
not the specified key is present in the
hash table
then contains value this will indicate
whether or not the supplied value is
present in the hash table
now let's try these methods in the hash
table in the correlator
let's start with namespace
as
hash
table
class
as program
static
void
main
with argument as string
krgs
now let's define the hash table so hash
table
h
table
equals to
new
hash
table
now let's add element in the hash table
so as table dot
add
one
comma
let's add element as c
then
hash table
dot
add
at number three
let's add a
then
hash table
dot add
let's set
s
at number four
then
h table dot add
at number 2
let's add
our
hash table dot
add
then at number five
we will add
h
basically what i wanted to do was
from key 1 to 5 we will be spelling
trash
so
now for each
for each
object
i
in
h table
dot case
console
dot
write line
i
and for
each
object
j
in
h table
dot
values
console
dot
right line
j
basically these two statements will be
printing out the first the keys and then
the objects
now
let's print them together so for
each
dictionary
entry
dic
in
h table
we will write console
dot
right line
is is equals to
zero
and
values
is equals to
1
in curly braces
comma
so this will be tick
dot
key
comma
dic dot
value
and then
we will pass on
console
dot
sheet key
let's save this
and run it
as you can see we have first printed out
the keys
from five to one in the
opposite angle and then crash as hsarc
then we have printed these
together
now
let's get back to our slides
now let's have a look at sets
in c sharp sets are referred to as hash
sets
in c sharp hash that
ensures that there are no duplicate
strings or elements in an array
here's the syntax to declare the sets
now let's implement this in the code
editor
so we will start with class
program
static
void
main
here we will be declaring a string
arr
1
equals to
paper
comma
pencil
comma
eraser
comma
pen
comma
paper
now let's
print this so console
dot
write
string
dot
join
comma
comma
arr1
now let's declare a hashtag so var
h
is equals to new
hash
set
string
area 1
now since we have converted this error
into a hash set it will eliminate the
duplicate words
so now string
arr
2
will equals to
h
dot
two array
now we have stored
that ar1 array into ar2
so now we will print this
so console
dot
write line
then string
dot
join
comma
comma
arr
2
let's save it
and run this
as you can see
first time it is printing the
string array as it is like paper pencil
eraser pen paper but when we have
converted it into hash set it has
eliminated the duplicate value paper
which was coming at the first and the
last position
and this was all for today's session
