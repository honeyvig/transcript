happiness this is dr srikanth
from team conquer now in this session
i'll be talking about
instrument formula
so coming to the instrument formula hope
you remember the instrument formula
okay every instrument has a formula
which is given by series of numbers
okay it can be either three series
means which has three numbers or either
four series
which has four numbers right three
numbers
or four numbers coming to the
the first number okay the first number
indicates the width of the blade it
indicates
the width of the blade or the
primary cutting edge what is the primary
cutting edge for an instrument
this is called as the primary cutting
edge or the width of the blade
and it is measured in most important
area and it is measured in
tenth of a millimeter for example if the
first number in the instrument formula
says
it is 9 9 means
1 10 means 0.99 millimeter is the
width of the blade so they can give a
series of numbers
telling that this is an instrument
formula and they can ask you
what is the width of the blade in the
particular instrument
then the answer will be one tenth of the
first number that is
one tenth of the first number in
millimeters clear so this is a
first number that you have to make a
note
coming to the number two okay so number
two is the
number two indicates the primary cutting
edge
angle number two indicates the
primary cutting edge angle in a simple
words you can remember that number two
is
cutting edge
angle so as most of these
will be angles it is very difficult for
you to retain for longer duration of
time
so the easy way second will have c in it
okay and cutting will have c in it okay
the second number
for an instrument formula represents
cutting edge
angle and easy way your second number
in most of the situations will be more
than 50 degrees
okay in it is more than 50 degrees
okay there are few cases where this
second number is opposite
such cases are called as three numbers
as already discussed instrument formula
is either four number or three number
in few cases the second number will be
missing the second number will be
missing what case
the second number is options for the
instrument which has an angle of 90
degrees
so whenever the angle is apart from the
90 degrees whenever the angle is
apart from the 90 degrees then only the
second number will be considered
instrument which has an angle of 90
degrees will not be considered
okay that is about the second number
okay you can clearly see
the first number represents the width of
the blade
by one tenth millimeter okay
the second number represents the cutting
edge angle second
you can you can easily remember as c c
second
the third number represents the blade
length the length of the blade and the
fourth number represents the
blade angle right this is for four
formula what is the four formula
in four numbers formula the first number
represents the width
the second number represents the cutting
edge angle the third number represents
the
blade length and the fourth number
represents the blade angle
there is other type of formula where you
have three numbers what is that
the first number represents the
blade with your second number is absent
your third number represents the
blade length your fourth number
represents the blade angle
where here the numbers will be 1 3
4 okay so they can ask you
for a 3d zit for a three three digit
instrument formula what does the second
number represents
a second number is absent the third
number is going to
come into the position of second number
so for a three digit
the second number will be blade length
for a four digit
the second number will be cutting edge
angle i hope you are very clear
right next the number three
number three has already discussed it
represents the
blade length in millimeters it
represents the blade length now here you
are measuring the blade length
previously in the first number you have
measured the width of the blade
here you are measuring the length of the
blade
the next comes is the fourth number
what is the fourth number fourth number
indicates the
blade angle okay so this number
will be less than 50 degrees second
number we have discussed it is more than
50 degrees
fourth number is less than 50 degrees
okay
so this is width of the blade this is
the length of the blade clear so they
have given this formula
this is the instrument formula so what
we have discussed the first
is the fourth digit okay the first
number represents the width of the blade
by one tenth means
it is 1.5 millimeter is the width of the
instrument the second number is already
discussed that is the cutting edge angle
which is more than 50 degrees confirmed
it is more than 50 degrees
right the third number represents the
the third number represents the length
of the blade it is eight millimeters
the fourth number represents the blade
angle which is less than 50
confirmed it is 12 here so it is less
than 50. so
regularly the questions that are asked
for you is they're going to give
simple formula they're going to ask what
is the position of second
what does third means what does four
means or they can ask the dimensions
particularly most commonly they ask
dimensions of the first number because
it is one
10 means 15 has to be divided by
10 so the end is 1.5 what are the units
millimeters length of the blade is 8
millimeters
width of the blade is 1.5 millimeters
for this particular question
okay and the next great question is
instrument which has
four number formula okay your gmt
and angle farmers has four number
formula most of the instruments
which has an angle of 90 degrees in the
second position
so it is not considered so such
instruments will have
one two three digit formula only three
digits will be there
which number is missing out of one two
three four
is missing okay the second position will
be occupied by third number
and third position will be occupied by
the fourth number
for an instrument which is having a
three digit formula
so yeah i'm done for now
