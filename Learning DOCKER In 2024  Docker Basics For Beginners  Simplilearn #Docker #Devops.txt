hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on docker's tutorials for
beginners at simply learn do you know
friend that Docker is a powerful tool
for simplifying the process of creating
deploying and also managing applications
within containers these containers
encapsulate all the necessary
dependencies and libraries ensuring
consistency across different
environments this introductory tutorial
will guide you through the basics of
Docker starting with the installation
set up your system you'll also learn how
to create Docker images using Docker
files which are kind of text files
containing instructions for building
containers now before we move on and
learn more about it I request you guys
that do not forget to hit the Subscribe
button and click the Bell icon now
here's the agenda for our today's
session so guys we will start with what
is Docker moving ahead we will discuss
about why Docker is important then we
will learn about Docker versus virtual
machine moving ahead we will also Deep
dive into Docker components like Docker
engine Docker images Docker contain
container and Docker registry then we
will move on to installing Docker on our
Windows system and finally we will wrap
our session with a Hands-On just a quick
info guys simply learn has got a
post-graduate program in devops in
collaboration with calch ctme which is a
professional development course that is
going to square your skills with the
industry standards this is a Cutting
Edge Blended learning which is going to
combine live online DeVos certification
classes with interactive Labs that will
give you a hands-on experience so hurry
up now and join the course the course
link is given in the description box so
guys let's start with what is joa so
guys Docker is a powerful platform that
revolutionizes the software development
and deployment by simplifying the
process of building shipping and running
applications within lightweight and
portable containers these containers
encapsulate everything that application
needs to run including code runtime
system tools libraries which which
ensures consistency across different
environments unlike traditional virtual
machines Docker container shares the
whole system kernel making them
extremely efficient and fast to Startup
Docker enables developers to package
their applications and dependencies into
easily distributable images which can be
deployed seamlessly across any
infrastructure from local development
environments to public or private clouds
with Docker team can accelerate software
delivery improve scalability and
enhanced collaboration between
development operations and quality
assurance teams ultimately leading to a
faster Innovation and more Reliable
Software releases why Docker is
important Docker is important for
several reasons so guys the first reason
that comes up to my mind is
portability guys Docker containers are
lightweight and portable which allows
applications to run consistently across
different environments such as developer
laptops on prom servers and Cloud
platforms this portability enables
seamless migrations and scaling of
applications without compatibility
issues the next one that comes up to my
mind is efficiency Docker containers
shares the host system kernel leading to
faster startup times and reduced
overhead compared to the traditional
virtual machines this efficiency also
enables higher resource utilization and
improved application performance next
that comes up to my mind is isolation
Docker also provides process level
isolation which allows applications to
run independently within their
containers without interference from
other containers or host system this
isolation enhances security and
stability by minimizing the impact of
software conflicts and vulnerabilities
the next one is scalability docker's
lightweight and modular architecture
makes it easy to scale applications
horizontally by deploying multiple
containers across distributed
environments the scalability enables
organizations to meet changing workload
demands quickly and efficiently next
come is devops enablement Docker
facilitates devop practices by promoting
collaboration between development teams
and operations and QA teams with Docker
developers can package and deploy
applications consistently while
operations team can manage
infrastructure more efficiently using
container orchestration tools like
communities now overall Docker
simplifies the process of building
shipping and running applications which
leads to a faster delivery improved
reliability and increased agility for
organization across Industries now we'll
try to understand what is the basic
difference between a Docker and a
virtual machine so guys if I talk about
Docker versus virtual machines Docker
and virtual machines serve similar
purposes but they operate kind of
differently if I talk about virtual
machine they emulate the physical
Hardware to create isolated environments
where multiple operating systems can run
simultaneously on a single physical
machine each virtual machine requires
its own guest operating system consuming
significant resources and leading to
slower startup times in contrast Docker
uses containerization technology to run
applications within lightweight isolated
containers that share the host operating
system kernel this approach eliminates
need for a guest operating system
resulting in Faster startup times lower
resource overhead and greater efficiency
Docker containers are highly portable
and can be easily moved between
environments while virtual machines
require more complex migration processes
overall Docker offers great agility
scalability and resource efficiency
compared to Virtual machines making it
an ideal choice for modern microservices
based architectures devops practices and
Cloud native applications
now we'll move on and understand about
Docker components where we will discuss
about Docker engine Docker images
containers and Docker registry so guys
Docker has four important components the
first one is Docker engine then is
Docker images next comes containers and
there is Docker registry now let us
discuss each one of them one by one if I
talk about Docker engine so guys Docker
engine is a core component of the docker
platform form it is a client server
application that consists of a demon
process called Docker running on the
host machine and a command line
interface client called Docker which is
basically used to interact with the
demon Docker engine manages Docker
objects such as images containers
volumes networks and many more now let's
move on and discuss about Docker images
guys Docker images are lightweight
Standalone executable packages that
contains everything needed to run a
specific application including the code
runtime libraries dependencies and
system tools images are created using a
Docker file which specifies the
instructions for building the image
layer by layer images can be shared and
distributed bya Docker Hub or private
Docker Registries now let us understand
containers so guys Docker containers are
exactly instances of Docker image that
are running as isolated processes on the
host machine each container has its own
file system networking and isolated
process space making them lightweight
and portable containers can be started
and stopped restarted and removed using
Docker commands they provide consistency
across different environments and enable
efficient application deployment and
scaling now if you look at this
architecture guys you can see there are
application a application B and
application C and the whole all
architecture of a virtual machine
includes a hypervisor beneath it then
and there's a host operating system
kernel and then there is an
infrastructure the hypervisor typically
operates as an intermediat layer between
the host operating system and the
virtual machine which facilitates a
communication between them whereas if I
talk about Docker you can see rather
than containing an entire guest
operating system within a container
leverages the host operating system
through the container runtime while
ensuring the isolation now we will move
on and understand about Docker registry
so guys Docker registry is a service
basically for storing and distributing
Docker images Docker Hub is the official
public registry provided by Docker where
users can find and share Docker images
for a wide range of application and
software Stacks additionally
organizations can set up private Docker
Registries to store proprietary or
sensitive images internally Docker
Registries allows user to push pull
manage Docker image is facilitating
collaboration and deployment workflows
so guys this was all about the basics of
Docker now I'll move on and install
Docker on our Windows system so guys now
let's move on to our favorite web
browser that is Google and from there we
will go to Docker
desktop download okay so just click on
this and you're going to get this Docker
desktop
now what you can do just here you can
just click for download for Windows you
can go for if you are have a supportive
version for Mac Intel chip you can go
for this if you have an apple chip you
can go for this if you have wanted to do
for Linux you can do for this now just
click on this and you can say your
Docker desktop is just on the download
list now few important things I want to
tell you after this you need a
distribution package okay so that is WSL
for Windows so you can download that
distribution software which is going to
enable your Docker desktop the
installation process is very simple now
let me show you some of the Magics of
using Docker desktop okay so we will be
building this normal folder okay so here
I've built the folder called Docker and
I'm using vs code as our text editor so
guys what I will do okay so I will open
my vs code and let me show you how our
Docker desktop looks
so okay guys you can see all over here
this is our Docker desktop you'll get
something like this here is containers
since I am running no containers so it
is showing empty here are images you can
download Lo any images from the docker
Hub which is our registry and there's a
builds there is a volumes there's a
development environments okay there are
a lot of other other features okay so
let's move on little by little and let's
understand how we can integrate Docker
desktop in our development process so
guys what I've done all over here so
I've created a folder which is kind of
empty now simple thing I'm going to do
I'm going to go to my vs code okay and I
will try to open this folder so open
folder and on the desktop I'm going to
get a Docker folder so just right click
on this okay very nice
now let me delete
this so you can see all over here I have
created a file called Docker so I'll
delete it and make it once again so just
right click all over here and type
Docker
file okay you can see there is a shine
of a docker okay all over here
now what you are going to do we are
going to type something okay we are
going to type hello world on Docker
sounds amazing okay because on different
programming languages our first program
is hello world so I thought like let me
show you how we can type hello world in
our doc so guys let me write the
code so I'm going to type
from
Alpine and
latest okay now I'll explain each code
one by
one now here I'm going to create a
directory okay so
let's create
a directory okay
now I will type
run okay and mkd that will be our slab
directory okay now we are going to write
the hello
world pretty good now so in order to
write hello world I will
type
run
Echo
[Music]
hello world
okay and let's add some exclamation mark
okay so next what I will do since I've
have created a directory all over here
so/
app slash
hello.
text
okay now we have type all over here now
we are going to set the working
directory
so
so we'll type
work
Dr SL
app then I'm going to specify the
command to run the container
so type
specifying the
command to run our
container
CMD
okay here missed something that will be
cat okay now
here
let's type the name of our file which is
hello.txt
okay now program is completed this is a
very basic program and let me explain
you what I have written so guys from
Alpine latest means that is basically
specifies the base image to use for the
docker image in this case we are using
the latest version of Alpine Linux next
we can see I am creating a directory
mkdir okay so K is missing so mkd / app
then what I'm doing I'm writing the
hello world so run Echo hello world and
I'm creating this uh app /hello txt
basically means it writes hello world to
a file name hello.txt inside the/ app
directory then there is workd okay it
actually sets the working directory
inside the container to the SL app which
is our working directory okay now what
is going to happen this means that
subsequent commands will be executed
relative to this directory and finally
we have written CMD cat hello.txt it
specifies the default command to run
when a container is started from this
image in this case it prints the content
of the hello txt using the cad command
so basically this Docker file can be
used to build a image running a
container from this image will output a
hello world one more thing guys that
there's a extension and you can install
the docker extension in your vs code so
you can say Docker you can see I have
already installed it so you can install
this extension on your vs code now let
us run our
application
okay guys now the First Command that I
will be typing that is Docker build T
hello world which basically is going to
do what is going to build our Docker
file so let's click on
this so you can see it is building our
Docker file okay now it has created a
directory all over here now let's run
our this file so I will type Docker run
hello world and you can see on our
terminal it is printing hello world we
have successfully done this thing now
there are certain other more important
commands and let me also tell you about
it
now guys in this we'll be learning about
important Docker commands the first one
that comes up to my mind is Docker run
which we have already applied it all
over
here so guys the first command is Docker
run so basically this command is going
to run a new container for example you
can type certain like
this docker
run hello
world
okay so this is our first command
now now in this case you want to list
the containers running so for that
there's a command called dock of PS okay
so suppose you can there are certain
options with associated with it like PSA
or all so let me show you this command
all over here
and
so you can see already this container is
running which is cat hello.txt and it
shows 3 minutes ago so it is going to
list the containers running for the
docker images you can type certain like
this Docker
images okay so it is basically going to
show you the available images on your
system what images you have basically
created okay so let me type this if I
type all over
here so you can see hello world is our
latest image so there's a image ID
created okay and the size of it okay
now let us do certain things
else which is docka
build so guys Docker build is going to
basically build a Docker image from a
Docker file so this Syntax for this is
like
Docker build T and then the name of your
image so in this case it was hello world
so this was there so I've already ran
this command on the system I'll show
you so you can see Docker build T hello
world now next thing is Docker
pull
so guys if we talk about Docker pull
basically it's going to pull a image
from a registry for example
say Docker
pull engine
X
okay next is Docker
push so guys Docker push is going to do
what it is going to push a image to a
registry so for example
docker
push
then hello
world next is Docker
stop okay so basically Docker stop does
what Docker stop is going to stop a
running container and the same syntax
can be used so it will be Docker
stop
now next command is talker start so
basically this command is going to start
a stopped container so for example
Docker start okay me copy
this and what is the ID of the container
ID you have to give all over
here okay next command is Docker
restart now
this command is going to do what guys
this command is basically going to
restart a running container so for
example the same command all over
here
and with a particular container
ID now final that
is Docker
RM so guys basically Docker RM is going
to remove one or more containers okay so
for example Docker RM same and with a
particular container ID now next command
is Docker
RMI so guys basically it's going to
remove one or more images so for example
Docker RMI and with a respective image
ID now our final command that is Docker
X Okay so
so guys it is basically going to run a
command in a running container for
example Docker
X okay now in this what you can give
guys suppose Docker
X it
container okay we're going to give the
container
ID or we can give SL
pin and give the bash command so
basically this is going to run a command
in a running container that is what you
have to remember about this command it
is a very useful command Okay so
whenever you are building any
microservices uh there you can apply
these principles now finally so Guys
these are just few basic commands to get
started with
Docker so guys that was all for today's
