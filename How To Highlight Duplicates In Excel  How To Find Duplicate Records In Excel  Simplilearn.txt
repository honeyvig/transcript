hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel and in this session we
will be learning about how to highlight
duplicate cells in excel but before we
begin i would like to tell you guys that
we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous handful it is technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn now without
further ado let's get started with our
one point agenda that is how to
highlight duplicate values in excel
now for that let's get started with the
practical mode
now we are on our excel spreadsheet and
this spreadsheet has some values of
employees that is their employee id name
designation department salary date of
birth and date of journaling
now our concern is to highlight some
cells which are duplicate in this or
some rows which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on row number
seven we have the details of martha
and you can see the same details of
martha in the row number 14 as well
right so you need to eliminate those
cells or you need to eliminate those
rules now you can say there is a quick
way just few clicks and those will be
eliminated that is conditional
formatting yes that is also one way but
i'll show you what's the problem with
that okay so let us select the entire
table and get into conditional
formatting and here you have duplicate
values highlight cell rules with
duplicate values and there you go the
problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right so there are certain conditions or
scenarios where you cannot directly
identify which is the duplicate row
again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the entire
column of employee id and you can
identify the duplicate cells here since
the employee ids are unique for everyone
so this is a way but let's take a little
deeper and understand the
way of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new uh
column
and let's name this as duplicate
flag
e flag
so the new column has been created which
is d flag so here we will be using a
simple formula that is
count f and here press tab to select the
formula and here we will be adding our
range that is which range are you
considering so the range will be the
employee id since employee ids are
unique for every employee
and
and let's press function f4 to fix it
and now
again the criteria and the criteria will
be the same cell that is a2 and now
close the bracket and press enter
now let's track the same formula to all
the rows
okay
now here we have
now what you can do is uh sort it in an
advanced way go to sorting filter
and custom sort
and here you will be sorting by
the d flag
and it will be smallest to largest
so now
you can apply the conditional formatting
to highlight it you can select the
column h or the d flag go to conditional
formatting highlight cell rules and here
you can get into greater than
and
give the value as one
okay
so all the cells which are
you know repeated multiple times will be
selected here and they will be
highlighted with a selected color what
you have given so i've given red so now
you can select these cells and
i let them or delete them from your
spreadsheet
and now all your data in the spreadsheet
is unique and clean so that's how you
highlight duplicate cells in excel and
with that we have come to an end of this
session and if you have any queries
