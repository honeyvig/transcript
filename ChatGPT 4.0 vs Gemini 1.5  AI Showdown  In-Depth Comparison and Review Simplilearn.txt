a further Ado let's get started both
Google and openi equally share a part of
historic moment with their AI model
launch events it's nothing less to say
that they just reinvented the wheel
ground up in this video we'll discuss
the key points happened on May 14
2024 Google IO and openi along with few
others are in constant state of war
against each other on the grounds of
artificial intelligence the chat GPD 4
Omni is a faster powerful and less
expensive than its predecessor the gbd4
turbo the model can now combine text
vision and audio into a single model and
is capable of interacting with humans
like a human remember irona from rich
rich that just got real hey chat GPT I'm
Mark how are you oh
Mark I'm doing great thanks for asking
how about you hey so I'm on stage right
now I'm doing a live demo and frankly
I'm feeling a little bit nervous can you
help me calm my nerves a little bit oh
you're doing a live demo right now
that's awesome just take a deep breath
and remember you're the expert I like
that suggestion let me try a couple deep
breaths can you give me feedback on my
breaths okay here I
go whoa
slow a bit there mark you're not a
vacuum cleaner breathe in or account of
four okay uh let me try again so I'm
going to breathe in
deeply and then breathe
out for four and then exhale
slowly okay I'll try again breathing
in and breathe
out that's it how do you feel I feel a
lot better thank you so much sadly just
like aona the conversational features of
gbd4 aren't available for free to the
public users yet the voice of gbd4 omni
is presumed to be a Californian Val girl
Forni is capable of voice modulation
based on the topic of discussion it can
go sarcastic dramatic and subtle based
on the situation and emotion once upon a
time in a world not too different from
ours there was a robot named no no chbt
I really want maximal emotion like
maximal expressiveness much more than
you were doing before understood let's
amplify the drama once upon a time in a
world not too different from RS there
was a robot named bite j4 Omni is
currently free to use and the
unavailability of the conversational AI
models doesn't hurt much overball open
AI is all set with a plan to integrate 4
ohmni with the latest Apple devices now
ENT the Google Google is always one of
the healthy competitors and the grounds
of technology and chose not to take a
step back in the AI race Google launched
its latest model the Gemini 1.5 5
against omai and Google also has plans
to integrate its model with Apple's
lineup apart from that Google also
launched another weapon from its aail
called project Astra in the Collision
Course with 4 ohni as a head- onhe head
competitor Astra feels completely
similar to 4 Omni and can visually scan
things around and remember where you
left your glasses from the last time you
used them do you remember where you saw
my glasses
yes I do your glasses were on the desk
near a red
apple despite the similarities netizens
found it a little laggy in terms of
speed and voice sounds a little less
human now circling back to the spotlight
of the today's discussion the Google IO
the biggest announcement from Google is
Gemini 1.5 Pro the latest model now can
process 2 million tokens of context
windows just to get a wild guess that's
equal to 1.4 million words or 60,000
lines of code or 22 hours of audio or 2
hours of video that's basically a lot of
context and speaking of tokens the
memory they can use can make the model
expensive to cut down the cost Google
introduced something like token caching
can reuse token at a fraction of cost
apart from that let's dive into the
latest Hardware that Google has
announced Google announced the latest t
called trillum the sixth generation of
Google Cloud TPU Trillium TPU achieves
an impressive 4.7x increase in a peak
compute performance per chip compared to
TPU v5v along with Trillium Google is
here with the latest Arm based processor
the Axion for their data centers to
deliver instances up to 30% better
performance than fastest general purpose
arm-based incenses available in the
cloud today up to 50% better performance
and up to 60% better Energy Efficiency
than comparable current generation x86
baced instances also Google announced vo
the generative video model to compare
against open AI Sora we get experience
to a lot of progress compared to the
previous year from the Google's front
but find the winner of this competition
is turning out to be a little tricky
since the momentum of this AI model
competition broke out many competitors
like clu AI open AI Google and many more
are coming up with their impressive
tools and Hardware some set benchmarks
and some beted setbacks what do you
think let us know in the comments below
