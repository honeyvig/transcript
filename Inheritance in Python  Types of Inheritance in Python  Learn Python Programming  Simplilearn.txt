hello and welcome to this session of
inheritance in python
today we are going to talk about
how inheritance is implemented in python
now what's in it for you everyone we are
going to talk about the concept of
inheritance the types of inheritance
which are applicable so the different
kind of inheritance which we're gonna
talk about are single level inheritance
multi-level hierarchical and multiple
inheritance and we are going to support
each concept with an example
before
we begin this session i just want to
highlight that inheritance is not a new
concept in any of the programming
languages
just like in python this concept is
applicable across multiple programming
languages like java c plus plus etc
now what is inheritance inheritance
provides the reusability of a code
it allows you to inherit what you have
written in a particular class or a piece
of code and you don't need to rewrite it
you can inherit it
so that is the main purpose of
inheritance it is creating a new class
that utilizes the properties and
behavior of an existing class
so we will support this with an example
so if you take a look at the syntax the
sample syntax over here you have a base
class and you have certain attributes
functions
uh associated with the base class and
then you have a derived class in which
you extend
basically you inherit the base class and
you inherit the properties of the base
class
now the new class formed is called the
derived class or the child class you can
call it anything derive child or sub
class and the existing class whose
properties are inherited is known as the
base class parent or super class these
are synonymous
so any
where you hear that okay you know you're
working on a child class or derived
class you can
easily figure out that you're talking
about a derived class and whenever there
is a
reference to a parent or a super class
it means we are talking about the base
class
right
now
with this
concept with this idea let's move ahead
and
look at the different types of
inheritance which are possible
in python
now here we are trying to
display pictographically
diagrammatically the different kinds of
inheritance and this will make
understanding more clear
now let's talk about first single level
inheritance you have a class a and you
have a class b so basically only till
class b only single level child is
inheriting the
attributes the properties of classes so
that is what we call as single level
inheritance
multi-level is
you have
multiple level of inheritance
in for example class b here inherits
class a properties and class c inhibits
class b properties so ultimately you can
see
that the the properties gets trickled
down till class c right so that is the
example of a multi-level
right
next is hierarchical in which
two classes are inheriting from a single
class class b
is also inheriting from class a
and class c is also inheriting from
class a so both class b and class c
are kind of siblings to the parent class
a right
multiple inheritance it means that a
child class in is inheriting properties
from two parent classes so in this
example the class c is inherited the
properties of class a also and class b
also
so we will be looking at these examples
when we will be running in python
now let's
take this example with a real world
object right let's first try to
give you a
view of how we are going to how what we
want to explain in the inheritance with
real world objects right now here we are
taking an example of a black and white
tv and a color tv
now single level inheritance in this
type of inheritance there is only one
single derived class from a single base
class as i mentioned earlier so for
example you can assume there is a class
called black and white tv and what are
the attributes of a simple black and
white tb it has a regulator it has a
sound adjustment
now
there is a child class called color tv
which inherits the basic attributes of
course a color tv also has a regulator
or sound adjustment
but
additionally on top of it it also
provides new features like color picture
and cable connection
so now
what do you understand by this is that
the child inherits the basic properties
from the parent class
but it also adds on the new additional
features so the color tv does not need
to rewrite or
the
functionality of a regulator and the
sound adjustment it has inherited it
multi-level
very similar to single level but now we
are adding more features
so like in the previous example color tv
inherited the features of black from
black and white tv
now we move a step ahead now there is
another classification another
advancement of wi-fi led tv so that has
also inherited the features from color
tv right so it's a multi-level
inheritance
so just to reiterate the black and white
tv had channel regulator dish antenna
the color tv added additional features
of color picture quality and cable
connection
and the wi-fi enabled tv added the new
smart features to the tv which is
generated from the color tv
multiple inheritance now in multiple
inheritance the derived class is
inherited from more than one base class
right so now for example over here you
have a class called android which is an
android operating system based class and
one is the wi-fi led class which has the
wi-fi features like sound picture wi-fi
enablement and if you combine all these
features and bring it into another child
class that class is the smart tv class
which has the features of android and
the features of wi-fi led tv and then
you call it as a smart tv it has all the
android applications it has the wi-fi
features and etc so this is the example
of multiple inheritance getting the best
of
all the parents
hierarchical
if more than one class is inherited from
the base class right so now if we just
tweak our prior example and you know
just
rephrase it what we are saying is now
from the black and white tv you can also
make a color tv
you can also make a smart tv or you can
also make a wi-fi led tv right so there
is no restriction as such so basically
the color tv is also inheriting the
features of a black and white tv
smart tv is also inheriting the features
of a black and white tv and the wi-fi
led tv also is narrating the features
from black and white tv so it's a very
typical example of a hierarchical in
inheritance
so now let's
quickly look at the examples
okay so let's start off
with a
very simple
single
level inheritance
let's make a class
and
create a function
called speak
and print something
okay
now let's make another class
so what we did was we created a class
called homo sapiens and in the and now
we are creating a clause called man
which inherits
uh the attributes
of homo sapiens
and we say
create a function which is specific
to man so homosapiens has a function
which called speak and man has a
function called talk
and let's print it
now
let's create an object of
man
now
what does this signify
the man
class is also inheriting whatever is
there in homo sapiens so man can even
talk and he can even speak right
so what we are going to do is
first we are going to execute the
function
speak
so the
the base class function got called speak
and it is printing homo sapien speaking
and also
we can call the child function
man talking okay so so if you see
this is the basic difference which we
want to highlight
that
just you have created the object only
for the child class not the parent so
now making by making the object of the
child class
you can invoke the parent class function
as well as the child because the child
has inherited the parent features
now
let's take an example of
multi-level
so we will
continue from our previous example we
will create a class homo sapiens
define in
functions peak
and
print
now we will make another class
man
now we are saying
man can
walk
so we are saying man walking
now this is the third level this is the
multi-level
man child
and
we are saying that a man child can eat
so ultimately the man child can speak
can walk can eat all three operations
can be performed
so we are gonna make a object of
manchild
and now
python will allow us
invoke
walk function
speak function
and
eat function
so this is a typical example of
multi-level
hierarchy
now
moving to our
next type of inheritance which is the
multiple inheritance
where the child
is deriving
attributes properties from
two parents
so we will now create a class called
calculation1
in our example
and let's make a function
sum
and
it will return
calculation x plus y
second
calculation two
and
let's create
operation subtraction
and it will return x minus y
okay
now
we will create
the derived class which is in editing
both calculation one and calculation two
and
let's create
its own
function called
multiplication
okay so derived class now has a sum
function subtraction function and
multiplication okay
so let's create an object for derived
and
now let's
invoke the relevant functions
so sum
120
subtraction
it should say minus 40
and
multiplication
thousand
so if you see
it's it's different from multi-level
it's multiple it means that the child
class
has inherited from two parents it's
relevant functions right
and that's how we are able to call them
in the derived class
now let's take another type hierarchical
inheritance
okay
so in hierarchical in inheritance
let's go back to our example
of first we have the black and white tv
and
we will create a function called
antenna
print channels are telecasted through
antenna
then we will create
color tv
and
we will define its own function called
cable connection
plus it has an edited the function
called antenna from black and white tv
here it is okay
now we are gonna create another
class called as
wi-fi led tv which is also in editing
from black and white
now in this we are defining bluetooth
tethering function
[Applause]
okay
and let's make another smart tv
okay and then we are gonna
you can watch
android applications on otp platform
right so this is the
class of smart tv
okay so what we have done eventually
over here is we have created a black and
white tv
color tv also in edits from black and
white tv wi-fi led also in edits from
black and white tv smart tv also in
edits from black and white tv
okay
now
let's try to
create the
relevant objects
we will first create an object of color
tv
then we will create
wi-fi led tv
and then we will create
smart tv
okay
now we will have the relevant functions
available to invoke
so both all the child all the children
objects now will have an antenna
function a1
a2
and a3
all three are having the antenna
function so we can just try to print it
okay
and then
we can invoke the relevant
child functions
a1
cable connection
bluetooth ring
and
android applications
so if you see this is an example of
hierarchy
you have color wi-fi led in smart tv all
inheriting the black and white tv
features
and its own
its own feature
[Music]
okay
now along with this concept let me just
also introduce
some relevant concepts which are
applicable
along with
the inheritance concept which will be
helpful
i also want to show you
the example of
init function
init function
is a constructor in python language
and it is called by default whenever you
instantiate an object
so let me give you an example over here
so here you have a
class person
and you have
we are just defining the init function
the constructor
okay and
we are just
defining certain attributes
instantiating certain attributes in the
person
first name and the last name
another function which i am calling is
the
print name
and i'll print the name it's a
straightforward function
okay so
what i'm doing is i am creating a child
class now
called as student
which has inherited
uh the features attributes of the person
based class
and
i'm also making a constructor for
student
and from student
i am invoking the
constructor of the person class right
so now if you see i'm going to make an
object of student
and initialize it with
the self the first name and the last
name
and in eventually
the
parent class init function is being
called first name and the last name and
this function diff print name it will
print james anderson right as i have
already initiated the
parameters
okay so if you see now what have i done
i have
the attribute values in the parent class
are getting printed
by invoking the constructor of the child
class
so what happened when you invoke student
by default this init function got
invoked the parameters of james and
anderson got passed
then from person you invoke the
constructor in it and here now the first
name and last name got initialized
and then it got printed
so this is the basic feature of a init
function
now
like the way i have called person dot
init over here i i can also make a call
to super there is a keyword called super
keyword
so let's just take an example of super
keyword
okay
let me have my child class like the
previous one parent class the person
class
and
i'll have to just make a change in my
student class
in the init function instead of parent
dot init i will call
super dot in it
this is the keyword
super function
which will always
invoke the parent class
gives you the handle to the parent class
and then you can invoke the relevant
method
and
the invocation methodology will be the
same
and you can
check the output it's going to be the
same but it's that the syntax is
different there is another keyword which
is available for you to invoke the
parent so you don't need to know the
class
of the parent you can just make a call
to the super
now let's also take a look at another
utility utility function called is
subclass right
so
what we are going to do is
we are going to create a function
[Music]
calculation one
calculation two okay so we have created
two classes calculation one calculation
two independent classes
no one inheriting each other
now we are going to create a derived
class
now this is the example what we had done
earlier very similar to multiple
inheritance so we are just actually
creating a
multiple inheritance example
okay so you have a derived class which
has multiple inheritance from
calculation one and calculation two
summation multiplication and divide
relevant functions are there
now we will check
which class is a sub class of which one
right
so let's create an object of derived
now what we want to print is that
whether derived
is a sub class of calculation 2
and it should return true
and let's see
another is calculation one a subclass of
calculation two it should return false
right because these two are independent
classes so is subclass is another
function which is available in python
which helps you
decide you know you can check whether
which is a derived class and which is
not a direct class
next
let's take an example of another
function called is instance okay
we will take the same
set of functions
create an object of derived
and check
whether
the object d is of which
is it is it of a instance of class
derived or not it's true so instead of
derived if i make it as calculation 2
for example now if i say c
equal to
calculation 1
and say c
is instance of derived
it should say
false but if i say
calculation 1
it should say true
and if i say
calculation 2
should say false because
calculation class is an independent
class d is a derived class from
calculation 1 and calculation 2. so
basically d is in is instance of both
calculation one calculation two so it
will always return true
i hope you had a great learning session
with these concepts and i look forward
to connecting with you guys in my next
session thank you very much
