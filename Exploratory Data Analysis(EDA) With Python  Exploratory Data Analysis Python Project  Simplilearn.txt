hey everyone welcome to Simply Learn
Today We Will Learn Python exploratory
data analytics in this tutorial we will
be going through the fundamentals of
data analysis with python that covers
the data analysis libraries data
visualizations and much more for better
understanding let's go through a simple
use case on analyzing student
performance so that we can come up with
a report to assist improvisation in
their academic performance so here's the
context let's imagine our client from
the educational institute who runs a
couple of schools in the city he and his
school administration identified a
growing concern about the overall
development of their students realizing
that academic Focus alone was not
yielding in the desired results to
address this issue they hired a data
analyst to investigate key factors
influencing Student Success the anal
list highlighted critical parameters
like physical fitness parental education
rest and recovery and access to
resources as contributors to students
Performance Based on these findings the
school recognized that a holistic
approach is needed they decided to
invest in programs that promote overall
development by focusing on key areas
targeted by the analyst the school now
successfully enhances both academic
firmance and overall development of
their students the key to this success
was by Python's exploratory data
analysis using which the analyst Deep
dive into data about critical aspects of
a student's day-to-day schedule now
let's go through a similar approach
through our demonstration on Python's
exploratory data analysis but before
that if these are the type of videos

and description box below to find a data
science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with our python exploratory
data analysis but before getting started
with the demonstration let's have a
brief understanding of exactly what is
exploratory analysis is this anything
different from regular data analysis
yeah that's exactly what we're going to
discuss now types of data analysis so
basically there are two different types
of data analysis initial data analysis
and exploratory data analysis now what
is initial data analysis and what is
exploratory data analysis let's
understand a little briefing about these
both first let's get started with
initial data analysis so what exactly do
you mean by initial data analysis so
data can be in any form it can be an
Excel file it can be a SQL file it can
be a PDF it can be an XML it can be even
a website whatever it is it is Data if
you have some information in this which
can be used to extract some valuable
information then it is Data so initi
data analysis is a process of inspecting
the data and screening the data that
takes place after data collection and
before statistical analysis so before
you conduct any statistical formulas and
analysis on the data and squeeze the
data to extract some valuable insights
the process which you perform is called
as initial data analysis like taking the
data from The Source cleaning the data
transforming the data into a readable
format and using that readable data to
build some basic charts what exactly is
happening with this particular company
brand or anything let's say I give you
some data from the company then you get
some insights of it how many number of
traffic you receive how many number of
orders you received what's the sale that
you made in a specific month specific
quarter or specific year and what was
the profit so basic information which
you convert from the data and create a
dashboard right that is called as
initial data analysis so a step Beyond
initial data analysis is known as the
exploratory data analysis this is where
you perform some statistics and
probability and predict the future right
so let's dive deep and learn what
exactly is exploratory data analysis so
a simple definition for exploratory data
analysis is as follows exploratory data
analysis is a key step in data analysis
process that helps you identify patterns
outliners and relationships between V
variables before making assumptions it
is not like you just create a dashboard
out of the initial data analysis and you
can predict the future no it's not like
that you might have to last you might
have to go through some permutations and
combinations you might have to check the
seasons you might have to check the
possibilities right during some
particular seasons in the year let's say
it's Christmas then you can expect some
good sales let's say it's some Festival
it's some special occasion you can
expect some good sales on the product
right and maybe a part of the year maybe
a part of 10 years a decade right in a
certain period of time there might be
some reason due to which the sales of a
certain product were high so to make
sure that your assumptions to make sure
that your projection of the sales is
100% accurate or at least 90 to 95%
accurate then you might have to go
through the exploratory data analysis
where you make use of statistics in your
data analysis now there are certain
steps that you might have to follow
while going through exploratory data
analysis so following are the steps so a
first few steps might be slightly
relevant to initial data analysis like
connecting data cleaning it transforming
it and loading it after that you will
import certain libraries from Python and
after that you read the data what
exactly you have in your data the number
of columns the number of rows and if
there are any null values if there are
any uh entries which are invalid you
might have to check that read that and
you might have to check for duplicate
entries it is possible that one entry
might have been entered by two different
people right there might be a
duplication so you might have to
eliminate those duplications you might
have to check for some missing values
you might have to calculate the total
number of missing values from the data
set and try to eliminate them from the
calculation during your explorat data
analysis followed by that that you have
to do some model engineering followed by
that you might have to do some feature
engineering creating features and then
you will get started with explorat data
analysis and the at the end you will
generate a projection or a prediction or
give you an assumption that this might
happen in the future and you might have
to take action to avoid it or you might
have to take action to improvise it
right so this is how the steps in
explorat data analysis take part now
let's proceed and start with our demo on
Python's exploratory data analysis and
in this session we will be using the use
case that we discussed before which
happens to be the students performance
data set so in this particular data set
we will be having some columns based on
physical activity the distance from home
parental education the subjects the
marks they have scored in the previous
exam the marks that they have scored in
the previous exam and if they have any
disabilities if there are having any
resources that they require to write the
exams right so a few parameters the
important parameters that we will be
discussing in this session and followed
by that we will project the future that
how they will you know improve in their
exams and if there is a problem and if
there is a solution to that then we can
Implement that solution and help
students to gain better marks in their
exam so that's the overall use case for
this demonstration now let's get started
with our Jupiter notebook now we are on
Jupiter notebook now let's get started
so I would like to have a title for my
notebook so I'll write an HTML code for
that so HTML code
uh and I have uh three
apostrophes and here I would like to
write something in H1 so I want my title
to be in H1
[Music]
so style will be
background
color color name will be dark
blue so we Let's uh proceed with the
simply L background which will be dark
blue
usually and the
color of text will be
orange and I also want to have the font
let's Let me give the font size as
30 and in the next line I'd like to have
border radius I can give the Border
radius as 20
pixels and padding to be 16 pixels
text alignment I'd like to keep it
Center there you go let's code the let's
close the H1 and now let's code the uh
background color or border color
so b
style so what we can do is we can
basically have this uh code here and
what we will do is we will reuse this
particular code segment because we will
be having multiple HTML codes in this
particular uh workbook which will
explain the results of the analysis that
we are doing so the way we just run the
code and after that we will be getting
some visualizations and I will be
writing some textual content in HT in an
HTML page so that it will be easier for
for the people to understand what's what
exactly is happening here right so the
color will be light blue and now comes
the text we will close this and here we
will write the text
as
python
exploratory data
analysis and we
will break
here for student performance
and here we will close the
H1 and lastly we will display this in
HTML code so basically we miss this
Library so we will be importing from
IPython display import HTML to display
this particular code so without this
particular Library we cannot display any
HTML codes in our notebook so we will
quickly run that and we have a title
over here now let's proceed with the
next part now we will uh use some
libraries like CAD boost and light bgm
so for that we might have to install the
these libraries so we will be using pip
install here pip install cat
boost and controll enter to run this
particular code segment or you can also
use run and it's installed and after
that we will also in
install Light
bgm G sorry not
bgm so it's already installed now we
will start importing the libraries that
we need so we will be needing numai
Panda seon Matt blood Li and we will
also import another special Library
which is for ignoring warnings so we
will import warnings and after that from
we will be importing that warnings from
I python display import clear output and
after that we will uh tell the Jupiter
notebook to import if there are any
warnings so that code will be warning.
filter warnings and in the uh brackets
we will write ignore so uh the basic
libraries which we will be needing are
as follows
import
numai as V Let's quickly copy this and
proceed enter and now we will be needing
pandas as
PD enter and now we will be needing
[Music]
cbon
SNS and we will also use mat plot
lip. py plot
as
PLT and after that we will import
warnings
from I
python.
display
import
clear
output
warnings do filter warnings
ignore now we'll just quickly run this
query run and now we will proceed with
feature
engineering so you can use a hashtag to
ignore that particular line from
execution for jupyter
Notebook and here we will be importing
import
re from
sklearn do impute
input simple
imputer from SK learn do
model
selection import kfold there you go now
let's quickly run this
query there you go now we will proceed
with modeling and model evaluation once
we are done with this then we will
Direct import the data into our notebook
so for modeling the data we will again
use a hash code so that this particular
line will not
execute and import some libraries Li GT
GBM as
LGB from light GBM
Library import
lgbm
regressor from CAD boost
import add poost regressor there you go
let's quickly run this
command there you go now lastly we have
one more task before importing the data
that is model evaluation once that is
done we can proceed with importing the
data there you go let's quickly run it
and now so far so good we have uh done
the basic Library Imports and feature
engineering is done modeling is done and
model evaluation is also done now we can
begin with importing the data so we
let's also add U the HTML code where we
have done this importing so here I will
try to add another segment and I will
import the HTML code here which displays
a similar HTML format which explains
what exactly is happening here just a
moment I have the code ready I'll just
paste it here there you go let's quickly
run this so that we have a HTML code
here page here which explains what
exactly is happening here so we're
importing libraries and also student
data now let's import the student data
so that let's write the query so we are
importing the data as data frame and
after that we will write pandas read CSV
right and here we will add the location
of the file right so the file is located
in my downloads section so let's quickly
copy that location and paste it here so
this is the location of my file let's
quickly run it so there might be some
error it's okay we can resolve it so in
such scenarios you don't have to worry
either you can add an R but even if that
doesn't work you might have to change uh
in this case it worked but in case if it
doesn't work what you can do is uh you
can eliminate uh the r and you can just
change this from uh forward slash to
back slash this will also help so this
could be worth it so this can also work
so these are the situations where you
can use this now let's proceed with some
more uh interesting facts let's try to
understand what's going on with our uh
data set right so what you can do is now
the data is stored in DF variable as a
data frame so what you can do is read
this particular data DF do shape so that
you can understand what's the uh what's
happening with this data right so it can
tell you that there are uh 6 sorry
6,67 rows and 20 columns now let's add
another query part and here you can uh
try to see the head right right what
head means basically head means uh the
column headers so what you can do is
just write DF do
head and run now you have the column
headers and couple of sample columns
right sorry couple of sample rowes now
let's proceed with uh checking the
duplicates and identifying the total
number of duplicate entries in this
particular data set so you can write
down DF dot U
duplicated
dot sum and you will get the number of
duplicates present in this particular
file so we have zero duplicate entries
now let's see if there are any null uh
elements in this particular data frame
so DF do is
null dot
sum so these are all functions control
enter there you go so in the column
teacher quality
there are 78 null entries and in
Parental educational level there are 90
null entries and distance from home
there are 67 null entries now what we
can do is uh from the okay so from DF
shape we can add a new cell here and we
can write a HTML code so that the viewer
can understand that we trying to
understand our data so let's write a
quick code for that so let's not waste
much time in just writing the HT HML
code so I've got that HTML code written
in a notepad already so I'll just past
it over here and let's quickly run it so
that we have a HTML visibility here so
this was supposed to be the result so we
will add it here so what we will do is
quickly edit this particular content
we'll just quickly copy this code and
paste it over
here change the content from importing
libraries to
reading student data and we will cut
this code from here and we will paste it
in
here so that it give give us some
information let's also run this
particular code
segment so that we have trading student
data there you go now the next part of
this session will be about creating a
Target variable so overall Target of
this particular data analysis is about
exam score right so we can name our
Target variable as exam score and let's
understand the distribution of this
particular exam score with uh the
variables we have now let's write down
plot.
figure figure size should be around 15
comma
9 equals ALS to let's add a bracket here
15 comma 9 or let's keep it as six 9
would be a little bigger now enter now
we'll use cabon Library here SNS dot
count
plot X is equals to data frame cleaned
Target okay uh before cleaned Target we
might have to run a few more okay we did
not perform data cleaning so far right
so let's proceed with data cleaning so
far so we found some empty entries right
null entries and we also found some so
here we have 299 rows which have missing
values so we will have to remove that
for that uh we might have to create a
new column which has to be named as not
um assigned right DF data frame not
assigned which is equals to DF do drop
na so we will be dropping the null
values here it's a function function and
here let's print the values print DF do
DF hore na do shape so how many number
of rows and columns we have right and
after that let's also try to eliminate
the null values as well do a is null so
we don't have basically we don't have
null values but we have U some illegal
entries maybe some there you go now
let's quick run this query so there you
go so the new data is about
678a
20 so there is some okay we did uh some
mistake here so we supposed to add it as
null Nu NL n Now quickly run this so we
should not get any errors this
time there you go no errors so far so
good now let's describe the new data set
DF na dot describe so these are the new
columns and rows that we have and we
have uh mean standard variation standard
deviation minimum maximum so the scores
are split into 25% 50% and 75% which
could be based on hours studied which
could be based on attendance sleep hours
previous course tutoring sessions
everything so uh minimum sleep hours
maximum sleep hours 25% of that 50% of
that 75% % of that so that is supposed
to be the um describe now what we will
do is we have a Target variable which is
exam score right now we will do some
changes to it we already know in an exam
there will be a threshold value it can
be 25 marks per exam it can be 50 marks
per exam and it can be 100 marks per
exam right in our situation let's
consider the threshold value is 100
marks right if there is a situation
situation where marks is entered in a
wrong way right it can if they add if
they wanted to add 11 but by mistake if
they added uh another one right triple
one it's not a right entry right so we
will try to eliminate those kind of
data so we will create a new uh data
frame here which is the data frame
cleaned is equals to data frame
underscore not null so we have
eliminated the null values
dfdore na now we will add our Target
variable which is exam
score should be so let's come out of
this and here we will add it as should
be less than or equal to 100 but not
more than 100 let's use square
brackets here we also the format is
square brackets actually actually now
enter
and we will describe this
particular data set instead of D FNA we
will copy paste this here now let's run
this okay exam score is not identified
let's quickly check the error and
resolve it yeah so we missed out to add
U colons here it's okay not a problem so
this was supposed to be how it is now
let's run this and we will have the
answer over here so we have the output
now let's check the
head of this particular clean data set
so we can make use of the same code here
and paste it right here and instead of
describe let's write head so that we
have the header of uh this particular
data set so we have our study and
everything normal and we will categorize
the data right so we will make use of
three columns our study attendance and
previous course and uh after that we
will also make use of other columns in
this particular data set which happens
to be the parental involvement access to
resources sleep hour storing sessions
Etc and now our Target will be the exam
score that we created over here right
this exam score will be our Target and
using this particular exam score Target
we will categorize the data okay we will
categorize the data in terms of uh let's
say uh first class uh second class and
uh pass or something like that right so
if if a student is uh scoring below 64
and uh that is a separate category if
the student is scoring equals to or
above 65 that is a different category
and if the student is scoring Beyond 70
that's a different category and uh
before we proceed with that let's try to
add a HTML code before this particular
data set so that we have um an
understanding of what exactly happened
here so I let's I'll just quickly copy
paste this particular code here so we
will run it and now next we will
describe check the data type column
separate and everything and we will you
know create data type category
variables right now so far so good now
we will create the categories so num
call equals
to ours
studied comma
attendance so let's quickly add the
data previous exam
scores just a minute let's quickly add
the columns let me take a while there
you go I've added the columns so we are
considering three different columns uh
our stance and previous course for Num
call and Cat call we are considering the
other columns apart from the first three
and our Target value is exams score
let's quickly run this there you go and
now we will try to build some
visualizations and before that let's try
to uh add some data uh from in HTML
let's try to create a okay what we can
do is simply copy this particular HTML
file here we can take
this and add it here so that we will
understand what exactly is happening
next and in place of reading student
data we will write data visualization
for student
data and we will keep the color same
dark blue background and uh the color
for data visualization will be light
blue and student data will be Orange
Let's quickly run and there we have it
now our Target variable is exam score
right now we will compare this
particular Target variable with three
other parameters so our parameters will
be the following uh as we discussed uh
creating the segregation in data set
right so first will be distribution of
Target variable with other parameters so
we will create another HTML file for
that right here just a minute while I
paste the code for HTML quickly run this
there you go so distribution of Target
variable exam score against some
parameters now we will write the plot
for
that plot. figure so we are going to
consider the size equals to 15 comma
6 Pig
size is equals to 15 comma 6 the same
one that we considered before and we
will be using cbon SNS dot count
plot Open Bracket this a function x
equals to
DF cleaned okay uh what we can do is
just quickly take the
colum name so that we don't create any
mistakes here and we will paste it over
here in srip TF there you go of
Target so our Target is exam score comma
and we will use the pet as
green and the plot title will be
distribution of Target variable exam
scod we can copy this okay just a minute
before that PLT do
title should be let's use double codes
now copy this and paste it
here I think semicolon went off okay not
a
problem it's right here let's add a DOT
as a full stop and the next line if you
need you can add the full stop if not
you can ignore PLT do grid
true which equals to
major
comma AIS is equals to
Y comma line style equals
to so I want lines to be hyen hyon in
this way I want the lines and comma line
width U let's say 0.5 or 0.7 let's go
with
0.7 line width equals to 0.9 m
there you go now let's quickly run this
query there you go done and we have the
first visualization so here you can see
there are some students which are
scoring 58 59 and you can see maximum
number of students are already scoring
good marks which is under 65 and uh
sorry which is under 70 and above 65 and
there is a good number of students uh
which are also scoring uh above 65 as
well right so sorry 70 70 as well so we
have it less than or equal to 70 71 and
highest scorer in some situations there
is also 100 if you can see there is
slight growth here there are a few
students toop us maybe which have
already scored at 100 as well now we
have the list here now we what we need
to do is we need to segregate that is
part one which is less than or equal to
64 which falls under 65 and another
category which falls in between 65 to 70
and above 70 so we need to categorize
these three uh datas and segregate them
as bottom 65 top which is above 70 and
mid between 70 to 65 right now before
that if you want to add an HTML document
uh sorry segment here which explains
about the distribution of Target you can
also do that it's already added here now
let's continue but in case if you want
to uh add uh some data which explains
that we're trying to segregate you can
also do that uh I would like to do do
that let's quickly add that HTML code
here so what this particular code will
do is it will tell the percentage of
students which are scoring less than 65
number of St uh percentage of students
uh scoring in between 65 and 70 and the
percent of students which are scoring
Beyond 70 right let's run this and here
we have the result bottom 2.81% scores
under 64 while 24% scores over 70 and
50% are in between 65 to 69 right now
let's uh continue with the segregation
part of the data so for segregation we
will create three different variables a
b c so first a is equals to length of DF
cleaned so let's copy the column name
sorry data frame name length of DF
cleaned inside the square bracket we'll
again add DF cleaned of Target variable
which is exam score
let's also add uh single quotes
here who are scoring in between or less
than let's start with less than or equal
to 64 we'll not consider 65 we'll
consider 64 divided by Len of DF cleaned
Target variable exam score single codes
into
100 which will give us the percentage
now similarly let's just copy and paste
this three more times for B and C so
here instead of minus supposed to add
equals to and another one so here equals
to and instead of a I will write B and
the last one is C and instead of 64 we
will add 70 here for top and here we
will make some changes it should be
greater than or equal to
65 so this is the third category a b c
and then we will proceed with printing
the files so
print the
bottom for the first one which is f of
a is to do
2f and we will add the percentage symbol
over here uh
under
64 now we can copy paste the same here
and we can change the
variables so here we will be adding
under over
70 lastly in between the ones in
between 65 and
70 there you go here we will change the
values from A to B and here a to c there
you go and we can quickly run this query
so it's not 70 it was supposed to be
69 there you go so we forgot to mention
this particular one now let's run
this there you go so we have
21% of people who are scoring under 64
24% over 70 and 53% are in between
average so I think the school is
focusing on improving this particular
percentage reducing this particular
percentage and increasing this
particular percentage and try to
eliminate if possible this particular
one which are under 64 so that is the
overall Moto I guess now so far so good
let's now try to remove infinite values
from HTML right so before that let's add
this particular HTML code here so which
explains what we are trying to do so we
will first implement the code that
prevents warning abouts in finite values
during data visualization and now let's
add the code which will try to eliminate
the uh infinite values let's copy this
particular data frame cleaned uh data
frame name here now DF cleaned do
replace square brackets NP dot
info comma minus NP
do info out of the square brackets do
NP do
na non any values we're trying to
eliminate any values in place of those
values you can write true and after that
we will try to element the null so if it
is
null do some give me the total number of
null values after this right so let's
try to execute that there you go so all
the null entries have been removed here
now let's see the distribution of
numerical values here so before that
let's add the HTML code for that so
let's quickly run this so distribution
of numerical values so we will be
considering these three parameters so if
you go back here you can see our studied
attendance and previous course so we
will be considering these three values
or these three columns and check the
distribution of these variables against
the exam scope so uh is it making any um
you know kind of variation if the uh
attendance is high if if the attendance
is high is the exam score high and uh
apart from that we have if our studies
is high is the uh Mark score is high and
if the previous scores are high is there
a chance to get better scores in this
particular exam so what we are trying to
do is we are trying to see if there is
any direct involvement of number of
study hours and number of days attended
and number of uh or the number of marks
they received in the previous course and
we'll try to build a visualization on
that
front so let's go and build that so
we'll try the try to write the code here
figure
access equals to
PLT
Dot sub plots so we will be having three
different plots here since we're
considering three different uh
categories and the fixed size should be
equal to 12a 4 there you go
now
access is equals to access do
reel for
idx comma call
in
enumerate and we will try to import the
cbone library here we will try to create
histop plots here histograms
here histop plot
so line style we will be selecting this
one and
comma line width will be
0.7 there you go next will be access
ITX do
set title so for this we will be uh
setting the title as distribution of
columns so the columns will be the three
uh ones attendance I was studied and uh
what was the third one that we
considered previous course right so
instead of mentioning them specifically
what we can do is we can just write
columns here C and close
there you go and
lastly PLT
doti and show the plot there you go
let's quickly run this query run and now
we will be having the visualizations
here so you can directly see the
involvement of these three parameters
here if they are trying to help if the
number of hours are increased then you
can see if there is a better Improvement
in scores if the attendance is increased
if there is a betterment in scores or if
the previous uh scores are helping then
you can find it out how it is there you
go now we can write a result here in the
form of HTML page and if we run this it
will give you the result the breaks or
gaps in the our studed variable may be
due to the respondents answering
appropriately the variables attendance
and previous course which exhibit a
uniform distribution have a normal
impact on exam scores variable which is
a target variable now let's proceed with
another part of this session which will
be about the relationship between the
numerical values and the target
variables now we will copy paste the
same code and make some menu changes to
it so the only change that we did to it
is we're trying toh build a scatter plot
so we will be getting a scatter plot
here but before that let's try to add
another column here and try to add an
HTML code which explains why we are
doing
it there you go SC plot so basically
these two are one and the same here we
use some column graphs so here we did
the same using the scatter plot which
will help for a better understanding now
we will try to build some
correlations so basically a list is
called correlation is created containing
the names of the columns for which you
want to calculate the correlation so
here in our situation it is the DF docr
which is a data frame and it is created
by selecting only these columns for DF
clean data frame effect effectively
created a new data frame containing only
the specified columns now the second one
which is the co which is a calculate
correlation so this method computes the
correlation Matrix for selected columns
which is in DFC RR the one indicates
perfect positive correlation minus one
indicates the perfect negative
correlation and zero indicates no
correlation and lastly the setup of plot
this line sets up the figure size of the
plot in this particular situation we are
choosing five and four right now let's
quickly try to execute this query and
see the answer and we will also add the
HTML code for this so that we have a
better understanding for
this so we will be adding that
HTML uh box here which will explain what
exactly happened here so this is our
plot and this is the
correlation now let's try to add that
HTML code right here the result of this
particular data visualization will be
maintained here so the our study and
attendance shows a positive
correlationship with the target variable
which is exam SWA however previous
course appears to have no or little
relationship with the target variable
right now let's continue with our next
uh part of the session so now we will
try to identify the relationship between
studies hours and attendance and
extracurricular scores right so we have
other uh columns to consider which is
extracurricular activities so there is a
belief that extracurricular activities
will also help students to study better
so we will find if there is a relation
between the target variable and these
extra activities attendance and study
hours now let's quickly add the code
here now let's quickly execute the code
now we have the visualization which
explains the relationship between the
number of our studied extracurricular
activities Etc so here it is and now
let's add an HTML code which explains
about this
result think this particular code was
supposed to be added
here so this uh is the resultant column
here now here it explains about the
influences that it performs so the extra
collect activities parental income and
extra things that influence the scores
and there you
go now let us also consider other
columns right the other parameters like
resources are available or not parental
education and other things which also
might have influenced the exam scores of
students so for that let's add an HTML
code so that we have an HTML page here
which explains what is the next
procedure that we are following right
now let's add the query here so here we
are considering the other parameters
like family income peer influence
motivation level gender parental
involvement parental educational level
and extracurricular AC activities and we
are considering them against the target
variable which is exam score and now
let's execute this
query there you go now we have generated
a graph which explains about this
particular parameters against the target
variable and now let's add the HTML page
here which explains about these
results let's quickly run it and there
you go so when certain factors affect q1
and Q2 but not Q2 it can be understood
that individual has has overcome
challenges through personal effort right
so if Government policies and corporate
social contributors are focused on
addressing these aspect it seems that we
could create Dynamic country with
greater social mobility and open
opportunities for all all right so if
extracurricular activities can outweigh
the influence of other variables in
academic performance then we should
foster that kind of environment right so
this is how uh you can get extract some
statistical analysis on this particular
data set now let's quickly rename this
uh
python
Eda
students
performance and you can quickly renam
and save it and that brings us to the
end of the session on python exploratory
data analysis if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session and if you require any of
the resources used in the session like
