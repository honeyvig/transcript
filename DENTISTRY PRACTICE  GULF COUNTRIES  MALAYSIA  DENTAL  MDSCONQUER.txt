periodontist I'm currently working as an
assistant professor in Masa University
and a member of MDS concus
so I'm working right now in Malaysia so
many post MDS they require they are
saying no saturations on these things
but I say that there are various options
in abroad so just we'll go a few options
options especially most of them are
aspirant towards Gulf and Gulf
opportunities golf there are they call
us DCC countries that is six countries
that includes Kuwait Qatar Oman Bahrain
Saudi and in Dubai there are once again
Buddha and Dubai so when you see all
this each has their own style of
examination pattern first we'll start
with the one all the GCC countries they
require minimum two years of post MDS
experience then only you can go as a
specialist person or otherwise you
should go as a general practitioner so
as if you want to be a specialist
practitioner
[Music]
after two years after your MDS you just
you should do the data flow that is data
flow means there is you can do online
also there is specific account called
Syria DHC account you can go to that
account open your account like how you
do your Gmail and then there will be
sequential steps to upload all your
certificates so this is a third party so
once the certificates are uploaded
it will take some time for the
verification and they will ask you to
pay money online once the data flow
report comes that is called as data flow
report you should be always positive
that means that all these certificates
are genuine then you should write for
the DHA Examination for Dubai or the Abu
Dhabi exam that is hard so if you pass
or give the examination then you should
synchronize these two and you will get
an eligibility letter so with the help
of this eligibility letter you should
apply to the gulf any I mean in Dubai
any clinics if they're in need of your
branch definitely they will come out
into license and you can start
practicing in Dubai
doctor
and very simple do the data flow process
then write the hard examination once you
have done the hard examination data flow
process you synchronize both you will
get an eligibility letter once you get
the engine ventilator you should go to
the heart I mean go to the Abu Dhabi
then you should clear that then
availability letter will be converted
into your license and you can practice
in Abu Dhabi this requires if you want
to write this it requires minimum post
MDS two years of experience to go as
special spirit
quite after MDS the minimum experience
required post MDS is 3 years but the
problem with the kovite is you should
work sorry you should go to the quiet
and do the examination there in quiet
not in India so you should get an
opportunity first to go to Kuwait then
do the examination there there will be
two exams both Theory and practical once
you clear the theory examination and
practical examination the quiet release
the quiet ministry will issue minister
of Health license then automatically can
work in quit as in clinician
the last two DCC countries one is Saudi
one is Oman for Saudi and Oman
for examination that is Prometric
examination which you call it as mcqs
examination you can write in India but
for Saudi you can write the Prometric
examination India as well as you can
write the examination in Saudi you
should get an opportunity to work in
samadhi but to work there minimum post
MPS two years two years experience is
required whereas for Oman
that is commonly called as musket first
you should write the examination in
India then for the interview you should
go to Muscat and then you should clear
the interview then the license will be
offered so automatically once the
license is sued and practiced as a
clinician in Oman and you can go to
Saudi also after two years of experience
you can work as a clinician there but
the main difference is Oman requires
three years of experience Saudi requires
two years of experience so after once
you clear the Ministry of Health
examination then you are eligible to
practice in Saudi and this main
advantage is once the exam is cleared it
is valid for Lifetime if you want to
work in Malaysia like how I'm working
right now in Malaysia after MDS minimum
three years of experience is required
once the Malaysian after if after you
finish your three years of proposed MDS
you should apply for the various
universities in Malaysia there are seven
private universities in Malaysia you can
apply to any of the universities and
once your CV is shortlisted they will
conduct an interview and once the
interview is once the interview if
you're qualifying for the interview then
this marks will be sent to the ministry
of a foreign affairs and once they
decide that the job is valid for you and
said after verifying all your
certificates then your Visa will be
issued and you can work as an
academician in Malaysia but the
disadvantage with Malaysia is you can't
work as a clinician in Malaysia only our
decreased value to work as an
accommodation only in Malaysia thank you
very much
