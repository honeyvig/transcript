welcome to the realm of Cutting Edge
technology have you ever wondered what
it would be like to harness the immense
power of Google's Computing
infrastructure right at your fingertips
we'll look no further for in the digital
realm there exists a phenomenon known as
Google collab an interesting Fusion of
cloud computing and collaborative
progress imagine a world where you can
effortlessly explore the Limitless
possibilities of artificial intelligence
machine learning and data analysis
without the need for expensive Hardware
or complex setup Google collab emerges
as a Celestial Sanctuary offering a
virtual laboratory to experiment create
and collaborate with like-minded
Enthusiast from every corner of the
globe in this exciting video we will
understand what Google collab is and
then we will have a complete overview of
it so let's start with the first topic
what is Google colab Google colab is a
free online tool that lets you do coding
and datar related work on the Internet
it's like having a virtual notebook
where you can write and run python code
without needing to install anything on
on your computer with collab you can
also get data from different places and
share your work with others easily
another cool thing is that it gives you
access to powerful processors like gpus
and tpus which make tasks like machine
learning and data science faster and
more efficient it's a great tool for
Learning and working on coding and data
projects all right now let's take a look
at Google collab and do a complete
overview of it so first of all Google
collab requires a Google account for
access to begin visit the link we'll
type in welcome to
collaboratory so just type in welcome to
collaboratory as you can see and then we
click on this and then we'll click on
this open this one and sign in using our
Google account or
credentials if you've already have a
Google account then you can just sign in
with that okay so now let's start with
Google
collab type in Google collab
click on
this all right so this is the window
that appears when you click on that
first of all here we have the example
tab so the example tab offers some
initial examples to help you begin using
collab for a comprehensive understanding
of collaboratory features and efficient
usage of collab documents refer to the
document title overview collaboratory
features it covers fundamental aspects
and it'll get you started efficiently so
then there's the recent
tab okay so that displays a collection
of all the latest documents that you've
been working on now next is our Google
Drive tab the Google Drive tab feature
allows you to import any of your
previous notebooks directly from your
Google Drive okay then next is GitHub
tab so with the GitHub tab you have the
option to import notebooks from your own
GitHub repository or any public
repository simply provide the GitHub URL
and you can easily import notebooks from
the desired public repository then we
have the uh upload tab so the upload
feature allows you to bring in and work
on your own Jupiter notebooks that
you've created on your computer you can
easily upload any file from your local
Machine by selecting the choose file
option so here it is choose file option
next is our create a
notebook and as you can see there's a
notebook option there's a cancel option
so to create a notebook uh so to create
a new notebook you have the option to
use the new notebook button located at
the bottom by clicking on this button a
new Untitled notebook will be generated
to give it a specific name we simply
click on the current Type and Title name
so I want to name
it so as we've clicked on yeah to give
it a specific name as we just said
simply click on the current Type and
Title name on The Notebook and make the
desired changes so let's say we want to
make it sp1
let's just type the name all right so
next is our
cell here we can see this is a cell so
in a notebook cells serve as the
fundamental building blocks encompassing
everything uh within there are two types
of cells actually one is code cell as
you can see and it contains executable
code and has a run button on the left
side to execute its content this one all
right the output is displayed
it's out put as displayed below the code
cell after running the next type of cell
then is a teex cell so a teex cell can
include a texts images links and more
and you can edit its content by double
clicking it the teex cell uh supports
markdown markup language but you can
also use the provided options at the top
for
formatting the right half of the cell
shows how your edited text will appear
all right next let's take a look at how
to add a new cell to add a new code or
text cell use the respective option at
the top of the work area as you can see
here code or text by clicking on this we
can add code or text cells so clicking
on any of these buttons creates a a new
cell right below the current one so
let's say we want to add this and now we
want to add this and maybe another now
you can rearrange the cell order using
Arrow options located at the top right
corner of each cell as you can see uh
using my leads we could do that yep the
up Arrow moves the cell up one position
while the down arrow moves it down by
one
position as we can see now adding and
running a
code so let's talk about this so by
default Google cab provides One initial
code cell which can be supplemented with
additional cells as desired
these cells serve as a platform for
writing and executing python code for
instance let's consider the following
code so first I need to delete all of
these there we
go so first of all we'll try one code
and see how it
goes we'll just write the code
print yeah print
my
favorite
color
is
yellow all right now let's try to
execute it we can run this by clicking
on this now it's running
executing so as you can see my favorite
color is yellow is being printed so you
can either press press on this play
button to run the code or you can press
contrl plus enter to run the code as you
can see contrl plus enter to run the
cell now next is changing the order of
the cell so in Google collab you have
multiple options for rearranging cells
you can utilize the upsell or down cell
buttons located at the toolbar above the
notebook as we discussed previously
alternatively you can employ keyboard
shortcuts such as control shift up or
control shift down to move the chosen
cell up or down addition Al uh you have
the flexibility to reorder cells by
clicking on the cell number in the left
Gutter and dragging it to a different
position all right now deleting the
current tab so to delete the current tab
in Google collab you can use the delete
icon available over the top of the cell
this icon looks like a trash can and it
will remove the selected cell from The
Notebook as we can see this is a trash
can located here at the upper right
corner of the cell by clicking on this
we can delete the tab alternately you
can also use the keyboard short shortcut
control+ m and d to delete the current
cell you can also right click on the
cell and select the delete cells from
the context menu as you can see delete
cell okay all right now we will
understand how to add data sets so to
add data sets from your local device go
to the left corner and click on the
folder icon as we can see this is the
left corner and this is the folder icon
you can click on that now click on the
upload IC ion and upload the desired
file this is the upload icon we click on
that now we can upload the desired file
or whichever we
want all right so you can also upload
files by writing a particular command so
let's try writing that command so we'll
write from
google.
colab import
file and files and after that we'll
write
upload
equals
files.
[Music]
upload and then we'll put
brackets we'll press control and enter
and here we can see choose files now
from here you can choose files so you
can upload files both ways now
let's look at how to import libraries in
Google
so first of all you have to
cancel we'll click on
this so to import it we'll write
import
pandas as
PD after
that
pd.
read so here we're importing the CSV
files actually so we have to write pd.
reor CSV
and inside this we'll write a
file let's say we have to check whatever
files like this is a sample data files
right so you have to write the file name
which you want to import the CSV file
name I'm writing sample underscore
data all right underscore
test location you have to put.
CSV
so this is the location and if you want
to display 10 brows we'll write DF do
head and then
10 we'll put control and enter and we
can see 10 rows are being
displayed so this is how you can import
and like showcase the data so this was a
little about Google collab it we covered
a few major points but you will see as
you explore and start using it on your
