foreign
and welcome back to another video by
simply learn this is an Uber and in this
video we are going to see how flexbox
works and its property so let's begin
but before that do you know according to
Glassdoor the average salary of a full
stack developer in the U.S is 70 000 US
dollar per annum and it can go up to 125
000 US dollar per annum in fact by 2024
there will be 27 increase in the jobs
for developers according to the U.S
Bureau of Labor and statistics now is
the best time to start picking up the
knowledge needed to get started in this
career full set developers are more
likely to be in demand nowadays and in
future with a major part of every
business moving to the Internet so the
more jobs are creating in the field of
full stack development so let me tell
you guys about this amazing program I
simply learn if you want to become a
software developer consider this Caltech
postgraduate program in full stack web
development by simply learn and Masters
those necessary skills check out the
link in the description for more details
and you can also call on the numbers
that are given below to know more about
the program so do check it out now let's
jump to our video
so I have opened one folder I have
created one folder and name it as
flexbox so let me tell you about flexbox
flexbox also known as flexible box
layout it is a powerful CSS layout
mechanism that allows you to create
flexible and responsive layouts with
ease with flexbox you can arrange
elements in a single row or column
distribute space among them and align
them as you wish in this tutorial we
will cover all the properties of flexbox
and explain each of them in detail
first let me create one file and let's
name it as index.html
okay and here I'll put the Boiler code
by just pressing shift and one let me
show you again shift and one and just
enter so this is a basic HTML structure
let's name this as
Xbox
yeah
tutorial
okay let's save it and inside this
run inside this body I will create one
container
but before that I'll give you
and server
here you have to write live server
if you are into web development or any
field you must know about this live
server
and if not This Server helps you to
live the our project on a local server
so that we can just see what's the
editing or what are the things that we
are adding okay
so in my system it's installed you also
please install this extension it's a
very cool instruction
well by just pressing this here you'll
find the option open with live server
just click on it and you will it will
redirect you to the
this one so we just gave the name of
this URL to flexbox tutorial that's why
it's showing that okay so
I'll tell you about the first thing
about flixbox the flexbox container to
use flexbox you need to define a
container element and set it display
property to flex this will turn the
container into a flex container and all
the its style element will become a flex
items you can also write that like I'll
show you in an example
here then we'll
I'll explain you everything I'm just
telling you about it right now container
and inside that will write
display
flicks this is how
we write okay
let's cut it and create our file
and here
is this Dev container I'm going to give
it a class of
container
okay
and here
I'll write in H1
I'll write
this
is my
first or Android hello or something
done
to all the viewers
okay
yeah
so let's save it and see
how is it looking so this is how it's
looking on the screen right
now let's change our code because we
don't need this H1
so what we'll do is we'll give it as
Flex
container this class leave and inside
this we'll create one div
and in this there we'll give it a class
name of
items okay
and here I'll just
copy this part
and then paste it few times
okay
so let's number it
to
three
foreign
so we created Five uh containers inside
this class so let's save it as you can
see it's coming downwards so this is
because
these are the log elements right that's
why it's coming like that so we can
change that don't worry about that so
firstly I'll create one
file here and name it as Styles or like
style dot CSS okay and inside this
Styles you can write CSS like that if
you want to okay you can write any name
in this class name like I have written
Flex container you can write anything
like if you want to
fetch this you can also write ABC but
remember this should be same as when you
call this and right here the property of
that right okay let's move forward
yeah
Flex container because it's very
relevant here so just whenever whatever
you write it should be relevant whenever
when the developer developer that's
called it's not like this 18 lines of
code he or she writes 100 lines of code
so the class name should be relevant to
that thing okay okay let's move forward
and let's do something here to
check
okay so first thing I'll do here is
I'll remove this one and right here
so how we can fetch it with the dot okay
dot class name and in the curly brackets
we'll give it a background color for now
just to check as read okay
after that we can fetch the item
it was item
items okay
so we'll give you the background color
again of
blue
and let's save this one and this one but
still you will see it's not fetching the
given classes that we have written here
so this is because I'll show you
so
you have to link the CSS file here so
for that we'll write a link tag and
inside the rail we'll write spreadsheet
or style sheet sorry
style sheet and inside after that we
will give the link of the CSS file so
it's not inside any folder or something
so we'll directly call the CSS file okay
let's now save it and see whether it's
working fine or not so as you can see
it's working completely fine
so but we also declare this container as
red
so why can't we see that
right it's because
here the items are covered with that
container
see here we created one Dev container of
class Flex container right inside the
container there are divs there is no
margin in all inside
inside this there is no marginal so we
can't see that the one is taking this
much of space so the red color is behind
so if I
delete or comment down this and save it
now you will see the red color because
red color was behind that right we'll
see so many cool things here because I
think flexbox is the most important
thing in CSS
if I want to create a website and I am
getting difficulties creating that so I
use I again sometimes read Flex
Direction justify content and all uh
align items and all
because it's a very important and
beautiful feature of CSS
so let's commit it this down and let's
move forward
now let's give these items a margin so
let's remove this color for now because
it can so here we'll write border first
will give border of 2 pixels
okay after that we will declare the
color which color that we are giving
this border after that we'll give a
margin of
10 pixels would be fine yeah
so as you can see it's now
12 10 pixels of margin in every items
right
so
if I'll give the pending
I'll also show that to you guys
so I'll give the padding nothing will be
changed it will be as same as the just
have a border if there will be no border
it will be same as before right
so this is how
margin works you can fix it yeah
so now as it's horizontal if you want to
create a nav bar right so you don't want
these you want it like in a row so for
that we have to declare some other
properties
let's just simultaneously work on this
so
we will
change this to here
and the speech to here
now let's make it as Flex
till now we are just working with the
plain CHS now we'll start doing the
clicks so for that I'll write a property
here display flex and whenever I'll save
it it's coming like this right
so what I will do is I'll increase the
size of this obviously because it's
coming very small
so
yeah
so just like for that here I'll write
border
and let's give it a border of two pixels
of color
uh
will give
yeah
so as you can see there is one
container here right
so now we'll see another property of
start which is hide so we'll increase
the size of these boxes at 45. as it's
increasing horizontally
let's see
right and it can change the height
because it's fixed so we'll change it
now we'll give it a height and width of
this boxes blue color items so we'll
give it a height of 150 pixels
and
uh height and width
of 50. 150 so it will become a square
as you can see it's a little longer but
we can reduce that
for that we will do something as you can
see here it's coming right
now let's look at the properties that
you can use to control the layout of a
flex container and its Flex items the
first one that I am going to tell you
about is this Flex Direction
okay Direction okay you can talk about
it in a while as you can see there are
column column reverse row row reverse
and all so Flex direction is this
property defines the main axis along
with the flex item will be laid out you
can set it to row for a house until a
layout or column for a vertical layout
you can also reverse the order of the
items like this one reverse the order
like one two three four that things will
style right now it's starting from one
to three after that it will start by
from five four three to one you can also
reverse that okay uh you can also
reverse the order by using just uh this
one row reverse and column reverse so
how we can use it it's save like I'll
show you just a way second
I'll demonstrate everything but let me
just
open this in this page for good user
experience
I'll just zoom out this one
and here
okay just leave it I'll just write here
column okay
as you can see it's coming like in a
column base right
so
if I'll write here row nothing will get
changed because default is only
so now I'll write row reverse and it
will be reverse right it's coming one
two three four five from that side
right
so these properties will help you when
you are creating a website or something
of your own where you want these things
so flexbox is very important
okay
so
great
now I'll tell you about the next
property so for that let's zoom in and
minimize this one and it's a this Flex
direction is very simple I think you are
get an idea about this one so let's
comment it down and let's move on to the
new one so for that it's Justified
content so the main problem with Flix
direction is you can go to right or left
row or column reverse okay but you can't
do anything in Center if you want your
item or your container to being in
Center you can't use this the flex
Direction so for that it's justify
content this property defines the flex
item will be aligned among the main axis
you can set it to flex start to align
them to the left or top you can also
assign Flex end to align them to the
right or bottom or Center to align them
in the Middle with space between in to
distribute the space evenly between them
okay or space around to distribute the
space evenly around them right so let's
see each and every thing about on them
so for that I'll just start with the
center
because it's the simple one okay so as
you can see our items are inside the
center of this container so this gray is
our container and our items are inside
this in Center okay
so now let's talk about some other
property and we can also write Flex
thought which is the default of justify
content so you will see nothing is
changed here right so we can also write
Flex end which will start obviously from
that side
yeah
so now we can also write
um
you can also write align items but we'll
talk about it later right so first this
is what this is all about justify
contain it's also an amazing feature so
now let's talk about
let's comment it down so we can
talk about align items now so for a line
items we'll use okay I'll tell you about
it first then we'll talk about it so
this probably defines how the flex item
will be aligned among the cross axis
which is the center one the axis
perpendicular to the mean axis you can
set to set it to the flex start to align
them to top or left
Flex in to align them to the bottom or
right or Center to align them in the
middle Baseline to align them based on
their text baseline or stretch to
stretch them
to fill the container right we'll
demonstrate it it's just a theory so
we'll see by just doing practically
right
so
I also get
amazing feedbacks just learn while
practicing you will learn more while
practicing rather in the theory you have
to read so very first but don't read
Theory but just go on the Practical side
okay let's realign the items in the
Baseline so let's see in the container
what happened
so nothing has changed
so we'll give it another
property
and let's name it as
Flex Dot
and it's a default again
Flex end is
again that side
this side right so these all are doing a
different work like we discussed and the
justify content when we were doing
flexed and these five were going that
side and this side right in the right
side of the container main container so
now by using the Align items it's going
on the downside of the container our
mean container so these are the
properties that I think it's very
important when you are creating these
little things will help you create a
beautiful website uh okay so let's see
one more of this Flex
uh flick start to be done start and we
are done with so let's see
how to let's see wrap
no not wrap right now we will straight
check and see how this looks
nothing is changed in this one but we
can check it by just doing this
okay
yeah
as you can see
right it's stretching
so now let's comment it down and move
forward to our
property
let me give
yeah
so let's now
have a talk on Flex wrap so this
property defines whether the flex item
could wrap to the next line or column if
there is no enough space to fit them on
one line you can set it to no wrap so
the node app will not give any space to
that container right so inside that you
can also wrap the items with the next
line or wrap reverse to wrap them in the
previous line or column it's just very
simple I'll show you don't worry about
that so what we'll see is
here I'll write legs wrap and here I'll
give clap reverse first
to check
so as you can see it's wrapped but in
not in a closed Wing so we can do that
also
see
whenever the container is going shorter
it's just moving upwards right
so we can just write here as wrap
so now you'll see it's on the upside of
the container and it's again showing
that properties
okay so this is all about the wrap
you can also add okay just let me show
you
and if you'll inspect here
just let me give me a minute
here
let's go on this one and you will find
here
some of the elements
yeah
in this side this if I'll create okay
let me just open that CSS file
head in the flex container if I'll write
some of the property that we have
discussed like Flex Direction
it will give us all the properties
inside this flick Direction like column
column reverse inherit initial reward
row row reverse and unset
so let's see initial and let's save it
and as you can see
and let's see
as you can see it's initiated right
okay so this is how you can use the
properties in the console you can check
whether it's how the this part is
working and all and you can apply that
afterwards right
I saw now let's move on to the last one
on our list today is align content
so let's open the visual studio code
here and
will just commented for a while
okay so now let's talk about a line
items contained this one okay now first
let's talk about this so this property
defines how the flex line the line
created when Flex items wrap will be
aligned along with cross axis you can
set it to flex start to align them to
the top or left and you can also write
Flex n to align them in to the bottom of
that contain main container that we have
created or you can also make that two as
Center to align them in the middle and
space between to distribute space
between them you which will be evenly uh
always or you can also give the property
as space around to distribute the space
evenly around them so let's see in this
as space evenly first
okay
so let's save it and check
so as you can see there are some spaces
but it's like the old one but now if
I'll squeeze it
there will be all the time space between
them
and these space are even right
and earlier when we were let me comment
it down and show you guys and earlier
when we were doing that it was not
working that well
okay let me show you
by just
okay
now we'll see whether it's
working as you can see some containers
are going down because it's wrapped
between them
so with this the help of this
line items are content we can give the
space evenly between them when you don't
want whenever your website is showing on
the mobile phones and you don't want
your things to be clumsy and all you can
use this align item okay
and let's see some other properties of
this one
uh let's check for another one and we
can just say it to flexed n and let's
see
it's here
and let's say it should be in the center
as I've told you it'll be in the middle
so for that let's see here
see it's not going in the
anywhere right
down so this is the wrap for this video
