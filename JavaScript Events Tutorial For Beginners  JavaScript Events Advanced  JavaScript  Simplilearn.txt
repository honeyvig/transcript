hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be discussing about on mouse over and on
mouse out events in javascript but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now let's get started with
our one point agenda and over to our
javascript expert kaushal so guys we
have been discussing specific methods of
accessing an element for the past few
videos
now today we are going to discuss
something different
before going deep into this topic let's
recall events in javascript so the
simple definition of an event states
that something that happens
so when we manipulate an html document
in javascript we try to do something on
the web page right so several events
take place on a website like the user
hovers over a specific element or clicks
on an element or pressing a key in the
website can also refer to events
or we can say submitting a form or
playing a video also refers to the same
thing so we are using the on click event
for the past few videos wherein we
discussed that a specific task would be
performed on clicking a particular
button what we did was we were just
calling a function by clicking a button
in html so clicking a button is also an
event right and the function that will
be called upon clicking the button is
known as event handler because that
function is basically asking the
computer to perform a particular task on
clicking the button
so like the on click event we have some
more exciting events present in html
which helps us make a webpage more
interactive and responsive as well so we
can do it with the help of javascript so
we'll go through two such events today
the onmouseover event and the onmouseout
event so the onmouseover event will
perform a task when the user takes the
mouse cursor on that element similarly
the onmouseout event also performs a
task when the user takes the mouse
cursor away from that element so for
example let's suppose we have an image
present in our webpage and we want to
change the size of that image when the
user takes the mouse cursor over that
image and the image should get back to
its previous size when the user takes
away the cursor so what's basically
happening is when the user is taking its
mouse over the image or picture the
picture size will increase and on taking
the mouse cursor away from the image the
size will get back to its default size
so let's do it once and we'll see how
these events work within an html
document so first of all let's add an
image to the html file we'll use the img
tag for that and we'll have to provide
the path for the image right so we'll
write here
in a html file we'll add an image here
so we'll write here img and then we have
to provide the source
and the images are stored inside the
images folder in this system so we'll
write here the image name so we have
provided the path here next up what
we'll do is we'll use the alt attribute
so we'll write here
in the alt we'll write a simply code
fine
save
it and here you can see we have an image
over our browser but the image size is
quite large right so we'll limit the
size of this image using the width
property so what we'll do is we'll write
here
width and let's say the width of the
image will be 250 pixel
save it and now you can see we have an
image over here the image is in its
normal size so this is the image so we
have this image over here and next thing
what we are going to do is we are going
to increase the size of this picture on
taking the mouse cursor over this image
so what will happen is when we take our
mouse cursor here the picture size will
increase so for that we have to use the
onmouseover property or we can say the
onmouseover event so what we'll do is
we'll write here onmouse
over
and we'll call a function on taking the
mouse cursor over this image so we'll
write here change size
so we'll declare it in a javascript file
and we'll call this function on taking
the mouse cursor over this picture
so next thing we are going to do is
we are going to
move to a javascript file and we'll
define this change size function there
so let's
go to the javascript part we'll go to a
js file and we'll write here we'll
declare a function first so we'll write
here function change size
and then we have the body of this
function so
we can do it without taking any variable
like in the previous videos we were
taking a variable to store the reference
of
the id attribute so this time we are
going to use the document.getelementbyid
but we are not going to use a separate
variable for storing the reference so
we'll write here
document dot get element by id and we
haven't provided the id so let's do one
thing let's move back to a
html file and we'll use the id attribute
here as well inside the img tag we'll
write a id
let's say the id is
one fine
save it and
we'll
right here inside the js file we'll give
the id here as well so we have the ids
img one
save it and the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to use the style
property with this
document.getelementbyid method so we
will write here dot style
and then we will write a dot width
and then we will specify the width so we
will write here the width as let's say
500 pixels the default width is
250 pixels right so save it and let's
see if it's working fine or not so here
is the image on the browser and we'll
take the mouse cursor over the image and
you can see the change in the size of
this picture so javascript makes it easy
to do such tasks now you might have
noticed that the images size remains the
same once the user takes the mouse
cursor away from the image right so the
image size is changed let me zoom out a
little bit so it will be easy for you
guys so what we'll do is we'll refresh
this page and here you can see on taking
the mouse cursor over this image the
change in the size of this particular
picture
so now the image size is 500 pixel
now the image size is not getting back
to its original size like what we did
was we use the on mouse over event and
the image size is changing and that's
working totally fine so the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
use the on mouse out event and what will
happen is
the image size will get back to its
default size like which is the 250 pixel
so we'll
for that we'll use another function so
first we have to use the on mouseout
event here
so we'll write here on mouse out and
we have to create another function so
we'll write a change size 2 so this will
be a function name save it
and here we have to create another
function in the javascript file so we'll
write here function change size and the
function name is change size 2
then we have the body of this function
and we'll use the
document.getelementbyid method
the id is same which is img1 and then we
are going to use the style property
again
and this time we'll
specify the width as
250 pixel so this is the default size of
our image save it so what we did is we
created a function that will be called
when the user takes away the mouse
cursor from the picture and the image
size will be changed to 250 pixels which
was the initial size of the image
so save it
and now you can see here on the browser
the image size is changing on taking the
mouse cursor over the image the image
size is 500 pixel now and on taking the
mouse cursor away from the image the
image is getting back to its default
size right so you can see the change
here so this is how we can use these
events to make our web page more
interactive and attractive as well next
up we'll go through another example
wherein we will change the image on the
mouse over event and the default image
will be shown on taking the cursor away
from the image so this image will change
on taking the mouse cursor over it and
again it will get back to the default
image on taking the mouse cursor away
from the image so guys here's the code
for the same and what will happen is the
image will change on taking the mouse
cursor over it and gets back to the
default on taking the cursor away so
guys the html part will remain the same
wherein we use the img tag to add an
image and then we have two functions one
for the on mouse over and another for
the on mouse out event so in the
javascript file we defined the two
functions here so you can see the
function one is change image and the
function 2 is change image 2. so what's
happening is we are using the get
element by id method again and this time
we are using the src attribute and what
we are doing is we are changing the
source of image like we are using here
the simplylearn.png
so this is our image saved in the
particular folder inside the images
folder and in the next function what we
are doing is we are again changing the
image to the default image so we have
used the
simplico.png image here so what will
happen is the default image will be
replaced by this image when this
function is called and the other
function here will again replace the new
image with the default one so let's take
a look at the output and
save it
so
here you can see on taking
mouse cursor over this image you can see
the change so this is the image we want
to change so on taking the mouse cursor
away from this image you can see the
image gets back to the default one you
can see the image is changing and it's
quite responsive and attractive
so this is how we can use these events
in javascript that's all for this video
