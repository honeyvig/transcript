certifications such as aw architect and
Azure architect candidates with OnePlus
years of work experience are preferred
to enroll in this program so check out
the link mentioned in the description
box below for more details so without
any further delay let's start this video
with what is cloud computing cloud
computing in simple terms refers to the
practice of using remote servers on the
internet to store manage and process
data instead of relying solely on your
local computer it allows you to access
your files applications and services
from anywhere with an internet
connection providing convenience
scalability and flexibility for
individuals and businesses alike so
let's move on to the cloud computing
road map for 2024 the first step in this
road map is foundation of cloud Begin by
understanding the fundamental concepts
of cloud computing learn what cloud
computing is its history and why it's
essential in modern it familiarize
yourself with different cloud service
models IAS infrastructure as a service
learn about Cloud infrastructure
components like virtual machines storage
and networking pass understand platforms
that allow developers to build deploy
and manage applications without worrying
about the underlying infrastructure SAS
software as a service explore software
applications delivered over the Internet
such as email collaboration tools and
CRM systems get to know about various
Cloud deployment models public cloud
cloud resources are owned and operated
by a thirdparty cloud service provider
and are made available to the general
public private cloud cloud
infrastructure is dedicated to a single
organization and can be located on
premises or hosted by a third party
provider hybrid Cloud combines public
and private Cloud environments allowing
data and applications to be shared
between them the second step is core
cloud services choose a cloud provider
for example AWS Azure gcp or others and
start exploring their core services for
example if you're using AWS learn about
Amazon ec2 for creating virtual machines
understand Amazon S3 simple storage
service for object storage get
acquainted with Amazon VPC virtual
private Cloud for networking in the
cloud practice setting up and managing
these Services through the cloud
providers console or command line
interface the next and the third step in
this road map is networking and security
deepen your knowledge of cloud
networking explore Concepts like vpcs
virtual private clouds subnets IP
addressing and routing
understand how to set up secure
communication between Cloud resources
and on premises Network learn about
Cloud security best practices dive into
identity and access management I am for
user and resource Access Control explore
encryption mechanisms for data security
configure security groups and network
ACLS Access Control lists for
controlling traffics the fourth step or
the next step in this road map is
containers and
orchestration gain expertise in
containerization and orchestration
Technologies start with Docker for
creating and managing containers move on
to kues for container orchestration
scaling and management understand how to
deploy and manage containerized
applications in a cloud environment the
fifth step in this road map is
serverless Computing explore serverless
Computing Services provided by your
chosen cloud provider ews Lambda asure
functions Google Cloud functions Etc
learn how to create functions trigger
them and build serverless applic ation
the sixth step in this road map is
storage and databases delve into various
cloud storage options for example object
storage example Amazon S3 as your blob
storage and blog storage for example
Amazon EBS as your disk storage then
mastercloud databases including managed
databases services like Amazon RDS and
Azure SQL database the seventh step in
this road map is devops and automation
amb devops practices for efficient
deployment M and development learn about
cicd continuous integration and
continuous deployment pipelines explore
infrastructure as core tools like AWS
cloud formation or terraform for
automating infrastructure provisoning
the eighth step in this road map is
monitoring and
optimization understand how to monitor
Cloud resources use cloud native
monitoring and logging Services set up
alerts and notifications for resource
health and performance then optimize
resource usage to control costs and and
improve performance the ninth step in
this road map is Advanced topics
depending on your interest and career
goals explore Advanced Cloud topics such
as machine learning and AI in the cloud
big data and analytics using cloud
services internet of things in the cloud
the next and 10th Step In This Cloud
Computing road map for 2024 is real
world projects and practice apply your
knowledge by working on real world Cloud
projects either independently or as a
part of Team join online Cloud community
or forums to learn from others share
experiences and seek guidance from
others the 11th and next step in this
road map is continuous learning stay
updated with the latest developments in
cloud computing through books online
courses webinars and conferences
consider pursuing Cloud certifications
offered by Cloud providers to validate
your skills and knowledge and the last
step for this cloud computing road map
of 2024 is
certifications depending on your career
goals aim for Relevant cloud
certifications to demonstrate your
expertise to potential employers for
