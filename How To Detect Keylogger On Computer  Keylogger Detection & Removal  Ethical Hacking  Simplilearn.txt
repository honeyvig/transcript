hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn
for today's topic we will understand how
to detect key logging activity in our
system of computer devices and if you
want to know more about the topic you
can watch our video on what are key
loggers
but before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from us
for today's agenda we'll understand what
are key loggers
after that see some points regarding
detecting key logging activity in our
system
and in the end we'll see the demo
regarding key logging detection methods
let's begin with what exactly is a
keylogger
as the name suggests
keylogger program is a malicious program
or a tool that is designed to secretly
record the data that we type on a
keyboard
the program that is the keylogger
program gets installed into a system
secretly after that
it targets the system when the user is
working on it and records the key
strokes in a text file
then the text file is sent by the
keylogger program to the cyber criminal
that is the creator of the keylogger
program
where the recorded data can be used by
the hacker or a criminal to do malicious
acts
let's take a look at some of the
detection methods for keylogger in a
system
first one is
the keystrokes that we make become
sluggish that is the reaction speed from
the hardware keyboard which is slower
than usual
then we have instances where our system
gets hanged or freezes in between the
work
there are also cases when there is
suspicious unusual activity in the
internet
and lastly there are some unknown
programs that are running in the
background of the system
these four are general cases where we
can observe whether the system is
infected with a keylogger program or not
to better understand key logging
activity in a system let's take a look
at the demo for the same
for the first step let's execute the key
logging program in a system
over here i am using
a python key logging program
and if you want to know more about the
key logging program in python you can
watch our previous video on what are key
loggers
let's begin now
let's execute the program
and wait for a second or two for the
program to continue execution
okay let's take a look whether the
program is working properly
we can see that the key logging program
would create a text file named key
underscore log let's take a look
key underscore log seems like the
program is working fine
let's try typing something on the
notepad
hello world
now let's see whether the recorded data
comes
seems like the program is working fine
the data is recorded hello world
with exclamation marks
along with the time
now let's try detecting the keylogger
program using different detection
methods
for the first step
you can access your settings
where you should go for windows update
over here you would often see some of
the
updates regarding security measures that
is the very basic step if you want to
detect key logging activity in your
system
let's take a look at the second
detection method for this you can use a
start option
and type
task manager
using the task manager app you can see
some of the programs that are displayed
these programs are the ones that are
currently working or executed
in my system right now if you see any
unusual program that has been executed
without your knowledge
may refer to a key logger program
and if you find any unusual program that
has been executed on your system right
now
you should
right click on the
program and choose option in task this
will immediately end the task that is
being executed which might protect your
data from being recorded
let's take a look at the third option
how we can detect the key loggers
in the task manager use the option
startup
in startup option represents the
softwares or programs that get executed
when the system is turned on
if you see any unusual program or
software mentioned in any of these in
your system you might have to
disable that
this represents there's an
unusual program or a malicious tool that
has been executed when you start up your
system
which may relate to a keylogger problem
and the last method to detect keylogger
activity is
to type something
if you feel there is some restrictions
or there is a gap between when you type
the key on your keyboard and the
reaction speed becomes
slow even by a millisecond this might
represent there is a program that is
interfering with the keyboard
if you use the following detection
methods you might save yourselves from
being spied on or getting your data
recorded that you type on your system
with this we have reached the end of the
module if you have any questions
regarding topic you can ask them in the
comment section thank you for watching
