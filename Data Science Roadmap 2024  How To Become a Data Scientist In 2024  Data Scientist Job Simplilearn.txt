your experience and areas of Interest so
without further Ado let's get started so
let's get started with the topic one so
in this video we will be covering topic
wise so the first topic is
python so this is the topic number one
python is like the Swiss army knife of
programming languages versatile easy to
learn and Incredibly powerful here's the
road map to get you started first there
is variables so think of variables as
containers that hold data in Python you
can store different types of data like
number of text in these containers learn
how to create variables and the rules
for naming them then you can understand
numbers python supports various types of
numbers get familiar with integers int
floating Point numbers that is float and
even complex numbers then there is
strings so strings are sequences of
characters learn how to create
manipulate and format strings discover
methods for slicing concatenation and
formatting strings so now how to learn
this so you can learn this by online
resources or by reading articles they
provide structure learning parts and
interactive exercises you can also check
out Simply learn playist of python all
right then you have to do the practice
use interactive coding platforms to do
the practice of this one practice makes
a man perfect so you have to do the
practice of it these platforms offer
problems that help reinforce your
understanding all right the next one is
functions so functions are reusable
blocks of code that perform a specific
task learn how to define functions pass
parameters and return values understand
the concept of scope and how it affect
variables the next is Lambda functions
so these are small anonymous functions
defined with Lambda keyword they are
useful for simple operations and can be
used wherever function objects are
required all right then there is modules
so modules allow you to organize your
code into separate files learn how to
create and import modules understand the
difference between standard library and
third party modules all right next one
is exception handling so exception
handling in this one you have to learn
how to handle errors gracefully you
using try accept finally and else blocks
this ensures your programs can handle
unexpected issues without crashing if
you guys want you can also note down
these topics or else you can go through
this video all right the next one is
classes and objects so classes and
objects so you have to dive into the
objectoriented programming that is oop
learn how to define classes create
objects and use methods and attributes
understand Concepts like encapsulation
inheritance and polymorphism all right
so this was about the topic one that is
python now coming to the topic two that
you have to go through that is numpy so
numpy is like the backbone of numerical
data handling in Python making it
crucial tool for anyone stepping into
data science here's a road map to get
you started so first one on the list is
numpy arrays so unlike regular python
list numpy aray can store multiple
dimensions of data making them the
perfect for handling matrices or even
higher dimensional data learn how to
create and manipulate these arrays then
there is array creation so understanding
different ways to create arrays using
functions like arrays zeros ones and
arrange them the next one is array
indexing so learn how to access specific
elements rows or slices of data within
an array now talking about how to learn
it so documentation and tutorials start
with the official lpai documentation and
beginner tutorials online you can also
have a look at simply learns playlist
you can also go through various articles
and blogs from there you can have a
proper structured format of learning
third one is interactive practice use
platforms like Jupiter notebook or
Google collab to write R and run numpy
code
interactively so this was about numpy so
if you want more clarity on these simply
has a proper playlist for it you can go
through the entire playlist there you
will get all these these topics that
I've just mentioned so you don't need to
worry if you guys want I can also attach
the link of the playlist in the
description all right now coming to the
topic three so topic number three is
data analysis so it's all about making
sense of data finding patterns and
drawing meaningful conclusions it's a
crucial step in the data science Journey
where you will just turn the data into
insights here's what you need to know
first one is data cleaning so so
handling missing data so this one data
often comes with gaps or missing places
learn how to deal with this using
techniques like filling in the blanks
imputation or removing incomplete data
points you will need to decide the best
approach depending on the situation then
the next one is standardizing data data
can come in different formats like dates
written in various ways or inconsistent
text learn how to use and standardize
this data to make it usable then there
is dealing and outline
sometimes there are values in your data
that are way off compared to the rest
these are called outliers and can mess
up your analysis learn how to detect and
handle them all right so now talking
about the part where we'll tell you how
to learn it so pandas Library start with
the pandas a powerful python library for
data manipulation get familiar with the
functions like Drop now to handle
missing data then fillna for imputation
and S type for for data type conversion
then you can also go through the
practice data sets use real world data
sets for sites like kaggle or data go or
practicing with different data sets will
help you understand common issues and
how to address them so here practicing
is the main thing that you should focus
on all right so this was about the topic
three that was Data analysis now moving
on to the next topic that is the topic
four which is maths and statistics so
maths and statistics are the backbone of
data science they help you understand
and interrup data accurately here what
you need to know first descriptive
statistics so mean median mode these are
the basic measures of central tendency
helping you understand the average
behavior in your data then there is
variance and standard deviation so this
tells you how spread out your data is
are the values close together or widely
scattered so all these things so this
descriptive statistics tell you then
talking about how to learn it you can
start with simple data sets and
calculate these measures manually and
then with the tools like Excel or python
this Hands-On practice helps solidify
your understanding then there is
probability so learn the fundamentals
like probability of events conditional
probability and Independence this forms
the base of understanding data
distributions and make predictions then
distributions get to know commonly
probability distribution like normal
binomial or po each distribution helps
describe different types of data now
talking about how to learn it use online
resources and videos to understand
probably Concepts practice with
exercises to apply these ideas to real
world scenarios so in this way you can
easily do that it's not that difficult
all right coming to the topic number
five which is SQL that is structure
query language SQL is a powerful tool
for managing and manipulating databases
it's essential for data scientists to
interact with data stored in relational
databases here's what you need to learn
so basics of relational databases that
is table rows and columns understand how
data is structured in tables which
consist of rows and columns that is
Fields each table in a relational
database represents a specific type of
data like customers or orders primary
keys and foreign Keys learn how primary
Keys uniquely identify each record in a
table and how foreign keys are used to
link tables together establishing
relationship between them then how
should we learn it so starting with the
basics using online tutorials or courses
that explain database Concepts visualize
how data is organized and related with
the database schema the next one is
basic queries so select statement this
is a fundamental SQL command used to
retrieve data learn how to specify the
columns you want to filter records using
the we Clause then insert update and
delete these commands allow you to add
modify and remove data from the tables
understand the importance of these
operations and how to use them safely
now how to learn it practice writing
simple SQL queries to select and
manipulate data use free resources that
you get online and you can also go
through the videos try working with
sample databases to get hands-on
experience all right then there are
joints so in joints you should learn
inner join this type of join retrieves
records that have matching values in
both tables it is used to combine
related data from different tables then
there is left join also known as left
outer joint this retrieves all records
from the left table and all matched
records from the right table if there's
no match the result is null from the
right side then there is right join also
known as right outer join and full join
so these are similar to left join but
from the opposite table and full join
returns all records when there is a
match in one of the tables all right I
hope you guys understand that now to
learn it talking about how to learn this
practice with different types of joints
using real world scenarios for example
uh combining customer and Order data to
which customer have made purchases use
SQL practice platforms or database
management tools there are many things
that you can start with all right coming
to the topic number six which is machine
learning so machine learning is the core
of data science where you teach
computers to learn from data and make
predictions on decisions here's the road
map to get you started with it that is
the pre-processing thing that is data
cleaning just like in data analysis you
just need to clean your data before
feeding it into the model this involves
handling missing values correcting
inconsistencies and removing duplicates
then there is feature scaling learn
techniques like normalization and
standardization to scale your features
ensuring that all data points are owners
comparable scale this is important for
algorithms that are sensitive to range
of data like K nears neighbors or neural
networks then there is encoding category
data convert categorial variables like
color or category names into numerical
format using methods like H encoding or
label encoding then there is how should
you learn it use Python libraries like
pandas for data cleaning and skit learn
for pre-processing functions practice
with data sets to see how pre-processing
affects model performance so yeah this
was about the topic six which is machine
learning now moving on to the topic
number seven that you should learn is
model
building so supervised learning first
thing is this includes regression
practicing continuous values and classif
app ation start with algorithms like
linear regression decision trees and
support Vector machines then there is
unsupervised learning so learn about
clustering grouping similar data points
and dimensionally reduction reducing the
number of features key algorithms
including K means hierarchal clustering
and PCA that is principal competent
analysis so these are the things that
you should work or learn on then how to
learn it use skit learn to build and
evaluate models work through real data
assets from sources like kaggle to
practice learning then participate in
kagle competition to apply your skills
in real world scenarios then coming to
the topic number eight which is deep
learning so deep learning is just like a
human D it's about building artificial
brains called neural networks that can
recognize patterns in a massive amounts
of data imagine showing a kid thousands
of pictures of cats and dogs and they
eventually learn to tell them about
that's what deep learning does but with
numbers and computers to get started
you'll need to understand the basics
learn how neural networks are structured
and how they process information teach
the network figure out how to train
these networks to improve their guesses
over time then specialize focus on
specific types of data like images with
CNN or sequences like text use the right
tools learn to use powerful libraries
like tens oflow or P TCH to build and
experiment with different networks then
find tune your models make sure your is
performing its best by testing it and
making adjustment if you want to be at
the Forefront of data science and work
on The Cutting Edge projects
understanding deep learning is essential
so this was about deep learning so this
was a thing that you should work on or
you should learn to get started on this
journey now coming to the part where we
will be telling you about the other
parts of this road map that is the
resume
preparation all right imagine your
resume as a first impression it's your
onepage sales pitch to land that dream
data science job recruiters skim through
dozens maybe hundreds of these every day
so you need to stand out so first thing
that you should keep in mind is quantify
your achievements so instead of saying
analyze data say increase sales by 15%
through the customer segmentations
number speak louder all right that is
the quantify your achievement now coming
to the second thing which is
highlighting problem solving so show how
your data skills track real world
challenges did you build a model that
reduce cost or improved deficiency
showcase that then the third thing that
you should keep in mind is tailor to the
job every role is different customize
your resume to match the specific skills
and responsibilities listed in the job
description then there is demonstrate
your tool set python R SQL and the like
are essential but don't just list them
show how you use them in the projects
the next is explain complex concept
smoothly assume the reader might not
have a deep technical background use
clear and concise language to make them
understand better then highlight soft
skills data science is as much about
people as it's about data communication
teamwork and problem solving are crucial
all right so this was about the resume
preparation now talking about the other
side of it which is portfolio website so
imagine you are at a job interviewing or
pitching to a potential client you have
got your resume and cover letters ready
but how do you really show them off your
data science jobs that's where your
portfolio website comes in so first
thing that you should keep in mind is
Showcase data projects so display real
world data science projects like
predictive models or data visualizations
for example if you developed a model to
forecast stock price you can include the
code results and visualization next is
demonstrate analytical process show how
you approach data problems from cleaning
and exploring data set to building and
evaluating models this helps potential
customers see your endtoend data science
workflow then the third one is highlight
specialized skill so focus on the
specific areas like machine learning n
lpo data engineering if you have worked
on a sentiment analysis project feature
it to highlight your experience in NLP
