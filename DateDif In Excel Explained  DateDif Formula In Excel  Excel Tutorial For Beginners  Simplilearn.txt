hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about dated f function but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is stated function in excel
now we might have to switch to the
practical mode for that now we have
started our microsoft excel and here we
have our md worksheet so dated if
function is majorly used to find the
differences between two individual dates
so it is also called as dated if by a
few people and a few people also
reference it to date diff that is date
difference so anything is good now to
find the difference between any two
dates let's select a few dates
so the first date would be
let us imagine that you're an employee
and you wanted to find out how many
years that you've been working with an
organization
so for that you might want to need today
and the date where you join the company
right so it might be native joining
and today
so what's the difference
right so let us imagine that you joined
the organization somewhere around 2010
0 1
0
5
2010
and
today so for today can you can give any
particular date
let us imagine that
today is first of january 2021 or 2022
now we have our both the dates that is
the joining date and
the current date which can be the
current date so
the day can be anything so you might be
watching this on a different date as
well so the date of that day for today
would be a little different so we'll
imagine the today's date as an imaginary
read now we might want to find the
difference that is in terms of years
so you wanted to find the difference in
terms of years so here you can find the
difference in terms of years days and
months as well so currently let's try to
find out the difference in terms of
years so for years you might want to
specify the third parameter in the
dative function as y if you wanted
months you have to give
the m as the third parameter and if you
wanted to find the days you might want
to give d as the third parameter
uh so we have discussed the third
parameter so what are the first two
parameters right so the first two
parameters are the first date and the
last date so the first date in this
situation is your date of joining and
the last date or the final date
which you want here as your today so
let's find the difference so for that
equals two
so it can be dated if or date diff
sedate f and
the first state which is the a2 and
comma the last state that is b2
and
your parameter third parameter in terms
of years that is y close the bracket and
press enter so there you go you have
your date here so it's been like 11
years that you're working with your
organization so that's how you find out
the differences so we have 11 years
because
we did not finish the
12th year completely so if we had given
the month as uh maybe six
where we have finished our total years
then
it will automatically change to
12 years
so that's how you work with dated f
function in excel if you have any

covered in this session or if you feel
