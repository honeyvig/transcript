let's get started keep increasing for
the foreseeable future but where does
chat DP open AI popular language model
fall in this chain that's exactly what
we are focusing on in this today's video
on that note welcome to the simply learn
YouTube channel today we are here with
an interesting video on chat gut for

field of AI consider the artificial
intelligence engineer master program by
simply learn and master those necessary
skills check out the link in the
description for more details as I said
earlier programming is utilized in many
domains like web development robotics
mobile development machine learning and
so on so how can a program achieve
maximum code efficiency nowadays we have
VII based tools like charity to make our
programming experience more efficient
although there are several coding
resources platforms such as stack
Overflow and GitHub where programmers
can find solutions to their technical
programming questions charity stands out
from the competition because of its
quick response time usability and
support for numerous languages among
many other benefits now let's first
discuss how charity Works charity
generates responses to the text in using
a method called Transformer architecture
a large volume of text is fed into the
chat GPT from various sources including
books websites and other social media
platforms the model then uses this
information to forecast the following
word in a phrase based on the words that
came before it the charity systems
allows users to enter text or queries
and then the system uses its training
data and algorithms to produce the right
answer the answer is created after the
input text has been examined and the
pattern most likely to match the input
have being identified using the training
data in short chity is designed to
respond to queries logically and command
more quickly and accurately but why do
programmers use chip on a regular basis
chip assists programmers by offering
programming related answers and
solutions and helping them improve their
skills beside that Char is utilized for
code generation code completion code
review and a natural language interface
let us understand each in detail charity
is trained to generate the code or or
even the entire program described in the
natural language specified by what they
want a program to do and then charity
could generate the relevant code look at
the example of how charp generates the
code so now open the CHP and you can
type any program that you want charp to
generate so I will give write a palum
program in Java so here you can type
write
a
palum program in
Java so using Java programming language
it should generate the whole
program so as you can see it has
generated the program so it has used a
class name called palum Checker and it
has used e pandrum as a method name and
also it will give the explanation on the
program so you can see here why it is
explaining why e pandrum is used as a
method and U it also explains
the for Loop if a condition and so on
next we have code completion Char is
trained to generate Snippets of code or
even fully fledged programs it can
generate a list of possible code
completion depending on the context of
the users incomplete piece of Code by
automatically producing the entire code
it can help the developers save time and
minimize errors next let's see the
example of code completion using tab so
even if the program is explained in
natural language which CH GPT will
generate the proper code and give the
complete code so let's type
here using a
function write a
program to
convert the
string in
uppercase so using which language let's
keep using C
programming and enter it once again
so as you can see we have just said that
using a function write a program to
convert the string in uppercase so using
C programming language and using C
programming language it has used
function and you know this is the
function convert to uppercase and has
given the complete code for string or to
convert a string in uppercase and also
it gave the explanation here the convert
to uppercase function takes a pointer to
a string as its argument and then
iterates over each character in the
string using a for Loop so it explained
why for Loop is used why two upper is
used and why the method convert to
uppercase is used
everything so let's say uh we'll give
one piece of code like
void to
Upper car s strr
so as you can see we just gave the
method to Upper and it's generating the
complete code so this is how charity
works for code completion next code
review jity can analyze code identify
the bugs or errors in the program and
further help resolve them it allows
developers to fix errors more quickly so
now let's have a look at the example of
code review so in this example Char will
review the code so even if the code has
some mistake it will give the proper
output let's say we have given the
example here so we give the function or
a method called
upper and here we are giving the keyword
called upper so it should check whether
this piece of code is proper or is there
any mistake in
this so as I said uh it's saying that
the given code appears to have logical
error as the function upper is being
called recursively on itself inside the
loop so instead of giving two upper we
just give upper here right so using the
keyword two upper only then the string
can be converted to uppercase so here we
gave just upper so it says that it is
having this piece of code is having a
logical error and it gives a proper code
for
us so I hope it it's clear and then we
have natural language interface with the
use of chat GPT a software application
can be given a natural language user
interface that enables users to
communicate with it through natural
language instructions rather than
through conventional user interfaces
next let's see how chip helps the
programmers for natural language
interface so let's say we'll give
here
create a software
application where
the
user asked to
enter
credential for the too
app
enter so as you can see the charity will
give the steps so it can provide you
with an outlet for creating a software
applications that requires the user to
enter credential for a Todo app so here
it is few steps that we need to follow
to do a to-do
app so it's giving the explanation step
by
step
so it says that determine the
programming language and framework then
set up the database to store the user
information and then create the
registration page and then finally
create the login page as well and once
the user is successfully logged in um
you know it will have the options like
add edit and delete task as well and
then finally implement the security
measures to you know protect your
password words and then test the
application to ensure that it works as
intended and the user data is being
stored and retrieved correctly so it
gives the steps of how it has to be
developed we will move to the browser
and I will show you how we will open the
chat GPT or open Ai and use it to Learn
Python so this is the
first hyperlink or you can just search
open a or chat jpt and you can click on
the CH jpd
hyperlink so this is the official
website that is open.com chat jpd and
you can click here to get started and
you can see that it is also available on
Google Play Store and Apple
Store so we'll just get started you have
to register if you are a new user or if
you have an account you can just login
into it you could register with the
Google account also so after registering
you will get to this web page that is
the chat section so here you will start
the conversation with the chat JP and
you can find the complete road map of
how you can become a python developer or
if you want to be a specific in a field
or you want to become a data scientist
you could just have a road map for that
so here first we will ask J JP what is
python as we are on an embarking J
to Learn Python
here so you could see that it has
responded that python is a high level
interpreted programming language known
for its Simplicity readability and
versatility it was created by guo van
rosam and first released in
1991 so this is all about Python and you
can see that it has also stated its key
features that is readable syntax and it
has stated the feature also that is
python uses index ation or white space
to Define code blocks so that is
defining the readable syntax then
interpreted language Dynamic typing Rich
standard Library cross platform
objectoriented extensive community and
ecosystem so this is how chat jpd has
stated python so now what we will do
we'll ask chat jpd to act as an
instructor to us we will ask him kindly
act as an an instructor and give me a
road
map for teach
me
python so like uh we have mixed two
statements here you would just use one
that is kindly act as an instructor and
teach me python or you can also ask me
that give me a road map for a python
developer and you could also specify the
duration that is in 6 months or 2 weeks
that's up to you so you could see that
of course I would be happy to guide you
through a road map to Learn Python
learning to code is an exciting journey
and python is a great language to start
with here's a step bystep road mapap to
help you get started so getting started
what he has given you is install python
choose a code editor and then he has
stated that you could learn the basic
concepts variables and data types
operators control structures list tles
and dictionaries functions and modules
intermediate Concepts Advanced topics
web development and explore projects
collaboration and Version Control advanc
topics practice and learn so this is the
whole road map for a python developer
and now we will ask him
kindly act as our guide and give us a
complete
plan to become python
developer and that to in 4
months okay you could specify the
timeline so you could see here that
absolutely I would be glad to help you
create a comprehensive plan to become a
python developer in four months so month
one that would be for foundational
Concepts and basic programming so that
would be introduction to python Week 1
to two week 3 to 4 4 we functions and
modules and month two in start setting
we will do intermediate Python and
object oriented programming data
structures for the week 1 and two week
three and four we will move on to object
oriented programming so this is how the
chat jbt has created a full guide for
you in po months so you could follow it
and ask chat jpt for resources can you
provide
resources from where can I and
learn so you could see that it has
started providing resources
also for online learning platforms it
has stated code academy CMI edx and for
Interactive Learning and practice it has
stated lead code hacker Rank and books
also that is python crash course by Eric
mats automate the boring stru with
python and then the official
documentation that's the most important
thing to learn any language and the
YouTube channels then blogs and websites
so these are all the resources that
chadt has stated you you could also ask
him that can you include these Resources
with the guide or the course guide or
the complete road map so it will do that
for you also and now we'll ask him can
you
elaborate the
concepts I
should learn in be one to two so what
chat je does is it continues the chat so
what we have asked him prior we can just
cross question it and ask him further
like what we can do about it so you
could see that it knows what we are
talking about
what week one two so he has stated that
certainly in the first weeks of your
Learning Journey you will be focusing on
building a solid foundation in Python so
you could start with the week one only
you could just write week one and then
you can see what it states that is
understand what python is and its role
in programming install python on your
computer and set up a code editor or ID
example Visual Studio code or that could
be Jupiter noo it's up to your choice
and then write your first program that
is the classic hello world program then
day three and four you could move on to
variables and data types you could learn
them and when you want to learn the
concepts Chad je will help you and when
you stuck on anything Chad jpt will help
you so I will show you how you can be
sure and ask Chad jpt if you stuck
anywhere so uh we'll ask chy can you
explain
the
topic
variables and data
types to a
beginner and you can see that it has
sted now you have a online learning
sources that jity has given to you or
provided you and you can also ask J jpt
to make the concepts understandable for
you so you can see that chat jpt has
given you the answer that is of course
let's break down the concepts of
variables and data times in a biger
friendly way so variables think of a
variable as a container that holds
information it's like a labeled box in
which you can store different things in
programming variables are used to store
and manage data that your program needs
to work with so this is how chat jpt has
stated the concept variables and data
types for you and I can see like I have
a good hold on python so I can see like
it has stated a very good examples and
it has covered all the information about
variables and data types and there's one
more catch if you didn't understand this
concept by reading this information you
can ask chat jpt to simplify more for
you so you can just
write just I will copy it and I will ask
him can you explain the topic to a
6-year-old like you
can ask the chat to explain this topics
to a younger self or to a younger kid so
let's see what it states with
examples okay now let's see so you could
see that it has started so course
imagine you have a special box called a
variable okay you have a box this box
can hold different things like numbers
words and more let's look at some
examples to help you understand
variables think of a variable like a
label jar where you keep things you can
put marbles candies or anything you like
inside the jar the jar has a name like
magic jar and you want to use what's
inside you just say the name of the jar
so data types now let's talk about the
different kinds of thing you can put
inside the jar they different types of
things right like marbles candies and
stickers in the same way in programming
we have different types of things things
we can put in a variable so this is how
he simplified the concept for
you so this is how you can learn python
first you can have a road map and you
can ask the chity to act as an
instructor or a guide and he will
provide you the whole road map and after
that you can break down the road map
that is these things we have break down
that is we have asked him what concepts
we should learn in week 1 and two you
could also ask for the week one and
after that you could just took out day
one or two and you can also ask him
where can I found the resource or from
where I can learn how to download or set
up python in my system and how to
download ID so it will provide resources
to you and you can follow that resources
and if you find any difficulty just
paste that difficulty and give it to the
chity it will resolve for you and moving
on new you could ask the concepts for
week three and four and start with the
resources online resources and if you
don't understand those Concepts you can
ask Jad jpd to simplify it for you or
you can just like prefix it not prefix
it but suffix it that you can you state
these concepts for a 6-year-old or a
beginner so it will simplify the things
for you and it will show you with
examples and here if we ask
him can
you write
a
simple
addition of
numbers code in Python and explain the
code to me so you can see that CH has
responded and it has responded that
absolutely has a simple python code that
adds two numbers together and this is
the code that is number one variable and
it has inputed like it has input the
first number then the second number and
in the sum result they have added and
then they have printed it and you could
see that now let's break down this code
step by step and it has stated that
number one this line ask the user to
input a number the input function takes
the user types and store it in a
variable so this is how you can learn
what the code means what the function
means like the input function but does
its functionality and how you can use it
and the function is used to convert the
input into an integer a whole
number so this is how Chad Gip will help
you understand the code learn the
language and have a command on it so
further going you can ask more Concepts
from the chat jyy that give me some
example for list tle and dictionaries
and with the help of examples you could
just go with the course or the guide it
has provided you without any further Ado
let's get started so opena recently
released a multimodel version of gp4
called gp4 Vision that is GPT 4V so GPT
4V can understand images as input and
answer questions based on it 80% of the
world's data is unstructured and
Scattered across formats like websites
PDFs or images that are hard to access
and analyze we believe that this new era
of multimodel models will have a big
impact on the web scraping and document
processing space because it's now
possible to understand unstructured data
without having to rely on complex OCR
Technologies or tooling so let's explore
potential application of GPD 4 we for
web scripting so first what we'll do is
we will open any website or we'll just
open the simply learn website only and
we will save this as a HTML
dog HTML Only We have replaced
it so this is the HTML
log we will drag and drop it to chat jpd
and now ask the chat jpd to to web
script the data so we ask the chity that
use the above HTML
file and script the
data from it so first we'll see the
script data in text format only and
after that we will uh ask the CH to
scrape the data into Json format or if
there are any CSS files or styling or
metadata so we'll ask the jat gyy to do
so so you could see that jjd has
responded that the HTML file you
uploaded from the simply website it
provides a variety of courses and the
platform AES too so it has just given us
the summary so now we ask jity to
extract the data into Json
format
about
HTML
file
in format so you could see that it's
analyzing so you could see that it has
extracted the data into Json format and
here's a B for of the extracted data
so this is how you could web script the
data from the websites using gp4 Vision
so now what we will do we will go to all
courses click on explore the category so
here you could see all the courses of
the data science and business analytics
category so what we'll do we'll ask the
chat GP what we'll do is we'll ask chat
jpd to extract the titles of all the
courses
so for that first we'll save the page as
HTML
Doc and we'll upload to chat
jbd and going back to the page just
inspect you could see that heading three
has the title of this course so we'll
provide this as a reference to the chat
J so it can understand and extract all
the other title details from this page
so we'll get back to chat J and ask him
that extract the course
title from the
attached web
page or HTML
do
HTML and you can use Python and
beautiful
soup
and
Export
the results to a CSV
file and the title
tag
hed3 like this and now we will provid
it just copy the element paste it to
chat
jbd extract all the post
titles attached web page okay let's see
what does a chy respond to
this so you would see that it has
created a CSF file so we'll click this
open the
file and it has extracted all the titles
which are present in
H3 into a CSV file but we asked only for
the course titles and it has done so for
all the H3
points and now we'll ask the chat J to
extract the
metadata into Json
format from the
attached HTML
file so you could see that JD has
provided the metadata into Json format
and similarly we can ask it for other
Scripts
if this web page has any
scripts provide that to in Json
format so you could see that I accepted
the scripts from the HTML file and
presented them in Json format so it's a
preview of the extracted scripts so this
is the script that contain the
JavaScript code embedded within the web
page and due to the length of the
scripts only the first part is shown
here if you need the full Chon file all
the scripts please let me
know yeah
I need the full
script so you could see that it has
proved us the Json file so we can just
download it and open it with any
ID so this is the Json format for the
whole web
page I'm moving back we move back to the
website and now we will ask chat jpd to
extract the data from this image that is
or like make someone understand what
does this image show so first we'll do
is we'll save the page into HTML dog
and back this
image
element and ask the chat jbd first we'll
upload the HTML file and ask the chat
JD uh explain
the
graph present in the
attached web page and describe it
so save and submit it and let's see what
does it respond if it doesn't respond
we'll just get back to the web page and
inspect the element for it and provide
the div class or the particular element
so it could understand for Which diagram
asking CH to describe
it see so file you proved title post
Post in data science c t does not
display it content in a format that
allows me to interact with or interpret
any embeded
graphs so we provide
you with the
element
present HTML
file read that and
explain the
graph or diagram to
us so let's
see so you could see that it has
provided the information about that
image that the HTML snpp to provide in
appearance to represent a style
graphical element likely part of a
larger graph or visual representation
speci Bally it describes a div element
rotated by minus 53° containing another
div with a background color of a shade
of pink so this is how the gp4 version
works and it also describes the images
if you have wondered how to Leverage The
Power of chat GPT the AI language model

description box below let's dive in and
see how chb can help you to make a great
app so here we have chat GPT okay you
can write here chat.
open.com so here I will ask to chat gbt
what is chat gbt so I will here write
what is
chat
GPT so here you can stop generating if
you want to okay I will stop generating
okay so charge bit is a conversational
artificial intelligence model developed
by open it is based on the GPD Genera
pre-rain transform architecture
specifically GPT 3.5 which is at
Advanced language model so GPT 3.5 is
trained on a massive amount of Text data
to generate human like response to wide
range of prompts and question you can
ask anything to chat
gbt
okay after coming
[Music]
chat
GPT
software Developers
are
safe software developer jobs are
safe like see yes after the introduction
of chat gity and similar language model
software developers still have important
roles and their jobs remain revent while
AI models like chat gbt can generate
text and provide automated response they
have limitations see they have
limitations chb have limitation and
cannot replace the skills and expertise
of human software developers so here is
a few reasons why software developer
jobs remain valuable okay so here are
the few reason so you can ask anything
to chat gbt so what we will do we will
create a small small gaming app okay so
here I will
write uh let's make first Tic Tac do
okay so here I will
write give me
the
code for
pick T
to
game see it will give you the step by
step chb will explain you everything see
this board then player check columns
check diagonals play game everything C
check for the winner play game
I see to play the game simply run the
python script players will take turns
entering the row column numbers to make
their moves the game will okay so what I
will do okay first I will ask the steps
to make a game tic tac to
okay give me these steps to m game
t
see first it will uh we will ask for the
steps then we will ask for the
code charity can make your app in 2 3
minutes in Just 2 3 minutes small small
app in 2 3 minutes okay see what what is
the first step set up the game board
create a data structure to represent the
Tic Tac to board this can be 3x3 Grid or
Ned list with initial empty values okay
for example this then second is the
print the game board write a function to
display the current state of the board
on the screen this will help players
visualize the game and the third is get
player input prompt the player to enter
their moves accept the input for the
rows and columns where the players want
to place their symbol X or zero okay or
you can change the value X or Zer
whatever cross right okay update the
board after receiving the player input
update the game board with their move
make sure the validate the move and
check if the selected position is empty
okay then check for the winner then
check for it is draw what then alternate
turns okay then repeat 2 to 7 until the
game sends optional add additional
features we will first we will make
tikto uh what you can say a simple tikto
then we will add the additional features
on this okay using CH GPT only Okay
so I will
write provide me
The Tick
T
to game
code what we will do we will uh open the
visual studio and copy it
directly OB see current player is X then
o see current player row the second
player switch
player okay what we will do we will copy
it from here and we will open the visual
studio that new file I will write here
TI T to. P1 okay Enter I will save it so
here I will directly copy the
code where is my code oh it's it comes
in
okay copied this
also copy the whole
thing okay I have to remove this or I
can make it you know
comment yeah so let's try to run it what
terminal
says see enter the row okay
two enter the column
two okay it made like
this okay what I will
do I will ask for the
GUI uh provide me
the t t to game with GUI
okay now the Tinker came Tinker is
python Library used for the GUI in
Python okay okay now uh we'll copy the
code and just paste it it will run okay
with GUI and then we will add the
additional features okay from here now
I'm copying the code now select all
replace with this code like here no
error no red sign so let me play it it
will run I guess no
problems okay what happened see as you
can
see we got the ti toam okay so see here
x 0 0 x 0 x player X wins so let me add
the additional features in this so what
we will do we'll go to chat GPT again
we'll ask for the additional feature see
note the code above uses the message box
module from the Tinker for displaying
messages ensure that you have compatible
version to Tinker okay when you run this
code a graphical windows will appear by
3x3 grip and this uh okay players can
click on the buttons to make then mov
the game state will
okay okay update you can you know talk
to chity so I will say
update my code with
some good font and
scoreboard
scoreboard font scoreboard and color
update my GUI code I can
write here is an update see right
certainly here is an updated version of
GUI code with improved font score card
and color if you get error in this you
can ask to chat gbt
okay anything you are facing issue about
your code whatever it is you can ask
directly to chat GPT
see we created an App in like 2 minutes
just in 2
minutes so chat GB is making our life
easier okay let me copy this
code okay let's see the changes what
what J
does
okay there's nothing changed I
guess
player X me like this
cross
okay
okay uh I will write here see in this
updated code the font style has been
improved with a bold aial font the
buttons have a custom background color
and the overall window and SC have a
different
color I didn't feel like
this I didn't feel like
this okay
so
[Music]
change uh
the great style of the
game it's giving updating the boat see
to change the great C of the same you
can modify appearance of the buttons and
the spacing between them is an updated
gii code with a modified grid
sty it's just a little bit of time
taking that's it nothing else it's very
useful J you can create your app in 2
three minutes
only
okay
continue generating it's a half
code okay code is
copied let me select and paste it here
and check
see player x z player R
zero okay it's little bit FR I
guess X okay this one two three box why
these lines
then okay who
cares C XS okay see the scoreboard is
updated
okay so this is how you can make your
Tic Tac to more
beautiful okay uh let me write here
let me write here I want the black and
white boxes okay or colorful boxes
so
code provide me the code for the
colorful
boxes
okay okay here
chb wrote certainly here is an updated
version of the code with colorful boxes
instead of grid
lines
okay so wait waiting for the code update
the
code see in this updated code each
player's button X and O has a specific
color assigned to it the button colors
okay let me copy the code and paste it

so this is how you can make your app
more beautiful beautiful using
customization you can ask CH jpt

anything you can ask and you you can
make your app more beautiful
okay so now let's move on to the next uh
game which I want a snake game okay
using p game we will
make so here I will write please
provide me the code of
snake
game using
P game
python
okay everyone knows what is his s
game or first you want to ask the steps
we can ask the steps okay after this I
will ask this
step okay so till then let's make a new
file of
snake game.
py
okay let me close it see it's a
long code I guess just continue
generating now you can see the see the
food and all will come
okay you can ask anything like any
question any language question this this
code sets up the basic structure for the
Snake Game using py Game it includes a
functionality for displaying the snake
controlling this movement detecting
collision with the boundaries and food
and managing the scool you can run the
code and play the snake game with P game
window feel free to customize see at the
end what chb feel free to customize and
enhance the game according your
preference okay that is what I was
talking
about you can change n number of times
you can ask n number of times for the
code new new code okay there is one why
this error is
coming import pame could not be resolved
py
lens what is this py lens okay let me
ask to CHP
only what
is
vience Pence is a language server for
python developed by m s provides
Advanced language features including
code completion type
checking static analysis and code
navigation c p is built on the top of
language server okay let me give the
error
itself copy
message
okay I will write debug
error
vience
okay uh then make sure you have a p game
installed P game is already installed on
my okay install your python environment
open your command prom
terminal and run the following command
okay let me open the command prom
okay then what I have to
write let me copy the code and paste it
here what is
this okay emergency this this this this
this if py game is not installed you can
reinstall by running
already installed I
guess ensure the py is using the correct
python inter verify that py is confed to
use the same py which you have installed
by game you can check the python
interpreter setting in your
code editor or ID which make sure it's
point to correct python where P game is
installed
okay what I will do
I will go to terminal and here I will
write pip
install by
okay maybe it will be
helpful okay let me do
this
what Char P install by
game okay successfully install new
pip some error of pame I guess okay
we'll run it online no
worries if it won't work in this I will
run it online okay you see the
requirement is already satisfied and
this this this this so what we will do
uh we will
open
replate
okay we'll open replate and we'll create
the new
rapple okay then
Python and creat
up okay this is the same
like you know one of
the ID you can say okay then what I will
I will copy this P
code and paste it
here okay I will make a new file it's
name
py okay on that I will copy the code and
I will run
it
okay replate updating the package uh the
p and the buy
game okay it's running the code is
running okay it's installing P
game okay let me run
now
what happened what's the
error where's the
error okay
let
okay some hello from pame Community this
p
f some game Loop module fil main. P line
68
okay okay we'll ask to chat
GPT
snake game cod showing
P
okay
provide me
the snake game code
using python
gii this time from Turtle
okay let's
see because the pi games I don't know P
game is installed on my system it's not
working so we will leave
it okay we'll ask from this some good
GUI with some good
GUI see it is the head everything
everything is there the keyboard
bindings from wsd or you can up down
left right the keys you can use from use
the both
okay continue
generating then the functions the pen
the snake body everything is there snake
head is like everything is here what you
want everything is
there see the code utilize the turtle
module create the basic game with the
snake that moves collect food the the
score
is okay feel free
to let me copy the
code let me copy here
only and run
it see this is the
snake Okay this is the food this is the
score or high score okay I will uh run
it
okay see you can customize your snake
your uh food everything see the score
previous time the score was 10 the high
score now it
changes okay the score is 30 now I'm
enjoying the game so this is how you can
customize your you know
game
okay let me play the
game okay see this is how you can make
any game or any small small game in two
two 3 3 minutes
okay so uh go to chat jpd and you want
the you know change the color of the
snake or the food anything you can do
using chat
GPD okay so let me tell you what chart
GPT is chart GPT is a machine model that
generates humanik text responses it's
been generated on a massive data set of
text and can generate highly accurate
responses to a wide range of queries but
how can chat gbt be used for web
development there are number of ways for
example chat gbt can generate website
content improving SEO and boosting
engagement chat gbt can also be used to
create chat boards that can interact
with customers in a natural and engaging
way now let's look at some of the real
life examples of how chart jpt has been
used for web development so for example
if I ask chart jpt to create a
e-commerce website for me it will easily
create it so let's see
it please create a
website for me in HTML
and CSS so there is one point that I
wanted to tell you guys if you want to
ask chat jpt for anything just give good
description about it so it can give you
a good response if I tell you tell it
more about my uh requirements it will
generate good uh quality of product okay
so let me tell it please create a
website for me in cssn
HTML that should
[Music]
some like
orange and
blue
right
and where I'm
selling okay now lay wait for the
response of charg it will create us the
things the code okay now it's writing
the HTML code
right so I'll tell you more about it
like for example e-commerce sites use
jgb to generate product descriptions
improving their SE and uh driving sales
customer service team use CH GPT to
create automated chat boards that can
help customers with common queries and
there are so many other things also so
like uh content creators also use chart
GPT to generate amazing content for
their website right so let's wait a
couple of minutes more until it gets
completed right so as you can see it's
giving us a proper response of
everything as it created this file for
us and we can just easily copy it from
here and I have logged into my online
editor you can open any editor if you
want so this is the online editor that
I'm working on right now I'll clean
this so as you can see e-commerce
website is ready right so this is a very
basic website but chat jpt has created
this for us it's a very easy website
like very basic but as the instructions
that I gave it it applied all the things
that it's using yellow color but uh ask
for orange but it's fine I ask for blue
color so this is also fine but before
asking chart gbt you should know a
little bit about coding right so in H1
tag here you have to write the heading
it's the header tag inside that it's the
H1 The Heading
one okay so here I'll write my website
name I'll write
website and then you can see that's
Jo website right so how can you use CH
GPT for your own we development projects
first you have to familiar yourself with
the programming languages and tools that
are compatible with ch GPT and it will
only knows the data until
2021 so once you are done that you can
experience with ch gbt to see how it can
benefit your project right if I ask him
to create wait I'll show you guys some
of the things that chat GPT can
do create a
header so I have told RGB to create a
header and make it functional and also
add page product page and contact us
page make it a little more I have
written make it attractive right so
let's
see it's will write us a code for that
so until then let me tell you the use
cases so as I already mentioned chat GPT
has already proven its values in various
web development scenarios for example
e-commerce platform use Char GPD to
generate product descriptions boosting
their search engine optimization and
driving more sales customer service team
employ charge GPT to build interactive
chat boots that provides instant and
accurate responses to customer queries
enhancing the overall user experience so
optimize the generated content from SEO
ensures that the text generated by chart
GPT aligns with relevant keywords and
follow SEO best practices right so with
the help of char GPT SE things this can
help improve your website visibility in
search engine results and it can create
natural and authentic chatboard
experience so when using chat gbd to
develop chat boards focus on creating
conversation that feels like human use
context and personalization to ensure
user engagement and build trust leverage
ad GPT for customer engagement Beyond
generating content right chat GPT can
help engage user on your website also
for instance you can use it to develop
interactivity and so many other things
okay so now let's see what chat GPT has
created for us right let's copy this and
paste it on the online editor that I
have showed
you I don't recommend using uh online
editor you can have a visual studio code
it's very good so it doesn't have any
CSS I guess yeah add your customer Uh
custom styles for product pages here
yeah so as I know we have to write the
CSS here but it's fine I have to show
you something different so as I told it
to create a e-commerce website so it
give given its name as welcome to uh
e-commerce website but we can change it
from here the title of the website we
can change it right and I have told it
to create home product and contact page
right as I have showed you so it has
created the same thing that I have told
Char to create for me as in the products
page there's no things added right now
but we can add it add your products and
their details here as it's written in
the code also I guess yeah in the
section part we can add our product and
the things that we want right now let's
ask chgb to create
create
Circle create
five Circle
different
radius or 20
[Music]
pixels
to pixel right
and
files
and CS blue
and
orange now let's see whether it can
create five circles of different radius
for us or not right and now it's writing
the HTML file for
us let's wait a couple of seconds to see
whether it can create so it given us the
things we want but I don't think so it
has different uh radius okay as you can
see in the CSS part it is given
everything a different height and width
let's copy the CSS first or HTML
anything you want and we'll paste it on
the online editor let's go again and
copy the HTML part also and paste it
here now
we will down and as you can see the
first circle is small and then the last
one is the largest one right so as you
have given it the chat GPT the
instructions that I want this thing or
that thing it has created the same thing
that I told him to do right so it's all
about instructions but as I know that
this is width and height this is very
simple thing but when you'll uh Cod code
on python or JavaScript or Java it'll be
a very complex things so I recommend
first learn the language and then use
chgb to improve it right so many
developers and programmers use chgb to
enhance their productivity not to learn
it so it's very good for learning
purpose also if I tell
it I want to
learn Java I say
Java
from where
should
start learning
it give
me
some
princes
and
some
web sites
from
where I can
start with
the links of them right so I asked Char
to tell me from where should I start
learning the HT Java so it's now telling
that's great Java is a popular
programming language as there are many
resources available to help you learn it
here are some of the website and
resources where you can start learning
Java right so it's giving me Oracle Java
tutorials it's very good to learn Java
from uh Java programming on course era
it's giving some of the renowned Java
certification courses but I recommend
you to take our Java certification full
stack Java certification the link will
be in the description box for that it's
a very good certification for um
newly uh starting developer or
programmer or experience one also so
from there you will start learning Java
from scratch so that is also very good
you can also check it out right so as I
told it to give me the instructions from
how to learn Java so it just gave me
everything with the links right so
now let's get
to give me
any projects
ideas
for react
J
right so now it's telling me uh you can
create a project on react for from
starting from Todo list which is a very
basic app when you start learning any
language you start it by from too list
only or too app whatever you say next
one is weather app movie Library which
is also very good practice for Library
uh for react developers to start
learning react from and the e-commerce
store except founder chat
application and these are the 10
projects that they the Char gbt told us
to learn right so it's very good you can
ask it anything if you don't know
anything like uh I'll tell you reacts
right I don't know
thing about reactj
please about
it so I told it I don't know anything
about reactjs I know about reactjs but
it's like I want to see what it's saying
you can also check out the projects that
I have created on react on this simply
learns YouTube channel so as it's saying
everything certainly reactjs is a
popular JavaScript library for building
user interfaces it was developed by
Facebook and it is widely used for
building single page application it's a
dynamic over application so some of the
key points of react component based
architecture virtual Dom and declarative
sytax unidirectional data flow react
Hooks and so many other things so as you
don't know anything about react it will
tell you to get started with react you
can begin by learning fundamentals of
JavaScript and familiarize uh your
yourself with HTML and CSS once you have
a good understanding of these
Technologies you can explore reactjs by
following tutorials reading
documentation I recommend documentation
because it's very good you will get a
deep understanding of that then move to
tutorials and all and build small
projects it is also very good thing
start from uh learning from the projects
you'll learn more react official
document is here so excellent resource
to learn reacts from scratch
additionally there are various online
courses tutorials and YouTube channels
dedicated to teaching learning reactjs
such as react course on these platforms
and you can also learn react from our
YouTube channel remember to to practice
regularly build projects to refine uh
your learning and leverage the reactjs
community for support and guidance now
let's open the CH gbd and check let's
refresh this I have already opened my
chat gbd you can just log in it and then
you're good to go so let's say hello and
see so it's working completely fine
right now okay so what we we do today is
we'll open our Visual Studio code I have
created one folder which is Tailwind
it's an empty folder you can just see
that so in that folder We'll add the
Tailwind so first let's ask the chart
GPT to help us install or set up the
Tailwind so I'll
write
please set up
the
tnd let's
see
okay it's asking us to install nodejs
first and then it's asking us to check
the version of
that okay
it's saying to install these new Pro
Piel JavaScript
module to add these component in the CSS
file so this is saying to add this in
the CSS file
okay
[Music]
so let's check whether it is telling us
something useful or
not post CL class Oro
fixer
okay
okay now simultaneously let's
check the tail bin
website how to install
this so here it's saying to install this
command NP install D dilin CSS and then
in it in that project then it's saying
to configure the template part uh add
this to your dilin configure file then
it's saying to create a folder input.
CSS and then just start the
process so as of
now chart GPT has not given us the
correct answer it's correct but not up
to the mark as you can clearly see the
commands that are given on the Tailwind
docss official website
uh so according to me many people think
that uh CH because of chat jpt the uh so
many jobs of the developers are in the
risk because chat jpt can create
websites all of the stuff so I don't
think so according to me it's not that
good it's very good for the uh helping
any developer purpose uh but it's not
that good but Let's see we are in this
together so let's just open the visual
studio code and install our tailin now
we'll ask it to create so many other
things so let's see whether it can
create that or not so I have opened my
terminal so many people also comment us
uh that how you could open the terminal
so I just used one shortcut Control Plus
backtick to open the terminal you can
also go here and create one
terminal okay now I'll paste the line to
install tellin CSS in my
system so let's wait a couple of minutes
as you can see it's installed in our
system all the packages and modules are
installed now it will tell us to init
this project so let's do
that okay
it has successfully created the
configure file now inside the content
we'll copy paste this one as it is
saying to add these line configure your
template path add the path to all your
template file in the file okay so let's
just copy this
thing and paste in the
content now let's save
it okay so now next step is add the
tailin directives to your
CSS
now what will we do here
is let's go back to Studio code and
create a
folder inside
this
that
SRC okay and set this SRC we'll create a
file input.
CSS here we'll paste the code okay we
haven't copied that code all yet so let
Cy let's paste it here it's done
okay so I don't think so again that this
can replace the developers because this
is not the correct way to tell although
it has given us all the steps but any
developer can do the task in a very
short period of time it can just help
any developer but not take the job of
the developer
okay so let's move ahead
and step would
be to go back next step to build the
process let's copy this one and start
the Tailwind CLI build process
okay let's copy and paste it here
right as you can see it's done in 273
milliseconds the output. CSS is
generated in this this file folder
right now we just have to use this file
output. CSS
okay let's see
now let's create
a file
here and name it as
index.
HTML okay and inside that I'll write my
Boiler code just pressing shift and one
for the as comination Mark and then the
boil code is done so we can change the
name of this and let's write here
as
site using
CH
okay
now one main thing that I wanted to tell
you that I installed one uh extension in
my system which is the live server this
extension you can download and this is
very helpful
okay let's open this
one now what we'll do is we'll link the
output. CSS file in our html. CSS so for
that I'll write here
link okay
and inside this ring
I or you can just write link and then
click and then write
real style
sheet
okay this
cut what we'll do is we'll give the path
of the output. CSS for that dot dot
slash list slash output. CSS It's Just
sh
good
okay we close this link tag and let's
save it and let's just right click and
here you'll see open with live server
and you'll install the
extension live server so let's open this
one so this is working completely fine
it's showing us the title website using
JB okay or
something I'll write here
welcome to Simply learn and then let's
save it and you'll see it's showing
welcome to simpul
okay now the next step would be to
create now let's open
our CH
GPD
and here we'll
write create
a
responsive
header
using let's first copy this
one and
then
that's
okay so let's see whether it can give us
a right answer this time
let's
see okay it's giving us the code now for
the
[Music]
header
okay
so it is showing us in the above code we
use tailin CSS classes to style the
header we set the background color to
Gray This one is the property of gray
color and then the text color would be a
white color in that n Bar ins the header
we have a n element with the flex and
justify between okay classes to
horizontal Center the element space them
out evenly okay fine we also use PX4 and
py3 to add pedding to the navigation bar
cool for the mobile menu we used a
button with the MD hidden class to hide
it
on okay let's see the code now okay now
let's copy this HTML file let it write
everything so here we don't need this
one so let's delete this and let's here
write header and let's comment it
down this okay let's P the code and
check whether
it's
let's save it and let's go back to our
file so this is what chat gbt created
for us it's looking very good actually
so let's inspect
it and let's see is it responsive or not
so this is completely responsive
guys okay very good
yeah
so this is really very good okay on
Surface do s 20 Ultra this is what will
show on the mobiles okay now we'll go
back to the chat GPT and let's close
this one
and stop generating and let's here right
create
a
section
using
T CSS now let's see something went
wrong
okay let's see let's first copy this one
and refres
this and let's see
how it will create the hero section
using tail
cases so it has created this Nar really
very
good I didn't expect this from JT but
it's really really looking very good
it's simple and you can add these to
another Pages just using the anchor tag
here we can just give the PA so I'll
show you www.
simply
so this one is
okay so whenever I click on this one it
will redirect us to the simply L but the
URL is wrong we can just go back to
Simply
learn.com and let's copy
the and let's go back to
code and let's say write the URL
okay save it and let's
see yeah this is how this works let's
close this one okay now let's see what
is the
code okay let's copy this code and let's
see how this is working so it is also
giving us the complete code uh how it's
working how this step is working and all
as you can see it's giving giving us the
max W width 7 into one utility sets as
Max width for the container add to 7 XL
which is 12 112 Ram or 1792 pixels it's
giving us all the explanation for the
code it has written for us so let's
check it and after the header I'll paste
that code and let's save it and
see okay this is really very good
guys yeah I didn't expect this from
chart gbt but it's looking very good
so um till if I am a developer so if I
had to write this much of code it'll
take me around 2 three hours at least
but with the help of CH gbt it only
created in 5 10
minutes this is very good actually now
let's open the CH GPT again and here
we'll create a
information
section okay
let's
information
section
using
tment let's see
now till now it's working really very
good now it is writing a code for us so
as you can
see again very
good now let's copy this one and paste
it under
this save it and let's check so this is
the information section this has created
for
us right important information location
office ours contactors and all right we
can also regenerate it for something
else okay now it will create something
else for
us
right if you don't like something we can
just regenerate and create another one
so just let's copy this
one now it's telling us everything about
the code and here after that I'll write
this and save it let's check what's this
okay this is the information section it
has created for us that this is
something J data and if you don't like
this one also you can again regenerate
the response this is really an amazing
feature of chat gbt okay so now it's
creating the third option we can
countlessly ask him to uh create again
and again for us the
response let's copy this one okay and
let's remove all of it because it's
looking very
comy now let's see okay this information
section is information section will come
to our website this is what it's
written
okay now let's ask him to create
something else
okay let's copy this text create
informative and paste it using Tailwind
with
one image I'll check whether it can a
response to my things if I want to
create one image on the left or right
side and then the text on the other side
let's see whether it can create it for
us or not okay create informative
section using chart G with one image on
the
right and the text on
the left
side now let's
see whether it can create that or not
for us right just an simple command so
we'll check whether it can create or add
the
image
okay classes but
text
but okay it took the image class
also and it's taking the source from an
API called unsplash I have covered this
unsplash API on my previous videos okay
okay now let's copy this and paste it on
our code let's delete this one and paste
this one on the
website
okay so the image is quite large we can
reduce the sizes but in the starting
only I have told you I'll not add
anything in the code so I'm not doing
anything in the code right so we can
change the size it's really good as I
have told him to add the image on the
right side and the text on the left side
it's doing the same for the user so this
is really very helpful for the developer
but as I have already told you it will
cannot replace the developers because uh
I'm the developer I only knows how to uh
do things as I have showed you that it
has given me so many wrong answers
before that before this one this has
given me three answers but it was not up
to the mark so I had to told him that to
uh create uh like this image on the
right and I've explained it to uh CH gbt
then it created this one for us okay and
whenever I'll refresh this page the
image will get changed this is the
unlash API how this works okay we can
change the images
also this is random just write
here coding okay now you will see the
images that will come here
okay let's
see
oh let's check
it let not taking any other
name yeah I don't know why it's not
working but let's not waste time on this
random is also
fine till now it's looking really very
good
okay now the next step would be to add
the service section okay so let's ask
atgp to create service section for us
okay
using now let's
see it's
coming
okay class the the
one really very
good so look how beautifully it has been
created
right yeah
okay let's
see it's done now let's copy the code
and go to our
editor and
here we write this code and let's paste
it let's
check okay so it's not align straight
but we can align it so it's showing us
that the services that this website is
providing what we offer and this is some
Jun data web design web marketing and
all so let's check whether it
is
yeah okay so what this one is doing here
is it's using only
three classes is
using and the center
Center these all are using the same
class but let's find out why the
image just come
in like
that
right you can align
it you guys want me to align this we can
align this right
okay
so let's just align one it's just to one
line okay we can align that so let's dig
deep into this
code
okay this image
classes
okay same justy Center and then it's
using the flex shrink
function let's rounded
large
okay with the wi
56 let's make and
[Music]
check
and let's go back to the
code increase the size of this
first okay let scr back to the Chart
again again reg generate the new
response and let's see how is the
response is looking right let's wait a
couple of seconds
more okay let's see the response that it
is
creating we need a minimalist design
okay I was just observing the code
and how it's
looking we can also change the color of
the customiz it uh this website on our
own but it's really very good I'm really
impressed with this this really will
help developers creating
websites
okay let's go back to
still
creating that we'll create the about
section for the page
okay okay it's again giving us that
design and all
part
great if I tell CH GT to create uh this
service section and this is my
requirement and all it will definitely
create that I guess now I'm impressed
really impressed with the code clean
code it's
writing and it's also responsive I
haven't told it to create the responsive
uh code but it's really very good it's a
responsive I I'll show
you I was just seeing that only whether
it is responsible or not not if you will
see okay let me just cut this
part let's just
okay yeah so this is how we'll check the
responsive take and
let's see that these three uh home about
contacts are
vanished and this is is the head part
that we created and then the up one is
the Nar this is the information
section and services section is also
there this is all
responsive
okay so we'll check how it's looking on
Samsung Galaxy s20 this is how it's
looking yeah let's move on to the code
copy this code and coming back to the
code editor let's delete this
section
okay now let's paste it and
see
okay let give
and
this is what it created for us it's I
guess uh little
less
or it was already writing the code and I
stopped it's fine it's not its mistake
let's stop and regenerate the
response
let's copy this
again coming back to
the
Chart not working let's refresh rgbt
again service section let's
see it's really fast
now
okay let's observe this one first
our services what we offer web design
there must some lines about digital
marketing and I'm thinking there is
also uh one part which I cut
down not Char mistake it was mine
because I stopped generating the
response
okay really good let's copy this text
now and paste it under our
and let's do this and paste
it let's check it this
time
so this is how this one is looking now
this is also really looking very good we
can decrease the size of this image do
not worry about that uh this is the
service our services and some junk data
here we can write this website is
providing this and that okay service one
that we provide this service we provide
this service and we provide this service
okay this is all about
that right really very good really very
good it's really very good okay we can
change everything from it customize it
on our our needs
thing let's just go back
okay this one is good okay now let's ask
Char GPD to create the about page for us
so we'll write
create so I think uh mean while it's
writing the code for us I wanted to tell
you that chat is great for uh for
everyone but as I know the code how this
code is working I know what is section
what is Dev class and what are the
function this grid system that's using
Max WD uh it's using the Excel function
I know everything about it and if you
are a fresher or you don't know about
anything about the coding uh I think you
should first uh know about the language
or the framework then only ask uh this
to chat gbt or take help from the chat
GPT right uh if you don't know about the
language or the framework and you'll
just tell Char to create this and this
for us it's easy it will create for you
but uh it will not uh help you in your
future so according to me
just uh use it to learn not to
work
okay
so let's move
ahead and the path is
given
okay it was G managed let ask
it
responsive
about section
[Music]
using
T okay I just m but it is very
intelligent I misspell the Tailwind
spelling and then it corrected it very
good so this is not the complete code
for the about page uh I'll ask it
to let's see whether it will take this
command or
not right great so let's
see after this about section we'll
create this content start page and then
we'll create final this website
right so this is really very helpful for
the developers I must
say so let's copy this
and code and paste it under this
section
okay
so this is how the about page is
looking really very good the image size
is 500 into 500 it's really very big so
we can change the size of the
image let's
see is
that
250
50 and the image will not come
again let's just delete this
Source copy the
unsplash API for the random
image
right that command is really really
useful
okay I forgot to add that
yeah yeah this is how this about is
looking really very good guys really
very good if I tell charil to create
this on the right side or this image I
want on the left hand side or right hand
side it will definitely do for us as I
have given him the uh task in this
section information section it
definitely worked so I must say it's
really very good so now let's move on to
the contact page
okay let's here write
create cre a
responsive
contact
section
[Music]
using
Del and I'll ask him to do add some
sections for us so let's see whether it
can take up that or
not okay let's give it in a second shot
let's first see how is the contact
Section is looking then we'll tell him
to emise
that so it's just taking a section class
inside that section class it's using
some classes which is flex R and all and
it's giving
us it's
really let's copy this text again and
paste it there
so the contact D is also looking very
good get in touch and then it will
redirect us to
the that really good really the images
sizes are uh large but we can reduce it
it's not a big deal but it's all looking
very good right so one thing is left is
the footer part let's ask it to create a
footer for us now this is the last and
final step for
this
create
section
using
this is really very good looking very
good let's add
the one
Splash and
then use it
here so this is how it's looking down so
overall if I see it really given us a
good good output really so uh I will say
chart gbt can only help uh us that's it
as this code that is created by chart
gbt for us we can't use it directly this
structure that chat gbt created for us
is good but we need to add so many
things before deploying it right uh if I
see this one we need to add this uh uh
services in the center and we need to uh
uh arrange the text and the services we
need to change the size of the services
if uh the client wants it horizontally
then we have to change that we need to
change this image size as in front of
you I change this image sizes I use the
different apis so overall it's very good
but there uh is so many things uh that
we have to do okay and for that
developers are needed now let's dive in
and see how Chad GPT can help you make
great videos for your YouTube channel
open I created Chad GPT an advanced
language model powered by artificial
intelligence it's designed to understand
you provide helpful responses and adapt
to your writing style whether you are a
content creator a student or anyone
seeking assistance Chad jpt is your go
go to companion it uses vast knowledge
to help you with creativity problem
solving and learning so let's move to
chat gbt and see what we can do to make
YouTube videos so here we are in Chad
gbt now the first thing we are going to
do is we are going to see how to use
Chad GPT so before you use chat GPT you
should know how to give prompts to chat
GPT so chat GPT can get you valuable
content but you should know how to give
the prompts so here here we'll start
with a thank you so we'll write over
here thank you for helping me today fine
so let's see the response of Chad
gbt so here you can see it says you're
welcome and I'm glad that I could assist
you so here you can
see Chad GP is asking us if we have any
more questions or not so let's define
what we actually want chat GPT to do so
we'll write over here hi I I want to
create a new YouTube channel so let's
say we are starting a YouTube channel
fine now we'll say I want to create a
new YouTube channel where I want to
discuss
facts mostly okay so we'll write over
here mostly related to programming
languages so the first thing you should
keep in mind is what you want want chat
gpt2 Chad GPT won't give you the full
video for specificity chat gpt3 won't so
we are not using the plus version of
chat GPT so we in this video I'll tell
you how to create a complete video only
with AI not just chat GPT but we are
going to use another tool which will
help us create our video completely so
here in chat GPT what we will do is
we'll ask chat gbt to provide us the
script fine the script for a video so
here you can see we I have written over
here mostly related to programming
languages so I'll write over here I
want to create a
video on facts about programming fine
the length of the
video will be let's say 4 minutes for
now because for now we are not going to
use that much of script I will use three
effects fine so right a
script for the same and press enter so
let's wait for CH gpt's answer to this
question so here you can see we have a
script jgpt is writing a script so we
you can see we have a script which
starts with welcome back programming
enthusiasts in today's video we'll dive
into the fascinating world of
programming languages and explore three
insightful facts that will blow your
mind so grab your favorite coding
beverage and let's get started so here
you can see we have three different
facts right so we have first one is we
have curing completeness and the second
one is esric programming languages and
the third one is non-deterministic
programming languages fine so let's
change it let's ask chat GP to give us
three historical facts about programming
use three historical facts about
programming fine so let's see if we are
getting a new script or not so yeah here
you can see we have a new revised script
with three historical Pro programming
facts fine so here you can see the first
fact we have is fotron the pioner first
fact takes us back to late 1950s when
the world's first high level programming
language was born Fortran so Fortran is
basically the world's first high level
programming languages and then we have
the birth of c and the third one we have
is the rise of worldwide web and
JavaScript so JavaScript was basically
created by Bron Brendan ie in 1995 and
since then JavaScript is being used by
most of the developers out there right
so here are the three facts we have now
here you can see we have host written
over here the host will say if you found
these historical insights fascinating
and want to delve deeper deeper into the
world of programming be sure to hit that
subscribe button and stay tuned for more
wow it can write a complete YouTube
script right for YouTube specifically
similarly you can create videos for
different purposes not just YouTube but
you can create videos for your blogs and
different different purposes fine so
here you can see we have a script right
now the script is quite long right so
I'll write over here concise it in how
many words you want let's say 600 words
it's a random number 600 by the way so
we'll concise we'll ask chgb to concise
it in 600 words so as I mentioned
earlier you should be clear with your
prompts to chat GPT chat GPT will do it
fine so here you can see we have a new
script the revised script the concised
version basic
basically so here you can see we have uh
another three facts the same three facts
but this time they are concised to 600
vs so here you can see it didn't make
too much of change it didn't made any
like slight change right not too much of
change because I guess the other script
is also of 600 words around so I'll
reduce it a bit more and let's see I'll
say
reduce the script to 300 WS fine so we
are going to create a small video
because you can create a long version
but this time we are going to show you
by creating a short version The Script
the all everything will remain the same
it's just that you have to create a long
version you can add 10 facts or anything
you want to create right we can also
create shorts using chat GP that we'll
see in some other video and so here you
can see and here we have a complete
script now that's done we have a
complete script from here till here so
here you can see we have written over
here feel free to customize and add your
personal touch to the script and it's
basically chat gpts telling us that we
can customize this script and give some
personal yeah we can do it right we can
personalize it we can customize it
according to our needs so for now what
we are going to do is we are going to
take this complete script only we are
not going to customize it because it
will take more time so so what we are
going to do is we are going to move this
to this website it's weed. weed. is
another AI tool it will help us create
projects video projects so this tool is
completely free not completely free but
this tool is free to use as well fine
you can create projects you can create
videos from this tool so here you can
see once you go to the v.o website you
just have to sign in and just click on
create a project so now what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
video that to by only using the chat
gpts script fine so we are not going to
upload any video from there so we'll
just cut this this part now here you can
see we have different options we have
settings where we'll go to settings we
can change the layout uh we can also
create YouTube shorts here fine so it's
already here so here we are going to
create a YouTube video so that's why we
have used this YouTube 16 ra9 aspect
ratio so here here you can see this
clean audio it comes in the upgraded
version of this v. so we are using the
free version the trial version basically
for now so here you can see we have
media and then we have audio and then we
have subtitles text elements templates
we have a number of things right so here
you can see in elements we have
different sound waves we have we can use
them right so it totally depends on us
how we want to do it whatever we want we
just have to grab it from here we have
to paste it in the video and I'll show
you wait a minute so here you can see
we'll go to media
and media or audio whatever thing you
want so just click Text to Speech so
here you can see we have different
voices over here so if I use Ashley
female so we have to put the th thousand
characters so in free version we can
only use th000 characters only so if we
want it more than that we just have to
upgrade fine so for now we are going to
use the free version only so we'll write
over here this and then we have to use
this just a second we will copy it from
here we'll paste it
here and here we are going
to get a
second shot and yeah so here we have the
second fact and then we have the third
fact as well fine
so we'll write over here we'll copy it
from here we'll paste it here now we
have only6 characters remaining and if
you want to create the whole video so
we'll just copy this from here and just
paste it here so we
have uh like crossed the limit 78
characters over the limit so we'll
remove some
part more captivating content happy
coding and exploring Pro programming
history fine so we are done with the
complete script we have three FS we have
the intro part and the outro part now
just preview it welcome back today we'll
explore three
Captivate so it looks fine we can just
change the voice from here we can use
brance voice as
well now preview it welcome back today
we'll explore three Captiva and we can
change the English from here as well so
here you can see we have different
languages present right we have English
we have okay we have French we have
Indonesian islandic we have Canada we
have Lao so basically almost all the
languages are here so for now what we
are going to do is we are going to keep
it
English and we can also search for it so
here you can see we have
English yeah right we are using us
English for now so add to project fine
so it will generate the voiceover so for
now we are just adding the voice over
fine so here you can see we have the
voice over let's play it once today
we'll explore three captivating
historical facts about programming
languages that shape the programming
landscape so here you can see I take it
back welcome back so it it starts from
Welcome Back only fine now so you guys
can hear it right the audio is nice so
it's just a text to speech right we have
the voice over now for a video for a
complete video let's check towards the
end if it's there or not putting and
exploring programming history yeah it's
there right so you guys can hear the
voice and now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to add some
media over here so we want it to look
good so basically here you can see we
have different stock videos so let's
just add some stock videos and we have
to identify where we have to use which
video fine
we right over here coding and here you
can see we
have number of videos most of them are
basically free with the paid version we
are not using the paid version so we are
going to use this this video only fine
so we have to add it and just here you
can see the stock
footage okay so here you can see we have
the gap for adding this video now
now you can see the video is
here and we can also use the animation
effect the corners the opacity rotation
and there are different video editing
options basically we can use the clean
audio which is again A plus uh upgraded
version feature so here you can see we
have audio we can control the audio and
everything we can also use remove this
green green screen right we remove a
color from our video a particular color
we can
remove so this video is this long we'll
just play it once today we'll explore
three captivating historical factss
about programming languages that shape
the programming landscape let's dive in
in the late 1950s I so here you can see
we have this video what we are going to
do is we are going to welcome back today
we'll explore three captivating
historical facts about programming
language that shape the programming
landscape okay so till here we are going
to use this video and we are just
starting our video so we need something
like Welcome to our Channel welcome to
this welcome and subscribe and all this
so what we can do is we can add some
text over here fine and we'll just use
this headline title oh no we are not
going to use the headline title we are
going to delete it from here we are
going to use Simple Text
and just click on it just change here
right here
Welcome to our
Channel fine and that's
it we
can okay the video is moving for
now we can use this we can move this we
can keep it in the
center increase the
size in the background the coding video
will keep on going fine we'll use it
until here okay so we are done with this
and we can use some sort of animations
and all so we are going to use animation
over here so fade we can use slide right
slide
left we can use
wave okay so we are going to use
wave and come back today we'll explore
three captivating historical facts about
programming languages that shape the
programming landscape so it's looking
nice right here you can see we have this
welcome back today we'll explore three
captivating historical facts about
programming languages that shape the
programming landscape fine now the next
thing we need is we need another video
another St video fine so we'll again go
back to
Media it's taking time for my laptop but
if you have a good laptop a nice working
laptop so it will work totally fine
there will be no issues so I'll use this
video I'll drag it and drop it so the
drag and drop I guess it's not
working so just click on ADD video from
here and you can basically learn how to
do editing through this software alone
because here you can see we have
different options we have ai doing
everything for us right everything we
are getting in place just with this
one AI tool and so this is how AI is
helping us right so from here the new
video will come okay so it's a long
video a 20 second video and here you can
see the
transition sh landscape let's dive in in
the late 19 okay so the first fact will
come here right so we want some what we
can say text again
so we'll write over here or we can use
the typewriter one f for the first one
we'll delete the simple one and we'll
use the typewriter one
fine we just have to put it in
place just keep it
short and just change the caption what
we was the first caption fortron fine
foron the pineer
just write it over
here change the color to
white just take it a little
back resize
it place it according to your needs and
yeah it's almost done so animations we
can
use okay this time we are going to use
fall fine then it will say for run the
pioner it will come over here and from
here the fact will start in the late
1950s IBM introduced for Tran the
world's first highlevel programming
language it simplified scientific and
Engineering
computation now so here you can see we
have two videos right for next two facts
we can add two more videos or we can
just use these videos again and again
now let me tell you the simplest way of
adding videos through this software so
what we have to do is we need stock
videos right so if you need stock videos
for your uh videos like stock footages
for your videos so what you can do is
you can go to different websites where
the stock footages are free you can just
download them and you can just use them
here in v. so once you are done just
click on done and Export the file so
here you can see we have export video
option right so this is how we can
create a complete YouTube video uh we
are not creating creting one right now
because it will take a lot of time for
us to create now what you have to do is
you have to just go to
media and add some stock footages you
can here you can see you can upload a
file in this as well so what you have to
do is you have to upload a file use this
file over here and then what you have to
do is you have to use these uh what we
can say headings to express different
facts so this is how we can use chat GPT
to create a complete video fine now once
you are done with everything click on
done name your project if you want to
you can use any like Untitled project I
have used you can create any videos once
you export the video it will give you
certain options so here for now our
video length is 1 minute 8 seconds fine
for 44 MB is the size and our video is
short right v. gives you th characters
for free so that's what you can use we
have used those thousand characters and
once you done with this v. will allow
you to export that particular file so
creating a YouTube video using different
AI tools is easier right you don't have
to waste so much of time so if we
conclude it all you need is you need to
be sure what you want in your video and
that's it go to what we can say chat GPT
and then ask for the script chat GPT
will write the script for you go to v.
v. will create the video for you that's
it you can download it from here even
you can download the video from here
click on this download button and it
will download the video the one thing
will be you will get a watermark so if
you want to remove the watermark you
have to use the upgraded version of v.
fine so it's the easiest thing to do
right so here you can see the video as
far as we made so yeah here you can see
it welcome back today we'll explore a
three captivating historic so this video
so this video right now is not working
completely fine because of the laptops
we are using so if you're using these
software you need a little highend
laptop fine and so that's a wrap for
this video I hope you guys must have got
a good idea about how to use chat GPT
for video creation fine you can create
videos on your own with the help of chat
GPT and v. try making one and let us
know in the comment section if you are
able to make one completely fine so
don't forget to check the AI and ml
course we have discussed in the starting
the link is present in the description
box below Excel using chat GPT now let's
open an Excel document let's also try to
open a new terminal in chat GPT okay we
have a new chat now right now let's go
back to the Excel spreadsheet and here
you can see we have a CSV file which is
a little longer so let's try to
eliminate a few rows let's try to work
with only 50 rows for
now select the first
cell delete right now I want an Excel
formula to separate all these comma
separated values into separate columns
now we have some automated solutions for
it right but now let's try to create a
formula using chat
GPD now let's ask CH GPD to give a
formula to
separate
let's edit
this
copy the code and now go back to the
spreadsheet so initially it was trying
to give me a solution which is automated
but we wanted a formula anyways so and
now try to drag the same formula across
all the cells until we get the last
column header so it is quite lengthy so
I think the last column header is
somewhere over here here is with the
current manager if you drag the same
formula to all the rules all the 50
rules that we initially working with we
will also get the data set separated
right now if you go back there then you
can see the CSV has been successfully
separated into different columns right
now if you want to work on some uh let's
say some sum functions or mathematical
functions which you work with day-to-day
life right let's copy 10 random values
paste them in a new sheet calculate the
sum of these values right some of 10
values has charity for the
same all the mathematical statistical
functions like average mean median mode
subtract differentiation everything now
let's try to ask okay for the sumission
give
me a formula an Excel
formula to find out sum of 10
numbers in
Excel there you go that's our formula
copy the code and paste PED in this
particular cell it had 10 right so we
need to add
10 so let's add the 10th value here and
now let's place the formula which is
equals to sum of this was the formula
right A1 to
A1 11 okay no worries enter think this
is with the data type right so I think
the data type is okay it is carrying the
formula so we were supposed to uh paste
the values only right now let's try to
delete this particular column and
control shift to
be let's copy the values once
again copy and go to the new
sheet paste special paste values only
right now it's not carrying any of the
functions with it so if we implement the
same function which Char gave us which
is from sum A1 to A10
enter okay it's still not taking I think
it is carrying the formula but again no
worries let's enter some random values
10 20 30 40 50 60
70 80 90 and 100 now we have 10 values
and if you use the same formula sum of
A1 to A10 which chat gbt initially gave
us we have the summation similarly you
can also ask Char to give you any of the
mathematical and statistical functions
now let's say we want to uh do some
macro level functions right let's say uh
we want an interest
calculator right so before that we need
to save this file
as currently this is CSP right we need
to save it as macro enabled workbook so
that whenever we write a macro the macro
will be accepted by the workbook right
now let's
say uh
okay to insert a macro we need to go to
macros from developer options let's name
our uh macro as
okay let's ask
uh okay
I right let's create this and now let's
ask Char for the
code give me a macro
for
calculating interest
in
Excel it should be given me the code
there you
go simply calculate the uh simply copy
the code go to your macro eras whatever
we have here erase this because the some
you know the function name you're giving
a new function name here calculate
interest right instead of interest just
save it it'll ask for a small
change I think it's done now you can
close this macro and in the same
developer options go to interest create
a button create it somewhere over here
and uh click on the function that you
just created the mro just you created
press okay and if you want to change it
you know you can also change it uh
instead of button one just uh type in
interest there you go done now whenever
you click on this button it will ask the
amount right let's give some principal
amount let's say $10,000 annual interest
rate may be 6% as decimal and term
period let's me let let's think it's uh
one year should be good right so that's
how you create macros using Excel I
think I gave one like instead of 60,000
right
uh there you go and let's say you want
to take it to a Next Level let's say
advanced level you wanted to you know
split the first name and second name or
let's say you wanted to do a v lookup
function to calculate the performance
right now let's say we don't have this
okay uh we don't have a what say display
username we don't have a username in our
current sheet let's imagine we don't
have a username right now I want a v
looka function from Excel or you know
just also would do give me a v lookup
function so it'll give you the required
formula you can just use it right and
type in the v look of function here and
it's really simple equals to the lookup
value you're looking
for which is let's say here you we
trying to add the lookup formula lookup
value and uh the table array which is
this one right here you have given the
table array comma the column index you
are looking for you wanted the username
right so you need to give these two
columns and the value you wanted is okay
so
um now you wanted column index
3 and you wanted exact
match let T to select
enter so I think it required only until
C300 value okay I did not give the
lookup value that's my bad uh the lookup
range you are giving is the first to
three you wanted third
column enter and now let's give me a
value add it here and there you go you
have the answer right you have the user
ID and using name and that's how you use
uh looka function in Excel now let's say
I wanted to uh okay let's remove these
two here and let's also remove these two
here and and let's imagine the display
name itself is your username here now I
want to split them into first name and
second name so go back to chat GB and
ask for a formula give me a formula to
split the name into first name and
second
name an Excel
formula split name into first
name and last
name okay it will give you the formula
shortly copy
code okay go back to excel paste it
right there okay I think we copied two
codes we just needed one so chat gbt
will give you multiple codes here so you
can just copy the first
one and erase
these
give me a simpler
code okay so I think that was for two
different columns right so now let's add
it here let's remove this and add it
here now if you drag the same formula
you should be getting the first names
and if you take the second formula here
and paste it in the last name
position you should be getting all the
last
names right if there is no second name
you will be getting a value error and in
case if you have a value you will be
getting the second one you can also wrap
this inside if
error right
say not
available single codes since we're
giving a text value and enter so that's
how you use chat GPT for Excel so now
you can see some data on my spreadsheet
so we have row ID order ID audit date
and ship date ship mode Etc so this
means that this particular D set belongs
to a sales data set for a store or
something so what I have done is if you
look out the videos on our Channel we
already have created one of the
interactive dashboards using the same
data set so we Tred to extract
month-on-month sales region category
subcategory sales country-wise sales
shipping type sales Etc right so I have
you know kept the data as it is and all
the pivot tables as it is now let's say
we do not know how to create all these
pivot tables and pivot charts and
slicers Etc we just know that we have
the data and you're new to this and you
want to analyze your data how do you do
that chat GPT is here for the rescue so
before we get on to chat GPD let's
quickly remove all our reference pivot
tables about pivot table I'm quickly
deleting all these they left out with
only the data right and again you can do
this dashboard using chat gbd 3.5 or in
case if you have a premium version which
is chat GPT 4 you can directly attach
your data set onto the chat GPT prompt
and chat GPT will do all the analysis
you need right but for now let's
experiment using the chat GPD 3.5
version which is basically open source
and free to use now let's quickly hop on
to chat
GPT so there you go we have chat gbd
version 3.5 we are not switching to
four so now let's quickly um explain
what we are up
to high chart GPD just keep it simple as
if you're talking to your
friend
the D set belongs
to
super store
sales or is
about the data set is about uh
Superstore sales
report and I need
to
create a dashboard
oh month on
month
SE
so this is the pr PR and basically I
just explained in a brief way I'm not uh
giving the detailed information but hope
this works so basically uh what you
supposed to do is uh give uh the
requirement one by one but I'm giving it
in a single prompt so that I'll get the
results in one single prompt let's hope
for that so what you're trying to
explain CH GPD is that you have a sales
data set and you're using Excel for for
storing it and for manipulating the data
and trying to build some Innovative
interactive visually appealing charts
and you don't know how to do it so you
explained that to your chat GPD and uh
what are the uh things you are looking
to build what are the charts you're
looking to build so I'm looking to build
a month-on-month sales report which can
be a quarter on quarter month on month
year on Year date wise however the way
you like it right so uh make sure that
your data is properly formatted first so
here let's check out that your date
column is formatted to date data type
right sometimes what happens is the
representation of date uh changes to
user by user let's say this particular
data set or this particular inventory
has been allocated to five different
people to entry the data right somebody
might use this type of you know here you
have uh let's create a new sheet and try
to let me elaborate what I'm trying to
explain so let's say U person one
L three so let's say I use this type of
uh
formatting 15th December 2025 something
like that and somebody else uses 15 12
2025 and another one uses 15
December
2025 and so sometimes few people also uh
intend or you know may um follow uh a
date pattern which looks something like
this December the 31st
2025 right and it's not wrong so many
people will have different uh
conventions of writing their dates so
you need to make some data cleaning and
okay if you are coming back to data
cleaning we have listed a video in our
descriptions for data cleaning in Excel
and uh that would help you in various uh
data cleaning operations that are um you
know used in day-to-day lives of a data
analyst so that should help so basically
what you are looking for is so instead
of General go back to the data types and
here you can check out the data type
options and you can either give a short
date long date or in the case you want
to go for some additional formatting you
can also go to more formatting and here
you can check out the custom formatting
options here you can give a customized
option for now I want to go with date
and the date I want to go with is this
particular one which gives me date month
and yeah click on that and you should be
good to go right so make sure that all
the uh uh dates in your spreadsheet are
following one single date pattern so
that when it comes to uh month on month
quarter on quarter
and EBY sales that will help you a lot
okay it will just give you a filtered
option it will give you year on year
first then quarter on quarter next and
if you expand the option of quarter on
quarter you will have month on month and
if you expand the month then you will
have date wise so you will have a you
know better understanding when we
perform this operation in a practical
Way in real time and then we have the
next type of chart where we want to
identify country wise sales then we have
region wise sales so let's say I have
one country here let's say one sales
from France and uh I want to know what
are the uh sales happening in central
region of France North region of France
so you'll have region wise sales there
and category wise which category is
giving you the maximum profits or the
maximum sales and inside the category
which is that subcategory or which
product is that that which is giving you
the highest number of sales you can
identify that and based on that you can
plan a business uh you know you can get
up with a business strategy there and
shipment modes so which type of shipment
mode which should you invest in much so
that you can you know offer better
services to your customers so everything
comes so this is what I want to um you
know um extract from my D set so this is
my requirement you have explained this
to your chat GPD through the prompt and
just
enter now chat GPD should help you break
down the requirements and charity should
help you uh how to you know it'll get
tell you how to uh do the process so
here it will tell you the line chart so
basically it's um it's a it's a rule
that month- on-month sales or quarter-
on quter sales basically wherever the
time is involved the line chart is the
best to represent your numbers so now um
it basically tells you how to uh
represent your charts in what or how
what type of chart to be selected that's
good but now uh can you help
me
create the first
chart in
Excel there you go so it tells you uh
how to create it Ure you have a column
for dates and other corresponding values
so basically it is telling you to have a
properly mentioned or properly defined
metad data or column headers then select
the data go to the insert tab choose the
line chart okay and let's say uh you
wanted to create an interactive
dashboard right so to create an
interactive dashboard or to basically
create a dashboard you need a pivot
tables and you don't know how to create
a pivot table you can ask chat GPD to
help you create uh a pivot
table help me create a pivot
table
for the first
type for all the types okay
or for the data
set certainly
so it'll mention you the steps to follow
to create a pivot
table there you go so what's the first
step highlight the range of cells that
contain your data set and including
headers and go back to Excel and you can
just click on any cell and control a all
your data set has been selected or these
days you can just select one of the
cells and and go to insert menu and
pivot table and now from the table range
Excel will automatically select the
entire range of the table you're looking
for or you're working on and in case if
you are having any doubts on that you
can just select all the range and go to
the same insert option and select the
pivot table click on okay in a new
worksheet and there you go you have your
new uh say U pivot table let's delete
this now remember wanted to create the
month-on-month sale for the first uh
pivot table and pivot chart so and
remember about the uh date formatting so
we'll be looking on that now we will
drag odd date onto row here and you can
see here so this is what I was talking
about so Excel has automatically
segmented your dates we we have about
10,000 rows in this particular data set
and it has segregated all the 10,000
rows into four different years 2020 1 22
and 23 and if you expand the selection
of air it has segregated again into P 1
2 3 and four right and if you expand
quarter one you have month-on-month
sales in quarter one month-on-month
sales in quarter two and month- on Monon
sales in qu three and so on right so
this is why I was requesting you to have
a proper data formatting for all your
dates right which could be really
helpful when you want to extract the
quarter on quarter sales and date wise
sales and year-wise sales right so now
we wanted to find out month- on-month
sales right or year on year sales so
where is the sales yeah here we have the
sales parameter just drag that onto the
values and there you go now format this
into the currency
type so the currency is dollars American
dollars and you can eliminate the
leading zeros here if you don't want
them there you go now you have the whole
number here you can also do the same for
this you can select the entire
table go to pivot table okay let's check
the uh options provided by chat
gbd so basically we have created a pivot
table now we want to create a pivot
chart how do I create a pivot
chart so again it's making really clear
statements and really clear steps so
it's again making sure that you create a
pivot table first right so we have a
pivot table and uh highlight pivot table
data click anywhere on your pivot table
to highlight the entire range and insert
pivot chart with the pivot table
selected go to the insert tab on the
ribbon and then click on pivot chart and
uh open the insert chart dialogue box
choose the type you want and uh
customize the chart select the chart so
customizing the chart we look onto it
and Fields if you want to keep a few
Fields you can and if you want to
eliminate a few Fields you can you can
also do that refresh data let's say why
refresh data see chat gbd is so
brilliant right so let's say uh I have
the sales data until 2023 and now we are
in 2024 let's say we update 2024 onto
this particular spreadsheet and now we
have that particular data in the
original spreadsheet but that is missing
here in that scenario what you can do is
just go to data and here you will find
the refresh all option once you click on
this you can find the 2024 data updated
here for now we have not added yet but
in case if it's added all you can is
just refresh your sheet and everything
will change so brilliant suggestion from
chat GPT and save and share in case if
you want to share so let's follow the
same steps select any cell in the pivot
table select all the sheets go to insert
Tab and here recommended charts or go to
the charts option and select the chart
that you are looking for so we are
dealing with uh time so I would go with
the line chart just click okay but in
case if you want to create an
interactive dashboard just go to pivot
table analyze and here you you have the
pivet charts and again it'll give you
the same option just select the line
chart here and press okay so you have
your line chart over here so again if
you are editing this so you can remove
the Legends if you want remove U
anything else or you can customize that
okay there you
go and if you want to edit the name of
the chart you can also do that so I will
do this as M Sales
report okay accordingly I'll change the
sheet
name there you go right
now quickly we will create the other
charts as well so the process is same
you can hold control and drag this
particular sheet and you have the next
sheet so the next uh requirement that we
have that we requested chat GPD was the
country wise
sales so everything will remain the same
what changes is okay let's close this
and here instead of order data we will
have okay let's remove this from rows
and quarters
months right country so we will drag
country into rows and there you go now
we have countries now now country wise
so you can uh select this cell go to
pivot table analyze pivot chart and you
can select the bar graph so it
automatically gave you the first
suggestion as bar graph click on that
and you have the bar graph over here and
you can also edit the chart you don't
want you don't want the Legends you can
remove them and edit the name of the
chart
to Country wise
sales
go and uh quickly drag and drop the
sheet again new pivot table and here you
wanted category wise
sales or segment wise
sales uh close this
particular thing be this and instead of
country you're going to add segment to
the row and remove country and you have
segment wise sales select any sell on
the pivot table go to pivot table
analyze pivot chart and here you can use
any of the available um charts here let
me use the finnal chart or
histogram bar chart will be better press
okay and there you go you have the bar
chart same edit your you know customize
your uh
chart change the the name
to segment wise
sales hold control and track the sheet
now you have subcategory wise
sales instead of segment you will be
selecting the
subcategory you can remove
segment
and you can see the chart also changed
here and again you can do the category
wise sales so this was segment wise
sales you can quickly change the segment
to
category and you have it we quickly
quickly go back to yeah so we have done
the category Wise subcategory Wise
region wise is remaining
and shipment
modes so quickly drag or drop the region
remove subcategory from the
list there you have the region y
sales edit the
name
and the last one which is about the
shipment
modes remove region and there you
go now you can create a new dashboard
over here and name it as
dashboard you can do some customization
to your D dashboard like selecting these
cells giving it a
color there you go now you can quickly
copy and past paste all these uh charts
to the
dashboard starting from the month- on-
Monon
sales
copy
paste so I'll quickly do all the uh pas
thingss as soon as
possible
e
e
e
there you go you can also manage the
size of these charts so that everything
fits onto one sheet so for now let's try
to unpin
this so that we have a little better
visual
appearance okay not a problem
and now uh we need some filter right so
something which can make it a little
more interactive that's when you add
slices and let's say you don't know how
to add slices back to chat gbd and ask
chat gbd how do I add
slices to my
dashboard
there you go so is telling you to
uh add everything in a step-by-step way
and it also is talking about the
interactivity right it's it is asking
you to connect all the slices it it's
telling you to report the connections
right if you just add the slices based
on one single okay basically you need to
select one of your charts here and uh
select a pivot table or pivot chart go
to the pivot table or chart associate
with the slicer and insert and go to the
insert tab and insert a slicer I'll I'll
tell you that so basically it it's
telling you in a very beautiful way step
by-step manner right and even after
adding the slicer it it is telling you
to connect all the uh basically all the
charts or all the um you know CH
dashboards and charts you created at
this particular tutorial and connect all
those charts to that particular slicer
using the report connections option and
you can get the interactivity right so
in a very beautiful manner it it has
explained you let's try the way it has
explained to us go to the dashboard
select any one of it and uh go to the
insert option and here you have the
slicer right so now you have all the
slicers over here so basically we wanted
what type of uh slices is so I have
created a month-on-month
uh chart so I'll go with order date
slicer which is here then I have created
segment wise sales so I want segment
slic slicer country wise slicer category
and subcategory wise
slicers region wise so region slicer and
do I have anything else let's scroll
down that's the last one so where is
shipment
here yeah shift mode country region
category subcategory segment order dates
and shift mode so I will have multiple
slices in one go right now you have to
arrange your slices in such a way that
they are interactive and they they look
like they are sorted in one place so let
me do that quickly we have some space
left here in the bottom place of the
dashboard you can also keep your slices
there so what basically chat gbd meant
was if you try to use the slices here it
will you know the changes will reflect
only in one of the pivot charts not on
all all the pivot charts so to get that
interactivity to get that connectivity
between all the charts you need to do a
small setting which is called as report
connections so select one of the slices
over here right click and here you have
something called report connections so
when you report connections you have all
the pivot charts and pivot tables that
you just created you can just select all
those pivot tables that you created and
press on okay so that all these pivot
tables are connected to that particular
slicer uh you can just expand this and
check if all the pivot tables are
selected press okay do the same for all
the slicers I'll quickly do
that
e
so there you go we have interconnected
all the charts now let's let's say I
want to find out the sales that happened
in the latest year just go to the
filters select any of the dates
2023 and you have the data and if you
want to select any particular country
then you can also do that I want to go
with United Kingdom and in United
Kingdom we have all the data here let's
say I want to check out only for the
phones there you go now you have an
interactive dashboard which will tell
you the sales that happened on the date
of 16th of November 2023 in the region
United Kingdom for phones right and uh
segment is home or office ship and mode
with standard class and major sales that
happen are from nor region and the
categories from tech technology right
and that's how you create an interactive
dashboard using chat gbd in Excel so
each and every step has been mentioned
very clearly by chat GPD and you have
all the data in one place so let's
quickly remove all the
filters and there you have the entire
dashboard so without any further Ado

aspiring artificial intelligence and
machine learning expert or you might

different job roues like business
analyst data analyst but you might not
know how to build a resume that is ATC
friendly that is application tracking
system friendly and get you a job most
of you just go through the job
description provided on LinkedIn inded
noty or any other job portals and you
just copy paste the uh job rules and
responsibilities and expect the at
system to crack it or if not the ETS
system the hiring manager or the HR to
click on your receiving right that might
not work in all the cases so we have our
AI friend Chad GPD to help us build the
resume according to the job description
and the ATS friendly nature of your
resuming should help you land your dram
job now let's take an example let's open
one of the job portal platforms like
LinkedIn okay so here I'll be looking
for data analyst and here are my search
results I have senior data analyst data
analyst senior product data analyst

data analyst and here is your existing
resume so let's say this is your
existing resume and and you have a a lot
of things to add in here you have your
educational qualifications here you have
your you know maybe the cover letter and
you have your skills which are enlisted
bottom in the bottom section of the
resume right so it talks a lot let's say
uh these are not the ones which the uh
ATS system or uh the hiring manager is
looking for how do you make it a little
more interesting to do is I would use
chat GPT I would go to the job
description here job purpose and job
description I'll simply copy the job
description job roles and
responsibilities and everything right
now I'll go back to chat GPT and write a
promp just tell chat GPT hi chat
GPT imagine you are uh 20 year old or
let's say 15y old
[Music]
professional resume writer
now I need you to check on the job
description for a data
analyst and help me with the cover
letter
resum
so it should be a two-way communication
most of you end up doing some mistakes
wherein you try to extract all the
information just in one prompt so I
would uh recommend you to keep it in a
two-way communication let chat GPD know
what you're up to let chat GPD know its
role and responsibility right it should
understand what you are expecting from
it so I'm trying to convince it that it
is a professional resume writer and I'm
telling it to check out a job
description which I'll be sending it in
a minut and then I need it help to
create me a cover letter and resume
right now let it know about the job
description okay I'll give you a job
description you need to
understand the
key the key points of this job and
critical
expectations from the
candidate here are critical expectations
from the candidate here is
the
JD
now is given me some of the critical
roles and responsibilities that this
particular job role demands from the
candidates now uh you have all this
right so you need a cover letter first
so give me a cover
letter covering the top
three
responsibilities or highlighting instead
of covering you can write it as
highlighting in my according okay so
give me a cover letter highlighting the
top three
responsibilities keep the cover
letter under 200
words
so here you have your cover letter dear
hiring manager I'm writing to express my
Keen interest in data Andis position at
your esteemed organization and uh I
bring expertise in three pivotal rules
some of the uh corporate languages that
chat gbt helps you with is the one key
factor which will help you crack your uh
you know uh the initial stages of the
interview you can just get uh a
clickbait from the hiring manager and
it's the best chance to get your resumer
selected now let us proceed with the
resume
right build me
resume using the job
description so this is what you actually
do but uh I would recommend you to go a
step further right now you can use this
template it will give you professional
summary key skills required professional
experience correct and education so this
is not everything so what you need to do
is take the key responsibilities right
so you can take the professional summary
as is given by chat gbd or you can
enhance it based on your own words
and you can give your basic details
about your name address ZIP code email
address phone number LinkedIn profile
Etc you can go with the same
professional summary or you can enhance
it in your own words and coming back to
key skills you can add your key skills
here based on the profile you're adding
and uh here you have professional
experience and here you just have plain
English plain statements right so what I
would recommend is the plain English
points will not help you if you can take
the entire template as a test and when
it comes to your uh uh professional
experience I would suggest a few
modifications here so these are the few
modifications which will help you and
your resume to stand up from the others
correct so here you can add your
educational qualifications your
certifications and professional
membership so in case if you have any
professional certifications from
authorized organizations you can also
take them and attach them to this
particular resume and references will be
available upon request now coming back
to the critical modification that I has
been suggesting you so when it comes to
professional experience let's say I have
this particular professional experience
on my resumer right so what I could do
is uh tell chat
jpt uh or you can also use the same uh
detail that it gave you you can copy
this
and ask chat to quantify
this can you
please if I
my
experience you can
use terms
like 15% organic
growth
10% reduction in
expenses for advertisement
this increased Revenue per
lead lead by 12% so you can just add on
some numbers right so it will when you
quantify your experience when you
quantify your pointers it will help the
potential recruiter to understand your
potential in a much better way and your
resum will also be shortlisted there you
go you have your new resume here and
again giving you some key notes on this
particular area so what you can do is
you can also modify or enhance these uh
professional experience based on the top
problems faced by the company or top key
critical roles and responsibilities that
you need to fill right to solve those
problems in that particular company and
take those positions and secure the
company right that's the overall point
of it so ensure that these particular
professional experience fall in line
with these key skills at least the top
three right and that will be
self-explanatory for your recruiter and
the rest of the part is as usual so the
chart GPT resume always follows the ads
format and the only major different what
it makes is right the only uh difference
what your resume and the rest of the
people's resume make is the difference
in the way your quantif finding your
achievements the way you are measuring
your capabilities and adding them on
your resume to catch the eye of the
recruiter are the few things that matter
