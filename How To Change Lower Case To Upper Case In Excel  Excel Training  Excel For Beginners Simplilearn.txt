ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to convert cells from
lowercase to uppercase in excel now
let's get back to the practical node and
now we are on our excel spreadsheet
so
here we have some text boxes on the
column a
and on column b we have lower and upper
okay
so um we have a mix of uppercase and
lowercase in our text so first we'll try
to convert them to lowercase and then
we'll try to convert the entire text
into uppercase so for that you need to
press on equal symbol and select the
lower formula
tap
and you selected the function and now
click on the cell a3 that's your cell
address and press on ok now all the
letters are converted to lowercase so we
had j in the uppercase which is
converted to lowercase now all you can
do is drag the formula to all the cells
and it will be applied to all the cells
right now let's similarly try to convert
into uppercase and tap space and there
you go you have selected the formula now
the cell address
press enter
and drag the same address i mean drag
the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the echo all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you convert the cells or data in excel
to uppercase or lowercase in excel and
with that we have come to an end of this
