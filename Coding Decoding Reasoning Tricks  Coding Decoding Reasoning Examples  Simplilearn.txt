coding and decoding is one of the most
complex topics in the reasoning section
this section is one of the most common
sections included in all major exams
conducted across the country many
students find coding decoding and
reasoning questions challenging to solve
and as a result they avoid attempting
these scoring questions and lose some
easy and quick marks so to make it easy
for solving and clearing the exam we
brought you some tips tricks along with
some better examples to make you feel
better and easy while solving
hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video from simply learn in this
session we will be discussing coding
decoding and reasoning tricks however
before we begin make sure that you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
don't forget to click that bell icon so
you never miss an update from simply
learn before we begin let's take a quick
look on the agenda for today's
discussion
first we will begin with learning what
coding decoding and reasoning is
then we will walk through learning why
we need these
after that we will dive deep into
learning some of the important tips
tricks of coding decoding and reasoning
followed by that we will wind up the
session by discussing some of the
important benefits of learning coding
decoding and reasoning
now let's dive into the session
first we will understand what is coding
decoding and reasoning
first let's have a look on the coding
coding is a part of logical reasoning
section used to encrypt words numbers in
a specific pattern of course using
particular rules and regulations
let's have a look with the help of an
example if a question asked code if
mango is p e q j r then what will be the
code for human
explanation
if you observe the above example the
code of mango is written by replacing
the three alphabets after m
so the same should be done for human
so the updated code will be k
x
p
d
and q
this is the process of how coding works
next we will have decoding let's have a
look over decoding
decoding is the process used to decrypt
the patterns into original forms from
the given forms let's have a look at a
decoding using an example for clear
understanding
if the question asked code of research
is r
s
e
a
e
c
h then what will be the code for people
explanation if you observe the above
example research the first and last
letters remain same the others
interchange the positions in pairs of
two so eo becomes oe
pl becomes lp
so code of people will be
p
o
e l
p e
this is how decoding works
the next in the list is we have
reasoning let's have a look at reasoning
the reasoning ability section is one of
the most common sections that is
included in all major exams conducted
across the country it is the process of
thinking about something in a logical
and sensible way to find the perfect
solution
let's talk reasoning using an example
find the number of triangles in the
picture
explanation in the above picture there
are some triangles our task is to
identify the triangles using some rules
by numbering the triangles it is easily
identified so the total number of
triangles in the image are eight
this is all about coding decoding and
reasoning
now let's have a look at why we need to
learn these
at present every job has entrance tests
where applicant skills will be examined
every entrance exam involves some kind
of aptitude round which is filled with
these kind of questions
so coding holds a significant role in
these kind of jobs
every company is concentrating more on
these rounds to recruit employees
these coding decoding and reasoning
skills will also help improve knowledge
and enhance your skills by logical
thinking
so these are the few reasons why
learning coding decoding and reasoning
skills is important now let's learn some
tips and tricks of coding decoding and
reasoning with the help of examples now
let's dive deep into these tricks
first let's have a look at the first
coding decoding number
in coding decoding every alphabet is
specified with a number starting a with
1 to z with 26.
these are the numbers for the alphabet
sometimes the numbers are also managed
to be specified in a reverse order with
a assigned z
this is how we specify numbers to
alphabets to execute coding decoding
operations
now let's dive deep into some types with
examples
in this session we concentrated on these
five coding decoding techniques from
these five topics the questions are
frequently asked for interviews in the
other competitive exams we have letter
coding number coding substitution coding
mixed letter coding mixed number coding
let's have a look at these five with
examples first we have letter coding
letter coding is a type in which the
letters are replaced with other letters
let us take an example monkey is coded
as k
m
l
i c w then what should be orange written
according to the monkey
explanation to solve the solution we
have to keep in mind that every alphabet
has a specific number so in the given
question we have monkey the code for
monkey is m is coded as 13 o is coded as
15 n is coded as 14 k is coded as 11 e
is coded as 5 and y is coded as 25 in
the same way k
m
l i c w is coded as k is called as 11
m is called as 13 l is coded as 12 i is
coded as 9 c is coded as 3 w is coded as
23. if you observe the given word it is
coded by decreasing 2 for each alphabet
so in the same way to code orange the
same number should be decreased
so orange is coded as o is called as 15
r is called as 18 a is coded as 1 and is
coded as 14 g is coded as 7 and e is
coded as 5. so in the same way each
alphabet is decreased with 2. so the
solution of orange would be 13
16 25 12
5
and 3
and the word should be coded as m
p
y
l
e
and c
now let's go for the second example
the mouse is coded as
n
l
f
h and v then
what should be cream written according
to the monkey
explanation
to solve the solution we have to keep in
mind that every alphabet has a specific
number so in the given question we have
mouse the code for mouse is m is called
as 13. o is coded as 15 u is called as
21 s is coded as 19 e is coded as 5. in
the same way
nlfhv is coded as n is called as 14 l is
coded as 12 f is coded as 6
h is called as 8 and we is coded as 22.
if you observe the given word it is in
the reverse order see the given table
then you have an idea about how the
letters are replaced using the reversed
letters
so in the same way to code cream in the
exact reverse order the reverse order
method should be used so cream is coded
as c is called as 3 r is called as 18 e
is coded as 5 a is coded as 1 m is
called as 13.
so in the same way each alphabet
replaced with the reverse order
so the solution of orange would be 24
9 22
26 and 14 and the word should be x
i
v
s and e
these are some examples of letter coding
now let's have a look at number coding
in the number coding section of
reasoning ability the candidate will
have to observe and guess the hidden
code of two or more sets of numbers once
the parent code is known the candidate
will have to use this code to generate
other numbers
let's have a look at examples for the
clear understanding of number coding
we have house is coded as 3
5 8 4 two then lemon is coded as one two
six five and nine then helen is coded as
so the curd for every letter is already
specified in the question itself so no
need to understand fixed codes of the
letters now let's specify the number of
each letter to solve the problem if you
observe the two words some of the
letters are repeated so no need to write
the repeated letters now let's code the
letters
h is coded as three
o is coded as five
u is coded as eight
s is coded as four
e is coded as two l is coded as 1
m is coded as 6 and n is coded as 9.
using these codes helen can be coded as
3
2
1
two and
nine
now let's have a look at another similar
example
we have coding is coded as
one two four six five and nine
and then is quoted as 4 3
5 then decoding is coded as
the code for every letter is already
specified in the question itself so no
need to use the fixed quotes for the
letters now let's specify the number of
each letter to solve the problem
if you observe the two words some of the
letters are repeated so no need to write
the repeated letters now let's code the
letters c is coded as 1 always coded as
2 d is coded as 4 i is coded as 6 n is
coded as 5 g is coded as 9 e is coded as
3.
using these codes decoding coded as
4
3
1
2
4
6
5
and 9.
so these are a few examples of number
coding
now let's have a look at substitution
coding in substitution coding some
particular objects are assigned to
codenames then the question is asked to
solve the answer in the same pattern
let's have a look at the example for
clear understanding
we have question
if white is called as red red is called
as blue blue is called as green green is
called as yellow and yellow is called as
black then what is the color of blood
as we know the blood color is red so if
you observe the above question it is
mentioned that
white is called red and red is called
blue so blood is red by using the
substitution method the answer would be
blue
now let's have a look at another example
if mouse is called keyboard keyboard is
called monitor and monitor is called a
cpu and cpu is called as printer then
what is used to type
as we know the keyboard is used to type
words but in the question it is
mentioned that mouse is called as
keyboard and keyboard is called monitor
so according to the substitution method
the monitor is used to type the answer
would be
monitor these are a few examples for
substitution coding now let's have a
look at the mixed letter coding
mixed letter coding in this type of
question three or four complete messages
are given in the coded language and the
code for the particular word is asked to
analyze such quotes
any two messages bearing the common word
are picked up
the common code word will mean that
word now let's have a look at some
examples for a clear understanding of
mixed letter coding
the question is in code language
hakka bao means how are you
means
good and bad
what does r stand for
explanation if you observe the question
it is mentioned that both first and
second statements are repeated as the
common word in both these statements is
ca rest of each word is different
so
r stands for car
so according to the mixed letter coding
r stands for car in the above question
now let's have a look at the second
example for more understanding and we
have in code language
means sun is out
means you and me
are
means get out from
then what does out stand for
explanation if you observe the question
it is mentioned that out is repeated in
both the first and third statements so
the common word in both these sentences
is ba
rest each word is different so out
stands for ba
so according to the mixed letter coding
out stands for ba in the above question
so these are the few examples for mixed
letter coding now let's have a look at
mixed number coding
in this mixed number coding type of
question three or four complete messages
are given in the coded language and the
code number for each particular word is
asked now let's have a look at some
examples for clear understanding of
mixed number coding
and the question is if the monster
hunter is coded as 3 2
4
will be the
is coded as 4 7 6 and they are in is
coded as 1 5 8
each digit represents t
so the explanation for this question is
if you observe the question in two
statements
the is repeated and in both the two
statements only repeated letter is 4. so
as for the mixed number coding the exact
code
for the is
4.
now let's have a look at another example
and we
have if you are good is coded as 2
5 6 good and bad is coded as 3
5 8 and we are bad is coded as 6 3 7
which digit represents
bad
explanation if you observe keenly in the
question in the two statements bad is
repeated and in both the two statements
the only repeated letter is three so
according to the mixed letter coding the
exact code for bad is three
these are a few examples of mixed letter
coding
this is all about the types and examples
of coding and decoding concepts now
let's have a look at the reasoning type
of questions
in this session we have covered 12
reasoning type concepts and their
examples starting with number series
verbal classification
logical deduction analogies letter and
symbol series statement and conclusion
cause and effect verbal reasoning
logical games artificial language
statement and assumption and finally
essential part
now let's dive deep into the concepts
first number series number series refers
to a sequence of numbers following some
pattern where candidates need to find
the missing or wrong number in the
provided series let's have a look at an
example for clear understanding of the
concept we have
question
look at the series
10
50
15
40
20 and so on
so what should come next
explanation
as mentioned in the numbers in the
series are 10
50
15
40
20 30. if we observe the series deeply
the alternate numbers are increased and
decreased
first and third numbers are increased by
five and second and fourth numbers are
reduced by 10 in the same way all the
alternate numbers are increased and
decreased
so according to the order the following
number should be increased by 5 so the
following number of the series is 25.
now let's have a look at the verbal
classification concept
in this type of reasoning question you
have four words all four words except
one are related to one another in the
same manner three words out of the four
words will be in the same classification
you have to select the one word that is
not related to the other words and we
have a question
pick the odd one from the list handsome
attractive
bottle
and charming
now the explanation
it is mentioned in the above question
all the answers are related to beauty
except the third option it is not
related to beauty so the odd one in the
list is the bottle now let's have a look
at the logical deduction
logical deduction is reasoning which
constructs or evaluates deductive
arguments a deductive argument is valid
if the conclusion does not follow
necessarily from the premises the
conclusion must be true provided that
the premises are true
now let's have a look at an example for
clear understanding of the logical
deduction concept and we have the
statement
some kings are queens all queens are
beautiful
conclusions all kings are beautiful all
queens are kings
now explanation as mentioned in the
above question only one premise is
particular so the conclusion should also
be particular so the answer would be
neither one nor two follows the given
statement
now let's have a look at an analogies
concept
analogical reasoning or argument by
analogy can be defined as a specific way
of thinking based on the idea that
because two or more things are similar
in some respects
they are probably also similar in some
future respects now let's have a look at
an example and we have glass break
fire
explanation
if a glass is thrown or falls then it
should break so as related to the first
one the fire would burn
according to the analogies the answer
would be fire burn
now let's have a look at the letter and
symbol series
letter and symbol series are sequential
order of letters numbers or both
arranged in such a way that each term in
the series is obtained according to some
specific rules these rules can be based
on mathematical operations place of
letters in alphabetical order let a
series in a logical arrangement of
letters of the english alphabet arranged
in specific pattern now let's have a
look at the example of letter and symbol
series
and then we have s c d
t e f u g h
blank
w k l so what should be filled in the
blank
explanation if you observe the first
letter of every word is replaced with
the following letter and the second and
third are replaced with alternate
letters so the following word in the
series is we i and g
let's have a look at the statement and
conclusion type concept
statement and conclusions topic
comprises a statement followed by a set
of conclusions for the same candidates
need to choose the most appropriate
conclusion regarding the given statement
let's have a look at the example
we have
in a test cricket match the total runs
scored by team are 450 out of 450 runs
350 was scored by all rounders
conclusion
so the first point
78 percent runs are scored by
all-rounders
second point
the middle order batsmen were all
rounders
now the explanation for this question is
if you observe with the question all 78
percent runs are scored by all rounders
so one doesn't follow and nothing is
mentioned about middle order batsman so
the two also doesn't follow so the
conclusion would be neither one nor two
follows
now let's have a look at the cause and
effect type
cause and effect is a relationship
between events or things where one is
the result of another or others
this is the combination of action and
reaction something happens of course
that leads to an effect now let's have a
look at an example we have statements
one vidart is nervous
second where art went to hospital for
checkup
so the explanation for this type of
question is
if you observe the statement one is the
cause and statement two is the effect so
the solution is
virat is nervous he went to the hospital
to consult a doctor now let's have a
look at the verbal reasoning
verbal reasoning is understanding and
reasoning using concepts framed in words
it aims at evaluating the ability to
think constructively rather than at
fluency and vocabulary recognition let's
have a look at an example and we have
smoke is related to pollution in the
same way war is related to
explanation if you observe the statement
smoking causes pollution so the war
leads to destruction according to the
concept the solution would be
destruction
now let's have a look at the logic games
game logic is a model logic that extends
proportional dynamic logic by generating
its semantics and adding a few operator
to the language the logic can be used to
reason about determined two player games
now let's have a look at an example
varad dhoni and rohit are three brothers
if the following statements are true
which of them is youngest
rohit is elder virat is not older than
dhoni dhoni is younger than rohit
explanation the first statement it is
given that rohit is elder to dhoni and
bharat the second statement tells virat
is younger than dhoni it also states
that virat is younger than rohit and
dhoni so the answer would be virat is
the youngest now let's look at the
artificial intelligence concept
artificial language is a part of
analytical reasoning where decoding the
meaning of some artificial language is
the main task some predefined artificial
languages with their meaning will be
given in the advance
some predefined artificial languages
with their meaning will be given in
advance by referring to that we have to
decode the original meaning of the
artificial word from the given options
let's have a look at an example what
could be the meaning of mess
guys
tulsa f means hello guys another means
hey raj
e h e r f o p w s e means hello miss
explanation
in the first and last statement hello is
common so the first
e
h e r e f is hello so
talls is guys and
miss
is o p w s e and the answer would be o p
w s e t u l s now let's have a look at
the statement and assumption
in a statement and assumption question a
statement is given in the question
followed by a few assumptions made on
the basis of them candidates need to
pick the assumption which is most
appropriately and logically is correct
now let's have a look at an example
statement detergent should be used to
clean floats now let's have a look at
the assumptions detergent forms lather
detergent helped to dislodge grease and
dirt explanation
in both the statements nothing is
mentioned about the lather so first is
not implicit detergent is used to clean
clothes quickly and easily so second is
implicit now let's have a look at the
essential part concept
essential part is
one of the important topics in logical
reasoning section
an essential part question each question
contains a word followed by the answer
choices let's have a look at an example
of essential part
company
work
report card salary employees
explanation in the above example the
company cannot run with our employees
the other three are also crucial in the
company but the essential is an employee
without an employee the rest is useless
as per the essential part concept the
answer would be employees
these are a few concepts and examples of
reasoning based questions now let's get
into learning some benefits of coding
decoding and reasoning
coding decoding and reasoning cover all
the aspects of learning that helps in
improving the focus and ability of a
person
almost every job related exam depends on
aptitude rounds which plays a key role
in recruiting the candidates
these are the few abilities of coding
decoding and reasoning this was all for
