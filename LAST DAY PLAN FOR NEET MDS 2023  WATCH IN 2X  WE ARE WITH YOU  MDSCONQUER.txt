okay hi guys good evening one and all so
I'm just going to give you a few tips
suggestions uh or like stress Breakers
which are really required uh for you in
this one day like you have one day for
your examination
so tomorrow is a valid day few of you
may have plans to travel to the
examination centers or few of you if
you're residing in the same place where
your examination centers are there yes
that's going to be wonderful so tomorrow
you have all sorts of things like you
need to plan accordingly but there are
few things that you have to consider
before uh going to the examination or
before giving your examination
so March 1st is your examination and you
have tomorrow that is February 20th one
day for your exam so today I'm not
considering one day for your examination
and the main important aspects that you
have to focus on one is your mental
Fitness
you should be mentally very very strong
okay uh you should not talk much about
the subject related to the examination
uh with anyone okay and particularly
before you are entering into the
examination center so there will be
people sitting on a group and
discussions and everything goes on don't
do such things okay so this is going to
affect your mental illness you have done
extraordinary so you're you're being
with conquer from one year few of you
from two years
few of you from six months and you're
doing good so there's nothing
extraordinary that you can do half an
hour or one hour before the examination
in front of the examination center if
you want you can read like whatever you
want to read you read yourself don't
discuss with your batchmates uh the
answer is that the answer is this all
these stories please don't do because
there may be some students some
individuals unknowingly or knowingly
they may create some negative impact on
your examination they'll ask you hey
have you do you know cephalosporin's
classification
immediately you I know that you can
manage cephalosporin's classification
and you also know that you can manage
Supply and classification but when an
open end question is given to anyone
even
to the person who has prepared suffers
for his classification also the author
also he will have a dilemma okay so the
Dilemma will be more one day before
examination or few hours before
examination so don't do that don't check
your check I mean like don't try to
check your knowledge or don't try to
check the knowledge of your friend or
your co-asporate so this may create
negative impact on you
so that is about the mental uh Fitness
like uh you need to talk with the
individuals who are positive you're
stressed if you want to talk with
someone talk with someone who is
positive to you talk with someone who is
going to give some positive vibes to you
so don't talk with your co-aspirants
okay because unknowingly knowingly they
may give some negative feedbacks that
will decrease your Fitness
mental Fitness second one physically you
should be very active so I strongly
recommend you to have a very good sleep
today because tomorrow
's you have to sleep but I'm not very
sure about tomorrow's sleep okay so this
is what my feeling when I was giving my
examination it was my my sleep pattern
one day before like the day before exam
was hardly like uh three or four hours
because it was very difficult for me to
manage the sleep and all those things
because uh I was I was in a different uh
Center Center is far away from my place
and we have taken a
portal over there so it's going to be
difficult for few of you so today have
good sleep today I have proper sleep
like even tomorrow also whenever you
feel sleepy go sleep because sleep is
very important for your performance in
the examination center okay right so
physically mentally you should be fit
have some good food light food okay so
on the day of examination also I prefer
you to have a light break first
from the place or from the home or the
same type of food what you think for
example you're staying in home
whatever whatever things you are eating
every day do the same or if you are
eating outside every day staying in
Hostel or eating outside make sure you
take food from the same place okay don't
go randomly and pick some oily food or
something because nothing is going to
happen because I know that your body and
my body are so resistant to everything
but why to take a risk because exam is
more important than anything
because we are working from past one
year for this examination so don't drink
anything outside don't drink anything
cool outside okay so make sure you drink
sealed water whatever happens after the
exam is fine but before exam is going to
hurt you and hurt me too okay so good
food good water light food okay good
sleep physically mentally fit these are
basic requirements from your side before
you enter the examination center
one so apart from this like uh
uh like before before the exam like
whatever you want you can prefer you can
plan there may be few mentors telling
you don't read anything one hour before
the exam I don't have any such
suggestions whatever you want
you read make sure it is more relevant
to the uh revision part okay don't waste
your time on XYZ stuff until unless it
is a repeat or it's a controversial
repeat question okay that is accepted
you can waste some time but but if it is
not a repeat if it's something like an
XYZ an update or very far from the scope
of repeats or very far from the scope of
revision don't waste time on such things
okay so coming to the uh plan for
tomorrow like probably if you're reading
like 10 or 12 hours tomorrow along with
three hours today so you have somewhere
around like 10 to 15 hours of revision
time from now till the date of
examination till the time of exam so
I'll go with the first year subjects
okay you want me to tell those things
you want me to discuss those things or
sell we have only a few more positive
positive talks that may break your
stress you want me to discuss the must
do aspects
okay so uh like as as I suggested you in
the last 14 days or in the last three or
four days I I asked you to go ahead with
more with the mock exams the 25 mock
exams plus uh the 10 years uh repeats or
something like I have suggested you like
people who are already doing good you
can just check the classifications and
these numbers and everything from your
power playbooks or the quick revision
videos this is what the suggestion I
have given and I hope that you have done
at least like 50 60 percentage and I
hope you have reached that 50 60 risk in
it but make sure you try to spend more
quality of time with the repeats because
repeats should not be spoiled in the
exam okay like for example if it is a
mock exam mock exam question your 25
marks are only for you the other
Institute people will have a different
mock series okay so even if you spoil a
mock exam question that is accepted at a
particular level but when you're talking
about repeats 2022 or 2020 or 2021
repeats are common for the all the
students who are preparing from any
Institute in the country who are going
to give exam on the March first that is
common that everyone they will do
repeats so when a repeat is coming in
exam and if you are spoiling the repeat
then your your intentionally moving out
of the competition
so this is very important so you should
be very accurate I know that uh I mean
like whenever they're asking a repeated
repeated questions uh the controversial
questions will not be asked 99
percentage of cases don't worry about
that controversy regarding the questions
but I want you to focus more on the
repeats because repeats should not be
spoiled because people who are going to
give competition like the Thousand or
two thousand students who are doing a
really extraordinary and who feel they
are in the competition with you the 2000
students all these two thousand students
most of these 2000 students will be
perfect with the repeats rather than the
25 month exams 25 Mark exams conquer
students will be perfect so this this
common sense I hope you have this common
sense and I hope you have done repeats
well but there are few students when I'm
asking questions on the group they are
going wrong in the repeats it's okay I
accept it but
give a glance over the repeats okay
so coming to the things that you should
not skip coming to Anatomy I strongly
recommend to have a quick glance of your
dental pulse synopsis of anatomy
particularly your osteology particularly
or gender histology General histology
General embryology that pharyngeal
arches General histology examples of
each type of epithelium how to identify
those epitheliums and your osteology
Basics your branches of your arteries
branches of your nose all nerves
exceptions and all these are very very
important and I hope you have done it if
you have done it known it if you are not
done make sure these has to be given
importance
that is all about an autumn
so jumping into the next part that is
your biochemistry so coming to the
biochemistry I strongly recommend you to
have a quick glance of your PP books
okay
because most of your glycos and storage
diseases okay so all these storage
diseases the deficiency of enzyme the
type are regularly asked memory based
questions in the examination of course
vitamins no need to revise I hope you
can manage the vitamins vitamins is not
a big deal okay if you want you can have
a quick glance over the dosages of
dosages of vitamins which are there in
your PP books okay but vitamins most of
the questions I feel like you can handle
so no need to check those vitamins but I
want you to check those other things
like which uh I mean like which Cycles
takes place in cytoplasm Cycles takes
place in mitochondria fatty acid
synthesis your classification of ammonia
acids water saturated what are
unsaturated water essential what are
non-essential all these classifications
are memory based and they are important
and they can ask a question about this
so that's all about biochemistry jumping
into physiology particularly I want you
to check out those
respiratory system stuff okay lung
volumes lung capacitance coming to CVS
CVS system okay heart sounds how these
sounds are heard how the circulation
everything takes place this is all there
in your physiology synopsis part of
dentals endocrine glands endocrine
glands what are the glands and what they
say create what are the uh the things
hormones they secrete what happens if it
is increases what happens if it
decreases and all these important stuff
are there in your physiology synopsis
part which I strongly recommend you to
have a quick glance because easy part of
questions may come from this particular
area so coming to DM again DM
classifications are very very important
okay coming to the first chapter that is
your physical properties followed by the
classifications most of the
classification GIC classification zinc
phosphate classification you have many
classification density of the bone
classifications so lots of
classifications few of them were
discussed recently on the group also so
it's a combination of operative
Dentistry Plus Dental materials please
check out those classification and
members if time permits
I want you to see the adaption sequence
table once that eruption sequence table
but yes and everything I hope you can
manage the sequence the sequence maxilla
mandible together combined sequence I
ask you to check okay prepare by
yourself I want you to check that and
apart from that Dental pulse synopsis
part of your permanent dentition is very
very important all permanent dentition
what are the unique properties that it
grows where these grooves mesial lingual
group is seen in the marginal group is
seen in okay uh your palatal canals your
parallel lapses are more common with a
palette of ginger grow is most common
with c-shaped canals are most common
with so all the specular properties you
have you try to check those things
coming to dental histology I want you to
check the enamel enamel and Dentin
particularly pulp and everything I hope
you can manage and I'm a dent in
cementum are important okay okay you may
get confused over these areas okay so
the what are these properties like
histology related stuff also if you are
clear okay if you are not clear is to
check histology don't leave those enamel
Dentin pulp is important but I feel like
you can handle cementum is important
okay
and similarly salivary glands okay
salivary glands composition everything
will be there because last 2022 two
questions were asked on Celebrity gland
composition please do check the salivary
column which is purely serious which is
purely because mixed predominantly
serious what are these glands and
everything now Supply what is the nerve
supply for each and every gland please
do check it that is all about histology
so jumping into pharmacology I don't I I
don't strongly recommend to check out
pharmacology but uh topics like your
general pharmacology what is zero order
kinetics what is faster Auto kinetics
what is the difference between them what
is KM values combination with your
biochemistry and drugs which are showing
this zero order kinetics and phases of
clinical trials recently discussed on
your group phase one phase to phase
three phase for all the important points
followed by T half the calculations of T
half and everything I hope you can
handle those things and um I like uh I
mean glucose 6-phosphate deficiency what
are the drugs which are going to cause
those hemolysis and everything and
followed by uh I want you to check the
drug of choices okay particularly uh
chemotherapy drug of choices for
chemotherapy are very very important and
apart from this I hope rest of the
things you have to do uh previously
everything related to Pharma it's going
to be impossible drugs of choices
clinical trials maybe uh the general
pharmacology part you can have a quick
lens then jumping into General pathology
I want you to check out this genes genes
apoptosis The Joint the genes and those
uh things particularly genetics I want
you to check the genetics what is
autosomal dominant examples what is
autosomal racism examples okay x-linked
rice is so excellent all these examples
which are there in your power play book
part three first two pages so I want you
to check those examples which are very
very important and mode of inheritance
that is Pedigree charts and everything I
hope you can handle so those are
important apart from that histological
slides of General pathology are very
very important complement system uh and
your
apoptosis are important histological
slides of your of your general pathology
and specimens of General pathology are
nowadays frequently Asked in the
examination so if possible please do
check anemias leukemias histology again
it is very very important so jumping
into microbiology I don't want you to
touch microbiology much but if time
permits and if you are not very sure
immunoglobulins has to be done
hypersensitivity types and the
predominant cells and the examples has
to be done immunoglobulins stuff has to
be done and followed by like maybe like
you need to focus more on like
streptococcus staphylococcus what is
this catalyze test positive Catalyst
test negative no abiotin test positive
test negative and followed by maybe a
glance over the TB TB drugs are
important again and it will be drugs are
important uh a glance of of these things
like are important I don't want you to
waste much of your time on microbiology
then general medicine uh I mean like
it's a combination of Pharma Physio and
all these things no need to spend time
uh surgery I think clinical based
questions I hope you can handle it so
there is nothing uh that you need to
check very deep in your general surgery
like until unless you mark something
which are a rally memory based or
something like classifications any if
you have class classification all these
things uh malignant melanoma also 2020
do they have an ask a question on
malignant melanoma also so if you have
any such stuff which are marked by you
then you can check in your general
surgery coming to oral pathology oral
medicine I want you to check out the
histological slides of the most common
tumor cysts and all these things there's
nothing very specific I hope you can do
uh oral path and oral medicine that's
the best until unless you have some
classifications or something that you
have to do it uh please do go back and
check it if not I hope like oral path
oral medicine you can manage Radiology
part there are few things like the units
of radiology or something like PV books
can help you out so there are few tables
that you have to have a quick glance
which are more often a memory based but
clinical radiographic questions and
everything are more oftenological so
there's nothing to revise over there I
hope you can handle them
then after Tito uh I don't I don't
strongly recommend to have a glance over
pedo uh until unless you want to check
some classifications are very specific
you can go back and check it and coming
to Ortho Ortho tables has to be done
from PV books okay so all these tables
which you are recently posting on the
group has doubts and all the Stables of
Ortho has to be done okay or the tables
has to be done like what is this MCA by
MF values uh control tipping
uncontrolled tipping diagrams and
everything like momentum lots of stuff
is there right so if you're clear okay
more of most of these are conceptual
things like if you are strong it's okay
if not uh if time permits Ortho has to
be given some more importance compared
to any other subjects perio I hope like
you need to check out the uh drugs okay
you need to check out the drugs you need
to check out the sutures suturing
techniques uh you need to check out the
classifications classifications of Perry
are very very important okay you need to
check out the classification what is
murin's classification uh what is
Miller's gradings and all these things
little classifications instruments of
perio classifications plus the diagrams
are uh are important okay so then
jumping into the next part that is oral
surgery again I strongly recommend oral
surgery you can handle it uh things to
be revised is if you want you can revise
classification so many classifications
are there in oral surgery if you want
you can just have a quick glance over
the classifications if not you can you
can Endo similarly same eye goes within
the again classifications are important
like a few of those classifications was
discussed one two or two days back on
the group so you can just check those
classifications if you want again
operator Dentistry combination of dental
materials plus classifications icedures
classification has to be done mounts
classification has to be on TV blocks
classification has to be done so there's
lots of classification GIC
classification questions are frequently
coming pretend visual classification
questions are frequently you take end of
2020 21 22 of course 2023 you have you
will have a classic you'll have a
question on weans or vertices
classification again 2021 22 repeated
questions that is uh loss of RFS
location so I mean these are very very
important areas like from operator as
well as from indoor point of view so
then jumping into the next part that is
the pros though prosto uh I want you to
have a quick glance okay just try to
turn the pages of your dental pulse
synopsis part of your cdfpd and RPD okay
there is nothing very specific you may
get confused related to the major
connectors clasps okay of your of your
RPD and coming to the CD uh like you
need to focus on articulators types
examples uh you need to focus on
compensatory curves okay you need to
compound you need to focus on the
formulas uh and everything like okay
coming to fpd I hope you can handle that
PD your Auntie's law question was given
in 2000 2021 choice of phonetics we have
discussed Lots right fontix uh make sure
you check pre-fabricated fontix you may
get confused with normal phonics I hope
you can handle if time permits you check
the prefabricated fontix which are there
as an as a table of 10 lines or
something in your dental pulse synopsis
you can go back and check it that's
going to help you out because they are a
bit tricky to understand they're a bit
tricky to answer in the examination
without any logics
uh then jumping into the implants part
that's what like implants uh like video
you have prepared a notes particularly
the distance from the implants uh
calculations and everything followed by
uh your density
classifications of implant your Osteo
your integration concept your fibro
osteos and this concept or recently
there are few more Concepts given in
your implants and their values or
everything is there in your PV Books
Okay I I forgot to say about forensic
foreign check out those classifications
of the lip prints check out the few
things which I have given in your
forensic the methods techniques and
everything related to foreigntology I
have given as the notes from Shoppers
okay so just have a glance I hope you
are already done with that if time
permits just try to have a glance that
is all about prosto then jumping into
the community uh Community is more often
a memory based uh like you have few
aspects more moving on the memory based
okay such things like your committees
and all those things your who recent
team
and the basic stuff about this covid-19
related to community stuff
covid-19 can be an important aspect okay
check out the drugs and everything like
whatever uh sahity ma'am has discussed
related to the covid-19 and apart from
that uh studies uh Community tests uh
your buyer statistics questions will
definitely come but I hope you can
handle them okay so no need to waste
time they're more often a conceptual
things
so this is all about like uh outline of
community okay so Community I I hope you
can ignore
uh surgery you can ignore
uh Endo you can ignore operative in
combination with DM if you do it's going
to be good little bit of brushing is
required Ortho brushing is required and
that's all like coming to the clinical
part that is the thing like Basics you
need to focus more I strongly recommend
you to focus more on the basics
particularly the first year Basics which
are going to be easy and scoring okay
right so this is all about from my side
yes question paper will be in part here
and part to be part here will be for 100
marks and Part B will be for 140 marks
they told that partia will be focusing
more on uh first year second year third
year subjects and Part B will be
focusing on more on a final year
subjects but it's an integrated exam uh
you cannot discriminate them as part A
Part to be basically the question can
come from like an orthogation related to
embryology can come in part here okay or
an embryology question related to uh
Ortho or Peter can be coming in the
pathway so you cannot differentiate the
subjects but it's going to be overall
like a party A Part B in your
examination
this is all from my side here about
about things that you should not skip
one day before exam focus more on and
not biochemistry
uh General path
micro
DM prosto author okay others I hope you
can manage okay right is there anything
more I need to talk
physical mental Fitness is required you
try to sleep as much as possible today
today and tomorrow even even in the mid
midday of tomorrow also if you are
feeling sleepy go and sleep
but I don't want to give any plans like
attempt this or items that basing upon
your convenience
you have to attempt both the parts so I
don't I don't regularly the few mentors
who are going to give some suggestions
by do I don't you you start something if
you're not feeling comfortable you jump
to other make sure you have to manage
the time because you have given 25 GTS
which is very very huge so there is no
point of uh managing managing part issue
for the conquer students okay how to
avoid negative marking already discussed
okay so I I hope like if you are given
25 Mark examination so there's no point
of talking about negative marketing I
hope you know what number has to be
attempted and what number has to be done
okay no that's what like if you don't
know anything if you don't know
completely for example I got some some
like an extraordinary word like I never
heard in a Dentistry even I don't know
which subject it is I don't want to
touch such question there is no trial
and error here I don't want this that's
such question if I know at least the
definition of some keyword in the
question I'll try to eliminate the
options and I'll try to go so whenever
you know something in the question
attempted that is that is the open
principle I can give you if you feel
your preparation is good
you have done your best okay and once
you're reading the question if you know
the meaning of the keyword for example
options are tough but the question is
about like and planners I know like and
planners so I'll try my best to attempt
till I can plan this question I don't
want to skip the like and planners
question but if I see a terminology or a
pathology which is completely new to me
so I don't want to touch I don't want to
talk about that that is how you can
avoid negative marking negative marking
is question which is bringing bringing
negative score to you means question
which is unknown will bring a negative
score to you so don't don't touch those
questions
however negative marking is already
discussed in the video okay I'll post
that video after the session on the
group people who want to check that you
can go back and check it
foreign
Day After Tomorrow 180 180 180 minutes
is your time and you have 240 questions
okay whether you start part one whether
you start part two whether you start a
whether you start B okay so there is
nothing you have to solve all 240
questions so if you feel you are not
comfortable uh starting part A then you
jump to Part B there's nothing like
whatever it is you have to do all the
questions so like for example if you're
if you're planning a preparation uh and
you'll have leftover 10 days I can ask
you focus more on Part B clinicals but
it exam it's not like that you have to
focus on only one part so do everything
like whatever you feel comfortable you
can proceed I don't want to suggest
either party or Part B Anything Can
Happen part A can be uh some some people
are going to tell you party is going to
be more tough part B will be easy maybe
that that is not 100 sure even Part B
can also be tough so I don't strongly
recommend like you can start some
something if you are not feeling so
comfortable then you go to Part B if
you're not feeling comfortable there you
can jump here but if you're feeling
comfortable and things are on your track
just go forward and straight away try to
finish them that's what I'm telling
solving the question paper I don't want
you to go for Rounds okay there are a
few people telling that round one round
to round three round for wheat cannot
sit for that many rounds in three hours
because you hardly have 45 seconds to
solve each and every question which is
very very minimal time and if you're
getting a case-based question 45 seconds
is not at all sufficient okay so what
you have to do is there is only two
rounds one is round one known questions
second one is round two unknown
questions that's all for example if Case
based question 10 lines is there it's
going to eat away your time so push pull
that to round two
some question is given or positive
prediction negative prediction question
is given push it to round two if time
permits only you have to answer round
two questions if time doesn't permits
your scoring will be moving on round one
so whenever you have more than five
lines whenever you have whenever you
feel like this question is going to take
more time for you you just keep it to
round two
right round two you can skip it question
which requires time for elimination
question which requires time to think
and answer which will take some time
round two okay so for example if a
question is asked given by
okay but I was given but you have to
answer it there is there is no point of
waiting and pushing this question to
router because you cannot invent proper
time in the two or three hours and come
out with the right answer calculation
based memory based or classification
based little bit of confusion which
requires time they can be pushed around
too okay clean clear simple repeat
questions known questions known aspects
has to be done in round one and the
leftover questions has to be handled in
round two that's all
don't worry about papers pencils and
everything okay if they provide paper
they will provide for everyone if they
provide pencil they will provide for
everyone so there is no bias in this
okay so don't worry about that it is
same for all the students it's a
competitive exam same for all the
students so don't worry about them
yes you can open
you can open you'll have you will have
those blocks you can open whenever you
want
anything more
of course we will pray
don't worry
prayers are already started
whatever we can do we'll do it don't
worry
your job is to peacefully enter the
examination center give your best shot
and
85 to 90 percentage of the questions
will be coming in the boundaries what
were thought to you what were discussed
200 questions will be coming in your
boundary sum my mind is only not stable
here how how can I expect my students
mind to be stable exam this is exam
definitely our mind will be instable you
are going you are going to the exam why
my mind should be instable even my mind
is also instable not only May everyone
even said Imam is also watching the
video why she has to watch this video
pointless
because she is also feeling a bit tensed
that's the point here okay so my point
is very clear and simple exam I still
remember in 2018 I have given my uh MDS
third year final exam I I still remember
how thanks diverse while giving the exam
or while giving the exam instruction
that can be an lkg exam that can be a
PhD exam also at any level any is
function will be there so that's a
common thing you try to overcome that
which exam is the easy I I just want to
ask one question
which exam is easy like your uh
finally your theory exams are easy or
McQ exam is easy
McQ exam is easy finally your theory
exam you have to write something from
your brain you have to draw the diagrams
here you have to just keep ABCD that
pinky pinky ponkey
okay whenever you have a recent uh have
seen as I've seen a video McQ how to
handle McQ whatever the option which is
the longest that is the answer all of
them answer
okay McQ exam is easier answers are in
front of you you have to select the
answer writing an answer is difficult
selecting an answer is difficult
writing an answer is difficult or
selecting selecting the answer is
difficult it's very simple okay so
whatever exam you are giving
um
is an easy exam okay why your tense is
this exam result will may affect your
career that is the reason why you are
tensed am I talking uh my words are
sensible right why your why your fear
why why you are scared because this exam
rank or score
may affect your future
it's not exam which is making tense it
is the outcome of exam outcome of exam
is just spoiling your party so so come
come to the reality so what my
suggestion for all of you is every one
of you is
I can give you 100 percentage of
assurance that your life will be
comfortable in dentistry okay because we
are planning few more classes after your
exam both offline and online
many interactions this year I'm coming
with a different approach so your life
and Dentistry will be definitely
comfortable that is 100 is for sure
okay so don't worry about your future in
dentistry because you're more worried
about your future in dentistry because
this exam may impact your future
whatever it is whether your private
college Government College whether
you're from Clinical Department
non-clinical Department we have a very
good plans don't worry about the outcome
of this exam on your career go give a
best shot and come back
this is what anyone can do okay so don't
overreact to the situation there are
many many things which you have to focus
on the Future Okay many things like post
exam is the real game that is the real
game what department do we choose which
call is to be choose where I have to do
what I have to do how I have to do what
I have to learn your h word is your
teachers seniors this is more important
than this exam but I totally right the
exam rank may give you some sort of
satisfaction okay uh picking the college
government college typhens and
everything so for this we are into this
that is open secret so go
tell us about Mark review they will
consider why to keep in mind I don't
understand the problem here why you want
to keep it in review
why waste of time again you want to go
keep it in review again you want to
remove the review keep it in unanswered
again you want to answer it why I I
don't understand here Mark review and
all these are very important because you
want to revise it they are important is
there anyone planning to revise tomorrow
or day after tomorrow on the day or in
the examination Hall people are planning
to revise anything
why why to Mark the review I don't
understand why the need people also kept
marked review
I will I will read this review after two
days item
so it this is illogical right so just
just go be smart this is what smartness
required right why to keep it in the
review why to open it back again keep it
in the unanswered why you want to go
keep it answered why you are wasting so
much of Time how many seconds you have
for each question
how many seconds you have for each
question
45 in this 45 seconds you can do all
this punch I think
I'm asking you can do all these things
go back definitely in this 45 minutes
you need to go to one round of washroom
you will have this all imaginations and
everything blankness will be there for
15 10 20. so many things happen here in
this three hours it's almost like a
like you'll have that RR movie feeling
will be there three of us right
South Indian movies are three hours
minimum three hours nowadays so you'll
have all those feelings no interval no
break okay so I don't want you to do I
mean I'm giving an open statement for
all conquer students no reviews nothing
if you know answer it if you don't know
unattended if you want to come back and
check attempted so don't waste your time
okay one of my senior did not qualify
because she did not make the answers
after marking them for review better we
will not do it that's what I'm telling
again you need to feel bad whether they
will carry it or not whether they won't
carry it or not this is all like
confusion so that's that's what like I
don't uh suggest I mean definitely
before you start the examination uh
before you enter the examination what is
going to happen is uh there will be big
screen uh keeping all the rules
regulations how the scorings will occur
everything okay then you need to submit
uh keep a tick mark and you need to
submit same like how you attempt your uh
examinations here the mock examination
is a screen will come right the screen
will come a similar screen will come and
you need to read each and everything
because you are going to enter the
examination a hall like half an hour or
one hour what is the time they have
given I have not seen the time one hour
before the examination time you have to
enter or half an hour
oh okay whatever it is like you will
have time to check all those things but
I strongly recommend uh
like if you want to uh if you want to
clear the cushions if you want a
question to be checked again then you
can keep those things in the review but
make sure the review has to remove
either they have to be shifted to
answered either they have to be shifted
to unanswered because I I hope you it's
clear right
so don't waste time on this review
aspect and feel bad after the
examination be clear be simple be cool
and be compost
anything apart from this review so many
are worried more about reviews nowadays
every movie they are giving review and
this year students are giving review for
my question cover after the exam sir
extraordinary question paper very nice
very nice paper setting sir
reviews are very common nowadays
I will give a review after the result
for your preparation
anything more or shall we close the
session
okay go back and study okay so a few
things maybe we will be discussing in
the voice notes
um
dear students all the very best for your
exam so don't be panicked don't stress
yourself just be calm and compose and be
happy
okay so don't worry about the result
don't worry about the exam you have done
extremely well just give the exam that's
it
okay with 100 confidence you gave it
nothing more than that and nothing less
than that you will have your result
whatever it is there it's already
written in the heaven and it is absented
so don't worry about that so just go and
write the exam and do your best okay and
key one small tip is in if once you open
the exam and the first two three
questions may be if they are the tough
ones or they are the ones which you
didn't read don't let that affect the
other two for the 230 questions okay so
what happens is we'll be thinking about
the first question or the second
question and you try to show the impact
on others just don't do that that's the
only tip I want to give even if it is
don't let that affect your other
questions that's the only thing I want
to say okay so you will do extremely
well all the it depends on the paper of
how many questions you have created so
once you know where you are standing and
where you are prepared accordingly you
write the exam so just give the exam the
calm and composed mind okay don't stress
Don't get sweated hands and don't vomit
or of course all that will happen to
many of the students they will be
acknowledge they are feeling everyone
have seen many they I start already the
messages I've been getting them I'm
getting nausea feeling man I'm not able
to sleep man I'm not able to wake up or
I'm not able to eat I'm I'm trying to
say the same thing just try to calm
yourself
not only you right almost thousands of
students are writing the same exam so
how you are managing your stress levels
is up to you okay yeah all the best
okay guys so thing is if question paper
is tough or if a question is tough
it is tough for everyone not for you and
uh whatever whatever content you have
done and whatever we have given
um it is something extraordinary okay it
is like it is beyond the things that we
have done so many things for this
particular batch so your preparation is
really the next level
so of course it's a comparator exam
right so if you feel something is tough
like if the feet like I still remember
2020 question question paper was
completely a bouncer for most of the
students they were coming out and
telling that the question paper was sort
of sort of sort of okay but finally once
the result was out everyone they have a
very decent and a good rank in their
hands this is mainly you underestimate
yourself
I have given a horrible attempt
I've given a horrible attempt okay I was
very very feeling very very bad but on
the day of result I was so happy because
others have done more horrible than me
so my rank was around like 30 and that
is more than sufficient for me okay so
it's like comparative thing like you
have done well
who knows this we know that you have
done real extraordinary but you may
understand yourself that I don't know
this I don't know that okay so Point
here is
you're going to do extraordinary so I
have 100 is confidence on this and don't
assume that Magics are going to happen
from the first question
like I hope you have seen many movies
like twist will be there in the interval
bang or the things will be settled on in
the final climax right so I want every
one of you to fight till the last minute
it's a fight it's a fight of three hours
assume that this is a fight of three
hours and you have to give this fight
till the last minute I still remember
there were students who were real
extraordinary first 10 or 20 Questions
spoiled
she spoiled the entire exam and the
other student was a referred student
from the same batch this is a Topper
2019. they're from Vishnu topper 2000
2017 she's a Topper of the batch
University topper she spoiled the exam
because first questions were so Tang
were so tough
another student who is a referred
student
she's very lucky on the day because her
first time questions were known
questions
and finally
unknowingly the referred student has got
the best rank among the callers okay so
so fight till the last second and there
will be a few more suggestions which
will be dropped as a voice note maybe
tomorrow night okay if you have anything
you can just drop me on the WhatsApp I'm
talking to most of you on the phone I
was talking to few of you on the phone
okay so if you need anything any help
any support psychologically mentally
the entire team is open to help you out
