yeah very good morning one and all now
I'm just going to discuss few MCQs which
were given in our grant exam that was
conducted recently on community and
period so this is the question that is
given the composition of plaque from all
the types of registry to material is
almost similar except one of the
following so you need to find the odd
man out in this list for example if you
take GIC JS into consideration as we
know that GIC is going to release florid
okay so fluoride whenever it is released
and the relationship between the
fluoride and the bacteria is there is
one engine called as an Jam analyst
which is a very very important engine
that is required for that like Wallaces
process so when our fluoride is present
when our 50 ppm of fluoride is present
it's going to inhibit this engine and
prevent the glycolysis so indirectly
it's going to decrease the plaque so
with this explanation we can go for GAC
is the best option when compared with
the rest of other options the next one
this question is about the gingival
masses which was I mean let it not depth
oriented question but few questions were
given in this area in the recent
examinations so all the options which
were given under this question were
direct lines that are taken from
textbook see this the gingival masses is
going to provide epithelial thickening
increases the keratinization and
increases the mitotic activity both in
the epithelium as well as connector
tissue is the right statement so going
to the second statement epithelial
thickening increases the
characterization and increases the blood
circulation was not shown to be
beneficial in restoring the gingival
health
basically when you massage gingiva the
main reason why we'll get this positive
signs or good signs these because we are
removing the plaque indirectly so that's
what the point 3 says improved ginger
will help associated with the
interdental stimulation is more likely
the release of microbial plaque removal
than the ginger will massage so this is
the primary reason why we are getting
these benefits okay and it is not that
great in registering the gingival health
but it is very important in removing the
microbial plaque content which
indirectly helps in the gingival health
okay so all the statements are true if
you don't know learn it okay all these
three are direct statements which are
taken from Carranza so the next question
is the best method to differentiate
okay the best method to differentiate
acute periapical abscess and periodontal
abscess okay they're asking the best
method there are many methods and few
people are confused about their clinical
practice okay most of them are in terms
of final years done with the final year
internship they they have an idea like
if you have a vertical percussion tbp if
you have a vertical percussion then that
is periodical abscess if you have a
horizontal polarization horizontal
direction that is a periodontal abscess
we have this misconception this is also
one of the method but the best method is
the vitality okay if you have a vital
pulp and if you have an abscess that can
be mostly a periodontal abscess if you
have a dead pulp a non vital pulp
okay non-vital pulp and if you have an
abscess then that can be mostly a
periapical abscess okay so the best
method is the pulp vitality okay so the
answer is vitality tests next one so
there is a slight controversy regarding
this I I cannot consider it as a
controversy okay because one area of
dental pulse the how given a different
answer another area in the synopsis they
have given a different numerical with
this people got confused okay so that is
the correction actually but the right
value that is there in the recent
edition of Carranza is seventy two
hundred percent is so basing upon that
right value the incidence of gingivitis
in pregnancy you need to go for fifty
two hundred as the right answer next one
a bit controversy but you need to under
understand the underline the keyword
that is the minimum bone density or the
minimum bone okay so they're asking the
minimum bone that is required in this
particular question so the data that is
given is the diameter is four
millimeters okay don't get confuse it is
diameter in few questions to trap you
they can give you radius and I hope you
know the relationship between the radius
and diameter
so diameter is equal to 2 into radius so
this is radius and this is this whole is
diameter so diameter is equal to 2 into
R so they can give you radius also to
trap you to see you're like how focused
you are while reading the question so
the diameter is given that is 4 and the
length is given that is 10 millimeters
so they're asking the minimum that it
bone that is required so if you take if
you consider this as an implant and this
is what they have given for okay and for
an implant you need a surrounding bone
okay you need a surrounding bone the
surrounding bone dimensions that are
given are 1 to 1.5 millimeters
surrounding bone you required if it is
minimum if it is idle you need to go for
one point sighs so now the question is
about minimum so you need a minimum of
one millimeter on my sensor and one
millimeter on distance I totally you
require 4 plus 1 plus 1 that is 6
millimeters so you have 6 millimeters
and coming to the length of the bones
according to a statement that is given
in carranza the minimum length is 10
millimeters except in the case of your
mandibular posteriors because mandibular
posteriors you have mandibular can also
you need to go for 12 millimeters as a
safety so in mandibular posterior
specifically if they ask a question you
need to go for 12 millimeters you rest
of the areas because here they have not
specified right so you need to go for 10
millimeters so the answer is C coming to
the next question it's a key correction
in your exam and the right answer is
papillary preservation flap nothing to
explain direct question mandibular sorry
it is anterior teeth with a severe or
moderate you need to go for papillary
preservation flap okay this this is
again a bit of controversy so end of
evolution there is something called as
end up and parry olesia so it's nothing
but a combination of endodontic relation
and a parrot or deletion so basing on
that they are divided into simply
they're divided into three categories
one is
primary endo and secondary period means
primarily it is endodontic amine factor
and then and then secondly is your
period or deletion right and the second
one is primary period primary afarid or
deletion and secondary aeronautical
lesion and the last one is combined in
relation or a combination lesion means
you cannot differentiate whether it is
primary and or primary parry or second
or second row which cannot be us both
integration as well apparent relation
but with the clinical futures and
everything you cannot differentiate
whether it is an endodontic relation or
a periodontal lesion such lesions can be
categorized or diagnosed as may combine
lesions or or a combination lesion okay
so here this question in a case a tooth
has endodontic and periodontal problems
together but they are not given which is
I mean like which is which is primary
ouches primarily started or which is
secondary side they have not given so
consider it as a diagnosis of combine
leisure so according to the recent
studies of endo periodontal lesion for
any type of case whether it is a primary
internal secondary periodontal whether
it is primary periodontal second right
analytical whether it is a combined
lesion always try to start with the
initial treatment of endo first complete
endo finish the endodontic part then go
for the periodontal part or you can go
for simultaneous but if I know an option
is given like first go with end or
rather than going with next go with a
period so that is the best option okay
so what the question says is that I
endodontic relation should always
precedes the periodontal lesion yes this
is a right statement okay this is true
for all the types of interpolation
whether it is a primary and analytical
nation or whether it is a primary
paradorn relation whether it's the
combined lesion always start doing end
of first do end or treatment first then
go with the period treatment so that's
what the question is
okay next comes with the prevalence II
question it's it's a bit controversial
question there are two statements
regarding this question two right
answers okay both two and three are
right according to me but if you open
the recent edition that is the 24th
edition of Park okay
it was clearly given ratio can be the
best option according to me so if you
have any errors in your basic books
please do correct my keys ratio because
24th edition of Park clearly says that
it's a ratio of course it's a proportion
too but if you have both option then you
can think of both but if you have to
select the best among the four go for
ratio okay again a bit good question
this is a very good question and the
question is about the residual chlorine
levels so people going into the question
love you ask a few aspects related this
residual floor the minimum required they
have not mentioned where and when the
minimum required is 0.55 milligrams per
deciliter minimum without any giving an
idea like whether it is a water body
whether it's a swimming pool or whether
it is a portable water they have not
given any such things minimum chlorine
required is 0.5 milligrams per deciliter
and they can ask you the time okay the
time is 60 minutes the time of duration
of quantity is 60 minutes so these two
numericals are very very very very
important one is 0.5 and second one is
and the second one is the 16 okay so now
go into the go deep into the question
the key word in the question is water
bodies okay so these values varies from
option to option for example if they
give normal water okay then go for
answer as 0.5 milligrams per deciliter
if they give water bodies then the
answer is 0.7 milligrams per deciliter
if they give swimming pools swimming
pool then the answer is 1 milligram per
deciliter and the time duration is
common for everything 60 minutes
three minutes 60 minutes if they have
not mentioned anything whether it's a
water body whether it's a water whether
its water water body our swimming pool
if they're not mentioned anything the
minimum requirement is this one so
clearly given a water body so you need
to go for 0.7 as an answer slight
controversy regarding this question okay
this this this this is directly taken
from your carranza so with this
reference you can consider the answer as
random okay I don't know why this was
posted as doubt to me it's very simple I
hope you know this this this symbol is
related to AIDS which color band it is
red color band next goes with okay add
added simple question
okay levels of prevention the four
levels of prevention right primordial
primary secondary and tertiary among
this the fourth option will comes under
as a primary level of prevention okay
people were quite confused about this
see this question to find out whether
there is a caries reduction in a group
of individual before and after okay same
individual before and after this data
before and after the same individual is
paid because you are doing a paid data
in the same individual right so it's a
paid t-test before and after in the same
individual is paid t-test okay different
individuals at the same time is unpaid
you if you are comparing the amount of
caries reduction caries reduction in
boys and girls in boys and girls that is
paid t unpaid t-test okay our student
t-test
that is unpaid or student t-test what is
the question is comparing carries
reduction in boys and girls after
Florida application
is unpaid comparing the caries reduction
before and after application the same
individual then you have to go for paid
t-test hope it is clear okay a bit
high-level question so basing upon the
benefits and the size of the benefit and
the nature of the benefit the clinical
significant is divided into level 1
level 2 level 3 level 4 I just want to
make it as simple as possible
okay so basing upon the sales size it is
divided into large and small
what is large large is defined as one
that can be reliably identified using
epidemiological so whenever you see a
large crowd so then that is epidemiology
so such categories large whenever you go
for our cities or for small crowd then
that is called a small I they hope you
are clear with large and small the
second one is whether they are
beneficial or not means whether their
benefit to the patient or not so if you
see the outcomes the patient can feel
the benefits and the patient has
increased the decreasing the pain or
increasing the functionality or the
patient is feeling happy such things are
called as beneficial and non beneficial
are they are not they are not like they
are not appreciated by the patient's
mind so such things are called as non
beneficial so basing upon this they are
divided into levels so level 1 2 3 & 4
so if it is large and it is beneficial
and it is clearly perceived by the
patient and it is level 1 if it is small
perceived by the patient level 2 if it
is not perceived by the patient but it
is large then it is 3 if it is small and
not perceived by the patient then it is
4 so if you see the the line that is
taken from the pulse sorry the line that
is taken from the carranza the treatment
of the clinical significant level 4 may
cause more harm than good then it is
tied for so the question is more harm
than good level 4 it's a very good
question so please do read it and work
on low dose and the next goes is the
agony test
okay now in this test they're
categorizing 70 out of 130 or 60 out of
one that they are talking about the
person dis whenever they're talking
about the person tis or whenever they're
talking about the proportion then you
need to think of this choice greatest
when how they talk about the numericals
then you can think about the paid and
unpaid t-test so a bit controversy but I
want you guys to stick to answer as a
for this a bit controversy but I want
you guys to stick to answer a okay so
because whenever there is decreasing in
the attachment okay and the sulcus depth
will be very shallow okay even
periodontal pocket can be right answer
but I want you guys to go for the
shallow circus and the next dose is is
about if you see this okay it's very
it's very your pulse question is
generalized question now the question is
geared clearly given about the slow
siren filtration okay slow sand
filtration it is for if it is faster and
filtration eight to six feet okay thank
you all done for now we'll be coming up
with some more videos
