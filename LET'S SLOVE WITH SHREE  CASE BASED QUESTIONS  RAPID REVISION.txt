hi vanessa hope you're doing good and
great uh
so let's solve few questions uh most of
them uh
which i'm going to discuss now were
posted as a doubt to me and few of them
are case-based questions
so question number one
during root canal instrumentation
the apex constructor is violated
and enlarged to a size of
50. so keyword here you have to make a
notice 50 size 50 so basically they
thought of
preparing up to 50 but they have
violated the principle so means here
they have given
information that mpa that is master
apical file
maf
is 50 but they have violated it
means
now the preparation is more than 50. so
just imagine the preparation is more
than 50 size 5 that is nothing but more
than 0.50
millimeters in diameter so you need to
select an option which is more than
0.5 millimeters so what the question is
which of the following is appropriate
treatment for this scanner
obturate with the gutta pacha and
surgically remove the
uh
extruded excess gut apache no that is
not required okay so they're simply
telling that go for a surgical
endodontic surgical endodontics is not
advised always go for a non-surgical
endodontics that is nothing but called
as a root canal therapy or even if
mishap happens it's better to go for a
re-root canal rather than going for a
surgical procedure so option a you can
eliminate it
coming to option b
uh fit a number 50 cone with a seller
and careful condensation now the
preparation is above 50. you cannot use
50 file because if you use 50 file
definitely there will be extrusion of
the
cone as well as the sealer into the
periapical area which is
not to be done next option c 50 co fit a
50 cone with a sailor but don't condense
uh as to keep the gatapatcha being
pushed in the apical foramen they're
telling like i'm just uh told you the
consequence of option b that they have
externality even if you condense it even
if you don't condense it when you're
using 50 cone
okay you need to seal with a 50 50
seller 50 cone should be used whenever
you're preparing because typical tuck
back is very very important that uh
three to five millimeters of apical tuck
back like whenever you
try to pull the master cone there will
be someone there is something like
inside holding it that back is very very
important whenever you don't maintain
the touch back there is no apical seal
and there is high chance that the root
canal therapy is going to fail so option
c is also not appropriate but if you see
option d
he's telling reinstrument one millimeter
short of apex to a size 60 or a larger
so they're telling to go for a larger
indirectly they're telling to go for a
larger size for example if you calculate
this considering as a uh
two percentage of ios okay so what is
going to be the calculation they're
telling one millimeter shot of apical
foramen okay so this is going to be
perfect option when compared to other
and the answer for this question is
t
okay so we'll go with the second
question the second question is on kovid
19 question regular more of a common
sense question a woman
whose sister has tested covet positive
came to the clinic with a negative
antigen report okay so rapid antigen
test is regularly done in the most of
the clinics okay because rt pcr will
take time like even if you
consider my clinic okay
so it will advise the patient either to
uh either to get the rtpc report okay uh
which was recent like maybe like two or
three days before or either we'll ask
the patient
to undergo rapid antigen test and if you
talk about the sensitivity and
specificity rapid antigen test is not
hundred percent is
right in all the scenarios okay so
keeping that in mind but with other
add-on features other add-on findings
from the patient the symptoms and signs
we can think whether the patient has to
go for rtbc or is it mandatory to go for
rtpc or not so keeping this in mind
comes your training with a negative
antigen rapid antigen report or
upon which you have done rapid antigen
test which was sound to be negative uh
and she was a symptomatic as of now what
to be done next check the option test
again with rapid antigen uh after seven
days no meaningless that is okay
meaningless to do the rapid antigen
frequently test again with the rtpcr
after seven days yes you can think of
you can think of testing with rtp here
after seven days test immediately with
rtbc no it is already done and the
patient is asymptomatic so there is no
pointless of being testing the patient
again again test again with rtpcr only
if the symptoms are developed okay so so
compared to option b option d stands
better okay so d is a
better option for this compared to that
of the
b because the patient now is having
symptoms previously the patient is a
symptomatic fine now he's having
symptoms so as you already done the
rapid antigen test now just go for rtpc
okay right so the answer is d for this
particular question jumping into the
question number three uh of course we
have discussed this question in a
different format before
uh i mean a few days back
on the group so just just we'll try to
read the key points in the question
because this question has to be finished
as fast as possible a 25 year old male
who has worked as a truck driver so most
of the truck driver based questions
definitely they will have a
sexual contact unprotected sexual
contact will be there presented with
presented to the clinic with a genital
ulcer which is painless uh do make a
note it's a painless ulcer 10 days back
and has an unprotected sexual appointed
with a commercial sex worker three weeks
back on examination the ulcer was found
to be injured
partially healed and punched out okay we
got the clue here the punched out ulcer
is syphilis also okay blindly you can go
for option c because ulcer in the
tuberculosis tuberculosis is not mostly
sexually transmitted but
uh ulcer the type of ulcer we see in
tuberculosis is
is undermined okay undermined you see
undermine
undermined ulcer you've seen
tuberculosis okay whereas you see
sloping type of ulcer you see in the
case of
healing ulcer
okay right so i mean like if you talk
about ulcers okay all these are ulcers
ulcer ulcer associated lesions and you
see inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged
diagnosed serum with vdr also there are
many clues here vdrl is a very beautiful
clue that you can conclude it as a
syphilis one
second thing you have a clue of punched
out syphilis okay you have a painless
ulcer syphilis right so there are many
clues who are concluding it as a
syphilis so it's a syphilis
and we have already discussed recently
the vdrl test
is
perfectly positive in the case of
secondary syphilis when compared to any
stage of syphilis okay any stage of
syphilis uh the sensitivity and
specificity of vdrl test is going to be
100 percentage in the case of
secondary secondary stage of syphilis
okay so jumping into the question number
next question
uh next question is again a case-based
lengthy question you can check it off
they have given a radiograph chest
radiograph was given and we will try to
solve it 50 year old patient present
with a low grade favor with evening rays
of temperature
okay so whenever you see like a
evening rays of temperature like
rays of temperature you can think of
malaria apart from the diagnosis you can
think of malaria okay right so then you
see a product of for two to three months
so when you see cough nowadays
you will definitely think of kovid 19
but it's a cough of two to three months
clovid 19 cough is an acute cough most
of the viral related signs and symptoms
are acute but most of the bacterial
things can be both acute as well as
chronic but here you you can remove that
option of viral infection because it's a
cough which is going two to three months
ahead okay
he approached a local clinic for advice
since he has started coughing blood
blood things are also there from the
cough from the past three to four days
with a history of loss of hepatitis
and weight loss loss of hepatitis weight
loss uh of 10 cages are most common in
the case of hiv okay age related aspects
okay but now the combination is of a
different thing for example you see upon
chest radiograph there is a nodular
infiltration on the apical part of right
lobe that clearly sees on the radiograph
and the patient is positive to
acid fast specialize so you have a
beautiful clue acid fast basilic so
among the options you have two acid fast
basilas one is leprosy and one is tb
okay so
option b and option d are simply
eliminated and then if you jump into the
other contents cough
weight loss
okay and come coming to that of the
radiographic features on the chest x-ray
so clearly concludes it is a tb not a
leprosy the answer is c for this
question when you're talking about acid
fast basil day sometimes the paper
setter may be
have more concern towards you and they
may give you an add-on things okay for
example they may give you 20
days of h2so4 is used in acid baseline
then your answer is simple which ever
closes tubercles is very specific using
20 days of sulfuric acid whereas when
i'm talking about
leprosy it is just five percent is five
percent is only sometimes i give a clue
twenty percent is or five percentages
whenever they give twenty percent is you
can blindly list equal to the option tb
or whenever they give five percent is
you can blindly stick on to the option
leprosy okay so leprosy they'll have a
different uh background history which is
nowhere related to the tuberculosis but
both are acid fast baseline okay so i
hope you are clear with this question
the answer is tuberculosis for this
particular question so jumping into the
next question so this is already
discussed when i'm taking the oral
surgery classes in a different format
but uh i do make a note okay so a 28
year old professional rugby player
who is playing second row forward
presented with an acute
articular
hematoma
he has been aspirated by the club doctor
but how however quick
re-accumulated means the recurrence is
there
on examination the hematoma affects the
central part of pinna and was
causing approximately 75 percent as
occlusion of external auditory meters
the patient main consent was potential
defect that could cause the hearing loss
as well as the cosmetics also okay now
uh cosmetics as well as the uh like
long-term effect as well as the uh look
effect look means the cosmetics like how
he appeared to look which of the
following complication may occur which
may affect his cosmetic appearance
uh around the crowd around the people
around it okay so
if we jump into this this is basically a
perfect case of boxers here but now here
uh
it was given as a rugby player okay so
rugby player also may have uh the
similar sort of punched over traumas
or over the face or over the ears okay
because of uh
i mean like because of this particular
type of
sport which is more of an a like a
violence violence related sport okay so
so this is basically called as
cauliflower like here okay so the ear
looks like the ear looks like a
cauliflower okay and it's also called as
boxers here
what happens here in this particular
question is
uh
i mean uh it's they have given its as a
rugby player okay so that is uh that is
like a
it would be so better if the question
was framed around the boxer around the
boxer because it's most often called as
in a boxer's ear or cauliflower here
okay so but the theology is almost the
same it is most often related to the
violence
associated sport okay the answer is c
for this particular question
and
i'm done for now okay so do like
subscribe and we'll be coming out
with few more rapid revision as well as
few more case-based questions sort of
videos
and i'll try to solve them from my point
of view solving
a case-based question particularly a new
case-based question the approach of
solving will be different for different
persons okay so most of them i'll i'll
try to solve from my point of view but
make sure you need to practice this and
this is the peak time that you need to
uh you need to like you need to
understand the keywords
uh
i mean there will be one or two keywords
in the question which are going to
simply conclude you to the right answer
and
guys to make a note this questions has
to be solved as fast as possible in the
examination hall because these are going
to eat over your time
stay positive god bless you love you all
and we'll be back with one more
video very very soon
bye take care signing off doctor sleep
from team mds phone
bye you
