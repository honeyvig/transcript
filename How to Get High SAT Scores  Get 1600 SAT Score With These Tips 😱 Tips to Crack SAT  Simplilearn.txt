facts about SAT exam well Stanley H
Kaplan started the first sat preparation
company in 1938. he started training
college students in his basement in
Brooklyn and charged 128 per student
secondly sat was initially designed as a
military IQ test before the use for its
College admissions now let's quickly
have a brief introduction about sat and
why it is so popular well most
universities like Princeton University
Harvard and other Ivy League members
consider stats scores for admission
according to the college boards more
than 2.2 million students in 175
countries and territories take the SAT
exam every year in the United States and
other countries all around the world the
SAT is a standardized test that is often

now moving on let's quickly go through
three different sections of sat along
with some amazing tips to help you Ace
each section the SAT exam has a total of
154 questions bifurcated into three
parts a reading section with 52
questions a writing section with 44
questions and a mathematical section
with 58 questions now let's go through
them one by one firstly we have the
reading section with 52 questions with 5
different passages which must be
completed in 65 minutes each passage
contains 10 questions related to one of
these areas like classic or modern works
of literature social social science
historical passage and two passages of
physical science for example social
science concentrates on sociological
economic and psychological factors and
the historical focus is mainly based on
the U.S founding record or the great
Global conversation not talking about
the tips here are some tips that can
boost your score in this section at
first in the list we have know what to
expect well you should be familiar with
the type of questions in these sections
before attending them for example you
might be asked to find word meanings
discover the passage's main idea
compared to passages
Etc next on the list we have choose your
order now the order of reading questions
are normally in chronological order
rather than in terms of difficulty and
be brave to completely ignore a
challenging question if you are unable
to answer them keep them for the last
now the third tip is read what you need
now basically you don't have to spend
time and try to become an expert by
reading every word in the passage let's
say for example you have to switch back
and forth of the passage focusing only
on the main theme of The Passage lastly
save main idea questions for last now
the first question of the passages will
typically be a general inquiry about the
purpose of the passage so it is not a
good idea to answer them first because
once you answer the majority of the
other questions you'll be in a good
position to assess the passages overall
meaning moving on the second section is
the writing section this section mainly
focuses on recognizing and collecting
the errors in the passages it includes
all multiple choice questions that
examine your vocabulary skills command
of evidence presentation ideas
Etc however the subjects of this written
passages can still be familiar to you
here you will have 44 multiple choice
questions allowing 35 minutes to answer
them well it's time to know the most
important tip to help you Aid the SAT
writing test first is to examine the
answer choices to see what is changing
which words will be best to link the two
ideas in this sentence now those ideas
should be used in your responses so in
order to determine how each option
affects the questions you must carefully
evaluate each option now the next tip is
learn from the answer choices now we
frequently write which is different from
how we speak right so use the answer
options to highlight any errors in the
sentence that you may not have noticed
now and the last tip for this section is
process of elimination now the process
of elimination can help you get closer
to the solution once you know the
question so when you eliminate just one
or two responses the right response
becomes more obvious the last section is
the mathematical section which has two
subsections with and without calculator
where you have 45 multiple choice and 13
Ingrid questions here you have a total
of 58 questions allowing you 80 minutes
to answer them now the questions here
focus on topics like algebra linear
equations systems advanced math world
problems quantitative literature and
many more well now let's look at two
important tips to remember while
answering the SAT Math section firstly
memorize the formula it would be best if
you are focused on some formulas like
the area of circumference of the basic
shapes like circles triangles cones
rectangles Etc so you have a valuable
time flipping back to them during the
test and second what kind of calculator
to use you can use the graphic
calculator suppose you don't have a
graphing calculator you can go for any
other calculator so if you are using a
graphic calculator remember that it
cannot have a QWERTY style keyboard like
the ti-95 version and finally we have
one final point of advice is to get
enough rest the night before the exam
stay calm and do not panic while giving
your exam be confident and give your
best and with this we have reached the
end of the session today we learned 10
