hurry up and enroll out you can find the
course Link in the PIN commment and
description box below so let's get
started so you could see this is the GPD
4 version and here you will get the
plugins option here is the GPT 4 and
here we have GPT 3.5 and if you want to
use the plugins you just have to click
here and then or let's just first
explore Char plugins so enhancement for
the AI model chat GPT that is open a
advanced language model has been
widespread application across various
fields from enhancing customer
interaction to streamlining content
generation while CH gpts core
capabilities are impressive its
functionalities can be significantly
expanded through the integration of
specialized plugins these plugins
designed exclusively for CH gbt serve to
broaden its utility by introducing new
features and functionalities enabling
users to fully exploit the AI models
potential so now we'll see how we can
install the chat gbt plugins so setting
up chat GPT plugin is straightforward
with the Plus account so you need to
have a Plus account for that that is you
need the gbd4 version and follow the
following steps that I will tell you
that is click on your account name at
the bottom right that would
be bottom right just click on the
account and then select settings and
beta and then go for the beta features
tab settings beta features and this is
the beta features tab you just need to
click on the plugin section that is a
tri version of chat JP that knows when
and how to use third party plugins that
you enable so you just need to enable
the plugins and after you have activated
the plugins and you could see the plugin
here so this is the drop down menu and
if you just scroll down you will see the
plugin store here so click on the plugin
store so this is the plugin store and
these are the popular plugins that are
available here you could see the new
ones or the old plugins and you could
see there have 129 pages and this page
includes around eight plugins so you
could see like how many plugins are
available so going back to popular you
could install any plugin as I clicked on
this AI
diagrams and it has been installed and
you could see here that we can only
enable three plugins at a time when you
will be writing the prompt so those
plugins those are enabled will be active
and you can use them for the prompts so
you could see AI diagram and scraper
these both plugins are enabled
currently and if you want to explore
like what plug-in does what do what so
you could see here that it creates an
edit whimsicle flowcharts mind maps and
sequence diagrams that is AI diagrams
and then we have ai PDF that is super
fast interactive chats with PDFs of any
size complete with page references for
fact checking so you could see
that and after installing the plugins
you could start working with them and
now we will discuss the role and
functionality of chat JD plugins so
plugins are essentially software
extensions that introduce additional
features to an exciting or the existing
software framework without altering its
original code in the context of chat GPT
these extensions are crafted to
complement the ai's functionalities
allowing for a more tailored and
expanded use by employing these plugins
developers and users can enhance chat
gp's interaction with external
applications databases and services
thereby customizing the AI to suit
specific needs or industry requirements
and we talk about the operational
dynamics of CH gbd plugins so the
operational framework of CH jpd plugin
is centered around the extension of the
AI models native features through the
Strategic use of application programming
interfaces that is apis these plugins
facilitate a seamless interaction
between CHP and various external
resources this integration not only
enhances the AI capabilities but also
allows for a more versatile application
across different sectors and moreover we
will also talk about advantages but
currently we will search for some
specific plugins and write some prompts
for that so in the plugin store we will
search for prompt
perfect so this is the prompt
perfect so you could see here that start
your prompt with perfect to craft the
perfect prompts every time so that is
first up we have prompt perfect that is
one of the best J JT extensions that
lets users write the perfect prompts for
the AI chatboard if you're part of the
few not able to do so perfect will
immensely help you write the prompts so
to begin we will install
it so guys here you could see that the
three of three are enabled but we will
disable these and we'll just have one
that is prom perfect enabled and here we
will write a prompt that is however make
sure to write the word perfect before
your prompt so that is we'll
write
perfect
uh write
a
story on
automobiles or we will write he prompt
perfect
so you could see that the CH is using
the prom perfect here so you could see
that it is writing the prompt that we
can just give it to chat gbt and it will
write a story on
automobiles oh sorry like we have asked
him to write a story on
automobiles so you could see that this
is done and you could see a notification
from the open a only that is jpts will
soon replace
plugins and you could learn more about
it that is a beta
feature and moving to next we will
install some other plugins also and
let's have the Wolf Ram that I have
installed so I will show you what
description it has so it access
computation math curated knowledge and
realtime data through Wolfram Alpha and
Wolfram language
okay now we'll use it w
frame so while while it can get a bit
technical for some users the Wolfram CH
plugin is one of the best due to its
Advanced abilities so powered by
Advanced Data wolf frame allows chat gbt
users to access advanced commutation
math and realtime data to solve all
types of queries so instead of sticking
to just basic math problems you can ask
wfrm for advanced help like creating a
genal iCal tree creating an audio
spectrogram illustrating anatomy and
much more it can even tell the date and
time in real time which isn't something
Chad jbt can do so go ahead and
experiment with WF frame and I will show
you guys
something so we'll create another one
and ask him
here so you could see that it has
started using the Wolfram extens
exension here or the plugin here and it
is saying that I am unable to directly
generate or export a spectrogram for a
phrase so it is here using the current
setup so it is unable
to like generate a spectrogram so it's
okay we will explore some other plugins
so we will explore the web pilot
then it's also one of the most popular
plugin out there so you could browse web
page PDF data chat and write like write
with one that would be many one URLs so
we'll explore this so you could browse
any web page so first we'll enable it
web pilot and close this and open
another window and now we'll search for
simply learn
articles
and now we'll ask this web
pilot hey web
pilot I will provide you a
link can you
summarize the article for
me so we will provide the link so you
would see that jbt is using the web
pilot plugin
here so you could see that it is like it
has started summarizing the article here
and this was the original
article and you could also ask him to
read any
PDF so these are done with these plugins
only and now moving on we'll explore
some other plugins or I will just take
you through them that is here coder pad
diagrams that create diagrams that is
schemes diagrams architecture
visualizations flowcharts M Maps you
could export and add it for free and you
could run code in more than 30 different
programming languages and let us worry
about setting up the environment so you
don't have to set up any environment
here as you know that chat jpt can only
run
python code but you are not able to set
up any environment to run any other
programming languages so you could use
the quod pad for that and there are many
popular plugins also like the Cana one
and there are many other two book tables
or
RJ that is used to generate images
without learning how to prompt so you
put utilize these plugins and create
what you want so if we talk about the
advantage of deploying chat gity plugins
so incorporating chg plugins into the AI
models unlocks a pleora of benefits and
these advantages range from the ability
to customize the AI for specific task
integrating with third party service for
enhanced functionality to offering
specialized features pertinent to
sectors such as Healthcare e-commerce
and finance furthermore plugins can
Empower CH GPT with capabilities like
language translation and complex data
analysis significantly broadening its
applicability and efficiency and we talk
about consideration and challenges so
with the integration of CH plugins
offers numerous benefits it's important
to consider the associated challenges
and limitations access to these enhanced
functionalities often comes at a cost
requiring a subscription Additionally
the development of these plugins by
third party providers introduces
potential risk related to data privacy
and security users must be vigilant
about the data they share and understood
how it's managed by plug-in providers to
mitigate risk associated with sensitive
information
exposure so as you guys see we have
covered how to install the plugins how
to use them how to enable them and how
to call them so with that guys we have
