if you are preparing to interview with
hcl you might be curious about what type
of questions you would be asked during
the process
we have compiled some of the most common
questions in this video
as well as an overview of what to expect
from your interview experience overall
and how to prepare for it
working at hcl is a dream for many
software engineers
hcl interview questions help as parents
get familiar with what they might
encounter in their interviews the hl
interview process is set to the root of
engineers with a self-started mentality
and a solid technical background the
company's ideal candidate is someone who
learns from their mistake quickly grasp
new things and comes up with an
innovative ideas prepare the most
anticipated hcl interview questions to
nail the most challenging rounds
hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simplyland this is anubhav and
in this video we will be learning about
hl interview questions but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
channel already make sure to hit the
subscribe button and press the bell icon
so you will never miss any update from
simplyland so without further ado
let's begin and see what's in it for you
first we will know about the company hcl
moving ahead we will discuss the
interview process for hcl and then we
will see some hcl interview questions
for freshers and experienced
professionals
hl technologies is a leading i.t service
and consulting company helping
enterprises shape their businesses for a
digital age
operating in 50 plus countries hl is
headquartered in noida india the company
provides innovation solution around
digital cloud infrastructure management
analytics iot cyber security automation
and engineering services securing its
place on the forbes global 2000 list
now
we will see the hcl interview process
hl seeks new talented candidates via a
selection process comprises of four
rounds
now
first round is a written aptitude
assessment test
the first round is online
it involves questions around
quantitative ability and verbal
reasoning in the form of mcqs usually
for freshers not for the experienced
individuals
the second round is group discussion
round
the recruiter accesses a candidate
personality traits such as problem
solving skill
team spirit ability to come up with
instant solutions conflict resolution
and more by forming teams and providing
a common topic of discussion the third
round is technical interview round
software engineer are asked question on
critical topics like java c c plus plus
unix linux data structure and algorithms
etc to judge their fundamentals and
advance knowledge
experienced individuals should be
prepared for questions about their past
experiences based on their resume
the last and final round would be hr
round a final round has a scenario based
behavioral questions
the recruiter evaluates a candidate
interest in joining the organization and
their personal goals and ambitions
then
we will now discuss some hcl technical
interview questions for freshers and
experience
the first question would be
what are the fourth pillar of
object-oriented programming system the
pillars of words are as follows
first one is inheritance based on object
or class upon another class or object is
inheritance
the second one is abstraction
selecting data from a pool to show only
the relevant details to the object is
known as abstraction
third one is encapsulation wrapping data
in a single unit is known as
encapsulation and the last one is
polymorphism allows using class exactly
like its parent to avoid confusion is
known as polyformism
now
we will see the next question
what are the different types of data in
c
the five major characteristics of data
types in c are as follows
first one is basic data type which are
floating point integer double and
character
second one is drive data type
union structure array pointers comes
under derived data type
third one is enumerated data types
we use enums for that and the fourth one
is white data type it is an empty value
data type and the last one is bool type
which is true or false
what is the role of pointers in c
pointers in c are used for following
purposes
to access array elements for dynamic
memory allocation and deal location
while the program is executed
call by reference
to construct several data structures
like tree graph linked list and so on
after that what are the major
differences between c and c plus plus
c plus plus supports inheritance and c
does not support inheritance
in c it focuses on a method or a purpose
rather than data
and in c plus plus it focuses on the
data instead of method or procedure
in c plus plus it can access modifiers
but in c structures lacks excess
modifiers
in c plus plus it supports expansion
handling but in c it does not support
expansion handling
c plus plus supports reference variables
but c does not
the output of a function in c plus plus
are c in and c out
and in c
it uses printf function and scanf
functions
moving ahead
state major differences between a
constant variable and global variable
constant variable it has a fixed value
that cannot be changed throughout the
program and in global variable it can be
changed and is accessible by all the
functions in a program
the next question can be
what is the input output in isc
i o stream is the standard input output
stream in c plus containing c in c out
and other methods
the input stream allows inputs from the
console user
and the output stream displays the
operation resulting the user or the
output devices
the next question would be what are the
postfix and prefix operators
the plus plus and the minus minus
operator are used as a pre and post
fixes
plus plus i first
increments the counter and then perform
the next action whereas
in i plus plus it performs the next
action then increments the value of i
let's see the next question
what is a pass by reference
pass by reference allow a function
to modify a variable without creating a
copy
one has to declare references variable
the past variable and a parameter share
the same memory allocation
and any changes to the parameter is also
reflected in the variable
now
what is the significance of the finalize
method in java
finalize method is called as the last
chance for an object to carry out the
clean up activity
before the garbage collector reclaims it
it involves releasing any fixed order
resources held
termination of any connection if open
and more
how would you achieve multiple
inheritance in java
implementing multiple inheritance in a
class is the only method to achieve
multiple inheritance in java the process
does not cause ambiguity as all methods
declared in interfaces are implemented
in the class
next question we will see is what is
cloud computing and how is it useful
today
cloud computing is the technology of
storing processing and managing data in
a shared network of route servers over
the internet
the data is distributed and hence more
secure
cloud computing offers flexible
resources innovation and economics of
scale
and if you want detailed answers for
them please check out our article on hcl
interview questions you will find 40
plus scientific questions that are
frequently asked in the hcl interview
process
now moving ahead
what are the different cloud computing
services model the first one is
infrastructure as a service
a computing infrastructure managed over
the internet are known as
lass
the second one is platform as a service
cloud computing platform for developing
testing running and managing
applications are all comes under
platform as a service
the third one is software as a service a
cloud services provides host
applications
the last and the final one is function
as a service a platform for developing
running and managing app functionalities
without the need for building and
maintaining ab launching infrastructure
moving ahead
we will see what do you understand about
constraints in sql
constraints are the rule or limit
applied on the different data types in a
given table to ensure its accuracy and
relatability
sql constraints are as follows
no null
informs no null value can be stored
within a column
the next one is unique
in forms all the values in the column
should be unique
primary key this question is always
asked in the interviews what are primary
key the primary key is the field that
uniquely identify each row in a table
the next point is foreign key the field
that uniquely identifies each row in
another table
check it help validate the column values
for attending a particular condition
default it gives a default value for a
column when the user does not specify
one
the next question is
what are aggregate functions in sql
an aggregate function relies on a set of
values to return a single value
following are some sql aggregate
functions
first one is avg functions which gives
the average of the set
next one is minimum function
it gives the minimum value in a set
after that its count function
it returns the number of item in a set
after that its max function which
returns the maximum value and in last
it's a sum function which returns the
sum of all the values in a set
the next question what we will see is
what do you mean by dbms
the database management system is a
software for managing the entire
organization's data
including its proper storage and
presentation whenever required for
business decisions for example mysql
oracle file maker and microsoft access
the next question what we will see is
what is in it in python
in python nh stands for initializing
this method creates processes from the
script stored in the configuration file
used by the initialization system it is
similar to constructors in java
the next question what we will say is
what is the difference between
interpreter compiler and assembler
compiler
it converts the whole high level
language program to machine learning at
a time
interpreter it converts high level
language program to machine learning
line by line
assembler
it converts assembly language program to
machine learning
now we will see what are sql joins
sql joins are useful for fetching data
from various tables as a single record
employing common columns and foreign key
the four major types of joins are
first
inner join it returns records with
matching values in both tables
second one is right outer join returns
all records from the right table and the
matched records from the left
left outer join
it returns all record from the left
table and match records from the right
full outer join
returns all record in case of a match in
either left and right table
