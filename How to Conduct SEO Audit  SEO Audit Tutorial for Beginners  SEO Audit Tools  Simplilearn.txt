and optimize for Target keywords driving
organic traffic without the need for

websites stay updated with algorithm
changes and provide insights into how to
outperform competitors now the most
important part I will let you know that
two AI tools to conduct a basic SEO
audit for complete beginners so let's
get into the video so the first SE audit
website I would be talking about today
is aiio SEO that is allinone SEO it is
very easy and beginner friendly what you
need to do is you have to paste your
website URL over here in the search box
and then you have to click on analiz so
let's get started I'm using today the
shopify's website to get you an SEO
ordered so I will just show
you
analyze it may take a few minutes as it
scanning and see it has provided with a
SEO free SEO report over here so it will
first start with the overall site score
that is how your website is doing
overall it is 82 by 100 is like good
obviously it's excellent it has
commented also and a very good score is
between 60 to 80 for best results you
should strike for 70 and above so 82 it
is already good it has now further
broken down in the uh audit into five
critical issues zero recommendations and
good results uh the best part is it also
shows you the good results and even the
critical issues so basically it has
divided the Deport into 1 2 3 four types
like the basic SEO properties Advanced
SEO performance and security so first
get into the first basic SEO so it is
good it is good like the uh correct
symbols are for those that are working
well on your website and the cross red
mark is basically you need to fix this
issue so some images on the page have no
alt attribute so like there are 51 links
you can see you can even see the URLs
over here and this is working good
moving on to the next Advanced SEO the
page is using the uh canonical link tag
uh all this is fine you don't have to
fix over uh like the advanced Su part
performance the server is not using
expires headers for the images and you
can click over here and see basically
what is the problem the page makes 43
requests more than 20 requests uh can
result in slow page loading like uh the
performance would be less because it
makes 43 requests more than 20 requests
can actually hamper the page loading so
it is necessary you need to focus on
this and the the size of the HTML
document is 73 KB you need to also Focus
over here so this is over a
recommendation of 50k so they will
provide you the recommendations too and
basically this is nice I would say
moving on to the security part
everything looks nice uh directly
listing Sims to be disbled on the server
that is nice and see it is uh very
beginner friendly and the best part is
you can even download the report from
here like click on download and get the
uh like hold report into your own device
and you can see and make the free
changes so it is very uh beginner
friendly and I would suggest that use it
and have a uh for all the beginners I
would say use it and it would like help
you to get a free SEO report the next
website I would be talking about is
drank math.com it is also an SE analyzer
and this is nothing different you will
just need to paste your website URL over
here and then click on analyze and after
that you will get the free report your
free SEO audit report is ready so it is
getting giving you the overall website s
it is 82 it is nice we have seen it and
there are zero warnings and three fail
tests so let's see move on uh common
keywords SEO description so it has given
a right symbol that the meta description
was found and it is 145 characters long
so it is has no problem you don't have
to fix anything and yeah coming to the
image alt attributes as we have seen in
the previous um website uh SEO audit
that some images on your homepage have
no alt attributes so yeah you will need
to see this and uh the best part over
here is you know you will be getting
some recommendations on how to fix it so
if you click on it basically it will
give you some suggestions that check
your images for missing all tags and add
useful descriptions to each image add
your keywords or synonyms but do it in a
natural way so you basically need to
check your images that you are giving it
um the all tags and use and using the
descriptions for each image that what
that image is about and you have to uh
give the um keywords or synonyms of that
uh to make it a better one so uh this
this all looks good links ratio SEO
title coming to the next Advanced SEO
search preview is good nothing is
nothing no problem is there and
scrolling down you will see that it all
uh works good performance is also good
but yeah we can see one uh cross symbol
your homepage makes 42 requests more
than 20 requests can result in a slow
page loading we have found this in the
previous audit also so like it will give
you how to fix try to replace embedded
objects with HTML 5 Alternatives this
HTML uh new version has some
Alternatives and you need to replace the
embedded objects of that page size the
size of the HTML document is 71 KB over
the average of 33 KB and our
recommendation is of 50 KB you need to
uh like uh their recommendation is
they're recommending you need to do it
on 50 KB and you are having 71 KB then
let's see how to fix it uh first remove
any unnecessary tags from your markup
okay from that HTML you need to uh like
U remove the unnecessary tags this
includes developer commands which are
invisible to your users search engines
and uh ignore the text in comments too
sometimes inline CSS is a culprit okay A
little inline CSS can help your page uh
render faster too much will blow the
HTML obviously they they prefer outline
uh CSS and inline CSS is not preferred
you can reduce a CSS reputation with
HTML class and ID attributes uh that is
fine everything you need to change on
the HTML say is that coding part and
everything else looks fine you can even
share an email and print this SEO audit
and I will say there this is 3 million
plus happy users so it is basically a
very good website for a free uh SEO
audit and it's very beginner friendly
and I will recommend to use this so both
the free AI tool will help you get a
free SEO audit and make sure you fix
your website issues and make your
website rank higher so with this we have
