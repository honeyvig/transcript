with the increase in the networking
devices either for professional or
personal use the need to access the
internet to perform various activities
has increased
and in this process having an ip address
assigned and then being routed to the
network model and is applied using the
classless
intel domain routing
c idea hi guys and welcome to yet and
then the trusting video by simply learn
but before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from us
now without further ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
cidr
that is classless interdomain routing
moving on we will look at some of the
rules to perform the cidr addressing
continuing with the working of the sea
idea
and at the end we will look into some
examples
to better clarify all the doubts we have
learned so far now let's take a look at
the first heading that is what is cidr
the cidr or classless interdomain
routing is a network concept designed to
oversee the assignment of ip addresses
to a system to replace the outed way of
classful addressing system
furthermore using the cidr method there
is low wastage of ip addresses and it
also is helpful in maintaining the
routing table
and it performs the task of submitting
which saves a lot of ip addresses now
let's move on to the next heading that
is
rules of using cidr
to better understand the working of cidr
addressing in the later part
please take a look at the rules very
seriously
let's take a look at the first rule that
is
the ip addresses assigned
are according to the c idr
are to be continuous
as the isp will provide them in a
sequence to minimize the address wastage
for example
if we have an ip address 200.10.18.32
then the addressing will take place as
200.10.18.33
and moving on to
the nth position as mentioned in the
example this proves that they are
continuous in assigning of ip addresses
let's move on to the next rule that is
the number of addresses in a cidr block
is to be power of 2 that is
in case the number of addresses is odd
then its invalid value
for example
2 to the power 4 is equal to 16 where 4
represents the number of forced
whereas if the value is 17 then it's an
invalid value as for the last rule we
have
use of cidr block for notation purpose
that is for example if we have
200.11.19
28 as an ip address
then
the block id of this ip address is 28
and the host id is 4 which is calculated
using 32 minus 28. because in an ipv4
address 32-bit is the maximum limit
now let's move on to the next heading
that is working of cidr
the cider addressing applies the
variable length subnetting masking that
is vslm for short as the basis of its
working method
that is used to break the conventional
ip addresses into smaller sub networks
of varying sizes according to the user
requirement let's take a look at an
example to understand the working
process
in the given example the ip addresses
195.10.20.40
slash 16. now let's solve the question
to begin with from the giving ip address
we can determine the network prefix that
would be 195.10.20.40
whereas the suffix represent the slash
16 part
the number 16 in an ip address represent
the number of ones in the address that
is known as the block id or the network
id
and the host id is determined using
32-16 because 32 is the maximum limit of
bit length in an ipv4 address
so the host id is 16.
and the total number of force that are
available in the network is calculated
using 2 to the power number of host that
would be 2 to the power 16 for this case
so the value is 65 536
available host in this given network id
now let's move on to the examples to
better understand the working
the first example is
the given ip address 192.168.200.10
slash 28 and we have to find the
relevant information
let's begin for the first step
convert the ip address in a binary
decimal format that is
for this ip address it would be
the given binary format
now let's find out the network mask for
this ip address that would be
28
ones
and four zeros
the point to be noted is
according to the slash number
we point the number of ones for network
mask
for example in this question we have
slash 28 so the network mask has 28 ones
beginning from left to right
and the last four digit would be zero
and in numerical form the value comes
out to be
255.25
and this is the network mask for our ip
address
now let's move on to the next
information that is network id
the network id for the given ip address
is calculated using
this way
by the given subnet mask that is slash
28
we assume
that
192.168.2
does not change
because it is a part of network id
and the point to be noted is the network
id is never to be
tampered with
only the host id can be used to change
the value
that means we will open the dot 10 part
in binary format that would come out to
be 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
then
change once to zeros
and perform
the and operation after performing the
and operation for the last four digit
that is the host id part we will get
192.168.200.0
28 that represents the network id for
the given ip address
similarly we can find the number of
first that would be easy that is
32 minus 28 that is 4
and the total number of hosts would be 2
to the power 4
that is 16
and the first host id in this given ip
address would be
192.168.200.1
with the completion of this example we
have completed all the relevant parts
regarding cidr working
