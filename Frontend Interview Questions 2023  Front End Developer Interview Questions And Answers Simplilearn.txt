hello everyone and welcome you all
so today we have a very interesting
topic coming up and that's called our
fronted interview questions
as we know it very well
in today's scenario especially for the
front end
we have multiple topics aligned
and interviewers ask and expect lot many
common questions to be answered
by the participants
so we have brought some very common
questions which are usually asked in
interviews
in web development front as we know it
very well in our web development we have
a multiple technologies are involved
especially when it comes to
html
css
javascript angular and many more so we
have brought some really very nice
questions along with the answers to help
you to clear those interview questions
so let's get started
so
here
what is there inside for you so we have
one very common topic for the version
control system that is called a git
second we have a called html5
third it's all about css3 then we talk
about javascript
then we have a react.js
followed by angular
and generic interview questions
these
six
very important topics
are used
in web development
so
people expect that you are aware about
some very common questions which they
usually ask so let's get started
so we are going to talk about version
control system first what do you
understand with version control system
so as we know it very well today when we
talk about call
a kind of team which work in different
environment different computers so they
want to store
their work in a centralized repository
system
okay so that they can keep track of what
they have done so that they can
understand who have made the updates and
when to roll back
in case if some problem comes up
so you would like to push
all the necessary repositories to the
centralized system that is conversion
control system so it is telling you
it is a system that keeps track all the
necessary changes
made to a file or a set of data
okay so it ensures that everyone work on
a most recent system
okay
while taking care about
your
necessary updates
next what is the difference between a
centralized and distributed version
control system
so as we know it very well
when we talk about call a centralized
system
okay so in central system what happens
like here it uses the centralized server
to store all different versions of files
usually we always commit those changes
to our local system but in centralized
system it helps to protect in case of
any failure happens in your local
environment so it can easily protect
okay so developer doesn't need to save
any file local to their system
okay so the main idea is to basically
avoid
single point failover and keep
everything under the single location
now when it comes to the second option
called distributed version control
system so what they're trying to say
that every developer has a copy of all
the versions
while developing a code so it actually
improves the ability to work offline
and does not rely on the single
locations for the backup
okay so there is no even threat for
server crashes
that's the benefit of centralized
version system
now my next question is like just
explain me the get push and get pulled
how they're different
and how they are differentiated from
each other
so we know it very well when we talk
about like a git push so push is trying
to commit
okay some changes whichever are made
into the local file system to the
centralized repository
okay so whichever cloud environment you
will be using it it could be either
github or else you talk about bitbucket
or if you talk about gitlab
so you would like to push
all those necessary changes to that
location
and pull on the other hand is
responsible to pull to retrieve all
those version controlling to your local
environment
clear that's the benefit and that's the
difference which comes
okay
now
going ahead
and talk about
the git pull as i said that you try to
fetch
the real data from your local repository
okay towards your local repository
whichever is there available in your
cloud environment
so we say the git pull is a combinations
of two command
git fetch followed by the get merge
okay so now
next question
give us a few git commands and their
functions
okay so there are few commands which are
there the first command is like in gate
config
so in git config you basically configure
your username and email address that is
really helpful whenever you would like
to push
the repositories in your cloud
environment
get in is to
initialize a git repository hit add is
to basically add
the files to the staging
areas get diff to view the changes made
to this particular file and we have
called git commit
okay commit means water changes
to the head but not to the reporter or
to the remote repositories
now the other commands are also
available i can get reset which is
designed to undo all the changes
whichever we have made to the git
repository
we also have a git status to know about
the current state of the working
directory and staging area
we talk about like and get merge
okay so that means that you want to
merge a branch
okay
into a active branch
so get push so this is the command
through which you will be upload the
content from the local repository to the
remote repository gitpull is to
basically fetch and download the content
from the remote repositories
now next thing
the difference between git pull and the
gate fetch so when we talk about like in
git fetch so git fetch is only downloads
new data from the report remote
repository okay so it does not integrate
any of its new data into your working
files
okay so get command or get fetch can be
done at any point of time to update the
remote tracking branches
clear that is a gate fetch on the other
side when we talk about called gate pull
so git pull updates the current head
branch with the latest changes from the
remote servers
okay so the git pull downloads the new
data and integrates with the current
working directory files so it actually
tries to
merge the remote changes with your local
ones
so that's the difference between get
get fetch and the get pull
but the next question comes here is what
is the merge conflict in git and how it
can be resolved see the merge conflict
is very very common when you have the
common data is available
between the branches and at that point
of time
which one to take which one to avoid so
in such kind of scenario the conflict
automatically comes in
clear now so you actually does what you
go back and manually edit the file and
decide which particular portion you
would like to keep and which of the
portion you would like to discard
so that how the git merge merged
conflict you try to utilize it
now when we talk about the git merge
conflict how it can be resolved so we
have a call pull request which is
available under the repository name when
you click it there
so in pull request actually you click to
pull the request with a merge conflict
which you would like to resolve so it
need so in the near bottom of your pull
request the click resolve actually
conflicts so you decide which one to
keep which one to basically
avoid so that something which really
make your life even more simple
to avoid the conflict or in case in
confliction comes how to basically fix
that up
okay so you can see now
this kind of
messages like in greater than less than
and hyphen equal to sign this would be
shown
at a time of resolve
okay so you basically decide which one
you want to take it so if you have more
than one merge conflict in your file you
just scroll down to the next set of
conflict markers and repeat the steps
okay for four
point five resolve the merge conflict
will be taken care and once it is
resolved it will click as a result which
will be ready to get
update to your existing branch
that's how exactly the merge conflict is
really
made up
now so once you have resolved all the
merge you can see the green color signal
that says like okay there is no
confliction available or no more
conflict in your program so you can
simply
merge the entire base branch into the
head branch okay so to merge your pull
request you click merge pull request
okay
so get much conflict it arises when you
have a multiple branches when they are
trying to merge with each other so there
are some common set of data or files
which will be available in both the side
so at that point of time it needs to be
avoid confliction so that's how it
really works
so
how you can resolve it so you can also
resolve the merge conflict using command
line so you simply open a git bash
and never go
to this particular repository where the
merge conflict is actually occurred
and then
it generates the list of files which are
actually affected by the conflict so in
this particular example you can see
there is a one style guide dot md file
which has a god merge conflict
so you basically shoot up some command
okay so you open it in any editor like
in vs code editor atom so you go to that
location open this particular file
and manipulate and decide which one you
really want
and likewise you'll be in position
to resolve all the conflict and
discard all those changes whichever
you're not interested in
okay so that's how the merge conflict is
already taken care of
okay so what you're doing it right now
you are adding
your files to the stages by saying git
add dot
and after that you're committing it by
using this commit so now you can merge
all the branches with using push so
those changes
okay to your remote repository on your
github and merge your command in a pull
request
okay so that was the quick idea about
how you can try to resolve the issue of
get
conflict
okay so the next question comes here
that is called what is git stash
so what is a git stash so imagine we are
a developer and he's working with the
current branch and wants to switch the
branch
okay to the another branch
okay to work on something else
just imagine and after that what happens
but you don't want to commit changes to
your unfinished work
because the changes are not yet decided
so you really don't want to commit those
changes to your unfinished work okay so
the solution is called what is git stash
okay so it basically try to takes your
modified tracked files
and saves it on your stack
of unfinished changes that means these
are not committed properly so that you
can reapply at any point of time that is
called git stash
so what is the difference between get
merge and get rebase these are very
common question see suppose it says you
are working on a new feature of your
project and in a dedicated branch and
another team members updates the master
branch with some new commits
okay
and
what is happening now so to incorporate
the new commits into your feature branch
like you have already initiated one job
and your team members have already
initiated the job in a parallel
branch and you feel okay you want to
merge both the features together
okay so what you will do so you're going
to create a extra merge commit every
time you need to incorporate changes so
to pollute your feature branch histories
so here what is happening now is an
alternative to merging
see as an alternate native to merging
you can rebase the feature branch into
the master
so it incorporates or whatever the
changes you want to incorporate all the
new commits in a master branch number
one and it rewrites the project history
by creating the brand new commits
for each commit in the original branch
that's the difference
between
a gate merge and the get rebase
so
git is as you know it very well it is
designed for the centralized repository
system
and
from the remote repository or from the
local repository you can basically try
to update
or retrieve
whatever number of records you want
okay so to make it possible
about the get we have some
i would say commands available like
i talk about like in push we talk about
like in pull
so what is the difference see when you
talk about like and push you sense the
commit and ask them to update their
branch
this actually requires that things to be
right on their end
are we clear and the pull command on the
other hand it is nothing but a call
retry which is called a kind of fetch
which gets the commit and has
your git update to your report or remote
tracking
and get you there all latest updates
i'll be clear now so
let's go ahead and talk about how we
gonna be implementing this
okay so first of all i will be going and
creating a new empty repository by
saying get space
in it
so you can see it is initializing the
empty git repository inside this
and now i would like to create the new
file and keep it inside
okay so if i have
this file with me
okay
i'll put it under this or any file
whichever i want suppose if i have this
call
just
okay and i put it under my get demo
okay it is there under my git demo now
now what i can do
i can just use this statement like
get
space
status i can see by one file and i'm
saying git space add space start
and once again i'm saying git status all
files are now tracked
and now i talk about
git space commit space hyphen m
are we clear now all changed and now i
would like to push this
to my
remain repository so i have this command
with me called
you know git branch hyphen main as you
can see now
so
just see the commands here which we have
it because i have a repository available
in my remote locations i can say
get space branch
okay space hyphen
m space main that means i want to
put it in our main branch
okay
so now it is done and i'll be talking
about git remote where i want to add it
so this is the remote location
so
i need to make this remote location
available
paste it
okay and i can say git space push
okay hyphen u
space
main
now you can see it is uploading and it's
saying writing object and the records
has been successfully
taken
okay
so this is how you're able to
get all those into your application now
you can see
we have this react case study.docx is
now available to us
now we have an option called pull
request
are we clear so what it is saying now
we're going to pull this request
okay so i can just a new pull request
okay so it is telling you
compare and changes the branches across
you want
okay so let me go back and change
first of all i go back to my
code which is
get the em
and here
whichever the name i have it
i just use
the file which i have it now
i say
git space
pull
okay
and now you can see
it is taking it up
okay now you can see the word is being
taken and that's what the poll is so
pull actually calls the gate fetch which
gets
a commits and has your get updates
your remote tracking name and then runs
the second command to update your branch
so the second command can combine the
parallel development so this is how the
difference between
push and the pull
everyone so now we're going to talk
about some of the very very common and
useful commands
provided by the gate and their practical
usage
okay
now the first command which we always
use it with the kit
okay that is called git config
we talk about like git
config so this config is basically
provide
the configuration because if you want to
push
or pull the repository so it should know
about on which username and watch email
so we talk about the set the author name
and email address
okay
with your commits it is very very
essential
okay so
whenever you try to perform a commit it
basically keep all the names and email
associated so we say git config hyphen
global
and you provide user name
and then you provide the user name and
in a similar way you provide the email i
just copy
and here you provide what user dot
and now in space you can give the
username and here you provide what email
second command which we know it very
well that is called git space what init
that is for initializing the repository
as you have already seen
next we talk about like a git space
clone
okay which is responsible to obtain the
repository repository from the existing
url the one which you have already taken
it up
then you have recently seen the command
in my previous example that is called
git space add
okay space file name
okay
or you can use asterisk astrix means add
all the files and file name will be the
specific file you want to talk about
you've already seen one command name
called what git space
commit
which is to commit the records
into your repository we have also seen
git space what
status to know about the current status
of my repository or my
you know the statement like
in which particular position it is it is
untracked it is dragged it is committed
so those status i want to know that
clear now so
you talk about another command that is
known as call git space reset
what this command does so this git reset
is basically unstate the file
okay and stage means earlier your file
was staged now it is unstaged but
prevents
okay or the preserve the file contains
it doesn't delete those contents but
reset means what it does reset unstaged
when you say talk about add it staged
when you say
reset it unstaged but it basically
keep all the necessary data within that
are we clear now see these are some
necessary commands are there
comes along with your get point
hello everyone so now we're going to
talk about our next very interesting
area of the gate that is called
what is the merge conflict and how to
basically resolve that
okay see in every situation where the
work can be paralyzed
in every situation
where the work can be paralyzed will
work will eventually overlap
sometimes two developers will change the
same line of code in two different ways
in such cases git can't tell which
version is correct that time you have to
decide
okay so to work with the merge conflict
okay so git gives you the clue like say
like i have got two updates which one
you want to keep it so that you would
like to make it now so to make this
possible we will be using the system
now to make it possible i would like to
create one simple example of
avoiding the gate merge or sorry the git
conflict so first of all i will say
that is hyphen l nothing is there so we
are saying get space
in it it will be initializing the
repository ls iphone l it would not be
showing any
you know the
hidden repository which is created but
certainly in my vs code editor i can see
it is created for me that's perfectly
fine
let me go back and create the new file
here
okay and
i just create using
echo
this is new redmi file
okay
and the file name will be what
dot md
okay you can see this new file has been
created now
okay so what i'll be doing now
i can go back and change
some
content inside this
okay so
first of all let me check
cad space
redmi dot md i can see this is a new
file with me now i can say get space
add space
redmi dot md
okay
and after that i can say
get space
space hyphen m
i can say redmi
add it
okay
we can see now one file changed and then
all all done
so we just talk about git space
status it says on branch master it is
the
okay so
that's it it is there now let's go back
and create a new branch now so to create
a new branch what i'll be saying i'll be
saying git space
checkout i'm going to create a new
branch space hyphen b
okay and i'm going to give the name
called
okay plans to create
conflict
okay so we're saying git space checkout
okay space hyphen b and we're just
giving that name here
okay so we're just saying
so let's check about
what is there
okay so we've created
status
conflict
and the branch will be created and it'll
be shifting out there
so you see like we're saying switch to
the new branch branch to conflict
and if i want to check
by saying get space
branch so i can say my current position
is branch to conflict
okay and below this we have this
statement to me
now what i can say i can create
uh the changes inside my readme dot file
okay so
what we can do now here
in this readme.md file i can go back and
change
by saying
on the
branch
okay this is an edit on the branch
and
what we can do now
we can once again just check
get space
get space status
we can see the file has been modified
now
and i can just use git space commit
okay space hyphen m
space we can give a value call
on branch
okay
now you can see
this is telling you
the change
okay
so
we are saying one file change to
modifications
modified but yes we haven't
add those to make those changes so we
just need to secure space
add space
okay and then
commit it and now you can see one file
change to insertions
not is working because i did not add
those
and once it is done then it will be
switching back
to our master branch so
right now readme.md have those changes
i'll go back to my master branch we say
get
checkout
master
now you can see if i say get checkout
master it is having the older data which
is available to us
okay and now i can just make the changes
once again here i can say this
is
master
okay now i can call get space
status and i can call
git space add space
readme.md
and we can just say
get space
commit space hyphen
m
updated again in master
okay
and
you can see it's done but now when you
talk about like in merging
that the challenge will come
now if i just talk about git space
branch
so it is in master branch right now so
if i want to merge
the
master branch with this branch so what
i'll be doing now
i will just use this option like in what
git space
merge
okay and we have a call
branch
okay underscore two
underscore
conflict
you can see now conflict came up are we
clear now it is saying auto merging it's
a conflict content
and you can see immediate it is telling
you they say accept correct changes this
is the master and this is an edit
i'll be clear so at this point of time
you have to decide
which one you want to keep and which one
you want to avoid so if you want to keep
the which one
that
on edit which is done in a child branch
what you can do
you can basically keep those
okay and let those changes will be done
by your application
okay so now when i say
you can say
okay and that's it so this is how
exactly the merge conflict is taking
place
okay everyone so now you can tell which
of the file you want to make
so that's how the final file which is
available to you and that's the beauty
of what
the conflict changes i hope you're all
clear
okay so the get interview questions are
over now we are heading towards
html interview questions
now here are a few questions like what
is an attribute in html so you can
consider the attribute are the
properties that can be added into the
html tag and that changes the way the
tag behaves or it is displayed
okay so you can see here you have a call
button
okay so attributes are added right after
the name of the html tag so button is an
element for me it's not an attribute
okay
so what is the marquee in html file so
mark is something which keep on rotating
okay they
say for scrolling down the text page or
the text on the web page mark is used
sometimes you might have seen when you
want to display some very important
information
okay which needs to scroll at the bottom
or else the right after a specific
period of time you always use marquee it
is one of the very very old
element available under the html page so
it scrolls the image
top left right center automatically
everywhere so you always use marquee
tags for rotating it
so the next is what is the semantic and
html see semantics are htmls are nothing
but a call another coding style
okay so
when we talk about a semantics so they
are basically reinforcing the meaning of
the contents like typically you have
seen we are using div and span tag but a
given span tag really don't make sense
to us as an edge table reviewer
unless i go inside those and get to know
about what they're really doing it so
semantics are nothing
but
these are the standard tags
i'll be clear so you can see like here
like bold tag is not useful for the bold
statement
as well as the italic tag is useful for
what for the italic tag so instead of we
are using
strong and em tags
are we clear now so this makes more
sense to us
now the next thing is how do you display
a table in an html web page so obviously
we have a got table tag
and under the table tag i can
align the complete layout of my web page
because of table head table body table
row table columns there are multiple
different type of elements which are
available
okay which are the part of table it's
just to basically align the content in a
proper format
what is svg
okay so svg is basically known as a kind
of a graphic which is written in a
typical xml language the svgs are the
high quality graphics which doesn't tear
off when you basically grow
and increase
or zoom so normally what happens gif
image
you talk about
jpeg images
after beyond certain point that pixel
get deteriorated but here in svg it
never happens so you go to any level
when you want to zoom and you're gonna
get accurate contents at any point of
time
okay so these vector graphics
are really typically 2d base diagrams
and give you the x and y coordinates in
a regular systems
next how do you separate a section of
text in html to
separate the sections of text in html we
always use what either br
or else we use block code or else we use
what a paragraph type
so br means anyways it separate out a
text
and break the current line
paragraph is used to again write a
paragraph of text and the block codes is
used to define the large quotations
okay
next is how do you create the nested web
page in html
so obviously we have a different type of
options that are available like an
iframe
okay you need to say page within a web
page
okay so we can create a page within a
web page with using iframe this is a
very very common questions we used to
receive at the time of interview
okay the difference between ordered list
and unordered list
so ordered list will give you the
different
ways to display the data
in roman format in numeric digits or
else you can talk about like an
alphabetical order but the unordered
list is completely unordered you don't
get any options like an order list
okay so the ordered list start with
ol and
unordered list starts with
ul
in our html demos i'm gonna start with
very first file that is known as called
table demo
like how we can offer you
the table
related tags inside the html so table as
we know it very well it is designed to
organize
your contents or give you the proper
layout
so it is a very old technique we are
using
to align
or to pro define a proper layout
so this html page
will start working with the very first
tag that is called table
within this table we will be using tr
that is called table row under this
table row we will be using th call table
heading
and inside this table heading we are
going gonna give call
name
like this i copy
and here we say
uh employee name i say
city
or i can say name city
and we can say
department
three parameters i have it now so called
three different headings
and these headings are getting closed
and we're going to start working with
another table row
and here we'll be providing the data
so again another tr again we'll be
having this td in this 3d we can say
admin this will be the first
attribute we're going to use it's called
admin
followed by another properties
we say
admin
mail.com
department i can say hr
or
we'll try to copy this again
and have
few more rows
i can say
now i can say admin i can say atul
here we say
okay so
here we can say
finance
so this
is going to give me
the data so called what table data so
we're giving td
so here let me see how the outcome will
be
so
in finder
there we go now you can see it's going
to give me
the proper look and feel for how
the table really looks like in
so that's a quick example of table but
yes if you want to organize a table
little bit more better very clear so
this you can apply some of the styles on
the top of that like as you can see here
we have a call table
so we can just use
inline style that is called style equal
to
float
colon light
if i do so
i will see some difference you can see
it is on right hand side by default it
will be on left or
there's no center
no nothing it'll be either left
float left
okay so like this you are going to offer
the table so this is a very simple
example of like how the table can be
created within your html
next after this table
we gonna go ahead
uh with some new ideas well if in case
if you want to make this table even more
attractive we have some options with us
by offering some styles this example
will be seeing it in our upcoming demos
in a css
so that is the table demo which we have
recently seen
going ahead we'll be talking about like
and how we can offer you the svg scalar
vector graphics that is there a feature
under added under the html 5.0
so how you'll be adding it let's take a
look
let me add a new file called svg
demo
dot html
here let me add a template
and here onwards
we'll be adding this svg so svg itself
is a tag
okay so we're using this svg here
and this svg we have to provide
some
standard
width and height so we say
width equal to
100 and we just say height
equal to
100 that we are providing with the svg
here if i try to see the outcome
because it would not show right now but
certainly we can add it and see what we
can apply over here so we have a called
svg
let me add the first property called
circle
okay
so
in this circle
we'll be offering
the
x and y coordinates so we can say cx
equal to
i can say 50
x
okay and
we also use cy
equal to
once again
50
and uh followed by our radius equal to
the way you want
so within this i'll be offering the
stroke the surrounding part but let's
see
you can see it automatically came the
best part is like if you
expand or zoom at whatever level it
won't go down and that's the beauty
okay and here we can attach
the
some color strokes whichever you want to
give it here that we can give it so
here
we say stroke
okay
and
this is a circle
so
we would like to offer
the other properties so this will be the
stroke for me
so
rather than writing this separate
i can better attach it here
stroke equal to you can just say
black and we can use this option
like any stroke width
stroke hyphen
width equal to you can give three
and followed by you can use fill
color which you would like to make it so
i can just say pink
like this
okay that's it let's check
awesome this looks beautiful
that is one of the basic example of like
how you can use this svg
okay so now we're going to talk about
our next feature in a same continuation
to the html i'm going to talk about
something called how you will be
separating it out the sections
of html page see html page comes with
loads and loads of data now how you'll
be separating it out now how you'll be
arranging it properly to tell like okay
this particular section contains this
related data so in html5 we have one
beautiful feature comes that is known as
called semantics it is a feature of
html5 that not only helps
the
google that is which we talk about
called search engine optimization that's
called seo but also
to
make the developers life even more
easier to
understand the contents what is their
belief so
let's go ahead and talk about our next
feature called how you're gonna be
separating it out so this one's called
semantics so we're gonna talk about call
okay semantics.html
here we will start working with the same
html
tags with us so here we will start
working with the data so we always have
some predefined tags called
we will call header
okay i can say this is
header
and after this we have a call
footer you can say this is
photo so this is how you can see more
meaningful we talk about like a nav
you see like it is a nav we can say this
is menu
nav
okay along with this navigation we can
also offer call section
okay so under the sections you can have
an articles
okay so
we can say
uh
under the sections let's talk about call
article so article we can say this is
article
1
okay and
we can say this is article 2
and we can create n number of sections
in my code
okay and
after that we can have
summary
okay
which can defines the
for details elements so like there are
lot many available are
lot many are available
so if you can just take a look through
the semantics you really won't find any
difference but yes
it is a separators
okay so used heavily inside html based
applications so that's how you are
defining the separators into your code
so
it looks more even
uh easy to understand what is there
under
so that's how we define this
layouts
well
coming to the next area of our html
we're going to talk about something
called how you're going to be defining
okay a nested html page
so nested html page we have a feature
that means page under page
so
that's
called
iframe iframe is a feature
okay that helps the user
to define
the page under the page and how do we
use that let's take a look so under the
body section
okay i will be offering
iframe
okay so i can just use h3
i say
iframe demo
and within this i'll be using
iframe tag you can say iframe src
equal to i can just give
the name of simply learn so you can just
go ahead
sorry spelling wrong so you can just see
the simplylearn.com that is the website
so i can just copy this
okay and uh offer this iframe src equal
to
https simplylearn.com
okay and
that's it so we have a call frame border
i really do not want to frame border if
you want you can just add the initial
value
clear and you can talk about call style
in a same level
okay so
you can just say
style in style you can also offer some
other type of details too
okay let's see how we use it
so here we are talking about our style
part so style you can just say height
so height you can define how much height
you want so i can just say
uh 300 pixels
okay and also we can offer the width so
width i can say again
300 pixels
so these are the properties are there
let's check
how it really looks like it so here in
our
nested
now you can see we have got this uh
simply run refuse to connect because of
some you know
connection issues so it works but you
can see like how
it is showing you uh in your application
to have a quick look
okay so that's an idea like how the
iframes are used inside your code okay
so you can also offer some other type of
tools like you can say
here
if i say google.com
see it gonna show you like this
okay because of security issues it is
not
if i you just go to the inspect area
you can see console they say cross
origin
same origin so this issues normally
comes
okay but anyways that is how i told you
to use
this frame into your code
well going to the next area
of this html that's called defining the
list now this is once again a very
interesting area of
html
okay where it you're going to get the
different set of
uh display if you want to display the
data in the form of list so if you have
a form of array you want to display this
in a form of list you can certainly get
it so html has got inbuilt
tags available for the list two
different type of tags are available one
is called ordered listed taken for
unordered list
ordered list always starts with ol
yeah it always starts with ol call order
list under this will be using li that
stand for list items
you can give the items like i'm talking
about like in soap
okay and another one i can just take is
called
mobiles
next we are talking about
machines
so that is called
ordered list so this
ordered list
gonna give you
the idea of like how the
data really looks like and you can see
now
okay and this also you can change
look okay while using this
type equal to options are there like you
want to have a numbering which is a by
default option if you want to use
alphabetical you can see it is showing
the alphabetical roman numbers that is
called ordered list the other hand we
have this option like it you will call
unordered list and in this unordered
list you won't get any kind of sequences
but yes the data would be available to
us but there will be no sequence
captain so here
this is called ul
um
yeah
unordered list let's check
now you can see it's only disks are
coming up but there's no exactly
on the
types okay so that is a quick difference
between the ordered list and unordered
list provided by html tools
okay so we have already seen the
difference between ordered list and
unordered list now it's time to talk
about our another type of type of
interview questions which is regards to
your css
now
in css interview the first question they
always ask you like
how do you add css styling in html
so we have different ways to include
number one
we have a call inline css where we use
the element and within that we try to
add the css content that is called
inline css second is called external
style sheet
okay where you can just use as a
secondary or the
you know external css file and just
include it into your existing html page
okay that is the additional file which
you write it in the css and you include
it in html and third is called which is
the internal style sheet which you write
it within your html but the only
difference happens when you talk about
external it is reusable across multiple
web pages
now the different type of css selectors
which are available so we have a
different selectors like an universal
selector which is available where you
use the asterisk sign and select all the
elements and offer the common style
second we talk about element type
selector where you have the specific
element name into your mind and you
offer that particular type of selector
id selector is responsible to
select the particular element within
having the proper id
class selector which starts with a dot
class
okay and having the class name
we talk about deciding selector so in
descriptor you basically try to select
all the elements which are the part of
that
okay so you are selecting this container
and under that all the child elements of
the box
okay so we're talking about like in what
of your
decision selector we talk about called
child combinator so in this case you are
basically trying to select all those
which is a child of this
container so you are using this
greater than symbol of container.box
okay so selecting all those which is
having the child name called box
available
then you're talking about a general
sibling selectors
with this tinder sign and finally we
talk about like an attribute selector
where you have a proper attribute
available to you
okay so these are known as call a
general css selectors
followed by we have a next question like
in what is sas less and stylus
friends these are the advanced level of
theses
used in the industry so we talk about
like it what is the sas which we talk
about like in systematically awesome
style sheet so we also have a similar
type of option like in less and many
more
okay so it says about the sas
saying that it is a systactically
awesome style sheet it is
basically taking the complete css to the
next level
so that is a third-party website but
once again it is very
awesome
css which can
offer you the mathematical functions
as well as the reusability
you talk about less
okay so we talk about linear style sheet
where you can see all statements which
starts with add the read sign
there in sas every single variable start
with the dollar sign
then we talk about stylus it is also
flexible css so it doesn't use add the
rate or dollar for any defining
variables we can just directly use this
with the name okay and use it at any
point of time so these are the three
very popular
new or next generation css
so explain box sizing property like how
you can offer
the property for the box sizing
so here so
box sizing property actually defines how
to basically define
height and the width of the box which
are calculated
so you talk about a term name called
content box you talk about padding box
and you talk about border box typically
we use three different type of box
content padding and border box
in a content box these are the default
width and the height which can apply to
the elements
content which are there under the
content box
okay padding box are here you talk about
the dimensions which are added to the
box elements of the content padding
third which is available called border
box so here the dimensions added to the
content padding and the border
now what are the different way to hide
the element in a css
so we have a different way either we can
use display none
that means whatever is there inside a
dom it won't be visible to you
second option is visibility hidden that
is another property through which you
can
eliminate
the visibility but the thing is like it
is not visible to the user but this
element is added to the dom and takes up
the space
but in display none it doesn't load in a
dom so somewhere to
when you want to talk about performance
display none is anytime better
and second called position absolute so
this can be made to appear
outside the screen so three different
options are available
next option
what does that important css mean so the
important keyword actually indicates
that the highest precedence and it
overrides the cascade properties
okay so like as you can see here we have
a call paragraph where we have a color
call important and there's someone id
name called think color called green so
when we talk about pid equal to what
thing
so it automatically tried to override
the highest precedence
okay
now what are the css sprites css sprites
is a technique where you can basically
take
a
larger image
okay
download in a single shot and try to cut
down into the pieces and utilize the way
you always want
okay so if you're using this small small
images
separately
okay so to load those images
independently you would be making
multiple http calls which can be an
overhead so it is good to basically
download this lengthy image in a single
shot
clear and utilize them as per your
convenience within your application
so it is used to minimize the loading
time of your webpage by combining
multiple smaller picture into the single
image
okay that's what the css sprites are
so which property is used to underline
and strike through and the overline text
so we have this option
text style
text type text decoration
text transform
okay so the text decorations the text
decoration is the one which will be
helping you to achieve this
so i would like to demonstrate some of
the css related features the very first
feature is
like how many ways are there to add css
inside your code so
here i'll be creating a new file name
called
index
html
okay how many ways are there to add
a css into your code
so there are
three different ways are there okay the
number one which is known as call
external css internal css and inline css
external css means you have some css
features externally used and that you
want to make it available locally
okay let's take a look here i'm going to
create the new file
under the css demo that is known as call
style start
css and here we can write some normal
styles like you can talk about body
in this body we can just say background
color
equal to let's say pink
okay and i want to include this inside
my local environment so here in my head
section
i would like to use
link
okay so you can see we have an options
available name called
link rl equal to stylesheet hrf equal to
style but my class name is styles
let's say styles.css and check how it
works
so
here
you can see now the background color is
changed to what
to
pink that is called external css the
best part of the external css is to give
you the reusability factor so if any
other html file want to use the same
style it can be easily used
second is called internal style sheet
internal style sheet means you will be
having or some some of them say it is a
kind of embedded style sheet where you
have the styles available locally
and that starts with
style tag here you defined suppose h1
and in this h1 suppose if i say
color
i'm saying
suppose
blue and here we're defining the h1
okay i'm saying
welcome to
heading
and if i just try
you can see now this internal style
sheet is utilized here that is known as
call
internal or embedded style sheet and the
third which is known as call
inline style sheet where
you offer the style
okay to the element itself which is
uh
i say try to avoid uh it is not
recommended to use because it you know
you lose out the meaning of elements
completely so we just use this statement
like in what text
suppose we talk about text so with this
we will be using this style tag equal to
text align and if i just use center
so you will see here
so all three styles are applicable in
the same page that is called internal
style sheet that is called inline style
sheet and this is known as external
style sheet
so i'm sure we got the idea about how
these three style sheets are utilized
together
well going ahead and taking you towards
another very interesting area of our css
called different type of css selectors
see ultimate goal of css is what
to apply the style on your target
elements
okay
so in css we have a multiple type of
ways
to select your elements
in css it is known as called css
selectors
okay so css selectors are used to select
the content where you want the style to
be applied
okay so there are multiple type of
selectors are available first type of
selector you've already seen that is
called element selector
that is called what element selector
another type of option which is
available that is known as call id
selector
that means if i have a one h3
content with me and i can say this
is
heading three
and if i want to utilize here
call
s3 and i say what class equal to
give the name i can just say
um
s3
demo
just a name you can give any name here
if i just use with dot keyword i say h3
demo
and here if i want to apply the style i
can say color
echo
that means it will be applicable only on
those particular classes which color
equal to what echo let's take a look
there you go
okay so you got to know this is those
called what
css selector
another option which is available called
id selector that means similar elements
can be now accessed for help of ids like
if i remove this class and if i use id
equal to s3 demo so you don't use
dot you rather use what hash
okay and give the color the way you want
suppose if i want to talk about like an
blue eyelid so now
you will see it looks like this
okay so
that's called id selector so element
selector we have seen class selector we
have seen
id selector we have seen now we talk
about universal selector universal
selector means what that means all
elements will be selected like it starts
with asterisk and i say
align
text align
center if i see that means all the
elements will be aligned to the center
as you can see now all our elements are
aligned to the center that means
whichever element we declare it even if
i declare paragraph tag here i say
this is
para it will equally applicable to this
paragraph too you can see now it is also
coming into the center that is called
universal selectors
last which is called group selector
where you can have
elements which can be grouped together
like i guess i can see h1 and if you
want to apply the similar style for
h1 as well as for the h4 so we can just
use what h1
h4
okay they'll be sharing the same feature
now
so if i just use this
h4
this is
heading 4
now
well
now you can see
both headings are now sharing the common
feature this concept is known as call
group selectors where you can select the
group of elements together which you
want so we have told you about
element selector where you target the
specific element id selector with the id
attribute class means you always use
with the id class
id we'll talk about universally talk
about aztec you talk about group
selector that you're trying to tell
the group of elements which you want to
utilize it together so these are the
quick benefits and the ways how we
define it
okay thank you
okay so now we will be talking about our
next feature okay in this css that is
known as call what is the difference
between or how many ways are there to
hide the elements
okay how many ways are there to hide
elements so the two options are
available in css
to hide the elements number one is
called display none and second is called
visibility hidden
okay
now
let me try to show you this examples so
as of now i'm removing this uh all
records whichever is there under the
style
and removing it all okay now let's make
it very simple so it is called like uh
hiding the elements we have two options
either we can use display none or else
we can use visibility hidden so display
none removes the element from the normal
flow of the page
are we clear and
visibility hidden
leaves the element in the normal flow
are we clear but occupies a space in a
dom
that means it would not be showing the
elements in your browser but behind the
scene it will take the space
so it will be quite heavy so display
none is a better option compared to the
visibility hidden
both options are designed to hide
elements let me show you very simple
example here
so first statement what i'm trying to do
is
here
i'm defining this
ex1 and this ex1 we are using this
a
space href
equal to
hash
okay and we're using
style
okay in style we are saying
display
colon
none so i won't be displaying it okay
and
here after that i close this
and i say
unseen
okay after this i am breaking it
here
fine and copy the same
and pasting it below
you say like ex2
well ex1 is saying what display none
and style here we are not using this
rather will be saying
visibility which option we are using
this visibility and this visibility will
be checking visibility hidden
in such case when i try to run the
example
you see like both the options are not
visible but when i say inspect
you can see here
it is saying display none visibility
hidden so you can see here in this
example both options are not showing
okay so the answer is very clear to us
none of the hyperlinks are showing to us
because that's where
the conditions are
okay so we understood about the
way how to basically hide the elements
from the browser
there is another feature friends coming
up
in
the css front and that is called a
feature called property called important
so important is again a type of property
it is a rule in css to add more
importance
to a particular property than like a
normal value
so important will try to override all
the previous stylings and give
the next available value to your element
now let me show you how it really works
so just imagine i have got
this
body tag and in this body type we ever
got h1
we can say this is
heading one
okay like this i can copy
and
paste
okay so this is heading one heading one
three times i'm playing it now now in
this case uh i may have multiple classes
are also available this is like normal i
can say
equal to
i can use
head one
okay and here also i'm saying
rather than using class
okay i can use what id
equal to
head to you can change the name as you
want
and here what i can do is in my style i
can use this first option
for id that is called
head to
okay
i can use one more that is called
head one
so two properties i have it head one and
head two
and we can also use h1
as like a normal property
head to we can give this
for id i can say
background color
i say
pink
head one
i can just use background color
red
and here what i can do i can override
the properties
so what i can do here in my application
i can zip h1
here i say background
okay color
and here we can just use as a what
as i call brown so if i say brown in
that case and if i make it as an
important
like i say
important by saying accelerometer mark
important so what would happen just take
a look here
you will see it basically replacing all
the colors with what
with
brown because i'm making it as a what as
a
important as i said overrides or
overrule all the previous property if i
remove it
okay so it will be changing it
to the different color
and here
i just use what dot
and here i use what
hash
head to
is the id so i can just use hash here
and here we use what
dot now
you see they will be having their own
dedicated colors okay i say like this
but if i just make it as a what
important
and i use it as a cold water
green yellow so you can see
it will apply the green yellow to
everywhere
okay so that is an important prop let's
override all the previous rules that's
how the css is
okay everyone so our next example
is towards
focus on javascript interference
now here we have few questions that are
available like what are the various data
types in javascript
so javascript contains different type of
javascript data types like if you think
about
all different types which are there
generally
by short int long
float double character boolean these are
all different type of
data types are supported inside a
javascript
okay
now
going ahead what is the callback in
javascript so the callback means is a
function
okay that is passed with another
function as an argument on a parameter
okay so what is the callback callback
means don't call me i will call you
clear so the idea is like you are
passing
the function itself isn't parameter to
the another function because the
javascript is known to be called
non-blocking which never wait for the
code to finish it continues to move on
and due to some reason if your
function it's taking some time
to
you know
execute so javascript won't wait for
that particular function to finish so
you use callback to prevent such
behavior
okay that's called a javascript callback
now what is the difference between
function declaration and function
expression see this is called
function declaration
and you talk about a function expression
function declaration is just to declare
a
separate statement within a main
javascript code and
you can be called before the function is
defined
okay it gives you the better readability
where the function expression are always
created inside the expression
okay and
it is created when the execution point
reaches it
are we clear and it is used when there
is a need of for a conditional
declaration of a particular function
now what do you understand about the
cookies in a javascript so it is one of
the very very common question cookies
are the one which is created by the
server stored in a client side which is
responsible to store all the necessary
client activities so that the browser or
the application give the better
recommendation to the user
okay so it is just a
a small
text file
which is stored in a browser itself
okay it want
to record something about a user
activity you always put it like that
and you can also define
the expiry time for the cookies
okay as per your convenience to decide
how long the cookie wants to be there
inside your browser if you do not offer
any time span by default the cookie will
get lost immediately the moment the
browser closed
next what are the clauses in javascript
so closures are the javascript is a
feature where the inner function has an
access to outer functions variables
and the properties
okay so you can consider a closure has a
three scope change number one it has an
access to its own scope
that is defined within its curly braces
second it has an access to the variable
of the outer function and also has an
access to the global variables
now the closure is the javascript
features as i told you like which has
hannah has an access to the outer
functions variable simple example i can
give it to you is
a function which is known as called
inner function
and there's a function defined on the
top is an outer function so it is having
all the functionalities access of the
outer function inside it
now
what are the imports and exporting
javascript so import and exports in
javascript is a very very common way how
in java you use the term name call
import a package
but in javascript it is little different
unless you export something you can't
import it
okay so if you want to access any of
your files properties or methods outside
of your file you always use the
statement of import
and export so here you can see you have
got
one property like an sqrt which you are
exporting it and you have one function
which is called square there is another
function called
you can say diag which you are exporting
it and importing it just the way you
always want so that is how
it is importing and exporting
what is the difference between undefined
undeclared and null in a javascript
see undefined means a variable that is
declared but the value has not been
assigned yet that is called undefined
undeclared means
like it is a null
first of all we talk about null null
means it is an assignment value that we
can assign to any variable that is meant
to contain no value and undeclared means
the variables are not declared and do
not exist in the program
okay that is called what un
declared
how to remove the duplication from the
javascript array so you basically needs
to use
the standard filter methods
okay this is basically responsible to
help you to analyze whether we have some
duplicates available or not
so we'll be using using filter methods
okay so these are basically known is
called array and the current element and
the index of current element
and by using the for loop it is an empty
array is used for the storing all the
repeated elements
okay so these are known as call a
typical javascript discussion which we
have taken place
multiple questions are there which we
have already answered
it's time to basically talk about
javascript so i'm going to create a new
folder now the name called jsdemos
and in this js demo we would like to
explain you
the different concepts the first let me
go and create
index
dot html and i will be creating another
file here called
demo.js well my first concept towards
this javascript is like working with
callbacks like what are the callbacks
are see the ideally as we know callbacks
are the function which you pass it
okay to the another function as in
parameter so we'll be seeing how this
callbacks really works
with showing you one very small
demonstration let me have this
html5 here and
here
we would like to use script
src equal to
demo.js
and in my demo.js i'd like to create
const
okay
get
blogs
okay equal to
now
this function call
get
blogs
let me have this arrow sign here so now
here i would like to provide one
function called set timeout
this set timeout as you know there's the
javascript function which delays the
response time i'm dealing it for
2000 millisecond and here in set timeout
we are saying return
and here we will provide
property called title
colon
welcome to
js
so this get blocks is a function having
one
uh it is returning on an object of
having property called title and sync
welcome to js delaying for 2000
here i'm saying
const
bp is just a variable equal to
get blocks
okay and here we'll be using
console.log
and here we'll be providing the property
like a what bp
dot
title so that's the property for me
now
ideally if i just check if i try to run
my code i want to see what outcome i'm
gonna receive while try to running this
i'll go back to my browser and
just check
what works
nothing is displaying but when i go to
the inspect
i'll see it is saying like cannot read
property title got undefined
yeah now white it happens because
javascript is non-blocking it doesn't
wait for the function or
the
i would say the block of code to get
over if it is delaying for 2000
millisecond then title property will be
available only after the 2000
milliseconds are lapsed but here the
output is displaying title immediately
due to that it is saying like hey title
is not available because it is delaying
for 2000 milliseconds
now this is the concept where the
closure sorry this callback comes where
you're passing the function itself as in
parameter to another function which will
wait till the time the job get over
so here what i'll be doing i'll be
removing this i'll be using this as a
function called cb
sorry
cb and uh
this
enclose it it here now we have a one
function name called cb
okay which is having property called
title and i'm passing this cb as a what
as a parameter here
now this is called callback your passing
function itself is and what is in
parameter to another function
and here in get blocks what i'll be
doing it
i'll be using
get blocks here we are passing
bps and parameter
and now
let me take this
to back to my code bp.title and let me
see
how it works
okay so
that's where
the concept really comes in so now after
two second melee two thousand
milliseconds are over respond is
available response is available let me
refresh
two second two milliseconds oh sorry two
thousand milliseconds the response is
available
that's the concept of callback where you
are passing the function itself as a
parameter with another function
okay everyone so after this we're gonna
start working with our next area of
discussion
that is called what is the difference
between a function expression and
function declaration
okay see ideally if you check
there are actually
really similar
okay how you call them is exactly the
same
the difference is how the browser loads
them into the execution context
again i'm telling you
the
concept of let me try to create a new
file and give the name call
declaration versus
expression
so what i'm trying to tell you is
they are actually really simple or
similar
how you call them is exactly the same
the only difference lies here is how the
browser load them into the execution
context
so function declaration loads before any
code is executed
again i'm repeating function declaration
loads before any code is executed but
the function expression load only when
the interpreter reaches at the end of
the code
okay
so as i said the function expression
loads only when the interpreter reaches
that line of code
okay so once again i repeat the
difference function declaration loads
before any code is executed however the
function expression loads only when the
interpreter reaches that line of code
if you try to call function expression
before it is loaded you will get an
error for sure
if you call a function declaration
instead it will work because no code can
be called until all declarations are
loaded like again i'm telling you this
example if i say
alert
demo
i'm using this
okay and i'm coming down
okay and i'm using this work
demo
equal to
function
which says
return
hello
are we clear
so you see it is an error
why it is an error you can see the error
carefully they say
whatever the reason is okay suppose even
if i put semicolon here so there will be
no difference here because they're
telling you very clearly
like this example
is an error because the demo function
was not found it is an example of
function expression
function declaration however what would
happen
in the other side
okay
it will run
i'll be clear it will run without having
any issue the way you call it's gonna
work
without having any issue
okay that is the alert demo
okay here we have a call
object which is returning here and
that's it
this is called function expression and
if i just show you about
another way around so we're just going
to say
alert
demo 2.
here
suppose when we are saying this alert
demo two here let me
try to close this
okay it is an actually error here in our
elliott demo when i say the same example
alert demo two
okay and i'm using it here by saying
function
okay and i'm using this call
demo two
okay and here
we're just saying return
is it gonna work for you
okay this is gonna work for you
that's the difference between function
expression
and function declaration so this is a
function expression and this is a
function
declaration hope you're all clear about
this
well another example which i'm trying to
show to you that is called working with
the closures
so i'm going to create a new file here
call
now what are the closure see the idea
behind the closure is very important
because it is a core concept of
javascript
the idea behind of closure means that
the inner function
okay you have a outer function you call
inner function inner function always
have an access to the variables and the
parameter of its outer function
even after the outer function has
returned
okay
now let's see how we gonna declare this
in this example if i define a one
function
okay this function is called
outer
okay and here defining one variable
called
oe
okay equal to 100
is a variable declaration and after that
we are declaring the nested function
inside this by saying
function
inner
okay
and now inside this i'm gonna declare
a simple alert
sorry
a simple alert where we are displaying
the
outer variable the one which is defined
okay after this a function we're just
saying what
return
you know see inner function is already
written
and
after this what i'll be doing i'm just
going to create the object of war
inner function
equal to
outer the object we are creating it now
okay and after that we are calling
inner
function
and ideally it should work because that
is what i said the
implementation is very simple the inner
function will have the access of what
come on outer function variable even it
has been returned and that's what we're
doing it now and if i just check
how it is
so here
i have a call closuredemo.js let me
invoke the closure demo
now
you can see
it is working
that's the beauty of
the closure okay so we understand like
closure example is very simple
where it is giving you the access of
external
variables can be accessed by the inner
variables
okay very easily
now i'm gonna tell you about the
difference between
okay the difference between
the null
undefined and undeclared
again i'm repeating my word three
options
undefined
null and undeclared what is the
difference so here
i'm gonna define a new file called
in this different.js undefined means
what undefined means a variable that has
been declared but not has
assigned a value
okay like if i just say var a
and defining this log
okay let me say a so that is called
undefined
that's called undefined you're using it
the value hasn't been defined
i'll be clear that means the value is
undefined null means it can be assigned
to a variable to a
represent no value again null means what
it can be assigned to a variable to a
represent no value like
you think about a situation
var b equal to what
null
are we clear and if i say log
okay and i'm defining the beak
this will be null it can be assigned to
a variable
to represent no value that is called
null and undeclared means what
undeclared means if a variable is not
declared then the browser throws an
error here at least to define declare a
variable but you haven't defined the
value
and here i'll be showing what
log
and here if i just say
demo
so this is certainly a what
come on undeclared this is called what
your application will be throwing the
error saying like hey what you are
trying to access it doesn't even exist
so here the type is undefined
okay that's the differences
okay so we are clear about what you mean
by
undefined undeclared versus the null
values
now the next thing is
how to basically try
to eliminate
the
arrays
duplicate values from the arrays so if
you are planning to remove the duplicate
values from where from the array you
have options with you
what options very simple to remove the
duplicate elements in an array let me
declare one simple
let
data equal to here let's define a value
like an a
like in b
okay
like on c
and once again we are defining what a so
a is a duplicate it should not be
repeated while displaying so we can just
use what let
let unique equal to we're using what
data it contains one function called
what
filter
inside this filter we are passing two
properties here
number one
is just a character like in c and second
we are passing what index
okay
and here
here we are defining return
okay the property called what
data okay dot
index of
okay here we are passing the first
character like in what c
index
that's it
that's how we're defining and let's
close this
and use
log
what
the unique
okay and this demo.js we are including
in our index.js
okay and let's check this out
now you can see it is having abc
it doesn't have any duplicate elements
which we have defined
now let me add another one that is
called b
again but here
you see it's really having what
the same value so this is how the way
you remove
the duplicate elements from there
from the area very simple and
straightforward utilization of the
filter function okay thank you
well let's go ahead with the next area
that is called working with react.js
interview questions
now as we know it react.js is as
important as like in other
tools which you've already seen
so what is the jsx here jsx called
javascript syntax extension
okay
so this syntax extension to the
javascript in react.js isn't the way
how you express
to bind js and html together to result a
jsx
content
so by using jsx you can write the html
structure in the same file that contains
the javascript code that is something
more innovative way because of that
react js is creating
more buzz in a market
so
jsx actually helps the making code more
easy to understand and debug and avoid
lot of boilerplate code okay inside the
dom structure
now the next thing what is the virtual
dom so the virtual dom is representing a
dom in a memory
okay that is called virtual dom so
manipulating the real dom is much more
slower and costly affair
okay because you need to repaint the dom
over and over the period of time
when the user changes few things
so
when the state change virtual dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real dom
okay
update instead of updating the entire
object so that makes your page to be
load far more faster
okay so in virtual dom what happens this
is the real dom this is a virtual dom so
the orange color portions which you are
seeing that is basically the changes
which has been made
okay these are called changed object
okay so virtual
dom is basically compare it's to the
previous state and understand which area
it needs to send for the updates and
avoid the other areas
okay that's what this
virtual dom really works
so what a react extension react
extensions are many like you talk about
like in flux it is a third party tool
which is responsible to attach
the state management feature you talk
about react native which is responsible
to develop the hybrid mobile
applications
in javascript so these are two very
popular and there are many more which
are available
okay so
like you talk about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering
okay so redux and there are lot many
other tools are also available so what
is an event in react and how you're
going to create that so react is
basically offering
the ideas of handling the event very
fairly easy so that you talk about
clicking anything
you talk about taking your mouse
somewhere so these kind of options
generate an event so for that we
typically say
alert and you click on this render you
click on this button in a curly braces
you call the function to trigger
to event
now what are the components in react
so friends react components are nothing
but a call view
okay like a complex view can be divided
into the smaller portions
a complex ui can be
distributed further to create more
better and reusable views
clear so it splits the user interface
into the independent pieces of code
which can be developed and joins
later on okay so that's how you define
the component in and react so in angular
and react
in both the areas the word component is
very much used so the component meaning
is very simple you talk about a view
so what is the state in a react so state
is a react is nothing but
is
the one which identify
what was and what is now
okay which stores the value for the
specific period of time which changes
and react is basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications
okay so it keep tracking about all those
states what it was there like in i'm
talking about an incrementing encounter
so that is also the state available
there okay so the state object is always
initializing the constructor so it can
contain the multiple properties so this
dot set state is used to change
the value of the state object and set
state is responsible
to
perform the shallow merge between the
new state and the previous state
now the state holds the data that a
component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
accessed as you can see this example
here
in the constructor we are defining the
super props and the states being
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state render
the state and update the states
what is a higher order component and
pure component react higher components
are the component which are typically a
function okay that takes a component and
return a new component to you by
manipulating few things
they're basically designed for the
reusing
okay so the higher the components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so to in order to perform some
reusability a pure components
are the components okay is a
variation of react component that
doesn't
that does a shallow comparison of props
and state
okay shallow comparison basically checks
what the equality
are we clear now so that's what the main
job
going ahead what do we implement and how
do you implement react routing so to the
implemented react routing react routing
also comes with inbuilt
react
modules and that particular module need
to import it
so
here we define the react modules by
offering the route path
where you have a call left hand side is
the name and the right hand side is a
component which you would like to
deliver it now
okay that's how you define it so we'll
be discussing about some of the
important aspects of react
so the very first question is what is
the component in
react see we know it very well the react
is known to be called component centric
library where the word component playing
a very important role especially when it
comes to the representation part
so in a nutshell i will say whatever you
see
in your
browser
in a modern days applications they are
nothing but a called what
there's so called typically a
component and how to use those
components let's take a look at my code
so in a very complex applications
the view can be distributed to the
smaller portions and every single
portion will be treated as a what is a
component so how to create a component
in react let's take a look
so to create a component what i will be
doing it i will just go back and create
a new folder
called
components you can give any name and
inside these components i'm going to
create a new file with the name called
main
app.js
so here i have to import one package
called import
react
from
react
and here i will be giving
component
in a curly braces now here let's go and
create a component by saying export
default
plus
main app
extends component and the moment you do
so immediately you have to
create a one function called render
which
have a return
and
this return will return you the jsx
and here i write a very simple message
under the div tag
and say
welcome to
let's put it under the paragraph tag
okay that's it the component is ready
let me include it under the app.js which
is already created component provided by
your react
and here
let's include it
and
start it by saying npm space start
and it will launch in port number 3000
it is saying like
srthintex.js is not found
okay so there are some
previous components are written
so we haven't used it
oh you can see the message called
welcome to main app
so you can see this is a very simple
example of how the components are
created
in your application
that's the one thing
now the next thing is like how to
basically go and create an event how to
gonna launch or trigger any event in
react application
your friends triggering an event in
react is very very simple
what i will do is here i'm going to
write one very simple function called
call
app
let me put it under
here call up
and here we can say alert
app is called and to trigger the event
i'll be creating one very simple button
and i say
call
let me have an even call
on click
equal to and here in curly braces
i'll be calling this
method which is called call up
okay and once it is ready let's go
and there we go you see how easy it is
for you
in react to create an event and launch
an event
okay everyone so our next example in the
same continuation
is like what do you mean by higher order
components
okay so you need to understand like uh
when we talk about uh higher order
components they are the just like in
javascript function
are used for adding additional
functionalities to the existing
component
it is basically designed for reusability
okay so they're designed for adding the
additional functionality to the existing
components these
functions are pure this which means like
they are receiving the data and
receiving value according to the data
okay so if the data changes higher order
function rerun with a different input
okay so
the idea is like higher order function
is wrapped around the normal components
and provide additional data of it
and that's how this works let me try to
give you a very simple example of how
the react
react offers a higher order function for
you so let me go back and create a new
file
and uh get the name call
hock
okay so as usual i'll be importing the
same
in hoc i'll copy and paste the same
and
give the name call
extends component i'll remove this call
app
and
render return whatever we have it i'll
just remove these two also
so this turns to be very very normal
function
for the normal component
now what i do is in a very first step in
my application
i'll remove all those i really don't
need those first
i'll say const
info
okay equal to
props
it is a stateless function component
okay now here i'm defining a div tag
okay within this div tag i'm saying h1
or h2
and within this i am saying message
called
info
after this i am starting with another
tag called paragraph tag
and will say
the info is
something whatever it is but what data i
really don't know but i can just use
something here
now
here if i just say suppose
props
dot info so you might be thinking like
what exactly the info is so don't worry
i'll help you how to achieve this
i'm going to create one more called
const
with
admin warning
okay equal to
now here we're going to create
a very simple
okay now here i'm just going to give the
name called wrap component
wrapped
it's just the name wrapped component
okay
here we are saying return
with prop
okay and here
within this props i will use again
another div tag here
within this div tag i can use the
paragraph
and i will say
this is private info
message we have written
and what i'll be doing
within this application i'll create
what wrap component
and within this
i'm saying
okay so we are basically printing what
drops
once it is over
that's it so you can say const
admin
info
const admin info equal to
i'm just gonna give the name call what
with
admin warning and passing what
the another component inside this that
is an info
that's it
so that is what we wanted
okay and i'll be saying what
export
default
which option admin info
and that's the example of typical
higher order component so you can see
this higher order components are the
components which are taking the input in
the form of component and returning what
the another component which changed
value
and that's how we're returning another
component
with
and passing what a component inside so
this info is passed choose another
component to the wrap
with admin warning and returning this so
this is a typical example of like how
your higher auto components are actually
used
our next example is all about state
management
how to define and display the states
inside a react as we know it very well
react takes care about the state pretty
well and that is one of the beauty of
react so let's see how we can use this
estate management inside your
application
so to maintain the state what i'll be
doing it uh
here i'll just try to create one
function called uh inc
increment
okay or
whichever you want to make it so i
better use inc
for increment okay
i remove this alert
so to define the state inside your
component you always use one line
that is known as call
constructor
inside this you define props
and here you use
super
number one and after that you initialize
the state the way you want so to
initialize the state you always say this
dot
state because the state is in an object
so you define this state with the value
called count
colon zero so count is just a variable
which are initializing the initial state
with the value zero
and you'll be displaying this value
right over here and say
counter
and here
to display this will be using this start
state dot count
initial value is actually zero so let me
check
here you can see the value is so zero
now i want
to
increment it value so how you're going
to be incrementing it now so to
increment this what i'll be doing is
i'll be calling this
okay this and calling the set state
function by saying this dot
that state
okay
and in the set state i would like to
check what are my previous values and
what is my current values accordingly
i'll try to make it so here i will say
this starts that state
here i will take one parameter call
ps that is called previous state and
here
i would like to say return
and here i will say count
colon
ps dot
count plus 1. ps means previous state is
just a variable to confirm what was the
previous state
of my application whether it was 0 1 2
or whatever
and we have to call this inc function
right over here
that's it let's check
there we go
okay very simple that is called state
management very simple example you
initialize the state
and after that you render the state and
after that when the state changes while
calling this inc function
this set state function will render the
updated state to the dom
due to that you are able to see this
value
now our next step is like how you're
going to be performing this navigation
inside the react application
so friends when we talk about like a
navigation we have a very
straightforward demonstrations
first of all in case if you want to
perform the navigation you need to have
the new dependencies to be get added by
saying npm space i space
react hyphen
router hyphen dawn
that's the first dependence you need to
have it
okay
and
once the dependency is ready
you have to go back and start
importing
some of the portions of your code like
suppose if i create another component
here
give the name call
login dot js
okay that's my component name
and i'm gonna create one more component
here called
landing page
dot js
okay
so
once these two components are ready
so you'll be creating a routes
so in our main app.js or
the previous component what we have
created
okay i would like to go back and create
some data right over here
support class constructor super i am
removing it all
render return
i'll remove everything give the name
call
landing page
okay extends component and everything
and what i'll be doing is to provide the
routing on navigation
here in my applications i will try to
say
how to provide so i will say const
okay
routes equal to
now here
i would like to make one dependency
called browser router there's some
dependency i would like to use
so here i'll say import
from
you can see react router down this
dependency came and now i'd like to
bring the first dependency here that is
known as call browser router
that is the location from where your
navigation will pick up
and within this i'm using this div tag
within this div tag i'm using
route
okay i'm saying
path
equal to
if i say
login
okay so which component should load so
i'm saying component
equal to
which component i have it here i've
recently created call login
but i didn't write anything there
so here
so let me go back and create it
remove this all
okay and writing
welcome to login and here in my landing
page when i go
i say component
i say
login
okay that means when i will be clicking
on this
i'll be getting what the login so that
is the path i've given
okay and this particular routes i'll be
putting it right over here
so that's it and this is my landing page
and i will be making it landing page
available under my main app
or if you want to make it app.js you can
make it
okay say say ng space
sorry npm space start
now the navigation is taking place
now nothing is coming up because landing
page is blank but yes i know one thing
if i try to click on login something
will come
there we go welcome to login
that's a very simple and straightforward
behavior of like how the navigation
takes place in react applications
okay everyone so we will go ahead with
the next set of interviews which is
related to your angular
so angular is as popular like in react
okay so there are some questions which
are usually asked like what is the data
binding okay so the data binding is
actually the process which allows
the
application
okay to have some data associated with
your
html page from your typescript classes
or the vice versa
okay
so the data binding is the one through
which you bind the data okay
so you can see here it says like angular
uses two data binding when the changes
happens in a model it will be affected
in a view and whether changes happens in
review it will affect the
model also so it is used to
typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange
what is a typescript typescript is a
typical
i would say
a language which is used
by angular okay to develop angular
component services pipes decorators and
multiple things it is a superset of
javascript and it supports
javascript libraries and apis it is a
pure object oriented in nature
uses object-oriented principles better
development time fast to load and
additional features to the javascript
for sure
okay
what is an aot compilation how it is
different from jit aut stand for ahead
of time compiler which is converting all
angular and html and typescript code
into the javascript code during the
build phase before the browser downloads
and run the code
okay so aot
is far more faster and light weighted in
the size just in time compiler is a by
default compiler
okay so
it is a process where the compiling
computer go to the machine code during
the execution of runtime
so this ensures the faster rendering the
browser it also known as called dynamic
compilation
are we clear so when you want to develop
this aot compiler you always use hyphen
hyphen
aot
okay so here you always use
jit compiler because it is a by default
compiler you used when you say ng build
next what are the pipes in angular so
pipes means that they are the decorators
they
never change their default value but
just for the representation purpose they
change the values
okay
to look more better the way they always
want
okay
so pipes are ready made or else it can
be customized created angular also comes
with lot many predefined pipes
okay like it comes with the pipe symbol
here
okay so you can chain the pipes together
it can be provided with some arguments
at the run time with the colon sign
okay
now you pass the input you put the pipe
and get some result
with some decorated outcome now you can
see the pure pipes uses the pure
functions
clear so this pipe doesn't use any
internal state and the output remains
the same as long as the parameters
passed to stay
the same angle calls the pipe only when
it detects the changes in the parameters
being passed
a single instance of the pure pipe is
used throughout the all
components
okay so this is how
you see how the pipes are being used so
we have defined the pipe
okay which is the value called truen
falls for the pure and giving the class
by implementing pipe transform
so
you can see here the impure pipes for
the say for every change detection
actually happens in an angular and
impure is called
are we clear with regards to the changes
in the input fields
okay they will be calling every time so
multiple pipe instances are created for
the same for these pipes and push pass
to these pipes can be mutable by default
all pipes are pure only if you want to
make it impure you always say like pure
colon true
or
pure colon false
now what are the promises and
observables in angular see
promises it is a typical javascript
object okay it it emits a single values
at a time they execute immediately after
the creation and not cancelable
they are pushed error to the child
promises
okay where the observables are only
executable when subscribed to them
they won't call unless you subscribe to
them using subscribe methods so they
help perform operations like for each
filter and retreat and everything
when you unsubscribe this they won't get
called and won't listen anymore
what are the form control center form
groups see the form controls and form
groups these are two predefined objects
comes with your
angular
so these all text boxes
from you take the input it may be radio
buttons it may be the drop down it may
be the check boxes are called form
controls
okay so form controls is a class that
enables the validation for every single
input class
whichever you are creating it now
so they check
the values which are touched untouched
or the dirty
clear
now we talk about call form group they
are basically forming a group
which
under which you have a call relevant
fields joined together are called what a
form group
okay so form group class represents a
group of controls like you talk about
address contain city state and pin code
these all three can be together called
as a form group
okay so the form group class basically
return true if all controls are
basically what
the valid
okay and they are
designed to provide all the necessary
validation errors
what is eager and what is the lazy
loading
okay so eager loading means what it is a
default module loading strategy followed
in an angular
eagle loadings are used before the
application starts
these are typically useful for the small
scale applications
lazy loading however is designed
for dynamic loads of features
only on demand
this makes your application far more
faster so in a bigger application we
really don't make easy eager loading
because it hampered the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy loading
what is the string interpolation in
angular see string interpolation is
written under the double curly braces it
is typically one way binding where you
get the data from the typescript classes
and display directly over your browser
it denotes with the curly braces and it
always display the data comes from the
component to the view in angular we have
two very important areas to discuss like
number one
what do you mean by
string interpolation say string
interpolation is very very simple
statement like you are
talking about a one way binding
string interpolation is a one way
binding technique which is used to
output the data from a typescript code
which is a ts file
so whatever data you keep it on your
typescript if you want to make it
available to the browser for the
representation purpose you always use
double curly braces
as you can see right now we have one
property called company name and we have
a call
my company and if i go back to the html
i can say this company name right now so
this company name is written in double
curly braces and here it contains that
value
now if i just give one more option here
call
my city
okay equal to if i say pune
and if i go here if i want to display
the city
so i can use
my
city
okay if i go to the browser you can see
it is showing me this
so that option is known as call what in
string interpolation you can basically
perform
some other activities to like in case if
you want to perform some calculations
that also you can do like you can see
here we have got
number 1
okay equal to
10
and you say
num 2 equal to 20 so if you want to do
that here you can say
and that you can put it
num plus to num2
and you can see now it is giving me the
calculation
so that is something which is known as
called string interpolation
that means whatever you would like to
make it you want to display over your
browser from the ts5
the next activity which comes in an
angular that is known scholar how you're
going to be dealing with and how you
will be dealing with another concept
here called
pipes
see the pipes are basically designed for
the formatting purpose so whenever you
would like to perform the formatting you
always use pipes without changing the
core values
okay so in case if i'm planning to
display some records or some data
okay without compromising the original
value i'll always talk about what
pipes
so pipes are always designed to give you
some more meaningful messages like you
can see
predefined pipes different type of pipes
are available
here we talk about predefined pipes
which start with this pipe symbol
and you put
uppercase so if you put an uppercase you
can see
all letters
mean
okay
here let me terminate the server and the
other properties are also two
like in component if i go and put
okay and we talk about
rating
okay we say
doj
equal to
date and if you put it in
like this if you put it
and those well if i want to format it as
usual
they'll be showing in a normal format
so formatting can really change the way
they should look
like just imagine here
embedding it as an upper case
in a similar one i can display
some other details too like i copy this
and i'm using
one more property here called income
and this i put it in a number
or currency
which will be showing me the values
where in a currency
again
i talk about
this rating
okay i can
change it to number
and also i can perform what
some basic
customized calculations like suppose
rating is 4.9867 i want to
trim the post decimal values to 2. so i
can say 2.2 minus 2
it will be going like that we could talk
about date of joining so if i just go
here
we say doj and i put what
date it is a predefined pipe it really
make a difference
in your existing applications
let's check
here
let me refresh my browser
you can see now how the codes are
looking like it
so they are basically different set of
pipes which are provided by the
angular to make a difference in your
application hope you are clear
and some generic interview questions
like you can see about what are the
advantages of typescript over the
javascript so certainly we know that
typescript is a superset and give you
the better benefits over the javascript
it is fast super loaded features
better understanding code looks like in
typical c plus plus and java and offer
lot many features like interface
generics and many more
how a web developer different from a web
designer certainly the web developer
build a web application using html
css and javascript web designer
basically use all the other tools like
an adobe photoshop and other tools
so
frequently you use javascript framework
for developing a web-based application
which may be client-side and server-side
you really require good coding skills
and you have to keep yourself updated
with your latest frameworks which can
create a better effects into your code
where in a web designer is focused only
on talking about trends color patterns
and all
so webbed is a developer having much
more better hand over the web designer
so what is the back-end developers
back-end developments you talk about
developing a server-side applications
like in java jsp php
you're writing and developing the apis
where the front-end application can
communicate with and it ensures the data
integrity and consistency and involve
writing a lot of scripting where you can
communicate with your backend
application in the databases
okay
what is the coffee script it is a once
again a type of scripting available
okay which is not used further but yes
it is a type of
a language
okay where you can write the javascript
code into so it attempts to demonstrate
the positive points of javascript in
very very straightforward manner
so you can write a consistent javascript
code
and getting much more better advantage
over the traditional coding
how would you ensure that a web designer
is a web design is a user friendly there
are certain parameters are there you
talk about
a front-end developer should work
closely with the user experience team
so it gives the same design what the
user is actually expect
they should test the application
regularly while taking the inputs
so the application developed
should be compatible with the different
platforms and the different screen sizes
would you recommend a web designer role
or a web developer role certainly we
talk about call web developer role
but it really a matter of preferences
okay if you are
more inclined towards creating the end
user experience
i would suggest to go with the web or ux
designer role if you focus on writing
everything together
okay towards more into the coding you
will certainly step into
web developer
how you would increase the page
performance there are certain parameters
you need to consider html document
should clean up
external http request could be minimized
sprites compressed images and the
smaller image would be included at the
bottom of the page you should put
javascript rather than on a head tag
css javascript and html
caching on cdn
okay so everyone thank you very much so
these are the quick interview questions
we have defined for you
okay i wish you all the best and thank
you very much
