below to find a business analytics
program that fits your experience and
areas of Interest now without further
delay let's get started now we will jump
into the MySQL workbench where we have
our query ready so here we will be using
three tables employee details employee
register and employee joining register
so we want employee name contact number
and joining date joining date is
available in joining register contact
number is available in employee register
and employee name is available in
employee details right so here we are
utilizing all three tables and joining
them to extract these three columns so
here I'm providing the table name and
the column name to make sure that the
SQL workbench will not get confused
which employee name I mean which
employee name column should I access
which table should I use so to clear
that confusion I'm providing the table
name so my SQL will use employee details
table and from there it will extract the
employee name column and contact number
to be sure it is present in only one
table so it will go to employe register
and joining date it is also present in
only one table so no need to specify the
table name but to be on safer side if
you want to add you can add that's well
and good and it will create an impact to
your interviewer considering that you
know about the syntaxes so I'll just
follow the normal syntax the way I'm
going now and now I'm trying to join
it's the same operation what you use to
join two different tables so you'll just
join use the join clause and give the
second table name and on what basis so
so I'm joining these two tables on the
primary key employee ID so both tables
have the same common employee ID So
based on that I'm joining these two
tables and then you will use the join
Clause once again and give the third
table name here and based on which
primary key or which common key so this
is the one which is common in both the
tables and is unique which is the
employee ID so I'm using the same one to
join the two tables with the third one
you can follow the same syntax and join
another table to it as well well so with
this let's execute this particular query
to find our answer so there you go you
got the query executed and you have the
table over here with employee name
contact and joining date so with that we
have come to an end of this session on
how to join three or more tables in SQL
