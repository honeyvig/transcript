with how to install jir now to install
jir you need to go to this particular
website don't worry this website link is
attached in the description box below
and now if you scroll down you can see
the option to get started with the
download just click on that there you go
just select the 64-bit version for
Windows then go to the agreement just
click on that accept all the agreements
and privacy policies if you want you can
just go to those agreement web pages and
you can also read them and you can also
cross check the privacy policy if you
wish to now simply click on submit
button and there you go I think the
downloader has been started if you go to
the download page you can see where the
file is getting downloaded there you go
it's about 560 MP so it should take a
few
minute there you go the file has been
successfully downloaded now yes now you
need to run this particular installer as
an admin there you go the visit already
started the installation
process there you go if you have to
check a few admin rights if you don't
have few admin rights then you have to
give some admin R to the installer click
on yes and go to next and here choose
the default setting which is Express
install and if you know or if you want
to customize you can go for custom
install but now I'll go with the
recommended one default one and check
the code numbers and everything allow
permissions once again give admin
authorities if you had to give for this
installer and then allow go back to
installation check the HTTP port and RMI
port numbers let B defa and now let's
start installing this installing might
take a little time let's
wait so the first stage I think it's
been successfully done it's extracting
the files and now it might take a little
more time for extracting all the files
needed for installation let's
wait once it's done it will start a new
window where it will request for the
startup of jira there you go so
installation is complete you can start J
now just click on next I think some
backup files I mean Java environment
setup will run in the
background and once you click on next
the the environment variables will start
the job and after that your jira will be
hosted on Local Host it might take a
while but again you can work on jira
directly from your browser as well you
just have to create an account and
create your demo projects let's also
take a look at that okay now let's try
to launch click on that uh icon checkbox
so that your jira starts in the browser
click finish and uh few background uh
processes will be learning which is
about the environment settings and
everything we can minimize that and let
it take its own time meanwhile let's try
to create a jira account from Google to
start jir in the Local Host the
background process need to run which
might take a little time but by then
let's try to create an actual J account
from Google's
website let's type in jira login and
select the first one login with
atlassian account I've already created
my account for this the creation is just
simple just like any other Google email
creation so you can either login or
create a new account and login so let's
select J software from the options given
and it will now open a dashboard so by
default you might be having a few of the
projects and if you want uh a new one
you can also create one using the create
option over there so these are some
default uh um scrums that that we have
already worked on and you can also
create a new project using that create
project option or create and with that
