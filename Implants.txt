I'm the forensic much on Team India's
conquered let's let's go to the basics
about the implantology and implants so
so this is doctor brain mark he was
considered the father of implantology
oral implantology and he discovered the
term he coined the term osseointegration
so this is the titanium Chamba the
experiments of brain ma this is the
titanium genre Aquila bodies he
introduced the titanium chamber into the
rabbit's foot rabbits femur tibia fibula
and later he tried to retrieve the
titanium chamber from the from the
rabbits food but he couldn't able to
retrieve then he came to know that the
the entire titanium has been hacia
integrated or integrated with the bone
rabbits bone so that it's it's become
difficult for the titanium Chamba to
retrieve so that he applied the same
concept on to the humans as well and
introduced the titanium implants so
let's let's go to the basics about the
titanium implant ology why implants
there are a variety of options to
replace the missing missing tooth like
removable partial denture fixative
partial mention but why but why the
implantology
came to the implants came to the
existence because it's difficult to
maintain the removable partial denture
and they tend to dislodge and all there
are many difficulties with the
maintenance as well so the removable
partial denture has been replaced by the
fixed partial denture the what's the
problem fixed partial denture is - to
replace missing - they decent natural
teeth has to be cutted - to make a
bridge or it so the natural tooth has
been damaged to make to replace a
missing tooth
so these are the variety of implications
of implants one is crown in a single and
a single missing teeth you can introduce
the implant into the bone and then place
a crown over the implant this is called
this called as crown and bridge as well
this is the implant supported an hour
denture I mean like the root supported
root supported our denture we can in
their complete a dental patients we can
place implants into the bone and with
the help of those implants we can place
an entire denture or that these called
as implants upward or danger before
going in detail in detail into the
implantology it's very important to know
about the bone DIMMs types of bone bone
densities what is d1 d2 d3 d4 and where
it is present it's most important
critically both clinically and
theoretically it's the most important
thing to learn it is it is given by mish
in 1988 so there are four types of bone
densities called as d1 d2 d3 and d4 and
the density is measured industry of the
d1 d2 d3 d4 has been measured with the
houseful Union hit house where units
that is achieved in d1 bone there is a
dense cortical bone as you see there is
a dense cortical bone with minimal
cancellous bone if at all this is a
cancerous one that is this minimal
cancerous wound present in here in the
the most common location of the presence
of d1 bonus anterior mandible so d1 bone
it's dense cortical bone with very less
with very minimal cortical bone so
cancerous boom Leeds prison in anterior
mandible and the house failure is
greater than one two five zero twelve
thousand and twelve hundred and fifty
house fire units d2 boonies there is a
porous cortical bone
cortical bone is prison this is not as
thick as in the d1 but there is a porous
cortical bone and but the cancellous
bone is present which is course and
trabecular the cancerous bone Troezen
dissecans
spoon isn't indeed ooh the the cancerous
wound is very the Trebek relations of
the canister spoon is very coarse and
the outer court this is a cortical plate
definitely there is a cortical world
plate but it won't be as thick as in the
d1 the cortical plate is a little bit
poorest most common locations are
sometimes anterior mandible posterior
mandible and sometimes antyram Xillia
might contain d2 bone mandible anterior
mandible and posterior mandible and the
anterior maxilla might contain the d2
bone as well
most commonly the posterior mandible is
considered to have d2 bone sometimes I
until maxilla also the HH units 850 to
1250 it's the rain between eight five
zero two one two five zero housefull
units let's come to d3 in d3 there is a
cortical plate see as you see this
cortical plate but very thin cortical
plate the cart will listen here is very
thin and between the cortical plates
there is a cancellous bone as you see
as you see in d2 the cancellous bone
prison is very coarse and dense but in
d3 the and the cancellous bone is not
course but they're very fine trabecula
prison they are not densely compact as
indeed ooh they're very thin comp thin
cortical plate the cancellous bone is
very porous and very thin most common
locations of posterior mandible and
anterior maxilla most commonly aunt is
maxilla
posterior mandible and posterior
mandible posterior maxilla the HU units
are 350 to 850 it's very important to
learn this d1 1 to 5 greater than 1 2 5
0 D to 850 to 1250 d3 350 to 850 and d4
DeForest the cortical billets are very
thin very fine the there's very fine
particle played with in between the
Carter people's there is a cancerous
bone cancelable very fine very fine yes
you see yes you compare this this
cancellous bone is very compact elitism
there's less compact this very fine
trabecular portion of prism there is
present in posterior maxilla the height
units are 130 150 to 350 it's very
important to learn this d1 1 greater
than 1250 d-28 52 or 53 350 to 850 and
d4 5150 to 350 and e1 is most commonly
visit an anterior mandible d2 in
posterior mandible anterior mandible and
anterior maxilla d3 is posterior and
anterior and posterior mozilla d4 is
posterior maxilla
so why do we need to learn this d1 d2 d3
d4 what are the clinical implications
because if we place an implant in d4
bone they're very the driver the
cancerous bone is very fine it takes
lots of time to ask you integrate the
the and the placed implant if you played
any place an implant over here in d4
that is a posterior maxilla as the bone
is very thin and very fine revelations
are present it takes longer time to heal
then compared to d1 or d2 so according
to this d1 has to be considered as best
bone for the implant placement because
there is dense cortical plane there very
very thin cancerous born very very
strong very strong bone is present in d1
hence it should be the implant plane the
success of implant placement is better
with the d1 bone but the most of the
implant success is present with d2 boom
d2 bone has highest success rate because
as there is a decent amount of cortical
bone with very coarse cancerous boom
cancerous bone provides the cancellous
bone provides us with the best clarity
so that the implant uptake is very good
with d2 bone d2 bone gives us the map
indeed upon the middle maximal success
of implant placement because there is a
decent amount of cortical bone the
cortical bone with cancellous bone that
provides the vascularity and the
cancerous wound is not very fine are
very thin as in d3 or Defoe
but the cancellous bone is very coarse
the Traverse vascularity hence the
success is highest with d2 let's proceed
to this rooster is next so this is
important day only to d2 d3 d2 d3 d2
before
as like misclassifications over let's
let miss classic mish classification of
bone densities there's another
classification like like Amon job in aid
in 1985 quality one is compact money as
you see this is the compact bone there
is very homogeneous compact bone in
quality to there's a thick layer of
compact bone this is a compatible this
thick layer of compact bone surrounding
core of dense tan trabecular bone this
is a trabecular bone
I mean cancerous one it has dense
traffic relations with a thick layer of
compact bone as well but in third
quality quality three the cortical bone
is very thin as you see this there is a
this is a thickness of cortical bone
this is the thickness of forty law this
is the thickness of cortical bone
there's a very thin cortical bone
surrounding a trap cancer spoon with
dense trabeculae shion's calculations
are done so you see there's a density
evacuations and the bone strength is
favorable because the can stress bone is
present there is a minimum amount of
cortical bone there's a kinda stressful
but the cancerous portion bone has
density violations hence it is the
fabula is a travel strength this is a
one this is quality for yes you see
there's a very thin cortical bone thin
cortical bone there's a cannister spoon
but again the tribulations are of low
density very fine
very widely spaced rabbit relations are
present in the cancellous bone there is
a load in straightaway flyball hence
it's unfavorable
this is this one is this one is this one
is somewhat viable okay let's go into
the classifications how the implants are
classified as as we see previously
proves to straights
we classified the bones depending on
densities of bones amount of cortical
bone amount of cancellous bone between
the cancerous moon the trabeculae shins
the is
the final cause according to them the
bone has been classified the bone onto
which the implant has to be placed has
been has been classified now this is the
classification of implants based on
implant design implants can be classed
classified based on implant design
implant attachment mechanism is it's
called as histological
his philosophy in implant attachment
mechanism means the attachment between
the implants and the bone based on a
macroscopic design of the implant body
and the surface of the implant and the
type of the material with which the
implant has been made so this is the
classification based on implant design
it's one of the common classification
that I've been used see the in first one
is industrial industrial built into the
bone when I implant material has been
placed into the bone it's called as
industrial subperiosteal subperiosteal
here we are not placing the implants
into the bone but we are placing the
implants beneath the periosteum
transversal it means trends Austria we
are traversing the bone through and
through here in industry we are placing
the implant into the bone not through
and through but in trance Austria we are
placing the implant through and through
interim mucosal means just into the
mucosa then others in thick mucus are
present in flabby register now when
there is a then when we need sufficient
Anchorage we can place the implants into
the mucosa and take the Anchorage from
the mucosa
that's interim mucosa within industry
they are further three it can be classed
before the three types one is ramus
frame as you can see
this is that I must remain plan it looks
like ramus of the body
it looks like Rams of the body here and
plate like thing Aramis plate leg thing
isn't introduced into the sim faith in
the symphysis area it is called as Lamas
flame root for meals implant display the
shape of the implant is just like the
true blade from implants are present let
us see what are the blade film clips see
this is the blade from implant this is
the root form implant it just like the
root you placed into the bone it is like
a blade industrial it traverses only the
superior alveolar cortex and penetrates
into the middle Larry bone when we are
placing the implants this is the
superior alveolar cortex and between the
buccal and lingual core templates you
can see the medullary bone so you Travis
in one cortical bone into the middle
thirty-one alveolar cortex you are
traversing the albion cortex and
penetrating into the middle Larry boom
most commonly among the ramus form
implants nderstand the ramus found in
plants root from implants bed blade from
England among the among this three most
commonly used a root form implants let's
come to transosseous implants as I said
transosseous implants traverses both the
alveolar cortex if you see this is the
alveolar cortex and this is the lower
cortex it is penetrating from the lower
border onto the upper border it is
traversing through and through its
traversing from the lower border onto
the upper border
traversing both the AL Ural cortex and
the bed lo lo context the mo most
important thing most importantly acid
cushion is what is tab limb plants
transosseous implants are called as
apple implants like you see if you stay
pin it passes it enters from one side
and emerges out from the other side like
this hence it is called a stab limb
plants it penetrates the integer as I
said intelligent to imagine how pose
it's a type of entry using a site of
entries from base of the chin advantage
is most commonly when it is used most
commonly because these two can be used
as abutments for the immediate bench it
placement most commonly used as
immediate bench placement and function
okay next is superior Spillman's it's
not more not widely used implant but
this is a superior seal means we just
elevate the periosteum we made it we
make a framework according to the we
customize the framework I got him to the
bone form and we elevate the perience
team and place the the customized
implant design under the periosteum most
commonly used for implant supported our
dentures in our second classification
classification based on attachment
mechanism it's more of histological
I mean there are two kinds posture
integration and fibrous integration
osseointegration the most important
question is that also integration was
coined by brain mark he's considered as
father of implantology he coined the
term brain mark as I said in the second
slide while he placed some titanium
chamber into the rabbits tibiofibular
this there has been a very difficulty in
I removed the implant right that he
considered that as osseointegration the
term osseointegration the term has been
coined by brain mark the definition is
its direct contact between the bone and
the surface of the implant when you
place an implant into the bone
there is no intervening thing between
the bone and the implant the bone
directly contacts the implant and bone
are in direct contact without no
intervening tissue that's called as
osseointegration osseointegration
is considered to be a success of when
you place an implant it has to be also
integrated then only it can be called as
a success of the implant fibrous
reintegration or fibrous integration it
was proposed by this concept of fibrous
integration as proposed by Charles
Hollis vase unlike in the unlike you see
in the Asha integration there has been
intervening tissue this is the bone this
is the bone and this is this is an
implant material between the implant
material in the bone you could see some
fiber like things present there is no
direct contact between the bone and the
implant this called as fibrous
integration this is this is not
considered to be a success of the
implant
there has been soft issues present
between the bone and implant this is not
considered to be a success because
whenever there is a direct contact
between the bone and implant they there
won't be any mobility of implant or the
long period of time but when there is a
soft tissue intervening between this
there are chances that implant might
mobile might get mobile implant might
get failure implant might get might not
be able to take the occlusal loads
larger amount of occlusal loads in the
posterior mandibular areas and out so
it's considered not considered to be a
success it is considered to be success
see this is the bone this is the bone
and this is the implant there is no
intervening tissue between the implant
and the implant and the bone this is
called as osseointegration this is
fibers integration it's given by Charles
waves
Charles waves it's not considered to be
a success there is a soft tissue
interface between the bone and the
implant just like the presidental
five-person of the natural deal
