businesses this is called B2B marketing
which is business to business marketing
for example a company that makes office
equipment sells it to other companies
which is quite different from B Toc that
is business to Consumer where businesses
sell directly to individual customers

started so first let's start with a
question why LinkedIn for B2B lead
generation well if you're new to the
term B2B stands for business to business
this means your company sells products
or Services directly to other businesses
and not individual consumers like in b2c
which is business to consumer marketing
so in B2B marketing the the buying
process is longer and more complex a key
difference is that B2B decisions often
involve multiple stakeholders from
different departments such as it Finance
or HR in fact research shows that three
to 4.6 groups can influence a purchase
decision this complexity makes
relationship building and Trust
extremely important now let's understand
why LinkedIn a state of B2B marketing
report reveals that 89 % of B2B
marketers use LinkedIn for lead
generation and 62% say that it delivers
more leads than any other social
platform why because LinkedIn gives you
direct access to decision makers and
provide tools to Target them precisely
now let's talk about optimizing your
LinkedIn profile think of your profile
as your personal brand storefront it's
often the first place prospects will
look before deciding to connect or
engage with you here's how you can make
your profile stand out at first you have
to use SEO friendly headlines use
keywords that your target audience is
searching for for example if you're a
data analytics expert include data
analyst or data scientist in your
headline second you should have
professional visuals according to
LinkedIn statistics profiles with
professional headshot receives 14 times
more profile views then you should have
credibility building summaries include
case study testimonials and even
relevant accomplishment to Showcase your
expertise but why does it even matter
because SEO or search engine
optimization impacts your profile on
LinkedIn profiles with right keywords
and quality content appear higher in
search results which increases your
chances of being found by decision
makers data from LinkedIn shows that
optimizing your profile boost visibility
by 30% which leads to more meaningful
connections and ultimately more more
sales now let's dive into one of the
linkedin's most powerful tools which is
sales Navigator but what exactly is
sales Navigator it's a premium LinkedIn
feature that helps you find connect with
and manage potential leads through
advanced filters and targeted search
capabilities for example if you want to
Target marketing agencies you can filter
your search by industry company size job
title and even location this is what we
call targeted marketing which allows you
to focus on specific group that's most
likely to benefit from your services for
example you can Target a list of
marketing agencies in the US with 11 to
50 employees and sales Navigator will
generate a list of prospects that
matches your criteria ensuring you only
reach out to qualified leads and by
doing this you're not wasting time on
prospects who are in a good fit targeted
marketing with sales Navigator helps you
streamline your out reach and increases
your conversion rates so once you've
built your list using sales Navigator
it's time to send out connection
requests but here's the crucial tip
always personalize your connection
request why because generic messages
like let's connect don't stand out
instead mention something specific about
the person like hi I noticed we shared a
passion for digital marketing I would
love to connect and exchange ideas it
just take few seconds but it
dramatically increases is your chances
of getting a response so this is how you
can send personalized connection request
now let's talk about crafting your first
message direct response versus
conversion starters so once your
connection request is accepted it's time
to send your first message there are two
common approaches first is direct
response messaging and second is
conversion starters so direct response
messaging means getting straight to the
point like hi I help businesses like
yours increase Revenue through effective
marketing strategies let's schedu a call
to discuss how we can collaborate so
this approach works well if you know the
prospect that has a specific need
alternatively you could use a
conversation starter to warm up the
prospect like for example hi I came
across a recent LinkedIn post about
digital marketing Trends I would love to
hear your thoughts on how you see the
industry evolving this software approach
encourages dialogue and help build
report before making a business business
pitch now let's talk about building
trust with thought leadership and
content one of the most effective ways
to build trust on LinkedIn is by sharing
thought leadership but what is thought
leadership it's when you position
yourself as an authority in your field
by sharing valuable insights articles or
industry Trends a study shows that 75%
of the buyers use thought leadership to
short list potential vendors this means
that more valuable content you share the
more Trust to build with your audience
post articles videos or case studies
that demonstrate your expertise and
address your audience's pain points when
done right your leadership turns into

free value lead magnets and the catch so
when engaging prospects on LinkedIn
always lead with value offer something
for free whether it's an article a white
paper or a webinar this is known as lead
magnet and the catch here is your lead
magnet should solve a pressing problem
for your audience if your content
addresses their key challenges they'll
be more likely to engage further using
matched audiences and leer targeting so
using this featured this will allow you
to retarget website visitors to use your
email list to create customized and
campaigns Mas audiences can
significantly improve your lead
generation by serving ads to people who
have already shown interest in your
business like those who visited your
website but didn't convert you can also
ler additional filters as job functions
seniority and location to Target the
Right audience so what is linkedin's
matched audiences feature well Linkin in
matched audiences is a powerful
advertising tool that help businesses
Target the right people using data from
their own sources like customer
databases or marketing platforms example
me gim it's designed to help companies
retarget website visitors advertise
their contacts and find New Leads that
are similar to their current customers
which is ideal for B2B companies which
is looking to reach decision makers now
how does matched audiences work there
are three main points first we have
website targeting which means to
retarget LinkedIn users who have visited
specific pages on your website then we
have content targeting which means
uploading email list or connect your CRM
to create an audience based on your
contacts then we have account targeting
which means targeting specific companies
by uploading a list and reaching
decision makers within those
organization why is it effective because
matched audiences help your tailor ads
to reach people which are most likely
engage with your business for example
let's retarget visitors who explored
your site or Target similar leads based
on your data now let's talk about how to
use website targeting at first you have
to add linkedin's insight to your
website to track visitors then you need
to create a retargeting audience based
on the pages they visit this will let
your audience build and begin showing
ads once you have reached 300 visitors
so matched audiences is a powerful way
to retarget visitors and contacts
ensuring you're always reaching the most
relevant leads as your lead generation
effort grows you may want to scale up
adding more LinkedIn profiles perhaps
for your employees to expand your
Outreach just be careful with LinkedIn
automation tools and overuse can need to
generic messaging personalization is
still key even when scaling now let's
talk about how do you reach multiple
stakeholders and how you can gain
residence with the buying committee so
in today's B2B last landcape multiple
stakeholders from different departments
influence purchase decisions for
instance the ID Department might be
concerned with security while Finance
looks at Cost customizing your messaging
to resonate with different departments
and ensure your address their specific
concern this approach is crucial for B2B
marketers and influencing the entire
business committee increasing your
chances and closing the date finally
let's talk about measuring your reserves
using linkedin's conversion tracking
which allows you to see how your ads are
performing and which leads are
converting using AB testing to
experiment with different messaging
headlines and calls to action and
continuously optimizing your campaigns
Bas based on the data to get the best
possible results so let me break down
these terms in simple English AB testing
means this is like running a small
experiment with your ads to create two
versions of the same ad each with small
difference like a different headline or
message then you show these versions to
two different groups of people to see
which one works better it's a way to
test and find out which gets more clicks
or leads so once you know which version
performs better you can focus on using
that one then we have LinkedIn
conversion tracking this is a tool that
helps you see how well your ads are
doing it shows how many people clicked
your ad and more importantly how many
actually took the action you wanted like
filling out a form or signing up for
something conversion tracking helps you
understand which ads are helping you get
new customers or leads and by using AB
testing you can test different ideas to
see which works the best and with
conversion tracking you can track
success of those ads to see how many
people are turning into leads or
customers and there you have it your
