the average salary of a data scientist
in the United States is around 83 000
dollars
the same for a web developer is around
78 000 so these figures came out in a
U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics report
so are you also considering choosing a
career between the two most booming
categories in the IT industry in 2023
and still struggling to choose one well
here I am with a new video of Simply
learn on web development or data science
that will help you gain perspective
towards building your career in any of
the two Fields but before we begin with
the courses if you enjoy watching these
videos and finding them interesting
please subscribe to our Channel because
we bring the best videos for you daily

whenever we drop a new video so let's
have a look at what we are going to
discuss in this video we'll start this
video with
then we'll see the future scope of data
science and web development we'll also
discuss the salaries you can expect in
any of these fields moving ahead we'll
see how simply learn can help you master
both fields and back the job of your
dream so let's start with what is data
science data science is an
interdisciplinary field that utilizes
computational and statistical methods to
extract insights from data its
applications are widespread ranging from
predicting consumer Behavior to
developing new Medical Treatments with
the explosive growth of Big Data data
science has emerged as one of the most
exciting and rapidly evolving fields of
the 21st century web development on the
other hand involves building and
maintaining websites and web
applications its activities include
front-end development back-end
development server Administration and
database management with the internet
being a crucial part of our daily lives
web development has become highly sought
after skill in the tech industry due to
to the ever increasing demand for
Innovative and engaging web experiences
talking about the future scope of both
the Technologies can help you enter the
right field data science applications
involve using statistical and machine
learning techniques to gain insights
from data and make predictions or
decisions based on those insights some
of the key Fields where data science
plays a vital role are artificial
intelligence and machine learning the
development and application of AI and
machine learning algorithms which allow
intelligent systems to learn from data
and make judgments will greatly benefit
from data science internet of things as
the quantity and complexity of iot
devices increase data science will
assist businesses in making sense of the
massive volumes of data these devices
generate enabling them to streamline
operations and provide better goods and
service Healthcare organizations in the
industry will be able to analyze patient
data spot Trends and patterns and create
individualized treatment programs with
the aid of data science in other words
we can say that wherever a huge amount
of data is available data science is
important in that particular field
so are these applications enough to
choose data science as your future
career if not then the salaries of data
scientists might Amaze you although
there are several job roles present in
the field of data science like data
scientists data analysts data Engineers
business analysts and many but something
that will Amaze you is according to
glassdo the national average salary of a
data scientist is 12 lakhs per year in
India with additional cash benefits
depending on the companies hiring you
the average salary of the same data
scientist in the United States can go up
to 104 000 annually with additional cash
compensations so let's also look at the
future scope of web development
artificial intelligence AI is becoming
more important in web development as
businesses implemented to simplify the
process and reap its benefits web
developers need AI knowledge to create
customized development and predict
future requirements web assembly
webassembly is a low level byte code in
enabling high performance web
applications running near native speeds
it will become an essential tool for web
developers as web applications continue
to grow in complexity voice interface
development web developers must develop
voice interfaces to enable users to
interact with websites and web
applications using voice commands as
voice assistants become more prevalent
this requires understanding of natural
language processing and voice user
interface Design This is the future of
web development talking about the job
roles in the field of web development
there are different types of job
offering like front-end web developer
back-end web developer full stack
developer and UI ux design and many more
other jobs but according to glassdo web
developer gets an average salary of 5
lakhs per annum in India while the
average salary of a senior web developer
in the United States can go up to 104
000 annually with additional cash
compensations the salary numbers are
just average salaries for data
scientists and web developers exceptions
are everywhere so you can earn more than
this now that you have a good idea about
