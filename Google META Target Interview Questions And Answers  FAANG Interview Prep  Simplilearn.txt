if you are looking to land an interview
with Google you're going to need to
prepare yourself beforehand by doing
some research into their interview
process and the types of questions they
ask potential employees we have done the
research and compiled the requisite
information for you in this guide this
comprehensive list of the top 40 plus
Google interview questions has been
updated and expanded with the most
researched and ingenuous answers also
make sure you brush up on your interview
skills by practicing these sample
questions before your big day
let's go through the topics to be
covered today we will start by going
through the interview process a
candidate can expect when applying for a
position at Google where we cover the
multiple rounds conducted in a regular
interview next we take a look at some
tips on how to answer the interview
questions put forth in an interview with
Google we then cover the top four Google
interview questions followed by 40 plus
questions with their explanations in
order to prepare you for the interview
let's get started by learning about the
interview process at Google Google
interview process after the application
is submitted the next step is a two-fold
process consisting of recruiter connect
and the standard interview rounds when
it comes to the recruiter connect the
recruiter can contact the candidate
based on his or her profiles on LinkedIn
and other employment oriented online
service providers or if any of his or
her friends or acquaintances have
referred him or her to the company
however it's all always best to message
the recruiters via LinkedIn and apply
for the roles on the career page of
Google if the candidate is good in DS
and algo skills it is highly recommended
that he or she participate in Google
Kickstart a hiring contest conducted by
Google six times a year the recruiters
will contact you if the results in those
competitions are good enough after the
recruiter contacts you the standard
interview rounds begin now when it comes
to the interview process Google conducts
a total of seven rounds of interviews
the first two are telephonic interviews
where the interviewer mostly asks one
medium or two easy algo DS problems to
the candidate and the candidate has 45
minutes to solve the problems however if
kickstart's performance is a success you
move straight to the next round next
they have five on-site interviews out of
which four are algo DS interviews and
one is a googleness interview which
which is mostly a behavioral interview
so let's cover the basic part of the
interview
there are two 45-minute telephonic calls
during which the interviewer asks you to
solve either a medium problem or two
easy problems from a list of algorithms
and DS questions it is expected that the
candidate first explains the solution of
the problem to the interviewer and then
codes the problem on Google Docs in the
given duration of time regarding the
data structure and algorithms rounds
these are 45-minute interviews where the
interviewer shares a Google doc with the
candidate and asks medium to hard
problems about algorithms and DS it is
expected that the candidate first
explains the solution of the problem to
the interviewer and then codes the
problem on Google Docs within the given
time frame finally there is a round to
check the Google lines of a candidate
this is an interview process started by
Google in 2020 the goal is to check for
cultural compatibility with the company
as much as interviewing skills it is
primarily a behavior interview to check
the adaptability of a candidate to the
diverse cultural environment of the
company
one of the drawbacks of this hiring
procedure is that such challenging
questions can throw candidates off their
game and they may fail miserably
answering such questions can be
exhausting however even though it might
help fetch suitable candidates to a few
hiring authorities there is no evidence
that these bizarre hypothetical
interview questions actually identify
capable applicants which is why they are
not in practice today let's look at the
strategy you can follow to sail through
the interview process how to answer even
if you're only going to be asked normal
interview questions you shouldn't go in
without a strategy especially when your
goal is to impress the interviewer start
by looking at the job description to
understand what the hiring manager will
be looking for this will ensure you give
all the pertinent information in your
interview then review the company's
Mission and value statements to learn
more about the organization including
its priorities and perspective and
finally look at Google tools profiles
for company news about recent
accomplishments or do a quick news
search for more details if you can
discuss new developments with the hiring
manager during an interview there's a
good chance the interviewer will be
impressed okay now you've got some great
material to work with moving forward how
do you answer the simple straightforward
questions
well straightforward questions can be
answered with a simple yes or no to
demonstrate for example if the hiring
manager wants to know if you have a
skill reply with yes or no followed by
telling them how you acquired or used
that skill if your answer is no or you
know little of that skill explain that
you're making an effort to improve in
that area now how to handle those tricky
interview questions the ones that don't
have a right or a wrong answer the key
here is to adopt the right strategy
follow the star method which is a
structured manner of responding to
behavioral based interview questions by
discussing a specific situation and
providing information about the task
action and outcome of the situation but
add in the tailoring method and then
make your answers specific to the
interview to maximize your chances of
getting selected the tailoring method is
essentially a way to customize your job
interview to align exclusively with a
specific company and position you are
seeking now that we understand the
mental approach on how to tackle these
questions let us go through some of the
questions asked in Google interviews
going through the following will
definitely help you in preparing for the
final rounds be it for a technical role
or business facing questions it's
important to note that the Google
interview questions you face will vary
depending on the position what is being
interviewed for for instance a software
engineer will not be asked the same set
of questions as an HR professional
however certain common questions can
apply to almost any subject or career so
let's start off with some basic
questions and move on to the more
intricate ones number one
what Google product do you use the most
and how can you fix it
this is a question to assess how much
you know about Google's offerings the
answer you give doesn't matter as long
as you talk about the company with
excitement and say how it's changed your
life somehow
a sample answer can be I use YouTube to
find new ideas gain skills and explore
new subjects While others use it to
promote their work to provide more
customization to the users I would
Implement an option to say how the video
recommendations are affected by each
video the overload problem may be solved
depending on the feedback that the
YouTube Community wants
number two who are Google's top
competitors and does Google stand out
from the rest
with this question the hiring manager
can tell if you are familiar with the
other companies who are vying for the
same position as Google and give you a
fair opportunity to mention your
relevant strengths this can be
specifically helpful for more creative
or experimental roles such as product
managers or software developer jobs or
demonstrating how you are more
experienced or better is important
Google's competitors vary depending on
the market Google has the ability to
seamlessly integrate its services into
one user experience in addition Google
offers a variety of services making it
versatile and easy to avoid leaving the
website to accomplish a task
number three
how do you go about ensuring that your
co-workers are doing what they need to
do
accountability is an integral factor for
Employers in the eyes of Google you want
to make sure that you take on your
responsibilities and live up to the
company's expectations a hiring manager
May favor candidates who can also help
their co-workers stay accountable
especially if the company expects a lot
of group projects
a sample answer can be for me
accountability is always a priority one
of the things I do to stay accountable
is to track all of my deliverables and
Associated due dates a list is how I
stay organized create notifications and
block out time on my calendar as
necessary ensuring I can focus on the
task and finish on time when projects
are larger I also employ the use of many
Milestones which helps me explore the
step-by-step process and plan more
effectively working with my co-workers I
find that keeping in touch is often
helpful now this can be in the form of
scheduling team meetings to discuss our
progress or bouncing ideas back and
forth additionally I try to contact them
periodically to check if they need
anything or offer assistance if they
appear to be falling behind number four
have you ever done something
professionally risked a lot and failed
what was it what made you take the risk
and what did you take away from it
Google seems to love Innovation and with
Innovation comes risks so when Google
finds a creative person it is
appreciative and respectful of the
courage to do something no one else
would there should be something to help
that next effort succeed in future
endeavors
now let's go over some other important
questions that you may face when
applying for a job at Google
more interview questions
number five what Drew you to Google in
the first place
the presence of free food and the
ability to bring your pet to the
Googleplex isn't what you want to do
here although it is a very important
factor to some instead discuss how your
skills mesh with what Google is looking
for what the company offers and the
specific job you're applying for now
this is your chance to show that you are
the right person for the job and
understand the company
Google always releases new devices and
apps your skill as an app developer
could be of assistance to this group
tell them that you would like to get
together with the team and discuss how
you can be of help
number six
what is your knowledge of Google's
history
headquartered in Mountain View
California Google LLC formerly Google
incorporated from 1998 to 2017 is an
American company that develops produces
and distributes software in diverse
technological domains with more than 70
percent of worldwide online search
requests being handled by Google it is
essential to most internet users
experience
at first Google just focused on its
search function but now it offers a
multitude of products such as email
document creation software and more
however 2012's acquisition of Motorola
Mobility enabled it to sell its own
Hardware as well
Google's wide range of products size and
influence on the high-tech Market makes
it one of the four largest companies
alongside Apple IBM and Microsoft yet
its Search tool is its core product that
drives its success
Google earned all of its Revenue in 2016
from advertisements based on people's
search requests
number seven
in your opinion should people have to
use their legal names when setting up a
Gmail account
although it is required by Google you
don't need to use your real name or the
Google username of your choice to
complete this profile you can put your
nickname make sure it sounds authentic
like a first name and you should be all
set
number eight what changes do you think
digital marketing will undergo in the
next five years
it is difficult to predict how digital
marketing will change in the next five
years but it will most likely be more
integrated into our daily lives digital
marketing is already widespread in most
countries and it's not going anywhere
anytime soon with the popularity of
smartphones and other mobile devices
users are spending a large percentage of
their time online and on mobile apps
instead of watching TV or reading
magazines like they used to as such
advertisers are quickly adapting to the
way people consume information on the go
number nine
how would you explain this Google
product to a young person say a
four-year-old
this is a complicated test that can seem
impossible when you are not well
prepared chances are the interviewer
will ask you questions about Google
products connected to the job you are
applying for so focus on those know how
the product works what it does and
whether you understand it well enough if
you understand it well enough you should
be able to rephrase it enough so a
four-year-old can understand
well do you know how we pay the cashier
at the grocery store for our food well
it's easier than ever to use my phone to
pay the cashier with Google pay my bank
account is directly connected to the
purchase so I don't have to worry about
leaving my card behind
number 10. what do you think of Google
charging for their productivity apps do
you agree or disagree a sample answer
can be I disagree with Google charging
for their productivity apps by charging
for these apps it will be difficult for
them to get a large user base as not
everyone is willing to pay for software
many users use these apps every day as
part of their jobs and don't want to pay
money for them by charging these fees
they may see a decrease in their users
or they may even lose potential
customers due to high prices
number 11. share a detail about yourself
that you haven't put on your resume
hiring managers often use interview
questions like these to see how quickly
you think on your feet and to get a
sense of your personality be ready to
describe something unique about yourself
that isn't listed on your resume or in
any other documents you've provided
avoid getting flustered and struggling
for words but also be careful not to
oversell yourself or give off a false
impression for example if you say you
can juggle flaming bowling pins while
riding a unicycle hiring managers might
want to know why that skill is relevant
to their business
and here's a Hint it probably isn't
number 12. can you give me an example of
a time when you and your manager were at
odds how did you two finally come to an
agreement
a sample answer can be I once disagreed
with my boss about a decision that would
have cost the company a lot of money it
was about how we were going to handle
our Facebook advertising and I suggested
a solution that saved the company about
a grand I wrote up a document with my
plan and emailed it to him asking if we
could discuss in person
he loved the idea so we went with it and
it ended up working out wonderfully
number 13 what does multi-threaded
programming mean
a multi-threaded program is an
executable program with multiple
execution threads each running on its
own processor
sometimes there could be multiple
threads running simultaneously on
multiple processor cores
number 14. could you briefly explain
AdWords to someone who's unfamiliar with
the product and online advertising
Google ads is an online advertising
platform used by companies to promote
their products and services on Google
search YouTube and other sites with
Google ads companies can also specify
what kind of traffic they want the ads
to generate with a Google ads account
advertisers can customize their budgets
and targeting and start or stop their
ads at any time this question tests
whether you can articulate a complicated
business issue and solve someone's
problem it's not about how much you know
but how well you can communicate it to
someone else
number 15 if you were told to create an
initiative to increase Gmail's user base
what would you do
if you were in charge of marketing Gmail
how would you go about getting more
people to start using it
well this type of question is designed
to see if you can formulate a strategy
on your feet
show them that you can brainstorm and
execute strategies give an example of a
time when you increase your team's sales
numbers or user base by X percent
through a particular initiative it could
be a real situation or something
hypothetical just make sure it's
relevant
number 16 describe a time when you faced
a technical problem how did you fix it a
sample answer can be working in my
current position I often get to call
customers on the phone and fill orders
through the company system however on
one particular day the system went down
and there were more than 100 callers
waiting to place their orders initially
it was difficult but then I realized
that there were a number of things I
could do to help with the problem I
contacted our customers and reassured
them that we were doing everything in
our power to assist them I spoke to as
many customers as I could so they were
on top of the priority list and their
wait time would be shorter I also stayed
sincere and helpful and told them the
truth our system was down momentarily I
have always enjoyed telling our
customers the truth about their service
when it hasn't been perfect and I love
taking the initiative to get to the
bottom of messy situations when my
managers have left me in charge I am
very eager to tell your customers about
your wonderful product should there be a
time when your system is temporarily
inaccessible number 17 let me know three
non-google sites that you'd like to
visit what do you like about them
Google has developed a reputation for
asking brain teasers that don't actually
provide much insight into candidates and
know your answers shouldn't mention
Turing machines or anything like that
still Google is interested in knowing
how you think remember to describe your
reasons and back them up with examples
from your experience and knowledge your
answer might be straightforward for
instance you can say you like CNN
because you always know what's going on
in the world and you love sites like
Facebook because it lets you connect
with friends whatever you choose make
sure to stick with it Google will ask
follow-up questions about why you said
what you said number 18 how do cookies
Move Along through the HTTP protocol
a cookie is transmitted as part of an
HTTP protocol via a header field cookie
lifecycle the first time a browser
connects with a particular server there
are no cookies the server creates a
unique identifier and returns a set
cookie header in the response that
contains the identifier
number 19 what is the function of
congestion control in TCP protocol
to prevent congestion or mitigate
congestion after it has occurred the TCP
protocol incorporates congestion control
mechanisms in contrast to the sliding
window used in the flow control
mechanism TCP uses the congestion window
maintained by the center
number 20. if an Advertiser doesn't see
the benefit of AdWords due to poor
conversions how would you convince them
to stay on board
if conversion rates are low I'd first
try to work out why usually the client's
website is the problem in cases like
this my approach to this is pretty
straightforward I can either sell them a
new website or improve their existing
one on the other hand I can make a
landing page with a tool like unbounce
to see if we get any leads or make sales
it only really works for lead generation
not e-commerce
you can test if your conversion tracking
is actually working and make sure you're
tracking every conversion you can
contact forms sales phone conversions
Etc
sometimes a client may not see any
benefit even though conversions are
happening as they're not being tracked
you need to show them how successful
your AdWords campaigns are in other
words AdWords is only an issue when it
is related to converting views present
them with numbers such as time on site
the number of pages visited and bounce
rate but do it with an idea of what the
problem is and how to fix it let the
client know that you spotted a potential
problem and gave them a potential
solution even if it's just a test
number 21
pick an app on your phone's home screen
what do you like about it what do you
dislike about it
I would like to share my opinion on my
app ifitness which has a home screen I
like that it is simple and easy to use
while having multiple features but there
are many things I dislike about it such
as having to pay every month even if you
do not use all of its features the app
is also very complex and takes up a lot
of memory on my phone making it longer
for my phone to boot up
number 22 what steps could YouTube take
to improve its business model
YouTube is currently a free platform for
users and makes money primarily through
advertisements YouTube could possibly
create paid accounts for users who wish
to avoid ads another option would be to
offer users pay-per-view videos and
exclusive content only available with a
subscription
number 23 describe a time when you were
faced with adversity how did you
overcome it
a sample answer can be my former
employer put me through an Excel
training course that I flunked it was
too challenging I soon realized I
shouldn't have started with an advanced
level course I brought up this issue
with my boss and we both came to the
conclusion that I wasn't quite ready for
advanced level coursework I am not a
skilled user but I have used computers a
lot to solve the problem I studied
online for a few weeks and then took up
the course again when I was better
prepared this approach was much more
successful as I not only managed to
complete it I secured 92 percent number
24 could you explain why the Google home
page is mostly blank
in the wake of annoying pop-ups and
advertisements the Google Founders have
made it simple for the users which
ultimately led to a better interface
number 25
in layman's terms how would you explain
the balance sheet to someone who isn't
familiar with accounting principles
a balance sheet is a simple one-page
financial statement showing what you own
and what you owe they're simple to
create and comprehend on one side it
lists what your business owns while the
other side lists how much debt you owe
as well as how much of the company you
own the info on a balance sheet will
give you your lenders and your investors
a brief overview of your company's
current fiscal Health that is when you
need to take your company's temperature
a balance sheet is your thermometer
number 26 how would you assure a
hesitant client that making the move to
a Cloud solution is the right thing to
do you'd want to understand what's
specifically about a Cloud solution is
causing them to be hesitant you'd also
want to gain an understanding of how it
would impact their operations as well as
any potential security or compliance
concerns most importantly you'd want to
establish a clear course of action that
will help your client make peace with
moving forward with a Cloud solution
solution and ensure that they fully
understand how and why such a move will
benefit them in the long term number 27.
what is Google's largest concern right
now
for a while now Microsoft has been
Google's biggest threat it has had a
tough time making gains in the PC market
but is still firmly entrenched in the
office space industries that Google is
aggressively trying to compete in
include technology business gaming and
the cloud if Microsoft's phones can be
significantly upgraded they may have the
ability to outperform Google in various
areas to note Google's greatest
competitor in advertising at this point
is Facebook while Microsoft is their
main competitor in search with a spot at
the number two position with significant
gains as is the case with many
android-based phones Android companies
have moved away from using Android due
to their disdain for the way that Google
dictates their product choosing to
launch their own alternative software
number 28. given an auto suggest issue
in a developing country what steps would
you take to correct it
a few steps in resolving an auto suggest
issue for searches in a developing
country would include number one
identify keywords that are being
searched frequently in your country and
then test those out for feasibility as
suggested Search terms by watching live
Auto suggest results testing out a
potential abbreviations and Etc
number two try to find similar countries
or regions where you can test it first
before launching it on a larger scale
number 29
tell me about an area where you believe
Google is under invested
if you work for Google it's a pretty
safe bet that they are already investing
heavily in social media but even if you
don't your job is to be able to pinpoint
areas where Google is under invested and
potentially could use some extra help
for example if you believe Facebook has
been expanding into YouTube territory by
producing engaging videos and therefore
has a potentially lucrative Revenue
stream at its fingertips then explain
why number 30. tell me about an area
where you think Google is over invested
just as the question before your answer
should follow the same formula replace
under invested with over invested
number 31.
share a time when a project had expanded
beyond what was originally anticipated
this is an open-ended question that you
should handle carefully while it is good
to be honest you don't want to come
across as arrogant by saying something
like your project was so important that
they couldn't ignore it instead you
should simply say something like it was
clear early on that we had far more work
than we had initially anticipated
the key thing to remember is that there
are always unexpected issues in any
given project when faced with a
situation where there is more work than
anticipated your response will help
determine whether or not you are viewed
as someone who can take charge of a
situation and ensure things get done or
if you're someone who cannot effectively
manage time and resources a good answer
would acknowledge their concern while
also reassuring them that even though
there were challenges everything worked
out in the end
number 32. what can I discover about
your personality by checking your
browser history
some of these questions may seem odd or
irrelevant but remember that
interviewers are trying to get a sense
of your personality many candidates have
failed not because they couldn't answer
questions about technology and data
structures but because they lack social
skills that is being a team player while
there isn't really any right answer for
these questions it helps to be
personable and show your Human Side
through examples that you come up with
off the cuff for example if asked if you
open your browser history what will they
learn about your personality one answer
could be that you spend a lot of time on
Facebook you like connecting with
friends and family but if they look at
your LinkedIn profile instead they might
see that your interests revolve around
artificial intelligence when you were
younger you wanted to work at IBM
research
number 33
share a story with me about when you had
to handle confusing circumstances
all of us have to handle confusing
circumstances at work it's important to
remember that you don't have to come up
with a solution on your own in such
situations instead you can seek help
from colleagues and mentors
if you have an opportunity to work at
Google or other huge technology
companies then it's very important to
prepare such questions beforehand
number 34 let me ask you something what
do you enjoy doing outside of work
the idea behind this type of interview
is to have a more conversational style
One Way interviewers can get a sense of
who you are and what matters most to you
is by asking you about something in your
life that isn't related to work you may
discuss what matters to you the most in
life you may speak about your family
non-profit or a favorite sports team
share with others not just what you like
but also why it matters to you
why does it matter to you do you mind if
I ask why you care so much I'm curious
how it has influenced your career if you
had no fear of failure what would be
your dream job
some companies interview potential
candidates by asking them what they
would do if they weren't afraid of
taking risks and didn't fear trying new
things because they want people who are
cautious Risk Takers and can take up
challenging assignments
number 35. tell me a time when you had
to sell or propose a solution to an
engineering or stakeholder team
a sample answer can be I had a code base
that I inherited from another developer
it was unmaintainable because it was a
confusing mess of spaghetti code many
developers were afraid to change it I
put together a presentation and shared
my plan for refactoring it with my team
and then made changes using pair
programming so we could all learn
something new together afterward we work
through bugs collectively passing fixes
back and forth until our process became
smoother and more efficient
number 36 what's the maximum number of
golf balls that can fit in a school bus
school buses are enormous Vehicles often
reaching lengths of about 40 feet the
average school bus can hold about 56
students but how many golf balls could
fit in a school bus
in 1994 one person calculated that
approximately 34 million golf balls
could fit into a single school bus and
that's not just a guess he had actually
measured it at least two were inside
each seat and another 16 were scattered
in every square foot of the floor space
as well
number 37 between learning and earning
which one do you enjoy more
a sample answer can be I enjoy learning
and I'd rather focus on being more
career oriented than money-minded as I
feel that that's how you become more
qualified at what you do knowledge will
lead to wisdom and a deeper
understanding of what you are doing
now we will cover some of the questions
that you can ask at the end of an
interview getting Clarity regarding the
job profile is highly important for your
career and prospective decisions moving

professionally if you don't dress
appropriately for an interview you give
the impression that you lack respect for
yourself and those you are meeting with
so don't forget to put on a formal dress
for your Target interview
documents before heading to the
interview keep your documents ready
carry your resume educational
certificates previous company experience
certificates and other necessary
documents it is also essential that you
carry photocopies of everything
in conclusion interviewing a Target
might feel like a difficult challenge
but remember no task is impossible at
Target all they are looking for is
confident people who have clear goals
and contribute efficiently to help grow
this brand hence make sure your
checklist includes all these points
always carry a resume that looks
interactive and engaging include your
qualifications and the courses you have
taken you must also mention the online
certification programs and training you
may have completed via online modes and
platforms you can easily crack any
interview with the right qualification
and the necessary skill set meta is a
social media Giant and Tech Powerhouse
it is estimated that 2.6 billion people
use the platform far more than any other
social networking site it's a dream
company for many graduates to work in
millions of people use the platform
daily which makes their employees work
work incredibly impactful you can be a
part of this too you just need to drive
in the right gear and reach the stop
practicing meta interview questions will
help you land your dream job at meta
many developers look to grab this
opportunity of working with a 52 000
strong Workforce since the competition
is fierce you'll have to prepare
everything for the interview from how to
answer questions to what are the answers
to the questions go through the
comprehensive meta interview questions
and the step-by-step preparation guide
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update so in this session you'll learn
about meta its interview process and the
top meta coding interview questions next
you will come across the technical
questions and finally you'll learn about
some tips for meta interview preparation
and at the ending we have FAQs before we
head to interview questions let's go
through the meta establishments
So Meta is one of the top social
networking sites globally created by
Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. it's an
American online social media site owned
by meta platforms which believes in
delivering change community building and
better growth it ranked fourth in global
internet usage in 2020 with around 2.8
billion monthly active users in 2010
meta became the most downloaded mobile
app many well-renowned computer experts
aim to get a job at meta because the
latter takes the matter of employment
benefits and perks seriously that makes
people think about how their lives will
be as software developers if they get a
job in meta and get the opportunity to
learn prosper and build an amazing
career for themselves
and here we have a simple question for
you guys when was Facebook launched 2006
2004 2003 or 2002 answer in the comments
section and we will update the correct
answer in the pinned comment
let's go through the key stats about
Meta Meta has raised more than 5 billion
dollars to support the causes they care
about they have inaugurated more than
one billion stores worldwide they have
more than 200 million connected
businesses who use their services and
they run a platform where more than 100
billion messages are sent every day
let's understand the meta interview
process
connect with HR the candidate's profile
or resume should directly connect with
HR further rounds take place once the
candidate passes the HR around
interview rounds meta conducts technical
behavioral and situational interview
rounds for various job positions there
are seven rounds the first two are
conducted over the phone and the rest
are taken on site candidates get to
interact with other employees in these
rounds to learn more about the company's
culture
post interview process the interviewers
judged the candidate based on their
resume and the interview conducted
another round may be conducted to
discuss the final call with the
candidate results if the candidate
successfully creates his first
impression and is selected the offer
letter is sent to him by the recruiter
with the understanding of the interview
process let's go through the interview
rounds
interview rounds phone screening HR
conducts two telephonic interviews the
initial call is to decide whether the
candidate is the right fit or Not by
asking them behavioral questions and the
second is the technical phone interview
where the candidate is supposed to
answer DS algo oriented questions a
coding or technical rounds there can be
four to five coding and Technical rounds
each interview round can last from 30 to
45 minutes the freshers are asked fewer
questions than the experienced ones to
judge their skills and abilities
another question for you guys which of
the listed platforms is acquired by meta
platforms Snapchat Instagram Tick Tock
or LinkedIn answer in the comments
section and we'll update the correct
answer in the pinned comment
now be ready to get started with the
coding questions
number one you're given a set of random
numbers write a code to shift all the
zeros to the left so let's see the
approach to solve the question create an
array ARR and store the numbers in it
now Traverse the given array ARR from
right to left while traversing maintain
count of non-zero elements in the array
let the count be count equals zero and
for every non-zero element arri put the
element at ARR n minus count and
increment count
after complete transversal all non-zero
elements have already been shifted to
the right and N minus count is set as
the index of first zero now all we need
to do is run a loop which makes all
elements Zero from count till end of the
array
number two write a code to merge
overlapping intervals
now let's see the approach to solve this
question here's the explanation given
intervals one three two four six eight
nine ten we have only two overlapping
intervals here one three and two four
therefore we will merge these two and
return one four six eight nine ten
a simple approach is to start from the
first interval and compare it with all
other intervals for overlapping if it
overlaps with any other interval then
remove the other interval from the list
and merge the other into the first
interval repeat the same steps for the
remaining intervals after the first this
approach cannot be implemented in better
than Big O of N squared time
number three you're given a binary tree
can you in place convert it into a
doubly linked list
let's see the approach to solve this
question this can be achieved by
traversing the tree in the in order
manner that is left the left child root
right node
transverse left subtree and convert it
into the doubly linked list by adding
nodes to the end of the list in this way
the leftmost node will become the head
of the list then convert the right
subtree into the doubly linked list
algorithm
Define a node class which represents a
node in the binary tree it will have
three properties data left and right
where the left and right represent two
children of a node root will represent
the root of the binary tree head and
tail node represent the head and tail of
the doubly length list
binary tree to dll will convert the
given binary tree to a corresponding
doubly linked list perform in-order
transversal of the binary tree by
converting the left subtree first
number four
can you print the given binary's tree
nodes level by level in other words
print all nodes of level 1 first then
level two and so on
level order transverse of a tree is
breadth first traversal for the tree a
simple solution is to print all nodes of
level 1 first followed by level 2 until
Level H where H is the tree's height
the basic solution to this is use
function to print a current level there
are basically two functions one is to
print all nodes at a given level print
current level and the other is to print
the level order traversal of the tree
print level order print level order
makes use of the print current level to
print nodes at all levels one by one
starting from the root
number five the sky is dark blue can you
reverse the order of the string
to do this we first calculate how many
words are present in the string then we
shift each word at the end of the string
to the left ensuring the words we
shifted already remain unaffected sounds
simple but no
first we shift the rightmost word by
shifting each letter in the word to the
left of the string now the tricky part
is handling the space after the word
blue we need to move the space at the
end of the string right after the word
for this we shift just once only within
the substring the sky is so the space at
the end of the stream moves before the
letter t once the word is shifted we
need to repeat the same process but only
for the substring the sky is
number six you were given four words
apple pear peer and pi
can this be completely segmented if yes
then how
you're given a dictionary of words and a
large input string you have to find out
whether the input string can be
completely segmented into the words of a
given dictionary you can solve this
problem by segmenting the large string
at each possible position to see if the
string can be completely segmented to
words in the dictionary if you write the
algorithm in steps it will be as follows
number seven
here is a list of daily stock prices
return the buy and sell prices to
maximize the profit
Max profit with at most two transactions
equals Max Max profit with one
transaction and sub-array price
0 to I plus Max profit with one
transaction and subarray price I plus 1
to n minus one I varies from 0 to n
minus one
number one create a table profit zero to
n minus one and initialize all values in
it zero number two transverse price from
right to left and update profit I such
that profit I stores maximum profit
achievable from one transaction in sub
array price I to n minus one number
three transverse price from left to
right and update profit I such that
profit I stores maximum profit such that
profit I contains maximum achievable
profit from two transactions in
sub-array price 0 to I and number four
return profit n minus one
those were some main recurring coding
questions from meta there's a set of
technical questions that are asked more
frequently let's start with them
number one how will you convert decimal
numbers between one to three nine nine
nine to Roman numerals also can you do
the reverse how
one thousand nine hundred five hundred
four hundred one hundred ninety fifty
forty ten nine five four one base value
which is just smaller or equal to the
given number will be the initial base
value or largest base value
divide the number by its largest base
value the corresponding base symbol will
be repeated quotient times the remainder
will then become the number for future
Division and repetitions the process
will be repeated until the number
becomes zero
number two can you find the triplets
whose sum is zero now here's the
approach the naive approach runs three
loops and check one by one that sum of
three elements is zero or not if the sum
of three elements is zero then print
elements otherwise print not found
the algorithm run three nested loops
with Loop counter i j k the first Loops
will run from zero to n minus three and
the second loop from I plus 1 to n minus
two and the third loop from J plus 1 to
n minus one the loop counter represents
the three elements of the triplet check
out the sum of elements at the ith jth
and kath is equal to zero or not if yes
print the sum else continue
number three what is the largest subset
whose elements are Fibonacci numbers a
simple solution is to iterate through
all elements of a given array for every
number check if it is Fibonacci or not
if yes add it to the result
number four calculate the maximum value
using the Plus or multiply sign between
two numbers in the given string the task
is pretty simple as we can get the
maximum value on multiplying all values
but the point is to handle the case of 0
and 1. in other words on multiplying
with zero and one we get the lower value
as compared to adding with zero and one
so use the multiplication sign between
any two numbers except numbers
containing zero and one and use the plus
sign if any of the numbers is 0 and 1.
number five how will you convert the
ternary expression to a binary tree
if we see the symbol question mark then
we add the next character as the left
child of the root if we see the symbol
colon then we add it as the right child
of the current root do this process
until we Traverse all elements of the
string
number six how will you count all
distinct pairs with differences equal to
K
a simple solution is to consider all
pairs one by one and check the
difference between every pair
following program implements The Simple
Solution we run two Loops the outer loop
picks the first element of the pair the
inner loop looks for the other element
the solution doesn't work if there are
duplicates in the array as the
requirement is to count only distinct
pairs
number seven
given is an array of positive integers
can you find the smallest subarrays
length whose sum of elements is greater
than a given number k
a simple solution is to use two nested
Loops the outer loop picks a starting
element the inner loop considers all
elements on the right side of current
start as ending element whenever the sum
of elements between current start and
end becomes more than the given number
update the result if current length is
smaller than the smallest length so far
number eight you have to find if the
string is K palindrome or not can you do
that
explanation string cannot become
palindrome by removing only one
character
the task is to transform the given
string into its Reverse by removing at
most K characters from it the problem is
basically a variation of edit distance
we can modify the edit distance program
to consider the given string and its
reverse as input and the only operation
allowed is deletion since the given
string is compared with its reverse we
will do at most in deletions from the
first string and in deletions from the
second string to make them equal
therefore for a string to be K
palindrome two times n is less than or
equal to two times K should hold true
below are the detailed steps of the
algorithm
process all characters one by one
starting from either the left or right
sides of both strings let us Traverse
from the right corner there are two
possibilities for every pair of
characters being traversed if the last
characters of the two strings are the
same we ignore last characters and count
for remaining strings so if we recur for
links M minus 1 and N minus 1 where m is
the length of string 1 and N is the
length of string two if the last
characters are not the same we consider
removing the operation on the last
character of the first string and the
last character of the second string
recursively compute the minimum cost for
the operations and take a minimum of two
values remove last character from string
1 recur for M minus 1 and n and remove
last character from string two recur for
M and N minus 1.
number nine how will you find the
minimum depth of a binary tree
the minimum depth is the number of nodes
along the shortest path from the root
node down to the nearest Leaf node the
idea is to Traverse the given binary
tree for every node check if it is a
leaf node if yes then return one if not
Leaf node then if the left subtree is
null then recur for the right subtree
and if the right subtree is null then
recur for the left subtree if both left
and right subtrees are not null then
take the minimum of two heights below is
the implementation of the above idea and
another approach is level order
traversal
number 10 you're given an unsorted array
of non-negative integers and an integer
sum can you find a continuous subarray
that adds to a given sum
explanation sum of elements between
indices 1 and 4 is 4 plus 0 plus 0 plus
3 equals seven
the idea is to consider all subarrays
one by one and check the sum of every
subarray following program implements
the given idea run two Loops the outer
loop picks a starting point I and the
inner loop tries all subarrays starting
from I Traverse the array from start to
end for every index start another loop
from I to the end of array to get all
sub-arrays starting from I keep a
variable current sum to calculate the
sum of every sub array
for every index in inner loop update
current sum equals current sum plus
array J
if the current sum is equal to the given
sum then print the sub array
number 11. you can see two unsorted
arrays how will you find all pairs whose
sum is X
a naive approach is to Simply run two
loops and pick elements from both arrays
one by one check that both elements sum
is equal to given value X or not
number 12. given are the 10 activities
with their start and end times compute a
schedule where the greatest number of
activities take place
greedy approach can be used to find the
solution since we want to maximize the
account of activities that can be
executed this approach will greatly
choose an activity with the earliest
finish time at every step thus yielding
an optimal solution
the greedy choice is to always pick the
next activity whose finish time is least
among the remaining activities and the
start time is more than or equal to the
finish time of the previously selected
activity we can sort the activities
according to their finishing time so
that we always consider the next
activity as minimum finishing time
activity so number one sort the
activities according to their finishing
time number two select the first
activity from the sorted array and print
it number three do the following for the
remaining activities in the sorted array
a if the start time of this activity is
greater than or equal to the finish time
of the previously selected activity then
select this activity and print it number
13 what is the next number of the
sequence 1 11 21 1211
in each number one is increasing and
decreasing the ones place if you look at
the two numbers in the tens place it's
also increasing after each sequence then
see the third line after the two the one
is also increasing and decreasing and at
last we will add one as the one is added
every time as with the two
number fourteen
given our two strings with binary
numbers find the result obtained by
adding those two binary strings and
return the result as a binary string the
idea is to start from the last
characters of two strings and compute
the digit sum one by one if the sum
becomes more than one then store carry
for the next digits
number 15. rearrange the given string of
alphabets in sorted order and all the
integers present in the string
number one start traversing the given
string a if an alphabet comes increment
its occurrence count into a hash table
B if an integer comes then store it
separately by summing it up every time
two using hash table append all the
characters first into a string and then
at the end append the integers number
three return the resultant string
number 16 map the digits of the given
positive number corresponding to the
alphabet in the mapping table also
return the count of the total number of
decodings possible take suitable
assumptions before coding
the possible decodings are a b a a u l a
input the digit sequence initialize
count equals zero
if the last digit is non-zero recur for
the next remaining n minus 1 digits and
then add the result to the total count
if the last two digits form a valid
character or smaller than 27 recur for
the remaining n minus two digits and add
the result to total count
number 17. can you rotate the given
Square matrix by 90 degrees in a
clockwise Direction the transformation
should be done in quadratic time and in
place
to solve the question without any extra
space rotate the array in form of
squares dividing the Matrix into squares
or cycles for example a 4x4 Matrix will
have two cycles the first cycle is
formed by its first row last column last
row and First Column the second cycle is
formed by second row second to last
column second to last row and second
column
the idea is for each Square cycle swap
the elements involved with the
corresponding cell in The Matrix in
clockwise Direction
here's the approach the approach is
similar to In-Place rotate Square matrix
by 90 degrees set one the only thing
that is different is to print the
elements of the cycle in a clockwise
Direction in other words an in by n
Matrix will have Floor N divided by two
square Cycles for example a three by
three Matrix will have one cycle the
cycle is formed by its first row last
column last row and First Column for
each Square cycle we swap the elements
involved with the corresponding number
18 state which histogram has the largest
rectangular area also return the area of
the largest histogram
a simple solution is to one by one
consider all bars as starting points and
calculate the area of all rectangles
starting with every bar finally return
the maximum of all possible areas time
complexity of this solution would be Big
O for N squared
we can use divide and conquer to solve
this in Big O for n Log In Time the idea
is to find the minimum value in the
given array once we have an index of the
minimum value the max area is the
maximum of the following three values
maximum area in the left side of minimum
value not including the Min value
maximum area in right side of minimum
value not including the Min value number
of bars multiplied by a minimum value
the areas in the left and right of the
minimum value bar can be calculated
recursively if we use linear search to
find the minimum value then the worst
case time complexity of this algorithm
becomes Big O for N squared in the worst
case we always have n minus 1 elements
on one side and zero elements on the
other side
and of the finding minimum takes big O
for in time we get the recurrence
similar to the worst case of quick sort
number 19 you are given integers in the
form of an array how will you print the
largest sub-array sum having at least K
numbers
a simple solution is to generate all
sub-arrays of size K compute their sums
and finally return the maximum of all
sums the time complexity of this
solution is Big O for n times k
an efficient solution is based on the
fact that the sum of a subarray or
window of size K can be obtained in Big
O for one time using the sum of the
previous sub-array or window of size k
except for the first array of size k for
other sub arrays we compute the sum by
removing the first element of the last
window and adding the last element of
the current window
number 20 return the product of the two
integers represented as strings we start
from the last digit of the second number
and multiply it with the first number
then we multiply the second digit of the
second number with the first number and
so on we add all these multiplications
and while adding we put ith
multiplication shifted tips for meta
