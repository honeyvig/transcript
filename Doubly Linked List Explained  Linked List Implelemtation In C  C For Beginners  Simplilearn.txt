hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn
in today's video we're gonna be learning
all about doubly link listen c but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
this session will help you understand
what a doubly linked list is in c
moving ahead let's understand the memory
representation of a doubly linked list
later let's look at the syntax and
finally operations performed on a doubly
linked list
now let's begin by understanding what a
doubly linked list is in safe
a doubly linked list is complex as
compared to a singly linked list
in the doubly linked list the traversal
happens in two ways forward and backward
direction and each node consists of data
and address of the previous and next
node
as it is clear from the above diagram
that the first node's previous is
pointing to null which means no more
nodes before it
and its next part is holding the address
of its next node that is the address of
second node
similarly second node previous is
holding the address of the first node
and next is holding the address of the
third node followed by that the third
node's next is pointing to the null
because no other node after it and its
previous is holding the address of the
second node
this will continue as many nodes are in
the doubly linked list
and the elements are located at some
random location in the memory for
example as you can see if the first
element is inserted at the location 2000
then the next element would be located
at 2016 and then at the next free
location and so on
moving ahead let's have a look at the
doubly linked list memory data
presentation
let's consider one example and
understand the representation of a
doubly linked list so consider three
elements to be inserted into the list
where each node consists of data part
and address part of previous and next
node and it is stored at some address
2000 2016 and 2022.
the address of the first node is stored
in the special node called head node
as i discussed before
the first nodes previous is pointing to
null because there are no nodes before
it and the last node next is pointing to
the null because there are no nodes
after it
every node in a linked list is connected
in two ways from forward and backward
direction with the other through the
pointers called previous and next
that points to the address of its
previous and next node
it is represented by the arrows in this
diagram
for example
so let our elements to be inserted be 10
20 and 30.
and the address of the first node is
stored in the head node
and the next part of the first node that
is this
is holding the address of the next node
that is 2016
and its previous is pointing to the null
similarly the second node is holding the
address of the third node
that is 2022
and its previous is holding the address
of its first node that is 2 000.
whereas the third node the previous is
holding the address of its previous node
that is 2016
and its next is pointing to the null
and in this way they are linked together
up next we have the syntax of a doubly
linked list
a doubly linked list consists of an
extra pointer compared to a singly
linked list
so
the syntax start with a struct keyword
followed by structure name called note
then we have the variable stick line
that is data and struct node asterisk
next and previous a point of variables
pointing to an element of a structure
node
so with this let's try to execute a
simple wlinkplace program to understand
in a better way
so from this program
we are going to create four nodes and
insert the elements into it
so we have previously discussed this
syntax of a doubly linked list so here
we have a previous and next pointer
variable
so
moving ahead we'll see that we have a
head node and we are creating first
second and third and fourth note so
initially
those are null so they are initialized
to null
and
for creating we need to allocate the
memory for it right to create a node we
need to create memory for it for that we
have we are using analog function
to allocate memory for the
node first second third and fourth
and once we create memory we are going
to assign the values to it so here the
values are 10 20 30 and 40. so these
values are assigned in the first data
path and the second data part third data
part and the fourth data part of every
node
and once after assigning we need to link
these nodes together so for that we have
the first next part is assigned to the
second that means it holds of the second
element
and its previous is assigned to null
because there are no node before it
and the second nodes next part is
assigned to third and its previous is
assigned to first
similarly the third next is assigned to
fourth and its previous is assigned to
the second node
and the last node that is fourth nodes
next is none because there are no node
after it and its previous is assigned to
thought that means it holds the address
of a third
element
and now
the first is assigned to head that means
the address of first node is
holding in the head node
and finally displays the first so this
display function we have to display all
the element in a doubly linked list
so this will
so as you can see here we got the output
the doubly linked list elements are 10
20 30 and 40.
okay so now let us move on to the
operations on a doubly linked list
first we have insertion operation
next deletion operation and finally
traversal operation so let's understand
them in detail
under insertion operation we have
insertion at beginning so basically we
insert the element at the beginning of
the element list
next
insertion at end that means it inserts
the element at the end of the element
list and lastly insertion of the
specified node that means it inserts the
element after some specified node
so now let's run the program and
understand these operations practically
so using insertion operation we are
going to execute a simple program
so we have previously discussed that
we have two
pointer variables that is previous and
next that is pointing to its previous
and the next node
and first let's discuss the insertion at
beginning operation so basically we are
going to insert a node at the beginning
of a linked list
so for that we are creating a new node
and allocating memory for it using mlog
function once creating the memory
the new data part the new nodes data
part is holding the new data
and the next is pointing to the head
and its previous is pointing to the null
because there are no nodes after it
so if head is not equal to null that
means the head's previous is equal to
new and now mu is assigned to the head
so it's simple
now
the head is holding the address of a new
node next coming to the insertion at end
so here again
we we are creating a new node allocating
memory for it
and on that new data is holding the new
data and it's next is pointing to null
because there are no more nodes after it
and we are creating a temporary variable
where
to hold the address of a head
so now if the head is equal equal to
null that means new previous is pointing
to the null
and new is assigned to the head and
return while
the temp next if it is not equal to null
then
the temp next is assigned to the temp
variable and the new now the new is
assigned to the temp next and temp is
assigned to the new previous
so now the last node is inserted
now coming to the insertion after node
that means
inserting in between of two nodes so if
previous node is equal equal to null
that means the given previous note
cannot be none
for that we are creating again a new
node and allocating memory for it using
analog function and its new data is
holding the
a new
nodes data part is holding the new data
and the new node next part is
is assigned to the previous nodes next
and we're just changing the addresses so
now here previous node next is pointing
to the new
and the previous node is now assigned to
the new previous
so if
new next is not equal to null that means
new next previous is equal to new
so coming to the display
here
while node is not equal to null it will
print all the node data till the till it
finds the null
and here
in the main function
we have we are creating a head which is
initialized to null
initially and when it comes the control
comes to the insertion at end
it will print a value 4
and next when it encounters the
insertion at beginning function
that means it will insert 2 in front of
the element 4
and again insertion at beginning so it
insert the element 1 in front of element
2
and similarly insertion at end that
means it will print element 5 after the
element 4
and insertion of the node head next
that means it will insert the element
after the element 2.
so now let's try to execute and run the
program
so as you can see the elements are
listed
in a proper way that means we have the
elements 1 2 3 4 and 5.
followed by that we have deletion
operation to delete from the beginning
delete from the end and delete after
specific node so now let's run a program
so now we are going to perform the
deletion operation so for that we have a
function called deletion node so
basically we are going to delete a node
from a list
so first
it checks the condition if head is equal
equal to null or
no delete is equal equal to null that
means a node to be deleted is also equal
or equal equal to null then it will
return that means the deletion is not
possible
next it checks the next condition if
head is equal equal to node delete
that means
if a node to be deleted is our first
node
then
head is equal to
head nodes next that means the head node
next is assigned to the head
next condition if node delete next is
not equal to null that means if it is
not the last node
that means point the previous next node
to the node delete previous
and finally if not delete previous is
not equal to null that means if the node
to be deleted is not the first node
then
point the next previous to the delete
node node delete next and finally we are
going to free up the
memory space for that
node and coming to the
main function where we have print
function after deleting an element it
gonna delete the node
so here after the head next
one two three four
so after the fourth node it gonna delete
the fifth element that is it will delete
the last element five
so let's check the output
so as you can see
after deleting an element
so our previously inserted elements were
1 2 3 4 and 5 and after deleting now the
element fifth is deleted
finally we have traversal operation
in this operation we visit each and
every node at least once maybe to
display all the data elements or to
perform operations on it so let's
understand it practically
so here we are going to perform a
traversal operation that means
it actually visit each and every node at
least once and display them
so here using a display function we are
going to display all the elements that
are present in a
linked list
so now let's try to execute and run it
so as you can see first the inserted
elements were 1 2 3 4 and 5 and after
deleting an element now the elements are
1 2 3 and 4 that means the fifth element
got deleted and now the final list of
elements are 1 2 3 and 4.
i hope you got a clear understanding of
how to perform insertion deletion and
traversal operations in doubly linked
list
so with this we have come to the end of
