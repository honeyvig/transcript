hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in the session we will
be learning about how to freeze rows or
columns in excel but before we begin let
me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies
so if you're a tech geek in a continuous
hunt for latest technological trends
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to freeze rows in
excel
now we might want to start our practical
mode so currently we are on excel and
this is a spreadsheet data
so here you can see
columns and rows so especially the
fourth row and the column c
right so
currently we have data on our
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you'll have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if even
even i had this data in the column
section right and what if i had to
freeze that and you know when you scroll
this and keep that data uh set on the
column as it is right so we can also do
that let's look at both of them
so
there is a simple process to do that all
you have to do is select the cell
or for which you want to you know set
the or freeze the column adjacent to it
or the row adjacent to it right so
currently you want to
let me expand it so currently i want to
freeze this particular row right and
this particular column so the cell i
would be selecting is the first cell
here that is
d5
right so when i select this particular
cell i can be able to freeze this
particular row and this particular
column
so now you need to navigate to the
toolbar and then select the view menu
and inside view option you can see there
is an option of freeze panes right so
click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is the second option
or you can freeze the entire column that
is the third option or you can freeze
both that is the first option
right freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in excel so with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to freeze rows or how to freeze
columns or how to freeze both the panes
in excel spreadsheet so if you have any
