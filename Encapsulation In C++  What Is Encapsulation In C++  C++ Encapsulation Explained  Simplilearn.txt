hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this session we
will learn about encapsulation in c plus
plus
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
so we'll start by understanding what is
encapsulation in c plus plus why do we
need encapsulation in c plus plus then
we will learn about access modifiers
after that we will understand the
benefits of encapsulation and also the
difference between encapsulation and
abstraction so let's start with
encapsulation in c plus
encapsulation is a very important
concept of object oriented programming
it can be defined as wrapping up of data
and functions together into a single
unit
just like a capsule the data members and
functions are wrapped together
wrapping them into a single unit helps
in keeping them secure from the outside
access
for example inside a class the variables
and functions are declared and then bind
together with the help of class
which also implements encapsulation
next is
why do we need encapsulation
hiding the details or attributes is also
an important thing that one should focus
on
encapsulation helps with that part
it keeps the details of the object
hidden or saved from the users by
securing them from the outside access
there are many implementation details
that the users are not supposed to see
so these details like the details of the
object are kept secure from the direct
access from outside the class with the
help of encapsulation
the data hiding is done with the help of
access modifiers
so let's understand these access
modifiers
the access modifiers helps in data
hiding part
the access modifiers provides or grant
the access to the members of the class
or it prevents them from the direct
access to the class members from outside
the class
so there are generally three types of
access modifiers that is public private
and protected
so let's understand them
in public access modifier other classes
and function can access the data members
and member functions of the public class
for example park is a public property
anybody can go to the park or access the
park because it's a public
nobody has to take the alliance of
anybody to go to the park
now coming to the private
in private access modifiers only the
member functions inside the class have
the access to the class members
functions outside the class cannot
access them
for example a house is a private
property
any member outside the family
cannot access the house without
permission
only members inside the family can
access it because it's a private
property
now let's understand protected
in protected access modifier
similar to private scope it cannot be
accessed from the outside class
but it can be accessed from the derived
class
the derived class is also called the
child class
also the protected member of a class can
be accessed from the friend function
so as we have understood about these
axis modifiers
now let's understand the benefits of
encapsulation
encapsulation helps in reducing the
complexity of code by hiding the
irrelevant data or information and by
doing so it reduces the complexity
second is encapsulation helps in hiding
and protecting the data by wrapping the
data and functions together which are
generally complex and by doing so
provides a simpler view to the user
with the help of encapsulation the
variables of the class can be hidden
from other classes
third is encapsulated classes can easily
be altered using the access modifiers
that is we don't need to change the
entire program all we need to do is to
change the access scope of the variables
that can be private protected or public
so these were some benefits of
encapsulation now let's go ahead and
understand the difference between
encapsulation and abstraction
both of these concepts are similar in
some ways but now we will discuss their
differences
so let's start with encapsulation
encapsulation helps in combining the
data and functions together in a single
unit whereas in abstraction the unwanted
information is kept hidden
encapsulation helps in hiding the data
and helps in providing an easier view
abstraction helps in hiding the
implementation details
encapsulation can be implemented using
an access modifiers
whereas abstraction can be implemented
using abstract class and interfaces
in encapsulation
problems are solved at implementation
level
and in abstraction
problems are solved at design level
so these were some differences between
encapsulation and abstraction
let's go ahead and do some practical
examples on this topic
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so this is our code editor that is
visual studio code and now let's create
a new file
and let's name it
encapsulation
dot cpp
so first of all we know in encapsulation
we can make variables inaccessible by
making their scope as private
so in this example we will do that
we'll make the salary of an employee as
private and then using the saturngather
methods we will set the value of salary
and return it as well
the setter getter methods are generally
used in these kind of situations where
the variable we want to access is
private
so now let's start
first of all we will create the main
function but before that let's add the
header files
now using namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
and inside the main function first of
all we'll create an object by declaring
the
class name let's say the class name is
company
the object name is obj
now
using this object we will call the set
function
or we can say the setter function
we will name it as set
salary let's say
and we will pass
two values
thirty thousand and six thousand
one would be the full time salary and
one would be the overtime
all right now after that we can display
those
and we can write total salary
and and
after that we can call the get function
to return the salary
as the getter function is used to return
the output and set function is used to
set the values so we'll write obj.get
salary
so the salary we will display over here
and after that we can write the return 0
now the main function is done now let's
start
with company class company
class
company and inside this class first of
all inside the private scope
this is the private scope
and this is the
variable salary
now this variable salary is private so
no member outside the class can access
it
but using the setter and getter methods
we will access this variable and we will
set the
salary and then we will return it
all right
now
public scope inside the public scope
we will
write the setter methods void
set
salary
and
end full time
and
over time
so these are two variables
this 30 000 that we are passing is a
full-time salary and this 6000 is an
overtime salary
so we need to add both of these salaries
in this part
so we'll write salary equals
full time
plus
over time
so this would be the total salary
and
let's just do this
all right so this set
salary function is done this is the
setup function
now we have to return
using the getter function so we'll write
the data type int
get
salary
now inside this function
we will simply return the variable
salary
as we can see
and
once the class
will use this semicolon
all right pretty much everything is done
and now we can save it
and let's try
as you can see total salary is 36 000 as
30 000 plus 6000
so it is working fine so this is how we
can access these private variables using
these saturn getter methods
now let's do another example
this example of encapsulation will also
be pretty much the same
we'll do the setter getter methods in
this one as well but in this example
we'll find the area of circle
all right let's start then first of all
we'll include the header files that is
hash include iostream
and the name space standard
we also forgot to save this
let's name this one as
first of all the location is work
now let's name it as
an encapsulation
two dot cpp
all right
now the header files that i did now will
start with the main function first of
all
now inside this main function we'll
create an object first of all we'll
write the name of the class
that is ball
now the name of the object is obj now
using this obj object we will call the
setter function
that is the set area function and we
will pass the radius
all right
obj
dot
set area this is the setup function
now we will pass the
radius
now now we can display the area by
calling that getter function but before
that we will display a message
all right
area of
ball is
all right
now
we will call that getter function
get area
all right the main function is done now
we need to create the class
class bowl inside this class
private scope
inside the private scope we'll
create that variable
area and let's make its data type as
float because we know that there are
chances that the answer could be
in decimal form because we have to use
pi in that because the area of circle is
pi r square so 3.14 is the value so that
is why we are using float as the data
type
all right now
in the public scope
we'll
set the radius inside this function
set area and
in radius this is the radius that is
6 that we are passing this is the r this
is the parameter
and
inside this function area equals we know
that pi r square is the formula so we
will write 3.14 that is the value of pi
into
radius
again into radius
r square
all right so this is the
area of
circle or ball we can say
after that
float is the data type now we have to
return the area using the getter
function
float getter
its
name is get area
get area
and will simply return the
area variable
all right after that we can use
semicolon in the end
and pretty much everything is done
so let's save it
and let's check it
if it is running fine or not
as you can see area of ball is 113.04
so if we multiply 3.14 that is the value
of pi
with
36 that is 6 into 6 it will give you
113.04
so this is the right answer and this is
how we can find the area of ball or
something like that
and as you can see here the area is
private and using this set area and get
area methods that is the saturn getter
methods we are accessing this private
variable that is area so these were two
examples of encapsulation you can try
these examples as well all right guys
with that we have come to the end of
