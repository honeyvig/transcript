I can customize this template
right and
if you see we have redirected to the
canva editor right here we can simply
drag and drop and we can edit anything
we can change the size of the font and
everything so let's design something
right so suppose if I want to add some
element right
uh if I want to add some shape so I can
simply click on this right and I can
create this one
okay if I walk I can also change the
color of this
I'm just showing you uh if I want that
this design so what I can do right
so like this we can add a shape if I can
change the shape color as well so
suppose if I want this to be in yellow
so we can get this company profile text
background and this particular shape
background yellow we can also increase
the font size from here okay so we have
I hope you understand the how we can use
the shape option you can check out the
different different things which are
available here on elements you will get
lot of things like tables you can add
tables Graphics photos videos audios
charts frames and collection so if I
want to add some graphic to this
particular
a design so how I can do this so I have
searched this skill
uh in the search bar so I'll get the
graphics which is related to skills so
uh let me just choose one image so that
we can add it here I have choose this
image
right so we can
add this image anywhere in this
particular design
we can resize as well right with this
option
we can animate as well if you want to
animate right so like this you can do
so there are multiple options are
available so you can explode this one
right that's how you can do different
different
uh Element Animations you can add if you
want to add please animation then you
can go to this option and you can see
page animations also you can do from
this
so that's how you will add graphics you
can same like the same process will be
there uh for adding the videos and for
adding the
audio files right and same thing for the
photos as well suppose if you want to
add some photos from your personal
computer then in that case you need to
go to this upload option and you can
also upload images from your own
computer or desktop or your laptop right
so you can upload anything from here
you can also upload any videos and
audios and there is also one option
available you can record yourself as

available in canva so from your if you
want to upload something from your own
PC or system then you can select this
upload option otherwise if you want some
stock stuff then you can go to the
element option and search any keyword
which is related to the thing which you
want to add in your design and you will
get the results and you can add anything
from this element option suppose if you
want to add some text in the text case
you can go to this text option so there
are you can add a heading add a sub
heading add a little bit body of text so
all these three types of things you can
add on your design so and there there
are font combinations available so that
directly you can use so suppose if I
like this one right so I can apply this
one and I can customize this right
uh suppose I want to write this as a
game I'm just taking it as an example
right I can also customize this
with this option
and you can move this anywhere
wherever I want this I can add simply uh
drag and drop you can do that's how
canva works so there are different

you or I would recommend you to select
this free option so that you will get
the free templates so directly so all
these templates are free so you can
simply click any of them and you can add
it for example if I I like this template
right I can customize this template late
the same procedure will be there uh the
same thing that we did for the
presentation the same thing will be
there for this one as well the editor
will be same but uh there is one
different that is the content piece is
different so I can edit this according
to my needs or if I want to add
something to this one then I I show you
previously as well on elements we can
add anything right on the text suppose I
want to add some text here so that also
I can do I don't want these font
combination I want some simple right so
I can select this heading option from
here
once I click on this heading option I
can customize this for example I'll just
write my name
I just increase the size
and I'll just put it here
so I can change the font of this
particular uh name uh it's my name
Tushar so I can change the font so for
example I want open sense then I can
choose this font I can increase the size
of the font decrease the size of the
font I can change the color okay if I
want this to be in bold then I can do
this from by clicking on this I can
change the alignment from this option I
want something in pointers or less then
I can use this if I want some spacing
Suppose there are multiple lines you
have written some paragraph so on that
lines how much spacing you need so that
also you can do from this option effects
this is also a good option I like this
left effect if you see there is
something change in the design so if I
click on this none option you see there
is a different design right and if I
click on this left background will be
little bit Shadow or something like that
intensity I can control from here so
suppose I want to increase some the
intensity then I can do that as well so
that's how you will edit things on canva
