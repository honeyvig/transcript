hey everyone welcome back to another
video session by simply learn
in this tutorial we will be learning
about kotlin jetpack compose
the jetpack compose is an android
toolkit but its mechanism is also used
for web applications
so let's go ahead and understand what we
will be covering in this
topic so we will start with what is
kotlin jetpack compose
then we will understand why jetpack
compose or why we use jetpack compose
after that we will learn how does
compose function work
following this topic we will understand
composable function layouts material
design lists and animations
now
before we begin make sure to subscribe
to our youtube channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update so
without further ado
let's get started
so what is kotlin jetpack compose
the jetpack compose is a modern user
interface development toolkit
it makes the app development process
easy and speeds it up
because of the jetpack compose you can
write less code as compared to the
current view building approach
which also leads to less potential bugs
it's changed the way developers create
user interface
making it easier and faster to write and
more performant to run
before the jetpack compose xml layouts
were used to make
native user interface
the jetpack compose is much better
advanced and easier than xml
with the help of
jetpack compose we can make a more
declarative user interface with less
code
so
as we have understood the kotlin jetpack
compose
so now let's have a look at why we need
or use the jetpack compose
so why jetpack compose
the jetpack compose is used because it
has huge benefits over the previous user
interface building system
first it accelerates the development
there are various features in compose
that helps in doing the task faster
for example previews
by making multiple previews we can save
a lot of time that we earlier wasted in
checking the user interface component in
different states
but with the help of multiple previews
we can easily do that
also the compose is compatible with
existing code
many libraries like kotlin core routines
view model etc work just fine with
compose
second is independent
the library of compose is not integrated
with any operating system
which means it is easy to add the new
features to the user interface without
changing the operating system
now next is intuitive
in compose the apis that are used is
intuitive and declarative
intuitive means easy to understand and
declarative means
all we need to do is to describe the
user interface and the rest will be
taken care of by compose
the components that are made with the
compose are not confined to a specific
activity
which makes the component easy to reuse
worth is powerful and feature loaded
compose is a powerful and feature loaded
that helps in making the app attractive
and user friendly you can make the app
as you desired with these animations
which are quite easy to implement
compose has the support for dark theme
material design animations etc which
makes things very easy for the
development
now
how does compose work
the word compose came from composite
which means the collection of objects
the composed jetpack
works on a composite design pattern
this pattern is used while dealing with
hierarchical data
like parent-child relationship
so in compose every view can contain
one or more child views within it
and the child views can further have sub
child views
unlike previous approaches where we
cannot introduce
additional functionalities in a view
now
as we have understood about this topic
now we will move on to the next topic
which is composable function
a composable function is just like any
other normal function of kotlin
but the only difference is
it is annotated by the composable sign
it helps in transforming the data to the
user interface hierarchy
all the functions with composable sign
indicate that this function is the
compose function and the sign tells the
compose compiler that this function is
intended to convert data into user
interface
and they can only be called from other
composable functions
the composable function doesn't return
any values like the codeline function
but instead
emit user interface elements to the
compose runtime system for rendering as
we can see in this example
composable annotation is used to make
the function message a composable
function
the element text is also a composable
function which comes from compose
library
with the preview annotation as we can
see we are able to see how our ui that
is user interface is going to look like
the preview
are often written with composable
annotation
and multiple previews can be added to
the composable function having different
parameters
now
the output of this example would be
hello rahul
so now moving on to the next topic which
is layout
the layout allows us to arrange the
components in such a way so that they
don't overlap each other
it basically arranges the components in
a proper manner otherwise they got
staggered over each other
it is one of the most important
component that helps in creating user
interface
it helps in alignment and arrangement
purposes for the user interface
a out is a compose function which allows
us to arrange elements in a row column
and box
so let's understand
here we can see in this example
there is a row keyword which means these
three words hello there mate that are
written inside the row function will be
arranged horizontally
the row function allows us to arrange
the elements in a horizontal manner
so hello there and mate will be arranged
horizontally
similarly the column function
lets you arrange the elements in a
vertical manner
so in this case that is in the case of
column function
hello there meet will be arranged
vertically
so this was example of layout now moving
on to the next topic which is
box
in box layout the children
are staggered over each other by default
so we have to align them to put them in
different positions or proper positions
we use the align modifier to set the
position or alignment for children
elements
as we can see in this example we have
used a line modifier and we can also see
there is alignment dot top center and
alignment dot bottom center
these are the alignment options that are
applied to the child user interface
there are total nine alignment options
let's have a look at them
first three are
alignment.topstart
alignment.top and
alignment.top center
here
alignment.topstart will align the user
interface to the top left corner
top end will align at the top right
corner
and top center will align at top center
position
next three are alignment dot center
start alignment dot center end and
alignment dot center
here center start will align the user
interface to the mid left
corner
center end will align at mid right
corner
and center will be aligned at the mid
center position in between center start
and center end
x3r alignment dot bottom start alignment
dot bottom end and alignment dot bottom
center
here
bottom start will align the user
interface to the bottom left corner
bottom end will align at the bottom
right corner and bottom center will be
aligned at the bottom center position
that is in between bottom start and
bottom end
so these were the nine possible
alignments
now
coming to material design
as the name suggests it helps to improve
the appearance using the material design
styling
there are three pillars of material
design which are color
typography shape
first is
color
by using values from wrapped theme you
can easily color wherever it is needed
inside the compose graphic package there
is a color class which is used by
jetpack compose
to define material design color system
color class is used
there are 13 attributes that can be used
and those are
primary primary variant secondary
secondary variant
background surface error
on primary own secondary on background
on surface on error
and is light
each of them having different means and
is used to color wherever it is needed
then there is typography
in the material theme there are material
typography styles which are used to
style or define a type system
with the help of typograph class we can
customize font style font weight font
family letter spacing text decoration
and many more attributes
third is shape
material design allows us to define
shape for small medium and large
components as well just like typography
we can easily create shapes
now coming to next topic which is list
and animations
the list and animations are one of the
most important thing for building an app
we have already discussed row and column
earlier
here we will discuss about lazy
composibles
lazy composibles include lazy row and
lazy column
the lazy row makes a horizontal
scrolling list
and the lazy column makes the vertical
scrolling list
in this example lazy column is used
as we can see
here lazy columns is used
that is vertical scrolling list
and this is how we add elements or items
here we are adding a single item and
here we are adding multiple items
with items there is an integer 7 which
means 7 items can be added
now
just like list animations are also very
important for a smooth and attractive
user experience
there are various apis that can give you
control and help with the animation
they are animation visibility
it is used if you are animating
appearance and disappearance
then there is animation
it is used if you want to have fine
control over animation time
then there is crossfade
it is used to switch between composables
with a crossfade animation then there is
remember infinite transition
if the animation is state-based and
happens during composition and is
infinite then this is used
next is
update transition
it is used if you are animating multiple
values simultaneously
so these were some apis that can give
you control over the animations
and with that we have done with the
jetpack compose topic
in this tutorial we understood what is
kotlin jetpack compose why jetpack
compose how does the compose work
composable function layouts material
design
list and animations
