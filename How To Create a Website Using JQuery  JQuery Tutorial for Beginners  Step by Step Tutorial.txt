let's get started and create this movie
downloading website but wait let me tell

developer get ready to take your skill
to the next level and build awesome apps
that will blow users mind the link in
the description box below check this out
so without further Ado let's get started
so far we have seen various different
topics related to jQuery in this
particular playlist we came across
jQuery effects animations callbacks and
then we moved on to jQuery UI wherein we
covered topics like widgets interactions
theme customization and many more
let's use some of the concepts in a
website today let's move ahead and we'll
take an overview of what we are doing
today the task is simple we'll create a
movie downloading website from scratch
using HTML CSS and jQuery only
so here we are in the website wherein
you can see we have the front page of
our website here we have some text which
says download your favorite movie in
just a click and then we have welcome
written over here right
the page seems simple the first thing we
have here is the navigation bar which
will navigate us to different sections
of the website we have home about
categories top rating and contact away
click on any of them and it will take us
to that particular section in a website
if you see here we have two arrows
present at the bottom of a home page if
we click on it it will take us to the
about section right here we have some
more text present we have the contact us
button present over here and it will
take us to that particular section click
on it and here we are at the contact us
section of our website
the next section contains categories of
movies we have in our website we have
six different categories present over
here over your mouse cursor over any and
you can see the animation in that
particular category
the next thing we have are the top rated
movies the HOA effect you can see here
as well but if you click on any image
you can see the image size is larger now
and we can also use these arrows to
change the movie right you can check all
the top rated movies over here now in
the last part we have the contact us
page wherein if we write our name email
and message and then if we click on send
message button a dialog box will appear
on your screen and it will say something
so let's try to do it here we'll write
here caution
then let's say we have a email ID over
here we'll write here question at the
gmail.com
and then let's say we are writing
something over here now click on the
send message button you can see we have
a dialog box which says thank you for
contacting us we'll get back to you soon
don't forget to check your email
fine the task is simple right I hope you
guys must have got the task by now all
we have to do is to recreate this whole
thing from scratch on
so let's get back to the programming
part without wasting any more time here
we are in the vs code and we have all
the required files present in our system
already if I show you once you can see
we have this whole folder present in our
system where we have all the files
images and everything we need to create
this website we have the jQuery file the
jQuery UI file and almost everything we
need right you can see it over here we
have images over here we have icons we
have the jQuery UI file we have project
content and many more things right
so let's minimize this for now
now let's move on to the HTML file first
and we'll start by designing the layout
of our web page or we can say website we
have to create a preloader thing before
we create the body of our website so
we'll keep these small things in mind
and later we'll see what vital part
these small things play in making a
website more interactive to the user so
we'll start The Code by writing over
here inside the body tag so let's use
comments for different sections so we'll
write here
preloader fine so this is a comment now
we'll start writing the code for Prelude
so first thing first we'll write here
dip we'll take a div tag
we'll write a class so let's say the
class name is
preload now we'll close this div tag and
inside this we'll create another div tag
so we'll write here div
class is equals to let's say
loader
file so we are done with preload we'll
comment it out once again we'll write
here
reloader ends fine so our preloader ends
over here
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to start writing the code for the
head section of a website so we'll write
here
at section starts
so now we'll write the code over here
for the head section so the first thing
we have to write here is we have to take
the header tag we'll write a header
class is going to be
header for this and then we'll close
this header Tag Away now inside this
we'll write div
class is equals to let's say
container
so we have to take so many div tags so
keep these things in mind
so the next thing we are going to write
here is we are going to write here
div
now class is going to be let's say
row justify
content between fine and then we'll
write here a line
items at the
Center
fine so we have taken this class name as
row justify content between and align
items Center
so now inside this what we'll do is
we'll write here
div
class is equals to branding so we'll
write your brand
name fine now we'll close this div tag
and inside this will take an anchor text
so we'll write here a href is going to
be
index dot HTML so this is the link now
what we'll do is we'll write here
movie
fine
now after this div tag what we'll do is
we'll write here
if
class is equals to
nav toggle fine
so this is the class for a navigation
bar now inside this will write here
pen we'll close this pen tag will keep
it empty for now now after this Dev tag
we have to write here
nav class is equals to let's say nav
we'll close this div tag now inside this
we'll Define a
items we'll write here home about
categories top rated and contact find
now inside this nav tag we'll write here
un will take an unordered list now
inside this unordered list we have to
use the litec so we'll write a li anchor
tag now inside this anchor tag we are
going to write href is equals to
home so this is the ID for home page so
we'll write here
home
now we'll do the same for every category
or we can say every item in the menu so
we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it
five times fine so here we are now the
next thing we have to do is we have to
change the names so instead of home
after we have about so we'll write about
then we have the categories so we'll
write here categories
we have to change the ID as well so
we'll write here
category
then after categories we have
top rated movies so we'll write here top
rated and the ID is going to be let's
say
so then we have the contactors fine so
we'll write here
contact and instead of home will right
here
fine so we are done with it we are done
with the
header so the next thing we have to do
is we have to write here after this
header
we have to mention it over here that the
header ends over here so we'll write a
header and
now we have to start the next section so
the next section is going to be
home section so we'll write here home
section
dots
and after this we'll write the code for
home section
so the home section starts with the
section tag we'll write your section
class is going to be home
so let's name it as home section this
class we'll write here ID as well so
let's say the ID is home
now we have to create a shape over here
if we move back to our website and if
you go to the home page you can see we
have a shape over here the shape is
rotating 360 degrees so we'll create the
shape first now for that what we have to
do is we have to write here
we have to close this section tag first
now inside this section tag we'll
mention a comment again so let's say
we'll write here shape for this
particular ship now what we'll do is
we'll write here div
class is going to be
shape
0 1
so this is the class name now we'll
close this div tag
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to take another Dev tag we'll
write here div
class is equals
container
now we have to take another div tag over
here we'll write here if class is equals
to
oh
align items

Center fine
we have to close this depth tag over
here now inside this we have to write
another div tag so we have to take
another div tag we'll write here div
class is equals
to home content

take another H4 Tech so we'll write it
over here H4 and we'll write over here
this thing we'll write download your
favorite movie in just a click copy it
from here we'll paste it inside the H4
Tech
now we are done with the heading so
after this what we'll do is we'll take
another heading we'll take H2 Tech we'll
write here H2 and we'll write here
welcome to
Movie Mania fine
so we are done with it now the next
thing we have to do is we have to make
these arrows over here so if we move
back to our website you can see we have
two arrows over here which takes us to
the about a section so we have to write
the code for these two arrows as well so
after this we'll write over here
inside commit so we'll write over here
scroll down
now we have to write the code over here
so we'll write here a
href is equals to
about
and then we'll write here class is
equals to
scroll down fine
now we have to
use icons so what we are going to do is
we have already have these icons present
in our system so we'll mention them over
here we'll write here IMG
SRC is going to be inside the images
folder what we'll do is we'll move
inside the icons and inside the icons we
have this file over here arrowdown dot
SVG so this is basically an icon so
we'll write your Alt
and inside this will write
scroll down fine
so this thing is done
now the anchor tag is done so we'll move
back from here now the home section ends
over here so we'll write here
inside the comments we'll write home
section
and fine
so we are done with the home section
let's check it out once save the program
open it with live server and you can see
we have all these things over here we
have home about categories top rated
contact and then we have two headings as
well fine so we are not able to see the
icon as of now we'll style it later on
now let's move back to the programming
part so the home section we are done
with the home section the next section
we have to work on is the about section
so we'll write here about section start
now the about section what we have to do
is we have to write a section we have we
are going to take the section tag again
so we will write a class is equals to
about section
now the class is done we have to write
the ID as well the ID is going to be
about fine now inside the section tag we
have to take another div tag so we'll
write a div
class is going to be container for this
one as well
and now inside this div tag what we are
going to do is we are going to take some
more div text we'll write here div class
is equals to row
so this is the class name
now what we have to do is we have to
write some more things about the image
so we have an image already over here
you can see if we move back to our
website so we have this image over here
as well now what we'll do is we'll write
some code for this image as well so
let's move back to the HTML file and
we'll write here div
class is equals to IMG box
so this is going to be the name of her
class
and inside this we'll take another div
tag and we'll write here
plus is equals to shape
zero so why we are doing here so because
is because if you move back to our
website you can see we have this shape
over here as well so we'll style this
shape as well later on in the CSS file
for that we need to mention the class so
that's why we are using here classes
shape
fine now after this what we are going to
do is we are going to write here
IMG so we are going to add the image now
we will write here IMG SRC is going to
be
inside the IMG folder

section title
now inside this what we are going to do
is we are going to take the H1 tag and
we'll write here
about us fine
after these two div tags what we have to
do is we have to mention a paragraph
here
so the paragraph is this one over here
so this is the paragraph This is nothing
but a paragraph which most of the
prototypes of any websites use so what
we'll do is we'll copy it from here
and what we are going to do is we are
going to use the P tag inside the
paragraph tag we are going to paste this
fine
so this is a paragraph now we are done
with the paragraph tag as well
after the paragraph tag what we have to
do is we have to write here

website now inside this div tag we are
going to take another Dev tag we'll
write here div class is equals to row
and over here we'll write div

have to close this div tag and inside
over here we have to write

so we have to do this thing for
more time we'll copy this piece of code
from here we'll paste it here
the class will remain the same now
instead of 2500 we have to mention the
happy clients over here so we'll write

million plus happy clients then we have
a link over here for the contact us so
we'll create a button later on in the
CSS part for this
so let's move on to the programming part
again
now the next section we have to mention
over here is the category section so if
I take you to this website you can see
we have categories over here we have six
different categories
so we have to write the code for this
part as well so let's move ahead and
write the code for categories as well
so we'll write here

say the first category ends over here
now after this what we have to do is we
have to add five or six more categories
right we have to add six categories to
our website so what we are going to do
is we are going to write the code for
second category of a movie so we are
going to copy this from here
and we are going to paste it over here

now let's move ahead and we'll write the
code for next section so the next
section we have is the top rated section
so we'll write here
top rated section
start
now what we have to do is we have to
take the section tag again so we'll
write a section
class is equals to let's say work
section so this is going to be the name
of our class for top rated section so
we'll write here IDs top now fine
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to write a div class is equals to
container
and then we have
div class is equals to row here fine now
inside this div with class as row what
we have to do is we have to mention the
section title the section title is top
rated movies so this part will remain
the same for all the sections so we'll
write here div
class is equals to
section title so we'll write here

start
now after this what we are going to do
is we are going to take another div
class is going to be work item
and now inside this div tag we have to
write here div
class is going to be work item inner
fine
now inside this we have to add images so
we'll write here IMG we are going to add
two images basically so we'll discuss it
later why we are doing so
so we'll write a IMG SRC and SRC is
going to be
IMG slash
works
and inside the works folder we have
another folder as thumb now we'll add
one dot jpg from here this is the base
file we'll write here data large
and inside the data large what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here IMG
slash
works
slash large
and we have this one dot PNG over so
these two files are basically same files
so they are saved with different names
one is a PNG file and another one is the
JPG file we'll write here Alt
will write here
movie one fine
now close this and
after this what we have to do is we have
to create a div tag with class s
overlay and we have to write something
over here we have to write the heading
so the heading is going to be
doctors
strange fine so this is the heading of
our first movie now what we have to do
is we are done with the first item so
what we'll do is we'll copy this piece
of code from here we'll paste it here
for
the second movie the second movie we
have the image is
2.jpgn2.png now instead of Doctor
Strange the second movie name is
Captain Marvel
fine so we'll write here Captain Marvel
then we'll
copy this and we'll do the same for
almost all the movies right for all the
top rated movies
so we are done with this part we are
done with Doctor Strange and Captain
Marvel then we have three dot PNG and
jpg as the file name or as the image
name so instead of Captain Marvel we
have Aquaman
so we have all the movies from repeat so
we have movies from Marvel Universe and
from DC Universe I believe that you guys
might be a fan of any of these universe
so let's move ahead and instead of
Aquaman we have 4.jpg and 4. PNG as our
next file name and instead of this
Captain Marvel what we have here is
X-Men fine
then
over here we have to mention the file
name is five
and instead of movie name but we have to
write here after X-Men is
guardians of the
then the last movie we have is
the argument so we'll write here the
Dark Knight
and we are done with the
top rated movie part as well so the work
section ends over here or we can say the
top rated movie section ends over here
so we'll mention it over here we'll
write here
top rated end so we are done with the
top rated section as well save the
program once move to the browser
and if we check it over here you can see
we have all the movies we have dark
knight Guardians of the Galaxy X-Men
Aquaman Captain Marvel and Doctor
Strange so it looks
really simple for now right we'll change
them in the CSS part as I've mentioned
it earlier as well we'll do it in the
CSS part so don't be so stressed for now
let's move ahead and we'll write the
code for contact us section so we'll

and we'll do the same thing for right
input group as well so we'll write here
input group right
then we'll write here Dot
work section and we'll write here Dot
work item
then we have to do the same thing for
service section as well we'll write your
dot service section dot service item
now we'll write inside
curly braces we'll Define the flex over
here Flex is going to be 0 0 and 100
percent
and Max width as well Max width is going
to be 100 again
and then we have
contact Section again will
use contact form from here
and we'll Define the padding for this
part we'll write your padding as 0
pixels and 35 pixels
fine
then we'll write here dot contact
Section
dot contact form
then we'll write a DOT form
and we'll Define the padding for this
one as well padding is going to be 55
pixels and 5 pixels for this one
now we are done with this
styling of the website is done now
save the program move back to the
browser and you can see
The Styling is almost done there's
something which is not correct over here
so it's not working correctly as of now
we'll see what wrong we did over here
there's nothing wrong over here so let's
save it once again and we'll see if this
thing works again or not
move back to the website so the website
is doing good over here
and reduce the size and it's working
fine now you can see we have this
website and it's working totally fine as
of now
so we are done with styling a website
that's all what we need to do with
styling now the last remaining thing
here is to add responsiveness to this
website that we'll do with the help of
jQuery and jQuery UI you can see the
website seems beautiful as of now and
let's do the remaining part quickly as
well let's move on to the Javascript
file so this is a JavaScript file and
we'll write the remaining code here only
so here we are in the Javascript file
before we move on further let's discuss
all things we need to do on a website to
make it look more interactive to the
user the first thing we need to do is to
add the preloader to our website a small
animation will take place before the
website opens the next thing we have to
do is to make the web page workable for
smaller Windows here if I show you this
thing in the website itself if we move
back to the original website you can see
on zooming out the Chrome browser you
can see the website adjusts itself
according to the size of the browser the
navigation menu is changed to Burger
menu and the layout of the whole website
is changed accordingly
some more changes we need to make are
related to fixed header smooth strolling
to all the links light box and the
dialog box on button click that's all
we'll do for this particular website
let's start the code for the preload
so what we'll do is we'll write here
let
index is equals to zero
and we'll write here
const
total
work items
fine so we'll write here total work
items and we'll access them so we'll
write here dollar
will write here the class name so the
class name is work item so we'll write
your work item
dot length fine
will need this part of code later on so
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to write here dollar
none will write your window
Dot on
we are going to use the load event so
we'll write a load
comma function so we'll create a
function now inside this function what
we'll do is inside the body of this
function we'll write dollar we'll access
the preloader class so we'll write here
Dot
preload
then we'll write here add class so we'll
add a class over here
we'll add classes loaded we have already
written the CSS part for this loaded
class
now we are done with this part save the
program and
will open this website with live server
again and you can see the preloader is
not here as of now we'll move back to
the CSS part we have commented it out so
that it will be easy for us to work on
the
other CSS parts so we'll remove this
comment from here
will paste it here fine save the program
now
save the JS file as well so here you can
see we have the preloader over here
now the next thing we need to do is we
need to write the code for
nav toggle so we'll write here dollar
again we'll write here document
then we'll use the ready function so
we'll write here ready
then we'll write your function
so what we'll do is we'll keep all this
code inside document dot ready function
so we'll paste it over here first save
it now
let's see if
this thing works or not
so here you can see the preloader is we
are getting it again and again so it's
not stopping as of now what we'll do
next is we'll
move back to the Javascript file and
we'll write the code again here
now
what we'll do here is we'll write here
the code for nav toggle so we'll write
here dollar then we are going to access
the nav toggle class we'll write in nav
toggle
then we'll write a click
then we'll write your function
and inside the body of this function
we'll write dollar
we'll write Dot
header space dot next we are going to
access two different classes then we'll
write a slide
toggle fine so we'll use the slide
toggle function from jQuery
then after this what we'll do is we'll
write here
dollar and then we'll again access these
two classes along with the anchor tag so
we'll write here Dot
header then we have Dot
nav then we'll access the anchor tag
then we'll write here dot click
will create a function for this we'll
write your function
and now what we'll do is we'll write a
if
we'll write here
dollar then we'll write inside this
window
dot width
and if the width is going to be less
than
768
what will happen is
the
header and the navigation bar will
toggle they will slide toggle again so
we'll write here dot header Dot
nav
then we'll write your dot slide toggle
again we'll call the slide toggle method
once again here
so we are done with this part save the
program
for now what we'll do is we'll
save the CSS file and the index file as
well
access this with live server again and
here we are in the website
reduce the size and
you can see the slide toggle method is
working totally fine we have about
we have this category section over here
we have top rated and we have contact so
each section is working according to our
need
so the website is working totally fine
as of now
the next thing we have to write here
inside
a Javascript file is for the fixed
header so what we'll do is we'll
write a comment over here we'll write
fixed header because we are going to
write the code for fixed header now so
we'll write here dollar
then we'll use the whole window then
we'll write here scroll
will create a function over here now
inside this function now inside the body
of this function basically what we'll do
is we'll write a if
dollar then we will use this
Dot
crawl top
so we have to write a scroll top
and this is a method so we'll write here
if scroll top is greater than 100
what will happen is we'll write here
dollar
then we'll again access the header so
we'll write here header
and we'll right here add
class so we are going to add the fixed
class over here we'll write your fixed
and we'll write the code for else part
as well fine so we'll write here else
what happened inside the else block is
going to be dollar
then we have to write here
inside this Dot
header
then we have to write here
Dot
remove class
and we have to remove the fixed class
fine
so we are done with this part as we are
done with the fixed header part move
back to the website and you can see the
header is fixed now
so you can see
the header is over here in all the pages
so it's working totally fine as of now
now let's move ahead and now we'll write
the code for smooth scrolling to all the
links fine so we'll write here dollar
will access the anchor tag so we'll
write here a inside double inverted
commas then we'll write here on we are
going to use the click event we'll write
a click will create a function again
we'll write your function now inside the
body of this function
what we have to do is we have to make
sure that this dot hash has a value
before overriding default Behavior so if
we write here if
then we have to write here this dot hash
not equals to
and we have to put a space over here
then inside this we have to prevent the
default anchor click Behavior we'll
write here event
Dot
prevent default so this is a predefined
function
now what we'll do is we'll store the
value of hash inside a variable so let's
say we are using the where hash
now we'll write here is equals to this
dot hash
now we have the
hash variable present inside hash so we
have the value of hash basically present
inside the hash variable now we'll use
jquery's animate method to add smooth
page scroll so the optional number which
is 800 it specifies the number of
milliseconds it takes to scroll to the
specified area
so for that what we'll do is we'll write
here
dollar
will write here HTML
comma body so we are going to use these
two text then we'll write here animate
so inside this animate function what we
have to do is we have to define the
properties as well so we'll write here
scroll top scroll top is going to be
dollar then we have to access hash over
here then we'll write here offset
we have to call this offset method we'll
write a DOT
fine
now we have to pass the timer as well so
we'll write here 800 in milliseconds and
we have to create another function over
here inside this function now inside
this function we'll have use
hash to URL when done scrolling so
default click Behavior basically so
we'll write here
window
dot location
dot hash fine is equals to hash
okay so we have to write here function
so the spelling mistake we have over
here so we are done with this the if
statement ends over here now what we
have to do next is we have to set light
box image Max site so for that what
we'll do is we'll write here
will take a constant we'll write a const
W height so let's say this is a variable
we'll write here dollar
then we'll access the whole window we'll
write a DOT window then we'll write here
dot height
and we'll call this method then we'll
write here dollar
will access the lightbox image class so
we'll write here Dot light box
image so we'll write here lightbox dot
image we'll use the CSS property so
we'll I write yes dot CSS then we'll
write your max height
so we'll write your max height
and we'll write here
W height
Plus
pixels fine so we'll write a pixels
inside double inverted commas
now we have to do this for light box as
well so we'll write here
after this
dollar again well right here
dot work item
so basically we are taking the top rated
movies
the inner part from the so we'll write a
DOT inner then we'll write here Dot
click we'll create a function for this
so we'll write your function now inside
the body of this function what we have
to do is we have to write here index
index is going to be dollar
this
Dot parent
and inside here we'll mention the work
item class so we'll write your work
item
then we'll write here dot index
X and in the next line we'll write here
dollar
light box again
so we'll write here dollar dot lightbox
then we'll write here dot add class so
we'll
add the open class over here
so we'll write here dot open
and we have to call a method now so
we'll write here tallest slide box
slideshow
and we are good to go with it in the
next slide what we have to do is we have
to write the code for previous and next
button so we'll write here
dollar
we are going to access
the light box
ref class so we'll write here dot
lightbox dot prep
then we'll write here dot click on
clicking the button what we have to do
is we have to call a function we'll
write your function now inside the body
of this function we'll write here if
index
is equals to 0.
then what will happen is we'll write
here
index
is equals to Total work items minus 1 so
we'll write here total work items
minus 1 so we have taken this variable
initially if you can see here the
initial value of this items was the
length of the work item
so we'll mention it over here now we
have to mention the else part as well
we'll write it else
and inside this will write index minus
minus fine
now after this what we have to do is we
have to call the light box
slideshow method again
and we are done with the previous part
now we have to do the same thing for the
next part so we'll write here dollar
Dot
light box
and then we'll access the next class
then we'll write here dot click
will call a function we'll create this
function now inside the body of this
function we'll write if
index is equals to is equals to Total
work items
minus 1
then index is going to be
0
and we'll write the else part as well
we'll write here else
and inside else will increase the value
of index we'll write here index plus
plus and once again we are going to call
this light box slideshow method
over here fine now we are done with
these two parts what we have to do is we
have to close the light boxes so we are
going to write the code for that now
we'll write here dollar
will write here
lightbox
then we'll
use the lightbox close class over here
we'll write here dot click
will create a function for this
and inside here we'll write
dollar
we are going to remove this class
basically we are going to remove this
open class so we'll write here Dot
light box
Dot
remove class
which class we are going to remove is
the Open Class fine
so what we want to do next is we want to
close the light box when clicked outside
of the image box as well so I'll write
the code for that part as well we'll
write your dollar
and we'll write here light box
we'll write here dot click
will write here function
we are going to create an event now so
we'll write here event
now inside the body of this function
we'll write if
dollar
event
Dot Target
dot has class
so we'll write here Dot
lightbox
we have to create the body so we'll
write here dollar

remove the class as open
so we are done with this as well
now the next part is to create the
function lightbox slideshow fine so for
that we'll write here

function and we are going to create it
we'll write here const
IMG SRC
is equals to

Dot
work item so we'll write your work item
then we'll write a DOT EQ
index
so basically we are taking the index we
are going to find the image we'll write
here dot find
we'll write IMG inside this and then
we'll write attribute over here so we'll
write attribute attribute is data launch
fine so we'll write here data large
and
then we have to take another constant so
we'll write here const
category
category is going to be dollar
then we have to access the work item
class again so we'll write your work

then we'll do the same thing again we'll
write here dot EQ index
then we'll write here dot find
now inside find we have to mention H4
