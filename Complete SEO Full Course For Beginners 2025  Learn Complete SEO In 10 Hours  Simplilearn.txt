Ado let's get started SEO is also known
as search engine optimization and if you
look up the definition of SEO on Google
it's going to say that it's a set of
practices designed to improve the
appearance and positioning of web pages
in organic search results but what
exactly does that mean well let's
pretend like the entire internet was a
library and the books inside of the
library were individual websites if you
wanted to go to the library and pick up
a book on gardening you would probably
search a database and this database
would organize the millions of books in
the library based off of how related
they are to your search query and how
good they are so the top suggestion for
the right book would not only be related
to gardening but it would be highly
rated and this is exactly what Google
does as well when you have search
queries when you type in a query to a
search engine like Google it exhibits
the best answer so how do you get your
website to rank at the top of Google and
be suggested as the best answer well
that's basically what SEO is all about
you optimize your website for the search
engine and by doing this your website is
going to get featured at the top of
Google and When It's featured at the top
of Google it's going to get a lot more
traffic and this isn't just any type of
traffic if the search engine does a good
job it's going to be the type of traffic
that is highly related to the topic that
you're writing about so if you're
writing about gardening for instance
these are going to be people who are
very interested in the subject of
gardening and the more people that are
on your website sitee the more money you
can get paid from AdSense affiliate
marketing as well as selling your own
products so whether you're trying to
create your own website or you work
professionally as a digital marketer
that specializes in SEO this can be an
incredibly valuable skill set one of the
greatest things about finding your
website organically or naturally using
SEO is the fact that not only is the
traffic highly targeted but it's free
you don't have to pay for ads in order
to get these customers now let's go over
the different types of SEO the first
type of SEO is internal or onpage SEO
this SEO deals with the modifications of
the website that you own this is where
you optimize certain aspects of your
website so that it gains heightened
chances of being suggested to the public
your goal here is to increase your
website's chances of being chosen by a
search engine to a query examples of
good practices with onpage SEO are going
to be having title tags using HTML
headers having content that's relevant
having content that's high quality using
using metad descriptions with your
website to increase website ranking
using interlinking techniques between
different articles on your website and
using your websites content to guide
visitors into other content on the
website itself the second type of SEO is
external or off-page seo off-page seo
deals with the external factors that can
affect your website's popularity a few
examples of off-page SEO are using other
traffic sources to get people to your
website for instance writing a really
valuable article and then posting it on
a forum to get people to view it another
thing you could do is reach out to a
famous influencer and have them shout
your website out also having backlinks
to your website from your social media
and having people actually follow those
back links to the blog itself and then
of course having other blogs link back
to your blog especially if those blogs
have high levels of authority and
authority basically means how much the
blog is respected by the search engine
the third type of SEO is technical SEO
technical SEO talks about the structure
and organization of your website some
examples of technical SEO are ensuring
that your website is logically built
improving your website's user interface
speeding up your website's loading time
making sure that your website is adapted
to mobile users optimizing your own
links and URLs and avoiding repetitive
content next let's talk about the
specific benefits of SEO after all it
typically does take years of doing SEO
before you can build your blog up to the
point where you're making making a
full-time income from it so why would
business owners invest in search engine
optimization when they can just pay for
ads and then get money right away well
first of all with SEO you do actually
have an opportunity to build a massive
audience it just takes time and these
are random people who have never met you
before that discover you organically and
the fact that they discover you
organically rather through an ad often
times makes them trust and like you more
so why is organic traffic so important
well if people discover you organically
and they benefit from your website you
can actually have a pixel on your
website that will retarget them with
paid ads the third thing is that SEO is
free this is pretty obvious but it's
nice to be able to advertise and acquire
customers for free the next point is
that SEO produces consistent traffic
typically when you build your blog up to
the point where it's getting let's say
10,000 viewers per month you're going to
continue getting 10,000 viewers per
month even if you stop working well into
the future the reason for this is
because your article rank for certain
keywords and they'll continue ranking
for a long time into the future a lot of
the time people who create blogs will
work really hard on them for about one
or two years and then after that they
just basically do maintenance on all of
the Articles and they update them every
once in a while and then repost them
often times YouTube channels for
instance can die but blogs are typically
more Evergreen and can last for decades
Google processes about 63,000 queries a
second and 5.6 billion queries a day so
if you can consistently create valuable
relevant content over a period of time
Google will trust you enough to rank
your blog on the first page and that's
why SEO is one of the most valuable
skills that you can learn ever wondered
how websites appear at the top of the
search results when you type a query
into Google well that's the magic of seo
seo stands for search engine
optimization and it's the process of
fine-tuning your website to rank higher
in organic that is unpaid search results
in simple terms SEO is all about making
your websites more visible to people who
are searching for the things online when
someone types a question or a topic into
search engine like Google SEO helps your
website appear higher up in the list of
search results this means more people
are likely to click on your website just
like how you are more likely to visit
the shops on the Main Street than those
tucked away in an LA study shows that
organic search drives are whooping 53%
of all website traffic in fact a recent
survey by Moos revealed that 61% of
marketers consider SEO to be the most
effective digital marketing strategy so
in this video we will cover what is SEO
types of SEO how does SEO work things to
keep in mind while doing SEO also if
craving a career upgrade subscribe like
and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to fast track your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back if you are interested in advancing
your career consider por University's

dedicated resources all right so let's
start with the first topic which is what
is SEO imagine you have a fantastic
store but it's hidden down a dark Alle
SEO is like putting a bright lights and
clear signs so people can easily find
you online that's what SEO stands for
that is search engine optimization it's
about making your website more visible
in search engines like Google when
people search for something search engin
use complex algorithms to rank websites
SE helps your website take the right
boxes for these algorithms good SE means
your website appears higher in search
results which can lead to more visitors
and potential customers it's like
putting up the big sign outside your
shop so more people know you are there
when your website ranks higher in search
results it's like having a prime real
estate in the digital world studies
shows that most people don't click past
the first page of search results so
being at the top can make a big
difference in how much traffic your site
gets SEO isn't just about getting more
visitors though it's also about
attracting the right kind of visitors
people who are interested in what you
offer and are more likely to become
customers or engage with your content by
understanding what people are searching
for and optimizing your website to match
those queries you can connect with your
starget audience more effectively so
this was about SEO now let's understand
about the three typ typ of SE all right
there are three main types of SEO you
need to know about first one is
technical optimization so this is like
the backstage work of su it involves
doing things on a websites that improve
its performance in search engines but
people don't see them for example
submitting your website sit map to
Google helps search engines understand
and index your site better the next one
is on page optimization this is about
making sure that your content on your
website is topnotch and relevant to what
people are searching for you do this by
using the right keywords in your content
and providing a great user experience
it's like making sure your website is
likable and helpful to visitors the next
is off-page optimization so this type of
SEO happens outside of your website it's
all about building your website
reputation and Authority on the internet
one big way to do this is by getting
other reputable websites to link to
yours these links called back links tell
search engines that your website is
trustworthy and valuable by
understanding and working on these three
types of SEO you can boost your
website's visibility and attract more
visitors helping your business Thrive
online so this was about the types of
SEO now let's understand how does SEO
work so basically there are some steps
to how does SEO works first search
engine crawling search engines like
Google use automated programs called
crawlers or spiders to browse the web so
these crawlers follow links from one web
page to another collecting information
about each page they visit they gather
data on the content structure and other
elements of the web pages which is then
stored in the search engines database
now next one is search engine indexing
once the Crawlers collect information
about web pages the data is organized
and stored in a massive database called
an index the indexing process involves
analyzing the content keywords metatags
and other factors to understand what
each web page is about
this index information allows search
engines to quickly retrieve relevant
results when someone performs a search
query all right now the third one which
is search engine ranking when a user
enters a search query the search engines
algorithms shift through the index pages
to determine which ones are most
relevant to the query the algorithm
considers various factors like keyword
relevance content quality website
Authority user experience and more to
rank the pages the pages that best
matches the search query and meet the
algorithms criteria appear higher in the
search engine results Pages websites
with strong Su practices including
optimized content quality backlinks and
user friendly design are more likely to
rank higher in search results so in
summary SEO that is search engine
optimization boost a website's
visibility online we discussed three
types on page focuses on content off
page build site Authority and Technical
ensures smooth site operation SE
involves understanding how search
engines find organ and rank websites to
succeed maintain quality content use
relevant keywords and earn trustworthy
backlinks regularly Track Performance to
refine strategies remember SE is an
ongoing effort requiring adaptation to
Industry changes for sustained online
success basically Google follows three
basic steps to rank a website they need
to crawl your website they need to take
what they crawl back to their servers
and when they take it back to their
servers your your web pages they need to
you have them available for indexing so
when somebody actually types in a
keyword into google.com it'll be
available to be found on organic search
so that's what indexing is all about and
then Google's job when somebody does
type in a search query is to basically
rank th those pages that they've indexed
from number one to Infinity depending on
how many pages are relevant to that
search query so really it's about
crawling indexing and ranking so so
prowling is simply a process done by
which Google has Bots and what these
Bots do is they go to your web server
and they're going to crawl every page
that they can find and how do they find
these Pages well they basically follow
links you might have heard the term
spidering but that's what they call
search engine spidering so basically
what Google's doing is they're building
a web so to speak all the links that
they're following and so when they can
follow all these links on your website
they going to be able to crawl them and
when they crawl them basically they're
going to take that content and store it
on their servers so it's available in
their index So based on this method
Google finds out which websites have
relevant content and which ones don't
based on certain keywords that are typed
into Google because if they can't crawl
your website you're not going to be
found and if you can't be found then
you're not going to show up for Relevant
keyword so we need to make sure your
sites available be crawled and we'll
talk about that a little bit later okay
but what show you an example so let's
just go to Google Search and if I type
in the keyword simply learn okay I can
see I have 1,10,000 results okay and
that's how many results are showing up
for simply learn okay now they may not
all be simply learned pages but
nonetheless simply learned is rank
number one here organically and there
are
1,10,000 Pages related to the keyword
simply learn now when you come comes to
organic search uh we don't want to get
it confused with paid search so anytime
you see paid search you're going to see
something that says add next to it okay
so we could see that there are paid ads
here but when it comes to organic search
those are generally below paid ads and
so that's where Google counts the
1,10,000 results and so that's the whole
idea behind crawling and indexing
Google's able to crawl simply learns
website and based on all the pages that
they gather they're going to make those
pages available in organic search so if
you type in a keyword and your web page
is not available for indexing then
you're never going to show up for that
keyword so that's why it's important to
make sure your website is available for
crawling and indexing and so when a user
types a query on search Google search
the most relevant websites that are in
Google's index are going appear in the
search results so in the example I gave
uh with simply learn well simply learn
is the brand name of the company simply
learn so there's a lot of relevancy
there so that's why you see simply learn
show up here organically number one like
we mentioned about what is SEO and why
SEO we talked about that user experience
so there's a lot of factors that go into
ranking relevancy being one of them so
in the simply learn example simply learn
is relevant to a lot of the simply learn
Pages because that's who they are simply
learn however ever simply learn also
needs to make sure that you know for
their Pages the page load time is fast
meaning these Pages load very fast for
the end user and Google also takes into
account other factors like how long
someone is staying on a website or are
they bouncing meaning are they going to
one page that they land on and then
leaving the website okay and so the user
experience is very very important there
are other factors also like language and
location and so for example
if you do a search say in India the
results are going to be a little bit
different than say the results in the
United States why because Google is
indexing as many web pages as they can
find so if somebody's doing a search in
India their results may be a little bit
different than the results show up in
the US because Google has different Bots
and these Bots are crawling different
pages at different times and so Google's
index is updating continuously but it's
not real time syncing so if you do a
search in India you may not see exactly
the same thing because both search
engines the Google in India and the
Google in the US are may not be exactly
synced up so an example would be you
know if you're looking for Cafe so if
you search a cafe in say San Francisco
you're going to see different results
now if you do a search for cafes in
Mumbai you're going to see different
results there's going to be local search
here at the top there may be some paid
search but again you may see different
results because one location but two
Google search engines in India and
United States google.com aren't exactly
synced up exactly at the same exact time
you do that search so location is
important language is important and
relevancy is important along with user
experience so all those are important
factors in how Google ranks websites so
keyword research is like finding the
words people type into search engines
it's vital for online success picture it
as using the right words to get noticed
on Google by knowing that words people
use you can make your content match what
they're looking for this is crucial
because it means the right people find
your website it's not just about being
at the top of the Google it's about
talking in a way that makes sense to
your audience keyword research is like a
guide helping you know where your
audience is looking it's the key to
making sure your website is easy to find
and has what people are searching for
the significance of research lies in its
ability to align your online presence
with the actual language your audience
uses it ensures that your content
resonates with their queries attracting
a relevant audience interest in your
offerings essentially keyword research
is a strategic tool that not only boosts
search engine rankings but also
establishes a connection between your
content and specific terms your audience
employees making your online presence
both accessible and meaningful all right
so this was about what is keyword
research and why is it important now
let's understand how to do a keyword
research using chat gbt for that let's
go to google.com so as you can see we
have opened Google Now all we have to do
is to write first of all we'll write
aipm AI PM all right so AI PRM or a PRM
for chat gbt you can type now let's open
the first link we'll click on the first
link so this is basically an extension
it is a Marketplace of prompts they
provide you prompts that you don't have
to type the whole prompt they have
pre-made prompts that you can use all
right now we can click on this add to
Chrome button over here ADD
extension right
so as you can see this is a whole new
outlook of this chat gbt this is aipm
prompt extension so basically they give
you pre-made prompts as you can see this
you used SE optimized content writer
fully SE optimized article including so
there are numerous as we can see 4 580
prompts so you can choose accordingly
whichever prompt you want and you can
also search over here and this is topic
activity sought by by you can also sort
and prompts SP page you can customize it
according to yourself so as you can see
here is the topic uh we can go to topic
and we can select so we want to
basically do a keyword research we'll go
to SEO we'll click on SEO after that in
activity we can select this uh keywords
all right now as we can see there are
numerous prompts according to what we
have selected that YouTube SEO keyword
generator SEO optim your Google business
profile Etc so we can select as per our
choice so what I have figured out which
is best is this one keyword analysis I
repeat keyword analysis so as we can see
find the table of best keywords with
search volume CPC paid difficulty Su
difficulty so for those who don't know
about uh CPC so uh CPC or cost per click
is a measure in online advertising that
represents the amount you pay when
someone clicks on your ad
it's essentially the cost of each
interaction with your advertisement
higher the CPC values often indicate
more competitive keywords or advertising
spaces and as you can see pay difficulty
is also written so pay difficulty refers
to how challenging it is to compete for
a particular keyword in paid advertising
a higher paid difficulty score means
that it might be more expensive or
competitive to bid for that keyword in
paid search campaigns
so now there is SEO difficulty so SEO
difficulty basically is a measure of how
hard it is to rank organically for a
specific keyword in search engine
results a higher Su difficulty suggests
that it might be more challenging to
optimize your content to appear higher
in unpaid organic search results for
that keyword it takes into account
factors like competition and the
existing strength of other Pages ranking
for the same keyword so these are the
meanings of these things as we can see
so we have already clicked on this now
as you can see seed keyword that you
search for so let's say uh I'm searching
for cloud computing let's
say cloud computing and let's click on
this so as we can see they are creating
all this now let's explore keywords
related to cloud computing along with
the respective search volume
all right so as you can see keyword
these are the keywords that we got and
these are the search volumes so we all
know what search volume is the number of
searches and the CPC as we already
discussed what is CPC again if somebody
wants to know about it CPC or cost by
click is a measure in online advertising
that represents the amount you pay when
someone clicks on your ad so these are
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on these ads all right so pay difficulty
again it refers to how challenging it is
to compete for a particular keyword in
paid advertising so this is paid
difficulty of each of these keywords
then SEO difficulty SE difficulty is a
measure of how hard it is to rank
organically for a specific keyword in
search engine results so these are the
uh Su difficulty so we can select
accordingly and the table index is a mix
of 100 keywords including longtail LSI
so longtail keywords are also there as
you can see we'll discuss longtail
keywords also after this so this is how
you can do keyword research using chat
GPT we'll do one or two more demos
regarding this so let's do another
example so we are going to select
keyword analysis and then we'll have to
put seed keyword remember to select SEO
first of all here we can see SEO and
then in activity you have to select
keywords because we are doing the
keyword research all right now after
selecting this keyword analysis we want
Bas we basically want all the these
things like search volume CPC PID
difficulty s difficulty so that we can
choose the right keywords accordingly so
let's see here we have to put the seed
keyword so let's say the seed keyword is
let's say
devops all right let's click on
this so they are giving us the keywords
a lot of keywords they usually give
let's explore the keyword analysis for
devops so as you can see high search
volume very high search volume High so
these search volumes regarding these
keywords are shown and the CPC is also
showing and paid difficulty SEO
difficulty as well so we basically want
the SE difficulty is to minimum like
minimum or like medium so we can search
or extract those keywords accordingly so
they have written this table includes a
mix of 100 relevant longtail keywords
LSI keywords and FAQ related to devops
it provides insights into search volume
CPC cost click pay difficulty and SE
difficulty to help optimize your content
and reach the target audience
effectively so through this you can
select these keywords and I think if you
click on continue it'll keep on going
for more keywords so as you can see
longtail keywords now it is showing so
these are LSI keywords so we will
discuss these uh terms longtail longtail
keywords LSI keywords after some time
later in this I repeat later in this
video so this is how you can simply do a
keyword research using chat GPT again
this keyword research is completely free
you have you don't have to pay a single
Buck regarding this now let's try
another method of doing a keyword
research for that all we have to do is
to go to Google and we'll
type
keywords
everywhere all right so here's the first
link let's click on this this is another
extension install for Chrome we'll click
on install for Chrome now let it open
and now we can click on add to Chrome to
just add this extension in our Chrome
browser as you can see ADD extension so
I think it is added now now all we have
to do is to pin this one all right so
now uh let's go to Chad GPT let's open a
new
one so as you can see this is keywords
everywhere icon please continue as you
can see clarify explain rewrite so for
that use this extensions powers or
functionality all we have to do is to
click on this template button all right
now here the thing is first of all we'll
select choose a category similarly that
we have done previously choose a
category so as you can see copy writing
marketing SEO social media productivity
professionals we'll select SEO because
we want to do keyword research then in
subcategory we can select keyword
research and because we want to do
keyword research then there's a template
so here we can see first is keyword
strategy so you can click on keyword
strategy if you want to do basically a
strategize the keyword so basically I'll
tell you what keyword strategy is
keyword strategy involves planning like
how to use specific words or phrases in
your content to achieve specific goals
like it's about selecting and targeting
keywords that align with your overall
objectives whether it's to boost website
traffic increase conversions or enhance
your online visibility then there is get
search intent for keywords so it I
repeat so it itself tells what it is
like intent understanding search intent
for keywords means grasping the reason
behind someone online search it involves
figuring out what a person is looking
for when they type a particular keyword
into a search engine aligning your
content with users intent ensures that
your information meets their needs
improving the relevance of your content
then here is related keyword generator
so a related keyword generator is a term
or phrase closely connected to the main
keyword you're targeting including
related keywords in your content help
search engines understand the content
and relevance of your page it's a way to
capture a broader range of search
queries related to your main topic then
there is longtail Gord so basically a
longtail keyword is a more specific and
detailed phrase usually consisting of
three or more words while these phrases
may have lower search volumes
individually they often attract a more
targeted audience longtail keywords can
be valuable for Niche topics are
generally easier to rank for than
broader more competitive terms so these
are all these things so let's say first
of all I want to search for related
keyword generator and so first of all as
you can see category SEO subcategory
keyword research templates select
accordingly whichever you want I've
explained all these related keyword
generator I want basically when we'll
select related keyword generator this
will come up language is English we want
in English English only here is the seed
keyword we'll have to write this is
total keywords how many keywords do we
want we can select accordingly basically
I want 40 itself so this is a prompt
template that automatically gets created
whenever you select a particular
template so let's say if I want to
select keyword strategy so it'll create
itself a different kind of prompt so if
I'll select long tail then a different
kind of prompt will be generated so this
is a self-made itself it will create a
prompt all you have have to do is to
write a seed keyword over here so let's
say as I said I want related keyword
generator and let's type here
devops all right so total keywords I
want 40 itself I'll click on execute
template all right so these are the 40
keywords that we wanted so related
keyword generator continues integration
infrastructure as code Dockers
kubernetes shenkin and they're also
telling me the search intent
informational so all of these keywords
are informational so firstly they'll
create a table regarding these keywords
after that they will basically list of
same keywords separated by commas as we
can see same keywords are separated by
commas so that you can easily use them
wherever you want all right so this we
have selected for the what we call
Related key generator now let's select
another one let's click on template
again we'll go to related or let's say
longtail keyword generator now we'll put
devops
again
yes all right so as you can
see I think we'll have to select another
new chat we'll have to create all right
now again we'll go to template longtail
keyword generator devops and let's say
this time we want
50 all right so we'll see whenever we
are doing this editing
here also it is getting edited so let's
type 60 then it will get 60 and whenever
we'll type devops this will also get
edited as you can see so this is a
prompt now we'll click on execute
template let's see how it
goes so these are basically a longtail
keywords as you can see not a single
keyword devops best practices kubernets
deployment genis automation site
reliability engineer Etc basically the
search intent of all these keywords is
like informational this one we can see
commercial commercial transactional
deployment so they also show the search
intent and these all are the keywords
separated with commas there are 60 total
keywords now let's do another one we'll
go to template and we'll type let's say
this time we'll type mobile itself now
let's see the keyword strategy for
mobile we have typed mobile as a seat
keyword now execute
template so as you can see category
keyword search intent title and they're
also telling us the title about as you
can see Let It complete this one then
we'll show this so it has generated the
table as you can see please note that
this table includes 24 entries to
maintain Clarity and conciseness if you
need additional keywords or adjustments
feel free to let me know we can click on
this continue to create more but let's
first just see as we can see first of
all types here there is device types
category mobile phone search intent
navigational and we can see title is
also there if we'll click on this as you
can see title search intent title
essential guide to choosing the perfect
mobile let's open this essential guide
to choosing the perfect mobile phone
description also is there for your

our comprehensive guide on selecting an
IDE mobile so description they also
provide a complete description is there

it clearly so in Excel sheet you can
easily uh figure out what all keywords
you want to use in your content or your
article so this these two extensions are
important for you if you want to do
keyword research using chat GPT and make
your work easy these two extensions are
completely free so feel free to use them
one is aipm and another one is keywords
everywhere on page optimization as the
name suggests is the practice of
optimizing web pages to rank higher and
get relevant traffic from the search
engine onpage optimization includes both
content and HTML source code
optimization search engine optimization
can be very complex so when you're
trying to understand it for the first
time time I find it very easy just to
break it up into general concepts that
you might already have an understanding
of when you look at the hundreds of
signals that go into SEO they can be
broken up into either relevancy or
because sometimes it's both popularity
so relevancy and popularity out of all
these signals they fit into one of these
two things we're going to break all the
signals we have into these two areas in
this section we're going to talk about
the onpage factors that's because these
are the factors that you have direct
impact upon and you can make a small
tweak and have a big impact with Organic
traffic with your onpage relevancy
factors the primary onpage relevancy
factors that I'll cover in this lesson
are title tags and meta descriptions
header tags which are used for headlines
and subheadings website URLs and URL
structure image alt text internal links
keyword usage and site Maps let's start
with one of my favorites and that is the
title tag this is also called a page
title the page title is not shown on the
page now rather it is displayed on the
browser Tab and this is what makes it
highly important is that in addition to
being displayed on the browser tab it is
also the title tag or the page title
that is shown on the text in the Google
search results as the link to the page
the page title influences both the click
rates and people's first impressions of
our website next up we have the meta
description Now The Meta description can
be a bit confusing the metad description
is in the code and it does not influence
rankings but it does influence
clicks people will see your snippet or
your page information in the search
engine results that gray text is the
metad description deson if you don't
have a meta description then it may pull
information from the
page you can affect this and improve the
chances of your metad description
appearing if you write a short
descriptive phrase of the content or the
purpose of the
page and just because we edit these
elements does not guarantee that they
will show up I often say that we affect
the change but we cannot control it this
is because the search engine May
override your changes and show different
different content in these
areas sometimes it may help and it might
be a better description but many times
it's
not now let's go to the next element the
header tags these are also referred to
as the heading and
subheading and this is how HTML was
built when the web was first
created it enables a logical hierarchy
of content so starting with a headline
then displaying a subheading
and then subheadings after that the idea
here is that you're establishing a
hierarchy of information so you start
with the H1 like a newspaper there's
only one main headline per page it
describes the main purpose of the page
then a subheading the H2 this is how you
break the subc content into
subcategories obviously you'll want to
use a keyword in there as well you see
by describing the purpose of the page in
the headline and then again in a
subheading you're naturally going to use
your primary and secondary keywords
because you're going to associate them
with the product or the purpose and the
benefit the key is to keep it short you
see after the headline are the
subcategories the H2S and then your H3
is typically used as a paragraph heading
now putting the keyword in these
headings Al loone does not make your
page optimized remember the purpose is
to provide a quick reference for people
to find the content they need within
seconds so short explanatory heading and
subheadings paragraph headings are very
effective and naturally you'll be using
keywords to help people locate the
information that is most important to
them now if we go back to the search
engine results page the Ser there is
another element in that listing the page
title is the large Blue text The Meta
description is the gray text now the
green text is the URL of the page that
is listed this is the address of the
page just like the address for your home
the internet knows that the URL is the
address for that page this is extremely
important for SEO for a variety of
reasons the most important though is
your keyword usage I like to make sure
that I have at least one Relevant Word
in the URL now now also here keep it
short one of the worst things you can do
is have a URL full of keywords or even
worse hyphenate them all remember people
use these
URLs they provide context for the page
people also copy and paste URLs into
Mobile messages emails and Social Links
so it is extremely important to keep
these short succinct and I like to say
readable now I've just briefly touched
about the importance of the UR URL and
now let's look at the URL
structure first let's start with the
primary core of the URL the domain name
in the example with the URL I have here
example.com that's the domain name so
this is the first thing that people see
with your online business now be on the
internet this is going to be what's in
all of your ads emails brochures
business cards and online your social
profiles all of your marketing efforts
are going to drive people to this domain
there's a lot of advice about buying or
using domains that have your keywords in
them and unfortunately domains have been
being sold for decades so there's less
chance of finding a domain with the
keywords you want now the search engines
don't make the keyword used in the
domain a primary ranking signal so
that's good however the domain is your
business it needs to be memorable if you
have a very I call it a spammy looking
domain name with mult mple words and
hyphens or one that's hard to spell or
confusing people are going to make an
initial impression off of that so make
sure you have something that's going to
make a great first impression here's the
rule for a domain name something that's
easy to spell and easy to pronounce
ideally sure it's something you can type
and share something you're going to be
able to put on a business card and be
proud of not something that you bought
primarily because you want it for SEO
reasons and you think with that that
you're going to succeed as an example
just think about Amazon their domain
name says nothing about books and yet it
grew to be one of the largest eCommerce
companies in the world the same with
Alibaba or Google their domain names
were not the keyword but their marketing
and branding built their company now
everything after the domain is a
subdirectory this is based on your
website organization as an example if
you have a website selling shoes then
the subdirectory can be called shoes
it's easy right the subdirectory is the
folder that contains the relevant files
or Pages for that group think of a file
folder with documents inside the file
folder is usually based on a major
category of content or products now
inside the folder are individual
documents or Pages these files or Pages
usually come after the subdirectory in
this example you see the file. HTML the
next step in optimizing the URL is to
name the page in a way that explains the
content of the page to use our
e-commerce shoe website a page name
would usually be a specific product name
this way you would end up with domain
name SL shoes as the category SL brand
name running shoe insert that here if
you've ever looked at the HTML that make
up the instructions of the page you'll
understand a bit more of how search
engines get the information from the
page the text on the page and the markup
such as the headings provide
instructions as to where the text is
located the importance and prominence of
the text in addition to the arrangement
of the overall page HTML is a set of
instructions for a browser to assemble
the page and the search engines use that
as well now the search engines spiders
cannot see images as the internet
developed many attributes were added to
provide for accessibility and additional
features users that are site impaired
cannot see
images and the alternative text tag
describes the image further there are
many times when our bandwidth isn't
strong and not all of the images will
load in that case we need the alt text
description to provide the context of
the image and its purpose search engines
use this alt text description to gain
additional context about the page the
content of the image and its purpose now
we have an entire section on links but
at this point I just want to cover
internal links an internal link is a
link from one page on your website to
another page of your own website now
this is important from a relevancy
perspective you'll see internal links in
your main
navigation you'll likely have a link
that says home one that says contact us
or about our company what you're showing
to search engines and to humans is that
this section if you click on this link
is about our company or this is where
you find our contact
information you see these links are not
votes like external links however they
provide relevance and context to the
information on your own
website let's dive in a little more on
keywords when a search engine crawls and
processes your website it doesn't simply
look for the instances of specific
keywords it's a lot more complex than
that it's using a technology called
natural language
processing natural language processing
uses algorithms to try to understand the
meaning of text you see search engine
processing is attempting to be human
this is the same way that people see and
hear the words and we're using the words
to find the meaning expressed in the
words similarly when a search engine
goes to your website it may seek
keywords but it's looking for the
context of those words you may say
football but just having the word
football repeated throughout your
website isn't going to help you rank
specifically for football what you need
to do and what is more common in actual
human conversation happens very
naturally when we talk about football we
use naturally additional words such as
goal and referee and World Cup you see
Google and the other search engines are
going to take these into account by
usage of other synonyms and other common
words you present present the context of
a bigger broader idea for your website
the next site signal that we have is
site Maps now there are two kinds of
site Maps there's the site map that is
for humans and there is the site map
that are for search engine robots
crawlers or
spiders the one that is for human is
called an HTML sitemap you've probably
seen these before the link is generally
in the footer of a website if you click
on it it shows you the major sections of
the website provides some search
functionality but looking at it as a
human it shows you the hierarchy of the
website and where to find important
information it shows how everything fits
together now there's something else that
exists called an XML sitemap it's not
linked from any page of your website but
exists as an independent file on your
server now this is something you can see
but it is for added for search engine
spiders using a programming language
called XML it shows the hierarchy and
the priority of each of the URLs of the
website every page every document every
image and it also shows the date that
each page was last updated or
changed so at this point we've covered a
lot of things that are important and
things that you should be doing when
optimizing your onpage content now let's
go a different direction and cover
things that you should not be doing
keyword stuffing hidden text repetitive
anchor text and cloaking the first one
is keyword stuffing now back in the
early days of search engine optimization
people used to increase the instances of
words on the page now this is well
before natural language processing at
that time search engines were looking
for occurrences of specific words well
search engines they're very smart about
this what may have worked 20 years years
ago or 10 years ago keyword stuffing
does not work you're not going to rank
better for any given phrase by including
it a dozen or more times on the page in
fact you might get an over optimization
penalty by constantly repeating the same
word over and over focus on writing
content that engages with your visitors
and uses language naturally now the next
one is hidden text unfortunately I still
see this this is when you write content
that is is solely for search engines and
not for people now typically is
attempted by writing a lot of repetitive
keywords as text coloring it white and
placing it against a white background
you see this was developed as another
way to add more keyword stuffed text
without the user seeing the overuse of
keywords now it didn't work too well in
the past and it definitely does not work
today this tactic backfires in two ways
first search engines can tell when it's
white text on a white background it's
easy to tell from a computer science
point of view search engines read the
HTML and in the HTML are the
instructions for colors when you hide
text modern search engines are smart
enough to figure it out probably better
than a human now secondly it's done to
hide repetitive keyword stuff text which
is the second thing against you these
outdated unprofessional tactics will
most likely get a website penalized by
the search engine the next one is
repetitive anchor text you may have
followed a link to a page when looking
for a business or information and
instead of the information you want you
get a page that doesn't feel like it was
written for people every sentence is
redundant repetitive and almost every
keyword is linked even when there
doesn't need to be a link it confuses
the flow of the information on the page
now again this used to be a tactic that
sometimes would work but but it's no
longer
helpful search engines and their natural
language processing algorithms have
advanced significantly they can tell
when something's not readable when
something is probably intended for
machines and rankings but not for people
search engines will figure it out please
don't waste time on redundant links
trying to inflate the relevance of your
links and Pages the last thing to cover
here is cloaking cloaking is the idea of
showing one thing to the search engines
and something entirely different to
humans
now this is related to the rest of the
tactics I just covered it's something
that used to work but it was expressly
against the search engine guidelines
while it may have worked if the search
engines discovered it on your website
you could have been penalized or dropped
from the search engine results entirely
now we've covered all of the most
important onpage optimization factors
let's take a look at what the
theoretically perfectly optimized page
would look like in this example we can
see many of these ele elements being
used together you can also see that the
base keyphrase digital camera is being
repeated but always included with a
specific context first at the top of the
page is the URL which has digital
cameras in the address the page title
follows using the context of the
information and adding the word reviews
you can also see at the top of the page
that the main navigation and secondary
navigation also called the breadcrumb
navigation provides content of the
Page's location within the entire
website and natural keyword
usage the H1 headline is the key phrase
but also happens to simply be the best
title for the content of the page the
subsequent subheadings provide
additional information such as ratings
recommendations and
features the links provide relevant ways
to access additional content the image
utilizes alt text there are also clear
calls to action which provide relevant
offers to visitors as you can see the
context of all of the content is very
strong and sends a clear relevancy
signal to both search engines and
readers to conclude this section I'd
like to cover the top influencing
factors now sometimes you may find these
as lists but I found it a bit more
practical to separate them into
categories typically every year you'll
find these collection of lists from
surveys experts or speculation some are
from testing but honestly you can't ever
truly test a search engine as they
change a little bit with every algorithm
so the best thing is to take from these
lists these factors that are the tried
and true factors over the years that
have worked
consistently also those tactics that not
only make your website more effective
with users they tend to do well with
search engines so if a tactic serves
that Dual Purpose it's a good tactic so
these are not exclusive and have to
lists for every situation but guides and
indicators for you to use the top onpage
factors from surveys opinions and data
are these a relevant page title page
headings anchor text links a
keyword-based
URL a keyword or contextual file name
such as page name image name or PDF file
name alt text and images and finally
what you do with a content on a page to
make it more readable lists bullet
points and bolded text the top factors
for off-page linking tend to contain
these items the total number of domains
linking to you the number of Highly
influential domains linking to you the
number of unique domain IP addresses
the total back links without no follow
limits the total relevant anchor text in
links to you and finally the types and
context of keywords in Anchor text links
the domain also contributes factors to
your overall rankings such as the age of
the domain which would include ownership
information such as the length of time
owned and operated by a company the real
business information tied to that domain
such as the business address being the
same as the business registration
address for the
domain in addition the signals from
social accounts driving visits to the
domain functionally the search engines
also utilize some attribution based on
the quality of programming of the
website for instance taking care of the
basic search engine Protocols of the
robots. text file XML sitap and https
protocol websites that Implement these
features have shown that they are
familiar with search engine guidelines
and
protocol now one of the changes over the
past few years has been the
implementation of page speed as an
increasing ranking Factor slow loading
pages with a lot of extraneous code that
slow the delivery of the page will be
penalized as they take away from the
user experience
optimizing the page code speeding up the
load time of the page can directly
impact your rankings and this is closely
related to the mobile friendliness of
your website if your website is not
mobile friendly it will be limited in
visibility as Google's primary index is
focused on mobile devices and mobile
delivery behavioral factors are the
newest factors and with the Advent of
artificial intelligence it is making
determining the intent and is making
determining easier for a search engine
to derive a judgment of relevancy based
on
interaction while the extent of these
signals is not fully known it is
suspected that they are minor but
growing in
importance these include the amount of
users that search for a brand name
business name and go to that result
showing brand awareness also the amount
of direct visits bypassing search time
on page pages per session which is also
called the depth of visit and lastly the
behavior of a Searcher from the results
page how many results are clicked how
many times do they return to the results
this evaluation is looking to judge if
the results presented were satisfactory
or deficient for that
query the two broad categories of
ranking signals are popularity and
relevance of the onpage fact
the page title is the most important
individual field the URL is important
and should be memorable alt text is
important for search engines as well as
for site impaired humans avoid keyword
stuffing hidden text repetitive anchor
text and cloaking natural language
processing is a technology that aims to
understand the intent that humans have
when searching for information and so
off page SEO is simply the process C of
linking or promoting your website using
link building and so if you remember I
talked about this earlier on there's two
types of links internal and external
linking and so for onpage SEO we used
internal linking for off page SEO we're
going to talk about external linking and
external linking allows us to improve
our websites recognition or relevancy or
credibility and why do we want to
improve our relevancy and credibility
and trustworthiness and Authority
because we want Google to know that our
web page is trustworthy it is recognized
by other websites and it is relevant for
a particular keyword and so if we can do
that using off-page SEO methods then
Google's going to rank our web page for
the keyword we want to be found for so
it's really off-page SEO synonymous with
link building and there's plenty of
opportunities to do link building it
just comes down to creating a strategy
so again some of the benefits to off
page well we talked about you know being
credible and trustworthiness and
relevant we need to do that in order to
rank but there's some other benefits
there so if we're have a link on another
credible website then it's likely going
to increase the traffic to our own
website it also creates high domain
Authority and so what I mean by high
domain Authority is if we have basically
links to other web pages pointing back
to us then basically our domain
Authority is going to improve and when
our domain Authority improves other
websites are going to want to link to us
so the higher authoritative we are for
our website then other web pages are
going to want to link to us and so the
more external linking we have the higher
the domain Authority so it all starts
with linking to other high domain
Authority websites so linking to a high
domain Authority website for example
having a link on Wikipedia that points
back to our web page creates high domain
Authority for us and it helps Drive
traffic so some of the other benefits of
off-page SEO are in credibility so if
we're linking from Wikipedia to our web
page it does create credibility for us
it also helps us increase our page rank
so remember that external linking helps
build domain Authority helps build
credibility trustworthiness and it's
going to in turn help us rank for that
particular page and then certainly not
last having a good off-page SEO link
building strategy increases our brand
awareness because if we're on other high
Authority websites Wikipedia or say a
social platform it's going to increase
our brand awareness and increasing our
brand awareness increases our
trustworthiness and so if somebody is
looking to say become a digital
marketing specialist then likely instead
of typing in digital marketing
specialist on gole Google they may type
in our brand name in this case simply
learn and so these are all the benefits
to off-page SEO so it's nothing more
than having links on other websites that
are pointing back to ours and again
there's lots of benefits it's drives
helps Drive traffic and increases our
Authority so those are things that we
want to take advantage of when we want
to rank and the key behind off-page SEO
or link building is always going going
to be content so from an onpage SEO
perspective having quality content
allows that content to be optimized for
Relevant keyword and ranked but also
from an off-page SEO strategy having
highquality content allows us to have
other sites and it doesn't necessar have
to be a website it could be a social
platform or could be another blogging
platform or blogging website link back
to ours why because the content is
original it's natur
it's well structured it reads well and
so that's the whole idea behind off page
you can't have links on other websites
if you don't have quality content so one
of the ideas behind off-page SEO is not
only do you want to create good content
but you probably want to spend a lot of
time or a bit of time on others websites
so remember the example I used earlier
in this presentation about having an ice
cream blog and ice cream recipes well it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to say
Spen some time on other blogs related to
desserts related to cakes related to
food in general related to vegetables or
other items that people could link from
so the whole idea is understanding who
else is out there who has relevant
content that you could share so you
could share your content with them they
can share their content with you and
generally that's how it works naturally
anyway in the web spere if somebody
likes your content they're going to link
to it they don't necessarily have to
wait for you to ask them but it might
not be a bad idea to understand who else
is out there that has content similar to
yours so that you can you know get a
link on that particular website or blog
post and so some other ideas behind
having external links pointing back to
your website is social media so social
media is not just Facebook or Twitter
but it expands beyond that there's
there's core there's medium there's all
sorts of content generated websites like
Reddit so the list goes on and on you
just need to find what's relevant for

imagine you have a fantastic shop in a
busy street but no one seems to notice
it because it's stucked away in a corner
SEO or search engine optimization is
like putting up bright signs and arrows
that guide people straight to your shop
it helps your website stand out in the
vast online world making it more likely
for people to find and visit it so SEO
is like the friendly guide that ensures
your website gets the attention it
deserves bringing in more visitors and
potential
customers and for doing so a tool is
very crucial and one of the best tool
out there is SEO pow suit so SEO
powersuit stand out as the best solution
for all your SEO and digital marketing
requirements it offers four powerful
tools like rank tracker website auditor
ASO spy glass and Link assistant
providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SEO power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back links and
Link building and first we'll have to
focus on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on it
so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understanding of keyword and overall
market dynamics so first of all we'll
have to create a project over here so
over here we'll have to type the URL of
this website and so I will just type
here
bof.com it's an e-commerce site all
right so now we'll click on next then
again we'll connect on next and here you
can enter the keywords if you want and
if you don't want then you can proceed
by clicking on
next here you can add more search
engines Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean
it's your choice if you want to add it
or not I just don't want to add all the
these Google and Yahoo are sufficient
then we'll click on finish all right so
our project is getting ready all right
so it is loaded so first of all we'll
start by understanding the menu bar so
the menu bar is like the control center
like of rank tracker offering a set of
drop- down menus that help you manage
your projects and preferences so let's
understand first so this is file so this
menu handles basic commands relating to
your project such as opening closing and
saving files it's a go-to for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
triling rank tracker to suit your needs
then there is window so window this menu
provides a list of supported hot Keys
like keyboard shot cuts and allows you
to quickly switch between different
modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation and action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the
assistance all right then here comes the
project as you can see project this menu
is like a project management Hub it
displays a drop- down list of all the
projects currently open in rank tracker
allowing you to easily switch between
them so only one project is there so it
is showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and then open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
projects with this command you can do
that then close this option allows you
to exit then as we can see check all so
check all rankings in all the open
project simultaneously with this command
it streamlines the process of gathering
information across your various projects
then you can also log in like found in
the SEO power Cloud login area this is
where you log to access Cloud related
features all right so this was about the
menu bar now coming to the sidebar so
quickly let's understand this one so
first of all there is a dashboard as you
can see project dashboard this is your
project Central Hub it provides a visual
summary of of key statistics related to
your organic traffic ranking progress
and how well your competitors are doing
it serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this module you will
find a list of keywords you're targeting
it shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as you can see
next is keyword research so here it is
so here you can explore new keyword
ideas using over 20 different tools like
it is in there the module allows you to
analyze and categorize new keywords into
groups and move them to Target keyword
section all right so as we can see these
are that 20 different tools the tools
that we are talking about then there is
Sur analysis that is SCP analysis this
is for in-depth keyword analysis it
provides you detailed analytic iCal
report on websites competing with you
for the same queries then competitors
research this module enables you to
research on competitors based on domain
or topic domain strength it offers
overall report on your website's SEO
strength showing how it evolves over
time then there is reports this module
is for generating and you know
delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research we'll click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as we can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the soul
store let's
say all right now I'll click on
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profiles all right so so
this is what it is this is the result
and as we can see keywords and this is
organic traffic this is URL of the sold
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and access their performance we
can you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely on rank tracker to
recommend the most relevant ones within
your specific Niche now after this you
can explore keywords with various
keyword research methods like keyword
Gap search console Keyword Planner
autocomplete tools related searches
keyword combination Etc so as you can
see all these are over here you can have
a look at these and explore these
meanwhile we can explore this keyword
sandbox as you can see keyword sandbox
with the help of this we can filter our
keywords which is the next step all
right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
Factor such a search volume as we can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the a competition
competition is high for this
keyword and keyword difficult is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like drag like
we can see so it's your choice you can
filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
dragged now your keyword will appear
also in the track keyword so like I have
tracked this one and this one so in
track keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type the
website that is
de.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as you can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all all
we'll explore similarly that we explored
in the previous one so this is the menu
bar and I think we have explored this
and this is the Side Bar it is bit
different from that so let's explore the
sidebar so site structure we have as you
can see this section organizes all the
elements of a website including its
pages and resources it provides like a
visual map of the site along with an
audit dashboard that accesses various Su
factors so as you can see page audit
over here now the page audit will do the
page level analysis so this was the
function of page audit then domain
strength is there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain structure
so this was about the sidebar now we can
start with the little demo so first we
have to create a project that we already
created and wait till the tool crawls
and collects all the pages on your
website so that we have done already now
we'll go to site audit so as you can see
here under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit will address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool all
right so next we can do is visualization
as you can see over here under site
audit we click on that now to ensure
visualization basically is used to
ensure your site is well structured the
tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly sport an address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections redirects broken links and more
so this is what it is used for on the
right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click depth as we can see
click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if if you switch to
internal page link as you can see you'll
click on that you can see how the
internal link are spreaded like it is
bit different sorting my page views if
you
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we're not able to figure it out as a
for that I think we'll be needing a
Google analytics account and we'll need
to log in with that
all right so after reviewing and
addressing on page optimization for the
site let's revisit the keywords you
gathered in Rand tracker like use
website auditor keyword map as we can
see keyword map for keyword map we'll
have to go over page audit inside page
audit it is keyword map now this module
automatically identify the pages most
relevant to each keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
key and Pages for further analysis first
of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say want to
write
joggers
watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts
sliders and
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket
hoodies
shorts all right I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have rote the keywords over here now
we'll click on create map now the
program will take few moments to harvest
all data for the keywords and the tool
automatically identifies the pages most
relevant to your keyword group or
specific keyword so this is showing only
one it should at least show five because
website auditor will suggest the top
five most fitting Pages for each keyword
of group so
so we must add more keywords I believe
we can add manually or we can just have
a look at rank tracker also like
hellfire club shirt we can
see can add
that all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just hover
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it
is all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map now with the ready G
map ensure your landing page is
optimized for Target keywords now we'll
go to content audit first so here we we
can adjust the target settings set the
default search engine for competitor
page and assign a specific one for the
current page so as you can see they are
showing the errors and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and as it is showing make your page meta
description approximately 22 word long
so it is showing how to fix also
basically and if we'll talk about
competitors we can see Amazon
and many other hm hm is there American
Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as we can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily you know edit this
site also and properly write an SEO
optimized title so as you can see 33.2%
optimization rate is there it is showing
and other than that we can click on this
and this is showing us manage mapped
keywords manage search engines so manage
search engines so this will change the
default search engine set a separate
search engine for the given page this
can be helpful when optimizing for
creating a regional or local page and
click manage search engines you can also
do that all right so the two top Fields
as we can see this one this one so these
two Fields will let you edit or enter
the meta title and meta description tags
and you can see how those fit into the
intersections the recommended number of
characters based on the best SEO
practices so as you can see 311 160 you
can easily edit that and make it SEO
friendly also all your target keywords
will show up in the mapped keywords as
you can see the mapped keyword hoodies
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as you can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keywords this
section will list the keywords that have
been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include these
as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so now let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking back links it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type
b.com all right now we'll click on
next SEO power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say we click on so these were the number
of back links so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while SEO spy glass
collects backlink statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of back links that the site
has
130,000 domains
9,622 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the data so search engines
prioritize websites that have backlinks
from reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spammy sites
can negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on an
any efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the back links already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SE
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find find the pages
linking to your site for that to gather
all the backlinks directed to your site
you need to initiate a new project in
SEO spy glass that we already did and
now we can navigate to backlinks
profile and click on back
links all right so the tool will examine
its index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful metrics
essential for further
analysis so as we can see back link page
domain in link rank link page links back
so all the back link pages are there it
is also showing
130k back links all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one like
in.org
g.net so like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary wiget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see
and number of pack links you can also
see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over uh any cell in the back
links domains columns you'll see the
icon of expanding the list of URLs to
look through so as you can see these are
the backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referal
traffic
and to analyze the traffic your website
is getting through the backlinks turn to
referral traffic module this is the
referral traffic module under back rink
profile this is backlink profile if you
want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click

stats or this also will work oh this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
Analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics or the backlinks in the
project after the task finishes you'll
see the results in the workspace you can
then switch between views linking
domains and backlink pages so the
linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
View will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to

summary you can like including key
metrics to identify both the strengths
and weaknesses of your site now we can
peek at your competitors's backlink
profile also now is the moment to to

strength 9.33 is of minra and 7.99 of
pof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics all right now coming
to the next step which is spot the
dangerous links before progressing to
actual link building phase it's crucial
to address one final task identify and
remove potential and harmful backlinks
so for that we will go to backlink
profile then the penalty risk so so
backlink profile this then we'll go to
penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisable to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
post minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on a particular link as
you can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will task updated
backlink base data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy class now let's do the link
building with link assistant
so this link assistant simplifies your
link building tasks it assists in
discovering numerous link building
opportunities managing Outreach and
overseeing your link building campaign
directly within the app so first of all
we'll create a project and specify the
site and backlink and Target
settings all right so as we can see uh
we can like first of all we'll type
b.com right now so as we have provided
the web web address select your desired
Target country so Target country over
here and the language also you can
select from this and other than this the
app's search engine will be tailored
automatically according to your
preferences Additionally you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is the
app will analyze the backlink profiles
of potential prospects and eliminate
those containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on
create all right so this is the layout
now so first by default this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see see six predetermined methods
or the configure a customized search
this one configure a customized search
using the export mode this is the expert
mode basically so these options enable
you to conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect you're
seeking if you lack seed keywords you
can utilize the get keyword suggestion
feature this function automatically
identifies your top 20 ranking keywords
that generate the highest
traffic all right so now step two would
be let's say let's explore this one
guest posting top 100 blocks we'll click
on this all right so by employing this
search technique you can identify the
top 100 prospects ranked by organic
traffic using specific search operators
related to your seed keywords to
initiate the search input the seat
keywords here you will write down the
seat keyword so let's say I just want to
write Winter
Wear all right and
and you can also do the search engine
settings but I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on
this so these are the contact
information this is the page previews
and this is the prospect preview and
additional details are also there you
can select or unselect all the results
to be moved to the prospects like
this right so then we'll click on move
to projects on Hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects all right so so these are the
prospect that you that we have moved now
that we have possess a recently compiled
list of potential links it is crucial to
access their quality and prioritize the
ones we intend to reach out to initially
we'll go to
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL and update so here is the update
and select contact info so as we can see
contact info we'll click on okay now
that we have settled on the list of
factors you like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated
like I'll click on uh contact
information and press okay like
that all right can do for this one
also all right so the next step is to
reach out to prospects utilize the app
to initiate Outreach directly taking the
convenience of having all the contact
details at your disposal by connecting
your email account to link assistant you
can centralize and organize your
campaign's correspondence efficiently
within the application begin reaching
out from the app since you already have
everyone's contact info simply link your
email to link assistant and all your
campaign messages will be saved in one
spot so you can just click on this and
then email so as you can see domain.
operations. web.com it has taken the
information from contact info and once
you have linked your account or email
then you can it will update over here
and then you can simply send it apply
and okay so as you can see dear owner

in marketing now let's understand the
next Trend that is the importance of SEO
with the help of Hands-On demo all right
next up we have is YouTube for marketing
so brands are increasingly interested in
utilizing YouTube for their marketing
efforts as YouTube is recognized as
second largest search platform this
means that people often use YouTube to
search for information entertainment and
products making it a valuable space for
Brands to connect with their target
audience utilizing YouTube can enhance
your SEO boost brand recognition and
Foster customer loyalty YouTube
marketing includes various strategies
including producing authentic promotions
content collaborations with influencers
running advertisements on platform and
optimizing videos for improved SE all
right so this was about YouTube for
marketing now coming to the next one
which is nano influencers so focusing on
Nano influencers who typically have
between 1,000 to 10,000 followers for
Branding is a strategy often employed by
cosmetics and wellness Brands Nano
influencers who have smaller but
dedicated following are often perceived
as more genuine easy to relate and
trustworthy compared to bigger
influencers they can benefit your brand
by boosting engagement expanding your
reach and driving more sales especially
in sectors like cosmetics and wellness
where trust and personal endorsements
matter a lot additionally collaboration
with Nano influencer is more budget
friendly and simpler compared to
partnering with larger influencers or
bigger influencers looking forward to
2024 it's clear that digital marketing
is changing a lot following these new
Trends can help businesses connect
better with their customers run
effective campaigns and stay competitive
using AI interactive content and
personalization can set businesses up
for success in the digital world being
flexible and open to change will be
important as these TRS develop this gets
into copyrighting you see like I said
when you when you get into you know are
people looking for colors are the people
looking for locations sizes I want to
understand the breadth of what they're
talking about and that helps me become a
better copywriter I can understand
intent if I know the questions that they
have then we can write answers and so
you know I want to see how people are
searching you know a great example is is
now we've seen searches increasing for
people searching for you know the best
or the top rated or uh reviews I think
is oh yeah for me uh people are actually
typing in what is the best car for me
and I think what they're doing
essentially is is is directly asking
Google you know based on the two million
things you know about me what would be
the best car for me um so people are
looking for more personalized
information uh so what you can do is get
into the you know the howto the why the
you know what it means all these
different cues that people are giving in
their key phrases develop your content
to answer those questions yeah i' had
actually seen a statistic that 82% of
smartphone users use and this is for
businesses oh looking for businesses use
specifically the term near me after
their search so even
geographically um I don't know if that's
anything you can include in the content
but uh well no you know it it's it's
blows my mind because um if they're on
their smartphone they're automatically
going to get results near them uh that
that's kind of interesting so it it's
more of a cue for Google than it is for
a website because to use that phrase in
any of your optimization really wouldn't
make a lot of
sense uh because you don't know who's
near you um and and if anything
especially on a mobile search Google is
pretty much going to ignore that near me
because you're going to get the results
near where you are
anyway yeah um so yeah getting into the
search data people search for what they
need
they they figure out what they're
looking for but now here is where the
role of the SEO is going to come in
organizationally is that when you have
people writing content generating
content for Content marketing for social
media uh especially if you're working
with uh you know like a publisher who is
constantly developing content now you
need to help them come up with ways to
measure success and also to motivate
them to implement SEO tactics in their
writing so rather than uh developing
catchy
headlines uh that may have a double
meaning that may not play well in search
you need to help copywriters understand
that well your headline while that might
look great on print in search it's
actually going to cause a problem and so
you turn into an educator for your
content developers uh you're you're
teaching them what works well what's
going to click well what's going to look
well in the search engines versus what
might be
confusing also uh it's also helping them
to understand you know a great example
of this um before I move on
someone um gave me a great example is
they were writing an article about
holiday time travel and that was the
title of the article that they put out
there and they couldn't figure out why
this article was cons instantly getting
hundreds or thousands of visits a month
uh well after it was published and when
we went back and started looking at some
of the rankings and some of the keywords
and things like that we found out that
the article was ranking really well for
time travel uh even though the headline
was holiday time travel uh so it's
helping your writers understand um you
know what makes a good title uh but then
also one thing that uh I worked with one
publisher and one of the things we did
to motivate the writers was to develop
like a a leaderboard of whose content is
generating the most visits uh and not
only that whose content is generating
the most new visits to the website uh
and then you can carry that through to
you know for how for different writers
how many visits or views have you
generated in a month or over the past 6
months how much as your content uh
performed compared to other content and
you can carry this all the way out to
you know which writers had the highest
amount of AD clicks uh in their articles
uh which articles uh led to people to
uh subscribe again or you know get even
get into customer lifetime value uh
there's so many things that you could
Implement so from an SEO standpoint you
understand already how to look at the
success of gaining rankings and what it
generates in terms of page views
click-throughs time on site uh click
depth uh you know all those types of
things that you can then develop into
helping others in the organization who
publish content start to measure the
impact of their writing organizationally
and then especially if you're able to
tie that to a financial implication uh
that shows that this is what it's
contrib towards the business in terms of
Revenue then you become the all-around
hero because you're able to help others
tie Revenue to activity that's great we
have someone asking can this backfire on
you for example if you're starting every
headline with uh one weird this one
weird trick dot dot dot um if you find
that you have a lot of if your bounce
rate immediately starts going up because
you have because if you're waiting for
time travel or Star Wars or something uh
that everyone's going to be looking for
um then um uh could that actually NE
negatively affect uh how Google sees you
if it's if you have all these bounce
rates they might see you as a no longer
being relevant absolutely and it's not
just Google with the bounce rate it it
damages your brand it damages your
credibility I mean it's it's clickbait
and I mean it doesn't take long for
people to realize clickbait is
clickbait um you can just look at some
of the data uh but yeah I mean when you
see articles or headlines that are
obvious clickbait people you know you
get caught a couple of times you get
fooled a couple of times it's not always
going to work and so this gets
to you know how are you positioning your
brand are you positioning your brand as
a trustworthy source of information that
answers people's questions are you
positioning your brand as we give people
what they need what they want uh or are
you fooling them to click on an article
based on what's popular right now uh you
know there's a couple questions that get
to how the brand wants to be perceived
in the marketplace uh based on tactics
like
that but great question great question
because clickbait is powerful um but you
got to ask yourself are we giving people
what they want or are we fooling them
into it and how will that reflect on the
brand
right uh from another keyword standpoint
one thing that I found is very valuable
to do is go out and look and see how
people are searching for the brand and
content associations they make with that
brand uh now this can also get into
other areas you may find that there's
some crossover uh where there is another
company with a similar brand name uh and
so this will help you understand a
little bit more if you get some of that
crossover traffic but also from a PR
standpoint do people associate content
or ideas with your brand that you would
ra this will help you become aware of
something that might be out there that
may not be getting picked up uh so I I
enjoy doing these kinds of searches
because I want to know what are the
words associations are people making
with the brand right that you may need
to deal with yeah and also look at your
analytics and what is linked in your CRM
to see uh how people have actually
converted because if you have some
longtail keywords in there that would be
good to generate content on uh that your
best customers are finding you through
that can be super valuable and at least
compensate for having some super click
baity words in there accidentally what's
interesting is that people people are
are a few people are really wanting to
hone in on this uh uh backtrack a bit
here to ways to capitalize on certain
things that um I know people are looking
for quick answers to rank high in Google
uh but the question keeps coming up
about for example if there there any
ways why you could restructure your
content to capitalize on things like
near me like should you put in your
opening paragraph you know if you're
looking for a near
uh that's that's almost I I personally
would would shrink from doing that
because I know that that that that's
something that that seems that a Google
I don't want to put words in your mouth
it seems like a Google's already doing
that automatically based on if you're
searching mobile but two if pretty soon
they're going to catch up to people
putting best and near me and because
that's the other question like should I
should I use terms that
are when I when I see the results of
most commonly searched terms in Mobile
should I put those in my in my copy uh
so uh what do you say about that like
are there ways to that you can
legitimately without being uh penalized
Capital yeah well okay if you're
legitimately publishing an article that
is well researched comparing different
products and you title it best pet food
products or something like that that's a
legitimate case I have no problem with
that do your homework and create
something of value and it will do well
if it's good content that people like
now the the near me is a bit more
sketchy because even though you may put
on your website something about near you
or near me uh not everyone who visits
your website remember this is more of a
mobile
uh phenomenon these are people on their
phone looking for something near them a
drugstore uh a car wash uh you know
something like that a restaurant and
that's being computed based on distance
based on uh you know past preferences
things like that so it has nothing to do
with the content of your website what I
would work on more is your local
business listing in Google and
developing more reviews for your
business and working with that uh
listing to add more pictures like I said
reviews uh they have a function there
now where you can add promotions the
more you develop that Google listing
that will do a hundred times more to
increase your visibility when someone is
looking for something near them and they
are near you then adding words your
website great well that sounds
smart I may come across a bit forcefully
on some of these
things uh mainly because it's it's it
has never bothered me when people out
andout try to fool Google with some
really intelligent things uh I I
somewhat tend to admire it uh but when
people try to fool Google with what I
would call amateurish things that are
poorly executed
that's where I you know that's where I
get I get a little ticked off at that
yeah because it it's create a quality
experience that's what people want
quality experience uh and and that's
really what it gets down to you know
with with content marketing you're
answering people's questions and so as
people are generating that content
you're also sending them back to the
site you're sending them back to get
answers to register to do things like
that so all those web pages from the
content marketing that they're linking
to they need to be optimized for your
inbound
strategy and what's interesting is also
for a paid search standpoint the landing
page from Paid search you know it needs
to be optimized just like any other page
that's part of the quality score
algorithm does the landing page reflect
the paid search headline does it also
contain the keyword that you're bidding
on so you've got to look at how people
are developing their Landing Pages
internally and maybe you can contribute
to that as well in helping improve the
quality score because the optimization
of that landing page is very
similar uh where I see employment and
Industry Trends now this is interesting
because talking with the uh director of
omcp and some of the surveys he's been
doing of hiring managers HR managers and
Technology uh or or in marketing across
the across the the the globe here one of
the things that he has seen is there is
becoming more demand of people who can
manage the entire Tech marketing stack
not the single Channel
Specialists because more and more
automation is handling that uh more and
more you know and this is where we're
going to see the entrance of AI and
machine learning is adjusting your paid
search
campaign with those minute
methods of increasing your click-through
rate uh you know it's going to be
managing those bids So eventually you're
just going to focus more on the content
and eventually AI is going to take over
the content uh so the demand is for who
were the single Channel Specialists of
SEO paid search social to move into
understanding the entire Omni Channel
digital marketing campaign and can run
and can change and can make recommend
ation across the board for the entire
stack of digital marketing this is where
we're seeing more of the employment
trends uh going as well as the skills
demand is getting away from that single
hard skill to understanding the entire
campaign uh and that's going to go into
all different types of things that's
going to include email CRM social
display uh and seos I think are probably
very well positioned in all of these
things because of the foundation of
keywords the foundation of keywords and
understanding intent and then developing
content that answers those
questions that's needed in email it's
needed in automation it's needed in
Social and display you know especially
in the CRM automation is someone has to
write the content that needs to be Auto
automated and so again this then gets
into uh looking at the trends uh because
AO
you not only need to write the content
but you need to then plan the content
when is it sent when is this completed
when is this done uh and so
understanding the the sales cycles and
how long they go and when people need
certain information at one times it
takes that planning strategy of being
able to do that and I think seos are
well positioned to understand that full
stack of marketing and the implications
as well as the management of it
and then we get to analytics ah this is
my favorite um so as an SEO or if you're
taking on more of the the Omni Channel
burden here uh you've got to develop
those measurements that show how
effective not only SEO has been but now
content management content management is
Big everyone is moving towards it it has
become a significant piece of strategy
however what is lacking in content
is the measurement how do we know that
this content piece that went out whether
it was a video uh whether it was an
infographic whether you know regardless
of what it was number one how do we
Track Performance number two how do we
know it affected anything number three
what was the pathway where were we
driving people and what did we want them
to do and how successful was that and
then also from an attribution standpoint
did this lead to other things you know
where did this content piece or where
does this channel help us overall an
attribution in driving New Leads or
nurturing people along the path and so
it's getting more than just getting you
know measuring clicks it's it's
measuring actual hard dollars that were
generated based off specific channels or
specific pieces of content uh and and
then you know it's it's developing an
understanding of sales goals what do the
sales department need uh in terms of
information to enance the CRM so that
they can nurture people along in the
path uh so it's more than just marketing
it's understanding that full scope that
a company has yeah that's a that's an
excellent point and I think another
thing to keep in mind too is is use
actual conversations with your sales
people as oh as a one of the few things
it's funny that that marketing and and
sales often are their own little silos
and uh I think one of the best things a
marketer can do is just go and talk to
your best sales people and ask them what
why are people buying us what are the
what are they what are the questions
they are asking you to answer um I think
that can be a because those questions
since they're legitimately people that
are that are engaging with your
salespeople and making purchases I think
those are the most valuable questions
you can answer in your copy oh
absolutely I mean short of talking to a
customer talking to your sales
department is the best way to get
information um now my before I got into
SEO I was in sales I took sales training
and and in you know dealt directly with
people so it kind of I had that uh you
know that view of things but I I'm
amazed at how much people don't interact
with their sales department in order to
learn uh you know what do people need
how do we answer their questions what
you know what do they respond to but
then also your salespeople are the first
in line entering information into the
CRM and when leads are created through
your marketing efforts it'd be good to
ask them what additional information do
you need that would make a better
lead you know there and there are many
times where we have changed the site on
the recommendation of the sales team and
you know we we may not have it we didn't
improve conversions but we what we
improved were the the the scenario
through which the sales call then came
after the conversion and increased the
close rate just based on changing the
landing page or the thank you page after
the registration right and it's it's a
good conversation to start having with
your sales field too so that they know
what kind of questions to listen to
because a lot of times they're just not
paying attention you ask a sales person
they made the sale because I was a great
sales guy um but the more you the more
you work with them as a team and say hey
you know to get them thinking about what
actually listening to what the customers
are asking for and passing that on to
you you know that of course will will
help lead attribution and and all the
things that you said so yeah definitely
don't forget the human element in SEO
well and this gets to you know this
really gets to if if if the trend now is
moving more towards you know someone who
can manage a full stack it's also moving
towards people people who understand how
to align sales and marketing goals and
beyond that it's not just you know like
the example I gave before it's not just
okay we increased the conversion rate of
our registration okay that's great what
did how did that contribute to revenue
but now it's understanding that there
are things that we can do to increase a
close rate that don't always take place
on the website but it's a process and so
now we're analyzing proc
processes that can be done
electronically and then how do we create
a better Revenue stream that way how do
we make a better nurture process now
we're getting into the effectiveness of
content and producing a result rather
than just you know a conversion uh a
sale or a lead now we're looking at well
how do we make more money based out of
this uh and that's really it's that big
picture of understanding that you know
our job is not just to get leads it's to
create better profitability which
rewards
everybody so it's understanding those
touch points from content uh you know so
as content is being pushed out does it
answer the question does it lead people
to the next stage how quickly does it
lead them there uh can you measure
influence from your content and you know
through depth of visit or the depth of
the page that they got to um and then
again it's the experience based on
motivation
can you understand that can you tie
together what a customer was feeling at
a specific point through their nurture
stream uh or through this process as I
said it's it's getting away from more
just stuff that happens on the site it's
Communications throughout the entire
process the entire life cycle of a
customer that's all coming under the the
management really of the marketing team
right now is that entire customer life
cycle communication and
management uh and finally this is
something a trend that I've been seeing
as well in terms of uh jobs and hiring
and also business function uh omcp did a
a survey at the beginning of the year
asking people where they spent the most
amount of their time and specifically in
SEO and SEO
managers uh
and uh anyone who dealt with SEO nearly
40% of their time was
spent uh presenting their research
presenting strategy as well as uh as
well as explaining their the reasoning
for that strategy and so seos you need
to become a lot more comfortable in
front of people uh presenting your
findings making recommendations
presenting opportunities Trends uh and
presenting it in a
persuasive format
uh that shows uh not a bunch of data
charts but shows how smart you are in
creating new Revenue opportunities for
the company that is really where we see
a lot of things going are the
presentation skills are becoming part of

keyword research so what are we going to
talk about when we talk about keyword
research we're going to talk about why
we would do keyword research for SEO
we're going to talk about the types of
keywords that we need to research we're
going to talk about some methodologies
best practices on how to do keyword
research some alternate suggestions
we're going to talk about keyword
clustering and then we're going to talk
about some tools that you can use to do
your keyword research so let's start
with the why we would do keyword
research so Jesse is planning to publish
a Blog of pizza recipes so she was doing
pizza recipes step by step pizza recipes
with sausage homemade pizza toppings
pizza dough recipes th Crust Pizzas
she's doing a lot of different topics on
pizza recipes well what Jesse needs to
do is understand what's going to drive
traffic to these blog posts if she's
writing about you know different topics
around pizza recipes so she's Unsure how
these blogs are going to drive traffic
so she really needs to understand that
hey you need to choose the right
keywords to drive traffic so the
question is if you're riding a blog post
about recipes with sausages is pizza
recipes with sausages or recipes for
free the best keyword to use maybe maybe
not so you need to take uh care and
choosing the key word words to align
with your content so that's really the
idea why we would do keyword research
because some of the issues with keywords
that are poorly chosen are they could
have low search volume for example you
may choose a keyword that just a lot of
people aren't using to search for or
they can be highly competitive so if you
choose a keyword that's very broad or
popular it can be very competitive and
take you long time to be found for that
keyword or you could just make the
mistake of choosing a keyword that isn't
in align with your content or you can
choose keywords but use them incorrectly
with your content so these are some of
the issues that you can encounter if you
just go about choosing keywords randomly
without due diligence without the proper
research so low search volume will lead
to less traffic High competition you may
not even rank at all okay if somebody
finds you for a keyword that's not
relevant to the topic they're just going
to leave the page and if you're not
using the right right keywords and or if
you are using the right keywords and not
using them correctly in the content then
your pages may not even be found in
organic search so you really have to
take care and choosing the keywords to
me that's the most important step with
SEO is keyword research so we're going
to talk about the types of keyword
research then so we have short tail
keywords and we have longtail keywords
so if you write a blog post about pizza
recipes well what are you going to
choose a short tail or long tail so
let's talk about short tail keywords
first so short tail keywords are
keywords that are usually three keywords
in a phrase or shorter in some cases it
may be two keywords in a phrase or
shorter so short tail keywords usually
have high search volume which means
likely means higher competition but what
it also means it could be lower
conversions because short tail keyword
like for example pizza recipes could be
considered a short tail key word but
maybe somebody's looking for homemade
pizza recipes or pizza recipes from
their favorite Italian restaurant so
short keywords may not be as relevant so
if we compare it with longtail keywords
chances are you're going to have lower
competition that's one of the benefits
but you're also going to have lower
search volume but with longer tail
keywords the keyword is probably going
to be more relevant with the content
you're writing about so therefore the
conversion rates likely going to be
higher so that's really the difference
between short tail keywords and longtail
keywords if you want to look look at
simplistically short tail keywords are
Broad in nature it's going to capture a
lot of eyeballs but those eyeballs may
look at your content is not relevant
versus longtail keywords that may be
very relevant but not as many eyeballs
on them so short tail keywords the
characteristics they're not as specific
usually they're less than three words
they have high search volume and high
competition so if you just choose pizza
recipes could take you a while to rank
for that keyword but when you rank
you're going to get the traic but again
it may not convert because the key word
is Broad in nature so pizza recipes is a
short tail keyw that may not be exactly
what you're writing about in your blog
post so it may draw a lot of traffic but
the traffic may not do anything so the
longer tail keywords are very specific
they consist of more than three words in
the search query they have relatively
low search volume competition so the
chance of you ranking higher fast for
that long TIY word is probably going to
be greater because not many other
websites are trying to rank for that
sink key word and so the benefit of that
is if you have let's just say homemade
pizza recipes with mushrooms that's a
long tiky word but if somebody's looking
for that type of pizza recipe then you
know you're going to track the right
traffic and chances are that traffic is
going to engage or convert based on the
type of conversion you have in place so
an example would be home homemade pizza
dough recipes that'd be another example
more than th key words in the phrase
very specific we're talking about
homemade pizza dough recipe so we're not
talking about just pizza recipes so it's
a little bit more uh specific in nature
longer tail so these keywords are used
for targeted Pages including blog posts
if you're writing a blog post
specifically about pizza recipes with
homemade dough then this is the keyword
you likely would want to use versus just
pizza recipes so let's look at an
example between a short tail keyword and
a long tail keyword and to accentuate
the differences we're going to use
Google's Keyword Planner tool so
Google's Keyword Planner tool is located
in Google ads the Google ads platform
and when you're in the Google ads
platform you can simply click on tools
and then Keyword Planner and so what
Keyword Planner allows us to do is get a
sense of the type of volume that a
particular keyword has so what Google
Keyword Planner does is they show you
the average monthly searches this is the
average monthly search volume of a
keyword over the past 12 months and so
in this example we're going to choose
pizza recipes and homemade pizza dough
recipes so one short tail and one long
tail so we enter those keywords in we're
going to click get results and what
Google's going to do is it's going to
show us the volume of those keywords so
for pizza recipe we could see the
average monthly search volume is
33,100 for pizza recipe so note that
pizza recipe and pizza recipes are
closely related keywords and so what
Google does is they consider that a
close variance so meaning if somebody
ties in pie of recipe then they're also
in Google's eyes looking for pizza
recipes so it's a close variance and so
for the keyword pizza recipe which is
short tail we could see on average over
the past 12 months this keyword received
33,100 queries and so if we hover over
the graph we could see basically the
volume the average volume per month so
here I could see for this particular
keyword here the volume per month is
331,000 and then I can see the actual
volume over the past 12 months and then
for the longtail keyword I can see
homemade pizza dough recipe again close
variance homemade pizza dough recipes I
can see over the past 12 months what the
search volume is for this on average
it's 2400 but I could see here in
December the volume went up to 3600 but
for example in May it was 19900 so it's
going to fluctuate a bit over the past
12 months but on average it's about 2400
so shorter tail a lot more volume longer
tail not as much volume but nonetheless
there is volume here and so these are
the differences between a short tail and
a longer tail and so what Google's
Keyword Planner also does is allow us to
get a sense of what the competition is
and so here I can see the competition is
low for both of these keywords fair
enough so we now know that if we want to
optimize or choose the keyword homemade
pizza dough recipe for our blog post we
know for ranks on page one of Google
even in the top spot we can expect about
2400 search queries for that keyword now
whether you get all 2400 clicks for that
keyword remains to be seen chances are
you're not going to get all 2400 you're
going to get a lion share of those
clicks but you're going to at least get
some volume on it so even the longer TI
keywords have a lot of Promise because
there is some search volume here for
this keyword how to do a proper keyword
research so we looked at Google's
Keyword Planner tool in Google ads and
we typed in two keywords and we were
able to get a sense of what the average
volume is so we definitely want to
choose key words based on the following
factors we want to choose it based on
search volume search volume is a good
indicator of the potential traffic we
can obtain so again for the keyw
homemade pizza dough recipe we know that
it averages 2400 a month in search
volume again we may not get all 2400 but
we're going to get a line share of that
we also need to look at competition and
so Google's key Keyword Planner gives us
a high medium or low in terms of the
competition but if you're somebody who
wants to get a better sense of what the
competition is and you should because
competition is a key component in
choosing keywords and so what I want to
do is get a sense of how many people are
actually optimizing for that keyword so
Google's Keyword Planner tool is going
to give me a low medium high really what
I want to do is get a better sense of
that numerically so what I can do is go
into Google's search and I could type in
pizza recipes and I could see there's
about 1 billion results that's a lot of
results however that means that every
potential web page out there on the
internet that mentions pizza recipes is
going to be included in this number here
and so I want to get a better sense of
who's optimizing for pizza recipes so
I'm going to put in the all entitle
syntax and so what that is going to ask
Google to do is tell me all the way
sites that have pizza recipes the key
word pizza recipes in the title tag so
if I do all en tile colon space than
pizza recipes my result drops down to
336,000 so what that tells me is that
there are 336,000 results with the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag
now if I want to focus in on my other
keyword if I choose uh my other keyword
was a longer tail keyword homemade pizza
dough res recipe so if I type that
keyword in the homemade pizza dough
recipe or recipes remember close
variants and I just click enter or type
the keyword in hit my Enter key I'm
going to get 35 Million results but
again is that really an indicator of the
type of competition I have no because
every listing that mentions homemade
pizza dough recipes is going to be
included in the search results so I'm
going to type in my all en title colon
space and then I'm going to get a better
sense of how many websites have the
keyword homemade pizza dough recipes in
the title tag and I get
2,160 different results so here I can
see the first result in the title tag
homemade pizza dough recipe second one
homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
sites or web pages that have that
keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the
thing you have to understand about SEO
specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few
different keywords not just one or two
so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to
contain keywords that we can potentially
want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my
recommendation is you come up with a
theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's
our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipe so the close variance here is
pizza recipe what was the volume well we
know the volume was 33,100 for pizza
recipe so what are we going to do we're
going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition
well if we go back and type in pizza
recipes it was 683 th000 so I'm going to
type in
683 th000 what was our next keyword well
it was pizza or homemade pizza dough
recipes so if I go back back for this
particular keyword is 2400 so I'm going
to put 2400 in under my volume column
and then what was my competition well my
competition was I type that keyword back
in 2,160 so I'm going to put
2,160 so now I have an idea of what kind
of volume and what kind of competition I
have now you want to do this for number
different keywords and when you do a for
number keywords what you do want to do
is obviously choose a relevant keyword
word that has high volume and low
competition so another way of saying it
is the volume or ratio of volume to
competition and so basically what we
could do is take volume divided by
competition and if I make that a
percentage I could see is 35% is the
ratio between volume and competition if
I do the same for my longer tail keyword
2400 / by 2160 I can see that 111% so
this just kind of proves the point that
yeah I'm still going to get some volume
but I have a better chance of ranking
for this longer T keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes so you want to be able to
do that for number keywords and examine
the volume the competition and the ratio
between volume and competition for your
themed keywords in this case pizza
recipes so relevancy you want to choose
keywords that are very relevant to the
content that you're writing and then
again commercial intent what keywords
are going to drive more conversions and
revenue for the business so when we talk
about commercial intent we're talking
about you know are you choosing keywords
that are going to get somebody to do
what you want them to do so we could say
You Know download pizza dough recipes so
somebody's typing in the keyword
download pizza dough recipes then
chances are they're going to find you
come to your s and take action by
downloading that pizza dough recipe so
you want to be able to also think about
the intent of the keyword is it going to
help you drive conversions and revenue
if you're an e-commerce site so search
volume is the average monthly search
volume made for a particular keyword and
phrase so we can get that number using
Google's Keyword Planner tool in the
Google ads platform we want to Target
keywords with high search volume that
will help bring traffic to the website
we want volume but we want to take into
account seasonality as well so that's
where the Google's Keyword Planner tool
comes in place because if we go back
again we can just hover over we get a
sense of any particular Trend going on
or seasonality so for example if I saw
large growth in the winter months and
not much volume growth in the summer
months then that might indicate to me
that this keyword is more popular during
the winter time so pay attention to the
graphs that you know the Keyword Planner
tool gives you use them to your
advantage to take into account
seasonality so a good example would be
funny how Halloween costumes well we
know that for Halloween you're going to
have a spike probably towards the end of
September all the way through October
and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so
that's an example but in the case of
pizza recipes you know you may find that
more people are choosing to search for
pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay
attention to seasonality it will affect
search volume so compet comption based
on our example it's one of the most
important key metrics you don't want to
choose a key word that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive
then it's going to be harder to rank
number one or even on page one of Google
depending on competitive it is so high
search volume low competition in other
words the ratio between the two is the
ideal combination so going back to the
spreadsheet recommend you have that
spreadsheet handy put your theme in
place okay theme Pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find
the volume we use the all entitled
syntax to find the competition so we
entered both of those numbers in and we
get our ratio and so when you have these
numbers for a number of different
keywords you want to be able to choose
that ratio of high volume low
competition but always relevancy always
trumps ratio so always go with a keyword
that is going to be relevant to your
content don't choose a keyword that's
not relevant if you choose a keyword
that's not relevant it's not going to
bode well for user engagement so the
difficulty of a keyword ranges from 0 to
100 in Google's keyword tool so it's
going to be easy it's going to be medium
it's going to be hard but my
recommendation is also to get the
numerical factor and that's the all and
title syntax and again relevancy is what
drives the traffic to your website and
keep the traffic there on your website
and also not only will it keep the
traffic on your website but hopefully
get that traffic to engage and convert
so that's the key about relevancy you
always want to choose keywords that are
relevant to your content even if it's
sacrificing volume relevancy again
trumps volume and competition so always
choose relevant keywords first so when
you do that you're always almost
guarantee that at some point somebody's
going to find your content because
somebody out there might be looking for
it and if they do you're going to get
found and then the engagement is going
to be better so understand your business
find keywords that are relevant to your
business and then focus on those key
wordss that'll help you with getting the
right traffic to your site always keep
in mind the commercial intent so these
keywords are more specific and result in
conversion rate for example buying is a
good commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your
website and buy then focus on those
types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could
be our commercial intent keyword again
there may be low search volume but those
are the type of keywords you want to
focus on because that's the type of
traffic you want to drive to your site
so some other examples like commercial
intent keywords or discount deal your
coupon shipping you don't don't be
afraid to use some of these keywords as
part of your longer tail keyword phrase
again the volume may not be high but the
traffic quality is probably going to be
better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen
your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's
going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk
about keywords we also want to talk
about our primary and secondary keyword
so every page should have at least a
primary keyword and then a second carry
keyword to work with so primary keywords
are really defining the nature of your
content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why
do we choose a primary and secondary
keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to
the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that
secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to
content and you may rank for that
secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one
keyword want to give your yourself a
chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant
nature so for web page there can be
several secondary keywords but only one
primary keyword so your primary keyword
is always going to be relevant to your
content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may
have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the
content and it gives you a better
opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary in search Okay so
let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and
secondary keywords when choosing
keywords so for primary keyword is
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet
plan is directly related to the content
so that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also
related to content and play off the
primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to Google's Keyword Planner
tool and get an idea of the volume for
healthy diet plan and then also the
volume volum and competition for some of
these secondary keywords like healthy
diet for weight loss healthy diet food
low carb diet healthy mail plans and
diet plan weight loss so if I go in to
Google's Keyword Planner and type those
keywords in I'm going to choose get
results and now here I could see healthy
diet plan keyword I'm focusing on as my
primary keyword has an average monthly
search volume of
99,900 and then some of my secondary
keywords healthy diet foods diet plan
weight loss
low carb diet you know Google will give
me a number of different keywords to
work with so I'm going to look at the
search volume of those as well and so
ideally what I want to do is be able to
then look at the volume and then look at
the competition so healthy diet plan I
go into my keyword analysis here that's
my theme so that's my keyword what's my
volume for healthy diet plan
99,900 what's my competition so my
competition is 74 ,700 and that's going
to give me a ratio of volume to
competition of 133% so that's what my
content is about that's a considered a
short tail keyword because it has a lot
of competition and so my ratio is 133%
and what I want to do is I want to be
able to put these other secondary
keywords in here as well maybe even go
to a little longer tail because I want
to be able to find two key at least two
keywords I want to be able to find my
primary keyword that's relevant to my
content and then I want to be able to
find my secondary keyword which is again
related to the primary keyword which is
also related to the content and so I
want to be able to choose two keywords
basically and I want to choose two
keywords that are relevant that have
good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea
again of how to do keyword research you
want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and get a
sense of what the volume is the
competition is look at the ratio between
the volume and competition and then
based on the content choose that primary
keyword and then again based on the
keyword you chose choose some secondary
keywords as well because you want to be
found for not just one keyword but
multiple keywords okayy let's look at
some alternative suggestions to keyword
research so for doing keyword research
we want to take into account LSI
keywords we could take into account
other platforms that host a lot of
content like Kora or Reddit we can use
Google suggestions in the keyword search
bar we can use popular platforms like
Wikipedia and we can use social media
bookmarking like Reddit so there are
lots of suggestions that we can obtain
from various sources so let's start with
LSI keywords and LSI stands for latent
semantic insect indexing and so
basically what it is it's just keywords
that are linked to your primary keyword
and and so when you're choosing keywords
you always want to choose that primary
keyword and then secondary keywords that
are similar to the primary keyword and
usually those are LSI or latent semantic
indexing type keywords so they're used
to drive relevant traffic to your page
so if you're focusing on one keyword we
want to have other keywords that are
similar to increase our visibility on
the search Eng result pages so we could
find latent semantic indexing right in
search so if we use the term healthy
diet if we go to Google search for
example if I type in healthy diet in
Google search all I need to do is scroll
to the bottom of the page and I can see
searches related to healthy diet so
healthy diet menu healthy diet essay
what does a healthy diet look like
notice at the top Google's also given me
some other suggestions here so they're
saying low fat diet veganism gluten-free
diet so there's lots of different
suggestions right in Google search bar
so all of these are LSI related keywords
if you're optimizing a page for healthy
diet then you could choose lowfat diet
as a secondary keyword you can use
gluten-free diet as a secondary keyword
it really depends on what the content is
but you always want to support your
content with as much LSI keywords as
possible so you can be found for as many
different keywords as possible in Google
search so it's important because if you
have a Blog that you know talks about
python so how do the search engines know
if the website python is about the
programming language or the snake so
Google for example uses LSI keywords to
understand what the page is specifically
focusing on so if you're just focusing
on Python and your content you want to
support that with LSI keywords and so
that will allow your web page to better
communicate with Google also to have the
visibility to show up on search so they
can certainly improve your search
positioning and featured Snippets as
well so if you have a keyword that
answers a question you could certainly
found for Featured snippet for example
maybe you know healthy diet recipes if I
type that in you could see here there's
a featured snippet so if I'm talking
about recipes that's a keyword I may
want to use and if I use that then
Google has an opportunity to see what my
contents about and place my information
at the top in this featured snippet you
can also again see what some of
questions are being asked what meals are
good for weight loss what is a good
healthy diet plan all of these could be
keyword phrases that you can use so the
answers are right here in Google so cor
is a great platform because cor is a
platform that people go and ask
questions in a community responds with
answers or responses to that particular
question or topic and so the great thing
about core is it's a good it's a good
place for you you to go to get some
ideas about a specific topic so if we're
talking about healthy dieting so we can
find keywords with high search volume
writing Kora so the whole idea is you
can look at you know the top five
questions for specific topic like
healthy dieting and find relevant key
wordss to healthy dieting so if you just
type in that particular key word in Kora
you're going to probably get some
responses to questions or responses to
somebody else's question and so if we
take a look at core for example so if I
just type in healthy dieting what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get some
responses to the the topic healthy
dieting so what's the best diet for
Healthy Living what are the top five
tips for a healthy diet habit so all of
these could be keyword phrases that you
could take away with for your own
content and so the benefit here is
you're getting kind of an idea of what's
trending what people are talking about
and if you use tips for a healthy diet
habit for example and you optimize for
that well again that could turn around
and bode well for you because you could
be featured in Google as a featured
snippet at the top here you can also
turn around and use LSI related keywords
for healthy diet habits and you can
simply just look for those LSI keywords
right in Google remember at the bottom
or at the Top If I scroll down I can see
some related LSI keywords at the bottom
so writing Google as well you could see
in the Google search bar that Google
provides some LSI related keywords to
your query so if I go back here and type
in healthy diet recipes I could see here
Google suggesting some other related
keywords healthy diet menu healthy diet
for men healthy diet foods healthy diet
for women so these are all LSI related
keywords that you can use to support
your primary keyword and the content
you're writing about so we've talked
about LSI keywords where to find them so
they're found right here they could be
found at the top of Google and they can
be found at the bottom you can also then
go to core as well and get some ideas
for the types of questions they're being
asked so if you ask a question and use
that as your keyword phrase then again
you have an opportunity of showing up
for a featured snippet in Google just by
doing some additional research within
Google itself or on Coral so according
to Google the autocomplete predictions
are automatically generated by Google's
algorithm without any human intervention
it's based on a number of factors but
the primary factor is how often past
users have searched for term so Google
collects all the keyword queries that
somebody types in and they're suggesting
some of the most popular terms that
people have typed in so if I go back to
Google again if I start to type in
recipes I could see some of the other
queries that somebody else has typed in
or some of the most popular queries
related to that topic so if you enter
the keyword healthy diet Google's going
to suggest multiple keyword suggestions
that users have had past in the past and
you could certainly get the search
volume of those keywords just by looking
in Google itself I could see for healthy
diet recipes billions of pages related
to healthy diet recipes I can also get
the search volume by going into Google's
Keyword Planner so if I type in healthy
diet I'm going to be able to see what my
search volume is for that keyword and in
addition I can see the seasonality of
that particular keyword and in addition
to that Google's going to provide some
other related keywords to my search
query so if I'm looking for healthy diet
Google's going to suggest hey maybe you
should choose healthy food or healthy
eating or how to lose weight so those
are LSI related keywords that Google
provides in the keyword plan which is
built into the Google ads platform
another option for you is Wikipedia so
Wikipedia is a vast platform of content
so we could turn Wikipedia into our own
assets and use it to our own Advantage
by finding relevant keywords in an easy
fashion so with Wikipedia we can
identify a list of keywords in The Meta
description itself we could choose
keywords from the P paragraph of
Wikipedia it has many relevant keywords
or we can take a look at keywords from
the Wikipedia content section so we can
also see additional Pages like the see
also section that gives relevant
keywords that you're looking for we can
also look at the references section as
they contain relevant keywords so if we
go to Wikipedia as an example and I type
in healthy diet into Wikipedia here I
can get just in the first paragraph
alone I can see some additional keywords
that I might choose to use like
micronutrients I never knew that
micronutrients was related to healthy
diet but Wikipedia is providing some
information about what micronutrients is
and maybe I can use that as a keyword an
LSI related key word to my content so if
I scroll down I can to see also section
so it might give me some information
food information to Consumers for
example dietary guidelines I can look at
categories like dietetics and diets I
can also look at the references section
so I can also see what information was
provided like health effects of
overweight and obesity I can look at
diet and physical activity so all of
these are related to my keyword healthy
diet so the answers are right in here on
the platform they're just all over the
page so Wikipedia has an abundance of
information you just need to know where
to look so again with Wikipedia you can
look no further than the first paragraph
you can look no further than the C also
section the referencing section category
section there's lots of information
right on the page itself to help you get
ideas for keywords so if you Google your
keyword with Wikipedia term in the
search query and get relevant keywords
from the title tag tags on the serup so
you can also do that as well so if I
type in healthy diet Wikipedia and
search I can also get some information
here as well so people also search for
healthy food advantages or healthy food
habits essay or information about
healthy food all of these are related to
my keyword healthy diet so again another
bit of information for you to choose or
look to choose some additional keywords
for it's so Reddit it's a popular
Community where people post content
discuss a variety of topics so that's
what Reddit is so with the help of
subreddits an individual can find
relevant keywords with with high search
volume so in Reddit there's an easy way
to find out keywords they have a keyword
tool called keyword it so keyword it
gives the average monthly searches for a
particular keyword so if we type a Word
in key rdit and choose keywords from the
autogenerator list this tool will
extract the keywords and give us those
relevant terms of search volume so if we
go to the keyword it and Show an example
of that for example healthy food if I
get keywords I can see what keywords are
relevant and the search volume of that
keyword so if I just type in healthy
food keyworded tool is going to tell me
some relevant keywords and what the
volume is so if you don't have the
Keyword Planner tool in Google ads
available to you this is a good
alternative solution to finding keyword
so it's free you just need to go to
keyword it.com type in your keyword
click get keywords and what it's going
to do is give you some relevant keywords
related to your primary keyword with the
search volume let's talk about keyword
clustering now so the whole idea about
keyword clustering is to really take
advantage of the keywords that we're
optimizing for to gain higher ranking so
if we can cluster keywords together in a
theme and that theme of keywords is
relevant to a specific page of a website
then we have a better opportunity to
rank so in other words why do we have to
Target just one keyword when we can
Target many so keep in mind you know LSI
keywords we want to group a bunch of
keywords together that are similar for
Content so for example after some
keyword research you can thematically
group keywords into a core topic so for
example we can cluster these group of
keywords together like for example what
is SEO how does work intro to SEO what
are the basics of SEO all of those are
related to the court theme what is SEO
another cluster keywords for example
could be SEO techniques SEO best
practices tips and tricks website
optimization on page SEO techniques Etc
so those are clusters of keywords okay
that we can group together in themes and
if we group keywords together in themes
we can apply that to a particular
content on our website so the whole idea
behind clustering keywords it's going to
provide more diversity more of an
opportunity for us to be found so that's
the whole idea behind clustering so some
additional steps remember stay up to
date on industry news so brainstorm your
ideas first and identify a list of
keywords I.E a theme of keywords that
you can cluster together and then you
could determine the keywords that your
competitors are already ranking for so
for example if we want to rank for the
keyword SEO best practices for example
we can use a tool called keyword Moz if
I go to keyword the keyword explore tool
in Moz and just type in SEO best
practices what it's going to do is it's
going to give me some volume related to
that particular keyword but more
importantly what it's also going to do
is going to show me what pages are
already ranked for that particular
keyword so therefore I can get a sense
of who is already ranking for that
keyword so here I can see mzmz
medium.com alexa.com so I can get a
sense of what web pages are ranked for a
particular keyword or group of keywords
I want to rank for myself so if we look
at tools for keyword research look no
further than Moz that's the Moz is the
tool I would just use but you could also
use Google's Keyword Planner which we
used in the example so for example if I
go back to the Google ads Keyword
Planner if you're in Google ads you you
click on tools you click on Keyword
Planner and what Keyword Planner does is
it provides you for particular keyword
the average monthly search volume over
the past 12 months it provides you
information on seasonality so if I hover
my mouse over a graph I'm going to be
able to see the volume per month over
the last 12 months what the Keyword
Planner also does is it provides me some
additional ideas for my particular
keyword and in addition to that it's
going to provide me some sense of how
competitive that keyword is by telling
me whether it's low medium or high in
terms of competition so there's ASM rush
there's also other additional keywords
tools out there like word stream or hre
or the Reddit tool keyword it and then
MZ is a is another tool I particularly
use so if I go to Moz again here I can
just type in a keyword that I'm
interested in it's going to give me the
search volume of that keyword it's going
to give me the level of difficulty so 50
out of 100 so it's halfway between
difficulty and easy and then it's going
to give me some additional metrics like
for example what my expected organic
clickthrough rate would be if I were to
rank for this keyword but more
importantly what I like about this is we
could see exactly what other sites are
linked to this particular keyword we're
interested in so here I can look at the
top 10 list so this is maz's key word
Explorer tool so so that's what this
tool is and it's part of moz.com so
there's a lot of tools at your disposal
I particularly use Moz I particularly
use Google's Keyword Planner and those
are the tools I use but there are lots
of tools out there Google analytics I
very excited to be with you today
because Google analytics is one of my
favorite Google platforms and my
favorite topics so let's talk about what
we're going to cover today and we're
going to start out with how to set up a
Google analytics account and so we're
going to talk about everything that
entails including creating your Google
analytics account we're going to talk
about setting up a property in your
account and what a property is we're
going to talk about setting up a
reporting view in your property and
we're going to talk about installing the
tracking code so those are the series of
steps we're going to go through today in
terms of setting up a Google analytics
account so let's get right to it and so
really the Bruin prerequisite here when
it comes comes to setting up a Google
analytics account is to have a Google
login an ID so when you actually go to
Google analytics you need to be able to
sign up or sign in and so once you
actually sign in then you're going to go
walk through a series of steps but
really that's really all you need to get
the account going is a Google ID and
login so if you have a Gmail account or
other email account that that you use
for other Google products then you're
good to go that's all you need to do so
when you actually go to sign up for
Google analytics you're going to be
asked to set up a new account and these
are the series of steps you're going to
walk through or go through to set up a
new Google Analytics account so you're
going to choose an account name and then
you're going to choose a property name
okay so the account name can be anything
you want it to be the name your company
your name whatever you want to name it
the property
name is really the website name so what
website are we talking about so here I'm
going to set up a fictitious website
name for now it's called demo simply
learn so the URL for this website demo
simply learn is going to be demo.
simplylearn dcom so that's the property
when we talk about properties in
analytics we're really talking about
what websites we want to measure and
then you're going to be asked to choose
an industry category and so for simply
learn we're in jobs and education but
you have a number of different
industries that you could choose from
it's is important go ahead and choose
the most relevant industry that your
particular business is associated with
okay and I'm going to talk about why
that's important here in a minute and
then you're going to choose your time
zone and the time zone is also important
because that's when the day starts in
analytics then the day ends based on
that time zone so the data that Google
analytics collects starts and ends with
that time zone so very important to
choose the time zone your business is
located in okay and then you have some
additional options here okay so you have
some settings and so the first setting
is to allow Google products and services
so if you opt into this then basically
what Google's going to do is share some
products and services with you via email
I would go ahead and opt into that
that's of course recommended by Google
it doesn't hurt to hear from Google on
related products and services that may
enhance your business the second is
benchmarking so benchmarking to me is
something you should opt into so going
back to that industry and category we
chose jobs and education so by opting
into benchmarking basically what
Google's going to do is share your data
that it collects on your website in this
case demo. simplylearn
that data
anonymously with others in the industry
in this case jobs and education and
because you've opted in it's going to do
the same exact thing for you it's going
to share Anonymous data on other
websites in the same industry and the
benefit of that is we get to see what
other websites or how other websites are
performing compared to ours what's the
Benchmark in our industry and so the
benchmarking to me is important and I'm
going to go over that in a few minutes
when we go over the different reports
but to me I would always opt into
benchmarking because this is the only
report Google provides in analytics
about how others in your industry is
performing versus your website okay so
it's a way to compare your website
performance against others in the same
industry the other options here
technical support and account specialist
I would also recommend you opt into
those because then it'll allows you to
basically Google allow Google access to
your account and they'll be able to help
you if you occur or run into any issues
so these are the options in setting up a
Google analytics account it's very
simple very easy to do you're just
entering in a few Fields note that we
talking about a website right now so I'm
talking about demo. simply learn.com but
just know that if you want to track a
mobile app Google analytics will allow
you to do that as well you just choose
the option mobile app so we're tracking
a website we want to know how users
behave when they get to my website and
that's what Google analytics is going to
allow us to measure and look at we just
need to do a couple more steps in the
process so once we fill out these fields
here we're going to click get tracking
ID now I'm going to accept the terms of
service I'm going to accept another
terms and service in relation to data
protection I'm going to click accept
once I accept I'm going to be able to
get some tracking code the tracking ID
is the ID associated with your account
and so this number is going to be
associated with your account so your
account ID starts with UA and it's going
to be this number here now the dash one
is the property you set up so in this
case I set up demo. simply learn.com if
I wanted to track multiple we we sites
under that same account then I can
certainly set up multiple properties
just know that every property I set up
in that account is going to have a d
1-2-3-4 Etc depending on how many
properties I set up so by default I set
up one property so my first property ID
is -1 if I set up a second property the
same account number it's just going to
have a-h to and that's important because
that ID that account and property ID is
going to be associated with that
particular property or website so again
once you finish setting up the account
settings then you're going to be asked
to add some tracking code to your site
and that tracking code is going to be
related to the account and the property
so notice my tracking ID up here notice
the tracking ID in the snippet of code
now this snippet of code needs to go on
every page of your website that you want
to track and you don't have to put it on
every page but if you want to track
website behavior on every page of your
website then it needs to go on every
page of your website so if you're using
a you know platform like druple or jumla
or even more popular platform like
WordPress adding the tracking code
sitewide is as easy as maybe adding a
Google analy plugin to Wordpress for
example and then just simply plug in in
the ID now there's an alternative to
adding the Google analytics tracking
code to your site and that's Google tag
manager so Google tag manager is the way
I would recommend going so if you're not
familiar with Google tag manager I would
recommend watching the YouTube video we
have on Google tag manager you can just
go to YouTube Type in simply learn
Google tag manager and this will give
you a nice overview of you know what
Google tag manager is and how it works
but basically this is the way I would go
and I would recommend that in addition
to having Google analytics you set up a
Google tag manager account and then that
way you can put the tracking code in
Google tag manager so if I go to Google
tag manager and I just go into an
account on tag manager I can just simply
put in the Google analytics ID right
into tag manager and so if I have have
it in tag manager then tag manager is
going to be the place that holds the
code and fires page view when somebody
comes to my website so that way I don't
have to add the tracking code to my
website if I do it in tag manager so
that's the recommended method for me is
to add the Google analytics ID associate
it with tag manager if you can associate
it with tag manager then that's the
easier route to go versus putting code
on your website okay so again take a
look at the video we have on YouTube for
Google tag manager that's the route I
would go now once you do get the
tracking code on your website whether
that be through Google tag manager or
through a Plugin or you know just simply
adding the script to your site to pages
on your site then what's going to happen
is you're going to start collecting data
so that's ideally the way it works you
need to add this code to your website
now if you're not ready to do that that
and you simply want to basically
understand how Google analytics works
then I would recommend getting access to
Google analytics demo account and so if
you just type in and search Google
analytics demo account basically what
you're going to do you're going to
choose the first listing there and
you're going to go to demo account so if
you have a Google analytics or Google
login then all you need to do is click
on access demo account and so what
Google's going to do is put this demo
account into your account and so it's
going to look something like this if I
click on demo account here it's going to
add to my Google analytics account so
I'm going to have then access to the
demo account from Google in Google
analytics so I would recommend going
this route here if you're not familiar
you're not sure what you're getting
yourself into so think of the demo
account as kind of a test drive you're
test driving Google Analytics before you
even add any code to your website so
again all you need is a Google account
and if you have a Google account and you
add the demo account to your Google
analytics account you're going to be
able to see how analytics works okay and
so that's what I would also recommend so
if you're not ready to start adding code
to your website then what you can do is
just simply add the demo account and
then once you add the demo account
you're free to peruse around Google
Analytics to see the different types of
reports it has to offer now when you do
actually set up a Google analytics
account you're going to have some
settings that you're going to want to
pay attention to so when you set up the
account you have the account name and
then you have a property so under each
property you have by default you're
going to have one View and so here you
can see this view here so if we look at
the account we set up we set up a demo
simply learn account property is demo
simply learn say so that's associated
with the website we're going to track
and then again by default under each
property you're going to have a view and
so by default the name of the view is
going to be called all website data and
so in that view is where all your
analytics data is going to be stored so
you can see my screen here there's a lot
of different settings you have you have
settings under the account you have
settings under the property and you have
settings under the view so we're going
to talk more about these settings and
future webinars for advanced Google
analytics users but for now know that
there's a bunch of settings that you
have that you can play around with when
it comes to Google analytics anything
from adding users to your Google
analytics account your Google anals
property or view you can actually set up
goals you can set up filters you can set
up segments you can link up Google ads
you can you know set up remarketing list
there's a lot you can do in terms of the
settings as it relates to Google
analytics but so know those settings are
there they're located right down here in
this little sprocket icon that's the
admin icon so if you need to get to
these settings at any time you could
simply just click on the sprocket or the
admin icon and then you'll be prompted
to choose any one of these settings here
that you want to edit or alter so now
let's take a look at some Google
analytics reports so once you've
actually set up your account you have a
number of different reports that you
have available to you in Google
analytics so we're going to take a look
at you know customized reports we're
going to look at real time audience
reports acquisition behavior and
conversion so these are all the
different reporting buckets if you will
that you have available to you in Google
analytics so if I'm an admin and I'm
looking at the Google demo account let's
start out out by looking at real time so
if I click on the real time report and I
just click on overview so basically what
this is going to do is show me at this
point in time how many users I actually
have active on the website okay so
that's why they call it real time
reporting because it allows you to see
the behavior of users who are currently
on your website and so this is the
overview report under real time and you
can see here I can see that
79% of my users are coming from desktop
18% 20% are coming from mobile and then
approximately 3% are coming from tablet
here I can see how they actually came to
the website so this is the referring
Source if they came from say search or
social I can see the source there and I
can see what pages they're active on and
then here I can see what locations where
they're located and so if I want to see
a breakdown of everything in the
overview I can certainly do that if I go
to locations under real time I can see a
majority of my users are coming from the
United States okay where are they coming
from I'll just click on traffic sources
and here I could see the different
sources and mediums medium is the means
in which the traffic was driven so if
it's Google it's either paint search or
organic search so I can see here it's
organic then I can actually see what
content they're looking at on my website
so I can see currently I have three
active users on the homepage two active
users on the Google's women's whet page
so forth and so on now most importantly
if you have a event tracking set up so
if you taking a look at our Google tag
manager webinar you know that you could
set up event tracking in Google
analytics to measure engagement on your
website whether that be a form
submission or somebody clicking on the
play button button of a video so if I
click on events I'll be able to see what
events are firing so here I can see we
have event tracking set up and I can see
how many different events are firing on
my website in real time so here I can
see e-commerce somebody clicking on the
quick view click some a couple of users
clicking on add to cart a couple of
users clicking on the promotion click
and as these events are fired you're
going to be able to see them highlighted
so if something gets fired it's going to
get highlighted and I could see that
these are the current events that I have
currently firing on the website and
that's what's currently fired now if I
want to look at the events that have
happened in the last 30 minutes I can
just click on this link here last 30
minutes and it's going to give me an
overview of the events that have
happened over the past 30 minutes okay
so that's event tracking and then more
importantly we can also look at what
conversions are happening in real time
just by clicking on conversions and so
now I could see I had one active user
who entered the checkout so that's goal
number four so in analytics you can have
up to 20 goals and so here I can see we
have goal number four has already had
one active user and so if I look at the
last 30 minutes I can see I still have
only one goal over the last 30 minutes
and that was somebody who entered the
checkout so that's real time reporting
in summary it just gives you an idea of
what's currently happening on your
website and so for me ideally if I'm
launching a campaign or let's just say
you do a new website redesign and you
want to see how users performing and
behaving then real time is a good option
for you so you can see how things are
happening in real time now let's jump
down to audience reporting so if I click
on audience if is just right underneath
real time I'm going to see a number of
different reports of available to me
under audience and so let's click on the
audience overview report so audience
reporting basically allows us to get a
sense of who is coming to our website
when I say who is coming to our website
it doesn't necessar have to be a
specific person in fact Google doesn't
allow personally identifiable
information in Google analytics personal
identifiable information such as a
specific name uh social security number
credit card information Etc however we
could still paint a nice picture on who
is coming to our website meaning what
country city or state did they come from
what language what device did they get
to our website from how old were they
okay were they male or female or other
what interest did they have what browser
did they use so we can paint a nice
picture based on all this information
that Google analytics is providing us
under audience so if I go to audience
overview here I can see I have all these
different options available to me to get
a basic understanding of who is coming
to our website so for example I could
see a majority of the people coming to
our website speak English and are from
the United States okay in fact that
represents 61% of the users and so
Google analytics does a great job of
giving me an overall percentage so if I
have a 100% of the users I could see 61%
of those users represented
English-speaking users from the United
States 7% represented English-speaking
users from Great Britain and so when it
comes to analytics we have users and
users are broken down into two
categories they're either returning or
they're new so when you add the Google
analytics tracking script to your
website what's going to happen happen is
if a user or when a user goes to your
website they're going to get cookied and
if it's the first time they've been to
your website what Google analytics is
going to do is store a cookie in the
browser so when that same user comes
back another day in the same browser
analytics is going to recognize that
that cookie is in the browser and so
then analytics is going to categorize
that user as a returning user okay so
that's how analytics is able to
differentiate new versus returning so if
that user doesn't have a cookie in the
browser then analytics is going to
recognize that store the cookie and then
count that user as a new user and so
when you're looking in analytics you're
going to be able to see a breakdown of
new versus returning so here I can see
over 34 of my traffic over the past week
here I can see April 6th through April
12th three over 34 are new users to the
website here I could see about 23 24% %
are returning users okay so I can get a
good breakdown of what type of users are
coming am I driving new traffic am I
driving traffic that's been to my
website before what language are they
speaking okay I can also paint a bigger
picture how old are they are they what
gender are they do they come from mobile
so let's take a look at some of these
different reports under audience so if I
skip down now to demographics I can
click on overview and when that report
loads I can see now under demographics
overview I can see the breakout of age
ranges and so here I can see the
majority of the traffic coming to my
site again over the past week now if I
want to change this date range I could
simply do that I can change the date
range just by clicking on the date range
and then maybe going say the last 30
days and I can even compare it to the
previous period or the previous year I'm
going to choose the last 30 days I'm
going to click apply now I'm looking at
data over the last 30 days and again you
can change the date range to any range
you want you can only go back as far as
when you actually created the Google
analytics account you can't go prior to
that so here I'm looking at the last 30
days and I can see almost
47% of my users were in the age range of
25 to 34 now when it comes to gender I
can see
66% represent males so I can get a
breakout of gender and age as well as
interest and click on interest and look
at the overview there and see what the
interest is of the users who are coming
to my site based on in market segments
or Affinity I can also choose language
and location so if I want to know
exactly where my users are located when
they're coming to my website I can click
on location and here I can get a
breakout 43% of the users of the last 30
days were from the United States more
importantly I can align my audience with
goals and we'll talk about goals here in
a minute but here I can see if I have an
e-commerce website I can see of those
43% 29% of those converted or purchased
something and that equates to 94
transactions so I can get a good of not
only how many users are coming from a
specific country but are those users
converting if I click on mobile and
mobile to me is one of those reports I
tend to spend a bit of time on CU I want
to know what devices users are coming to
my website and so for my website here or
this is the Google demo website I can
see mobile represents approximately
27% of the traffic so desktop still
represents a majority of the traffic so
for you you want to keep an eye on
mobile because mobile is definitely a
majority of what people use nowadays
that's how people start their day that's
how they transact Via Mobile whether
that's purchasing something
communicating or searching it all starts
with mobile so you want to keep an eye
on mobile and more importantly you want
to keep an eye on Behavior so Google
analytics is telling me that yes I have
approximately 27% of my traffic of the
last 30 days came from mobile how are
they interacting with my website so if I
look across this report I'm going to be
able to see different metrics so if I'm
measuring specific metrics against my
dimension in this case the dimension is
what we're measuring and in this example
we're measuring mobile I can see that
the bounce rate is approximately 48% and
bounce rate means that if a user in this
case for mobile landed on a page they
left the site without going any further
so they consider it a bounce if they
don't go to another page if they leave
the site from the page they landed on
and they don't go any further that's
considered a bounce so a bounce rate is
the percentage of people who come to the
site and leave the site without going
any further so in this case we have 48%
balance rate that's almost half of our
users who come from mobile leave the
website from the page they landed on so
is that good is that bad well it's open
to interpretation is definitely
subjective but you want to keep the
balance rate as low as possible you want
to keep people on your site especially
if you have an e-commerce website you
want people who come to your website to
purchase and so here we can see 48%
mobile and desktop it's a little bit
lower at 41% now if I look a little bit
further at engagement I can see how many
pages on average do mobile users look at
so versus desktop it's a little bit
lower you can see 3.86 on desktop it's
4.5 now if I look a little bit further
in engagement I want to be able to
measure how long somebody from mobile
stays on the website if they're bouncing
at 48% but they're all Al looking at 3.8
Pages 3.9 almost four pages per session
then that means in this report analytics
is tell me they're spending about 2
minutes on the site and interestingly
enough I can see that mobile over the
last 30 days had more transactions so 51
transactions versus 34 transactions from
desktop and interestingly enough the
eCommerce conversion rate is at 29%
that's higher than desktop at 07 it's
lower than tablet but it's higher than
desktop and mobile has the most
transactions and since they have the
most transactions they have the most
Revenue at
2,380 so yes the engagement isn't
exactly as great as it is as desktop but
we can see that people are still
purchasing with their mobile devices so
it's something to keep an eye on and
mobile is something I definitely look at
in fact since it's such an important
report one thing you can do in analytics
is if you actually like a report and you
think you're going to look at that
report multiple times then you can
simply just go ahead and click save at
the top here so if I click save I'm
going to enter a name for this report
I'm just going to call it mobile report
and click okay and then what's going to
happen is it's going to be located under
save reports and save reports is located
under customization customization is
located above real time okay so if I
close that up you can see audience real
time customization if I click on
customization if I click on Save reports
I should be able to see my save report
here and I do so here I can see mobile
report if I click on it I can simply go
to the report I was looking at before I
saved it so save reports to me is a good
feature in analytics cuz it allows you
to quickly access a report that you've
saved in the past so just take a look at
one more report under audience and let's
go to benchmarking so remember when we
were setting up our analytics account we
had the option to opt into benchmarking
and I recommended you do so and so if
you did actually opt into benchmarking
then you're going to be able to see how
your site compares to others in the same
industry so if I click on benchmarking
and then click on channels what I'm
actually able to do next now is compare
my website with others in the same
industry so if I go back to say jobs in
education and I choose education all
education as my industry vertical I
should be able to see websites that are
in the same particular industry and how
I compare with those websites so I'm
choosing all countries I can narrow that
down if I wanted to I can just search
for the United States I can choose a
specific F date and then I can choose a
particular site size so here I'm
choosing sites by daily session so these
are sites that have an average of 5,000
to almost 10,000 sessions a day and so
in this vertical education in the United
States sites that have 5,000 to
99,999 sessions per day that means that
there are approximately 310 web
properties contributing to this report
okay based on this criteria I chose now
if my site is similar meaning if I'm in
the United States if I'm in education
and I'm receiving 5,000 to
99,999 sessions per day then I'm able to
compare my site against 310 other
websites now Google's sharing this data
anonymously from the other websites and
they're doing the same with your website
to those particular websites
benchmarking reports okay so it's sh
share data anonymously in particular
Industries and verticals and so now I'm
looking at a channel report so if I want
to see how I compare to others in my
industry then I can go ahead and see by
channel for example am I driving as much
traffic as others in my industry and you
could see I'm not in fact I'm 76 77%
worse in terms of the amount of traffic
being driven from organic search so
anything in red is going to show as a
negative result a negative comparison
whereas something in green is a positive
comparison so if I look at engagement I
can see that I might not be driving as
much traffic but I can see that the
pages per session are better than the
site average or the industry average I
can see if I go over again looking just
at organic search I can see the bounce
rate is better than the industry average
so the Channel report under benchmarking
allows you to measure how you compare to
others in your industry and you could do
so by looking at location and devices so
if you opted into benchmarking when you
set up your account then you'll be able
to compare your website against others
in your industry in your country region
and based on the size of your website in
terms of how many visitors or sessions
you're getting per day so let's go from
audience to acquisition so if audience
is who is coming to your website
acquisition allows us to see how the
traffic was driven to your website so
how did these users get to our website
and so under acquisition if we click on
overview we'll be able to see an
overview of how users whether they're
returning or new came to our website and
so what analytics does by default is
they have a number of default channels
and when we say Channel we mean
analytics is grouping different channels
based on how users got to your website
meaning how did users get to a website
did they come via organic search meaning
did they type something into Google and
find you in the organic listing
analytics also groups users based on
whether they came to your site directly
meaning did they type in the URL
directly into the browser or did they
bookmark your website and come back via
the bookmark so they're grouping users
under direct they also group users under
referral meaning do they come from
another website they group users by
social do they come from a social media
platform like Twitter or Facebook if
you're running paid search meaning if
you're running paid search on say Google
then do they come from Paid search ads
now if you're running display ads on say
Google's Network Google's Display
Network that's a default channel so
analytics Will Group users there so if
they don't recognize a channel then
they're going to group it as others so
by default Google analytics groups users
on how they came to your website via
these default channels and so I can see
how many users came to the site from
each Channel now if I want to drill down
on this report I can click on all
traffic and then if I click on all
traffic I can go to channels I can look
specifically at the channels report and
so now I can see organic sech SE again
over the last 30 days is the number one
channel driving traffic and they
represent approximately again you can
see this number here in parentheses next
to the raw number of users I can see
that number is about
56% so 56% of my traffic over the last
30 days came from organic search and so
those are the number of users again as a
metric you're also going to have
sessions and you'll see sessions a lot
is a metric so users are broken down
between new and returning so every time
a new or returning user comes to the
website basically what they're doing is
initiating a session so you can have a
user who can come back multiple times
every time they come back to the website
it's a session so session is simply the
start of somebody coming to your website
and the session ends when they leave the
website and so just like we looked at
with the audience reports when it came
to mobile we can also look at engagement
by channel so just like mobile we looked
at balance rate pages per session
average session duration we can do the
same thing here with our Channel report
more importantly in addition to behavior
we can see conversions and since we're
running it e Commerce platform we could
see what the conversion rate is by
channel so organic search did drive the
most traffic and they did have the most
transactions over the last 30 days and
the conversion rate in this case is .17
okay so how Google determines the
conversion rate they basically take the
number of transactions and divide that
by sessions so that means that over the
last 30 days organic search drove 38,1
123 sessions and of those 38,1 123 64
actually turned into a transaction which
equates to17 which also equates to 3,000
in Revenue so I'm able to determine not
only how users are getting to my website
by looking at the channel report I can
actually see if they're engaging and if
they are converting and notice when you
look at a report in analytics you can
look at it by Channel you'll also get a
summary so here I can see a summary or a
total B based on my date range so I can
see over the last 30 days I've had
54,000 users
49,000 of them were new okay that meant
that out those 54,000 users I had 70,000
sessions I can see my average balance
rate was 43% the pages per session were
just over 4 and the average session
duration how long did somebody stay on
my website on average about 2 minutes
and 55 seconds the average conver verion
rate was .14 and I had a total of 97
transactions totaling
$5500 okay and that's all over the last
30 days so any report you look at in
analytics is going to have a summary and
note that any report you look at in
analytics is going to allow you to save
it so if it's a report you think you're
going to go back and look at at a future
date then you simply just have to click
on the save button conversely if you
don't want to save it you can simply
just export it so you can export it as a
PDF if I click on PDF it's going to
allow me to export that as a PDF now you
have other options available to you as
well you can do a Google sheet you can
export it as an Excel or you can export
it as a common delimited file so here
you can see I can save it as a PDF if I
want to and if I click okay it's going
to save to my desktop or location of my
choosing and then I can go back and look
at in that format at a later time so
that's the export feature available to
you in analytics again if you you could
save it as well or you can export it
okay some other reports under
acquisition if you're running Google ads
note that you can connect Google ads to
analytics and this is key because now I
can see how many people are coming from
Google ads to my website and are they
converting now this is important because
with Google ads I'm actually paying for
the click so you can see here I'm
running a report based on campaign data
so I could see what campaigns are
driving traffic how much I'm paying per
click and you can see on average I'm
paying 34 cents per click and then more
importantly I want to be able to see if
they're converting so you can see I've
spent
$810 over the last 30 days and received
$858 in Revenue so you want to make sure
that you link up your Google ads account
to your Google analytics account for
this very reason you want to be able to
see how your Google ads campaigns
perform once the users get to your
website and so I want to see if they're
engaging and I want to see if they're
converting so there are all sorts of
reports under Google ads so you can look
at it by keywords by search queries by
hour of the day if you're running
display campaigns you can look at
display targeting so there all sorts of
reports under Google ads you just have
to link it up and you link it up under
the admin now there are other reports
that you can look at so if I go to
campaigns I can look at all campaigns so
if you're running all sorts of different
types of campaigns whether that be on
Facebook whether that be email whether
that be you know other types of
advertising let's just say Twitter or
Instagram you're going to be able to see
those those campaigns here and that's
under all campaigns and again you'll be
able to see the campaign name and you'll
be able to see metrics associated with
those campaigns and more importantly
you'll be able to see your e-commerce if
you're running e-commerce platform or if
you have goals set up so you'll be able
to look at how your campaigns are not
one not only driving traffic but two are
they converting let's go from
acquisition reporting to behavior so
Behavior reports are going to actually
show you how users behaved once they got
to your website once they landed on a
page on your website how did they behave
so when we looked at audience we got a
sense of who is coming with acquisition
we get a sense of how the traffic got to
our website did they come from organic
direct social Etc the behavior reports
allow us to actually measure how that
traffic behaved once they landed on a
page on our website it and so if I go to
overview under Behavior now I'm looking
at this graph here it's showing me how
many page views have had and a page view
is simply once a page is viewed it's
counted as a page view so if a user
comes to my site they're initiating a
session and if they look at a page then
that page is going to have a page view
okay so a user can look at a page
multiple times in a session and every
time they look at that page it's going
to count as a page view so here I can
see in this graph how many pages I've
had again over the last 30 days and if I
look further at my overview report I can
see the specific pages and how many
pages they've had and I can also look at
some other metrics okay the average
balance rate the average time on page I
can look at the exit rate which means
how many people actually exited or the
percentage of people who exited from
that page so I can dig deep deeper into
my behavior reporting so if I click on
site content and I click on all pages
then I'm going to look at a report by
Page this is my Dimension this is what
I'm measuring my page and now I can see
how many page views each page had over
the last 30 days now not you also have
something called unique page views so
unique page views is equivalent to one
per session in other words if a user
came to my site and looked at the
homepage that the homepage is going to
have one unique page view and one page
view now if the user in that same
session looks at other Pages then every
page that user looks at is going to have
one unique page view however if the user
goes back to a to the same page in the
same session then it's still going to be
one unique page view but in this case
the homepage if they look at the
homepage a second time then the homepage
is going to have two page views if they
look at the homepage five times times in
one session then the homepage is going
to have five total page views and one
unique page view okay so that's why
unique pages is equivalent to one per
session where page views is a
accumulation of how many times the page
was viewed in the same session so in
other words you're always going to have
more page views than unique page views
okay so this gives me a sense of how my
page is performed so again I can look at
total page views and then engagement so
so ideally what you want to do with a
report like this is if a user is not
engaging on the page then that should
tell you something about the page itself
if they're not engaging if the bounce
rate's high if the time on page is low
if the exit percentage of exit rate is
high then you probably want to do
something with that page now these are
all pages but if I jump down to landing
pages my landing page report is showing
me how many people actually landed on
that page page and so here I can see
under my landing page report I can see
the homepage had
36,7 sessions in the last 30 days that's
how many people landed on the homepage
so here I can see 71% were new sessions
meaning that I had a lot of new users
who landed on the homepage in fact
25,000 or
52% of the people who landed on the
homepage were new I could see the
balance rate about 42% but of those who
didn't bounce they went on to look at
about 4.5 pages per session and spend
about 3 minutes on the site and the one
thing I like about the landing page
report is I can also see whether that
particular page in this case the
homepage did it help contribute to a
goal or conversion and in this case I
can see of those 36,000 sessions I hit
22 transactions totaling 1,200 in
revenue and that's an e-commerce
conversion rate of
0.6% so the homepage over the last 30
days contributed to
.6% of the revenue so this gives you an
idea of when somebody lands on your
website and they land on a page is that
page helping to move that person along
meaning are they not bouncing and is
that page helping to move people towards
converting and so that's what the
landing page in effect allows us to
measure is the engagement and in this
case we're measuring transactions okay
so analytics also gives us some other
reports under Behavior including sight
speed so sight speed to me is an
important report to look at just like
the mobile report to me site speed's
important because what Google analytics
does is they take a sampling of pages
and in this case you can see over the
last 30 days they sampled
2835 page views and of that sample they
came back and said the average page low
time is about 4 seconds now ideally you
want to keep it as quick as possible I
would say even under 3 seconds okay now
there are other factors involved with
page load time the browser you're using
the country that you actually browsing
that page from mind how to have the best
infrastructure you may may not even be
on the best internet Network meaning
you're on a cell network or the Wi-Fi is
not that great or you can be on a page
that just has a lot of images or a lot
of code that may slow it down so there
are other factors involved and so what
Google analytics does is show you what
those factors are so here I can see by
browser what the average load time is if
I want to look at Country I can see what
country is contributing to the low time
now the great thing about the sight
speed report is if I go to speed
suggestions okay what speed suggestions
is going to do is it's going to show me
the page load Time by Page and then it's
actually going to provide a link where I
can actually click on to get suggestions
on increasing the page load time so for
example I can look at this particular
page here this Google redesign shop
bybrand SL yoube page line number five
if I look at line number five I can see
add average load time of this page is 8
seconds almost 9 seconds okay that's an
eternity to some people now notice this
link next to it so Google's recommending
seven total suggestions so if I click on
seven total what it's actually going to
do it's going to open up a new window
and it's going to open up another Google
report called page speed insights and
Page speed insights is going to give me
some information about what I can do to
create corre correct the page load of
that particular page so look at the site
speed report it's important because
there is a correlation between site
speed or page load time and user
behavior of that page and there's also
correlation between page load time and a
page ranking organically on search so
page load time is very important it's so
important that I'm even going to save it
so I'm going to click save and click on
speed site speed suggestions as my name
and click okay okay and now that report
is going to be saved under customization
under save reports let's jump from
Behavior to conversions now conversion
reporting is arguably the most important
section in Google analytics because what
the conversions reporting allows us to
do is see how people are converting or
if they're not converting on our website
and so in Google analytics we have the
opportunity to set up goals now you have
the opportunity to set up 20 goals in
your Google analytics View and so to set
up a goal okay so you're going to click
on admin and Under The View you're going
to see goals and so if you don't even
have goals the first step is to create
goals and so you have four different
goal types in analytics so you have
pages per session so how many pages per
session is so if your goal is set to say
three or two if somebody actually looked
at two or three pages per session it's
going to count as a goal okay so if I
look here I could see I have pages per
session set at 10 so that means that if
a user came to the site looked at more
than 10 pages per session then it's
going to count as a goal another goal
type is destination so destination means
that if somebody actually went to a
specific page then it's going to count
as a goal and in this case I can see
here that the goal is set to this
particular page here and so when
somebody actually lands on that page
it's going to count as a goal now there
are two other goal types we can look at
one is duration so just like pages per
session in our previous example if
somebody looked at 10 pages per session
it's going to count as a goal with
duration it's based on time so in this
particular case if you set up a duration
goal and the duration is set to say 1
minute and 30 seconds then that means if
a user comes to my website and they
spend at least 1 minute and 30 seconds
then it's going to count as a goal okay
and then the fourth type of goal in
Google analytics is an event-based goal
so when you set up event tracking you
could turn that event into a goal so if
somebody clicks on say the submit button
of a form you can turn that event into a
goal so here you could see the category
equals contact form so you can always
verify if a goal works just by clicking
on verify this goal and in this case
this event is turned into a goal so
anytime somebody fires this event it's
going to count as a goal so you have
four different goal types in Google
analytics you have pages per session
destination event and duration and so
once you've set up a goal then you can
measure goals under conversions so now
if I look at goals overview I can be
able to see how many total goal
completions I've had so if I want to
look at it by goal I can just choose the
goal option here so if I want to look at
for example goal two engaged users this
was the pages per session I can see that
I had a conversion rate of 10% meaning
that I had
7,000 of all the users that came to the
website 7,000 goal completions meaning
7,16 users looked at 10 pages or more on
my website and so that's how you want to
be able to measure whether users where
they ever they're coming from whoever
they are whatever Pages they look at you
want to be able to look at the
conversion reports to see if they're
actually converting based on the goals
you've set up whether that's pages per
session duration destination or event
goal conversion tracking reports can
help you measure who is actually
converting and then the great thing
about Google analytics here is that I
can actually see by segment so the
default segment and a segment is just
looking at a specific user set so the
default segment is always all users
however I can choose a different segment
so if I want to choose instead of all
users if I want to choose Mobile Traffic
I can select Mobile Traffic hit apply so
I'm actually now looking at a subset of
data I'm looking at mobile traffic so of
all the mobile users who've came to my
site I can see
1,400 engaged or looked at 10 pages or
more okay and that's a 7% conversion
rate so the great thing about Google
analytics is you have the opportunity to
set up four different goal types okay
based on those goal types you can go to
goals overview and look at the
conversion rate of each goal but you can
also change the segment of that
particular goal to see who exactly
converted okay another report I like
under conversions is the multi-channel
funnel report so if I click on multi-
channel funnel basically what this
allows me to do is see how different
channels work together to convert so
remember the channel reporting we looked
at under acquisition here I can see now
how different channels work together to
drive the conversion so if I look at
three channels direct organic and
referral I can see all three together
Drive 2% of the conversions if I look at
direct and referral 12 1.2% if I look at
direct and organic
12.24% so I can see how different
channels work together and so if I look
at top conversion paths as an example I
can actually see what channels how
channels work together to drive the
conversion so in this example I can see
over the last 30 days that my top
channel grouping was direct time 2
meaning that somebody came to the
website directly meaning they typed in
the URL in the browser or they
bookmarked it and came to the site okay
they came the first time but didn't
convert but then they came back a second
time via direct and then converted so
that combination is my top conversion
combination of the last 30 days my
second best conversion grouping is
organic search and direct meaning that a
user came to the website via organic
search first did not convert and then
came back via direct the second time and
converted so basically what analytics
does is give credit to the last referral
meaning if you came to the website via
referral a referring website and
converted then the referring website's
going to get the credit for the
conversion but analytics does a good job
of showing you how different channels
work together so a channel may drive a
lot of traffic like organic search but
that traffic may not convert the first
time around for number of different
reasons whether it could be brand
recognition Price shopping reading
content whatever the case analytics is
able to measure if that channel actually
did contribute at a later point and in
this case we could see organic search
drove traffic that didn't convert but
that traffic came back a second time via
direct and did convert so that's our
second best Channel grouping and so the
multi- channel final report talk
conversion pass to me is a good report
to look at so you can actually see not
only have channels work together but you
can see sources and mediums and
campaigns and how all that all those
different campaigns and different
sources work together to convert so
that's just a good report to look at
there are so many different reports
avail in analytics there's so many that
we haven't even gotten to yet so my
advice if you look at the demo report
you can get a feel for each of these
reports under each section whether that
be audience acquisition Behavior or
conversions take a look at these reports
see what makes sense to you see what you
can use to improve your website
performance now if you have any comments
or questions about any of the reports we
covered feel free to comment underneath
the this video we're definitely going to
have more webinars in the future about
specific analytics settings that we
didn't get to today and other types of
analytics reports and features that we
didn't get to today today in this video
Let's Get To Know in detail about Google
analytics 4 Google analytics is a web
analytics service offered by Google it
was launched back in
2005 it tracks and Reports website
traffic from the information through
Wikipedia Google analytics is the most
used web analytics Service as for the
sources in April
2022 Google analytics was used by
73% of the 10,000 most popular website
across the globe however as per the
reports from bwi.com
281 lakh
52477 live websites use Google
analytics so now is the time to
understand what has been changed in
Google analytics over the years if you
are new to Google analytics it's even
better before moving forward do
subscribe to Simply learn and hit the
Bell icon to never miss any updates from
Simply learn so what makes Google
analytics so important Google analytics
generates various types of reports and
helps to track bounce rates ident
identify the best content of your
website record user Behavior flow on
your site and many other
metrics thereby allowing you to
understand and build your business
strategies thereby growing your business
now that you have understood why Google
analytics is essential let's check what
we have for you in this
video first we will understand what is
Google analytics for
then we will move forward with
identifying Google analytics version for
your website next we will have a
detailed look at Universal analytics and
Google analytics for we will continue by
understanding success stories from
Google analytics for users and finally
we will end this session by
understanding the future of Google
analytics F so allow me to introduce the
Next Generation of Google
analytics Google analytics 4 also known
as ga4 initially Google analytics 4 was
known as app plus web Google analytics 4
is the latest analytics property with
several advantages over the old Google
analytics also known as universal
analytics understanding more clearly
Google analytics 4 can measure and keep
track of website traffic as well as app
usage so now you can imagine that Google
analytics 4 is the onstop solution for
all your analytics needs if you are
still using Universal analytics we
recommend you to get familiar with
Google analytics 4 as
well as this is the new future of
analytics we will understand creating
and setting up Google analytics for
account in detail in the upcoming videos
let's first identify which Google
analytics property is associated with
your website in order to identify which
Google analytics property you have log
into your Google analytics account now
go to analytics
account and then open properties and
apps here you can see properties for
your
website now below the propert propes and
apps several properties are listed
where you can see different IDs if the
ID starts with UA and ends with a
number then you have a universal
analytics
property however if ID only has
numbers like
here then you have Google analytics for
property we will learn how to switch the
universal analytics account to Google
analytics 4 in the upcoming videos now
that you have understood how to identify
Google analytics property let's take a
detailed look at the comparison of
universal analytics data and Google
analytics for
data the major difference between
Universal analytics and Google analytics
4 is the measurement model Universal
Analytics uses sessions and Page views
as the measurement model whereas Google
analytics 4 uses events and parameters
as the measurement model therefore any
hit type from Universal analytics
property say a page view user timing Etc
are captured as event in Google
analytics for property let's see the
detailed comparison of every aspect of
universal Analytics and Google analytics
for first we go with
events in analytics every measurable
action for example page load form
completion Scrolls app installs Etc is
measured as event an event has category
label and action in Universal
analytics moreover it has its own hit
type
in case of Google analytics 4 there is
no categorization all the hit types from
Universal analytics are considered as
events now let's find the comparison of
universal analytics and Google analytics
4 in terms of page views page views is a
metric defined that calculates total
number of pages viewed on your website
now let's get a better understanding of
page views for instance when user lands
on a web page of your site the page
loads this is considered to be a page
view now suppose if user reloads the
page Google analytics tracks it as
another page view if the user navigates
to another page of your website and
returns to the same page this adds
another page view to your site now that
you have understood page views let's see
how page views differs in Universal
analytics and Google analytics for from
Universal analytics page view are
translated to Google analytics for
property as page view
event this page view event automatically
gets triggered in Google tag
manager the next metric we have is
sessions session is the time duration
for which user is active on your website
a universal analytics session May
consist of multiple page views events
e-commerce transactions Etc the session
is considered to be ended if the user
has 30 minutes of inactivity or any
other event for which session end is
triggered in Google analytics 4 session
metrics are track from session start
event which automatically gets triggered
with the basic interaction on your
website however the session duration
depends on the period between the first
and the last event now let's check our
next metric which is custom
dimension in Universal analytics custom
Dimension add the information to the
collected data whereas in Google
Analytics 4 information is added through
the event
parameters moving ahead the next metric
we have is content grouping content
grouping in Universal analytics allows
to group content into a logical
structure after which one can view and
compare metrics by the group name now
talking about Google analytics 4 it has
predefined event parameter for Content
group this parameter fills the data into
content group moving ahead the next
metric we have is client ID client ID is
a unique string generated randomly and
acts as a sorous identifier client ID
identifies the browser instance and then
it gets stored in the browser
cookies and therefore subsequent visits
to the same site are associated with
that user in both Universal analytics
and Google analytics for client ID
serves the same purpose that is the
client ID is responsible for providing
the
identifier now let's move ahead with our
next
metric
parameters parameters are associated
with Google analytics for
properties understanding in detail about
parameters parameters are the chunk of
information that specifies the user
action for example parameters can be
passed to describe the value of the
purchase next we have is user property
user properties provide information like
preferred language or geographical
location of the users that interact with
your website or app now that we have
seen difference between Universal
analytics and Google analytics for
property ities the question definitely
arises can Google analytics really bring
success to your
business well if you have a good
understanding of your audience and have
extraordinary strategies to work on the
Google analytics is your best
companion here are some success stories
by Google analytics for users we all
know about McDonald's the leading Fast
Food Corporation with huge number of
outlets across the globe recently a case
study has been shared by McDonald's Hong
Kong which suggests that the company has
experienced growth in conversions by
550% through the Napp orders and what
made them achieve such a great
growth yes you guessed it right it's
Google analytics 4 let's have a look on
their success story the major goal for
the company was to redesign the strategy
to increase inap food orders predict the
behavior of inapp audiences and reach
the right customers with McDonald's
mobile order campaigns to achieve the
goals McDonald used a simple yet smart
approach and implemented Google
analytics for properties with the help
of predictive audiences in Google
analytics for prop properties they tried
converting audiences into
customers moreover with the help of
Google ads they were able to manage the
campaigns as a result of the smart
efforts McDonald was able to gain
increase in conversions by
550% for the users who are likely to
purchase in next 7 days isn't it amazing
moreover for the same audience
McDonald's had noticed a visible
decrease in cost per action by
63% and an increase in Revenue by 560
per. some other companies that have seen
growth in their business through Google
analytics for includes PepsiCo claros
shop Etc with the proven success of top
brands in the world let us know what the
future of Google analytic po holes as
for the reports on buil with.com there
are
281 lak
52,7 live websites that are using Google
analytics out of which there are 1 21
lakh
73,4 and13 live websites from USA and 4
lakh
68538 live websites from India who are
using Google analytics if you look in
detail we have a list of big names like
Bank of America blogger.com
Cisco
Netflix
corsera
Flipkart ICI Bank Tesla India
IRCTC mintra Etc that are using Google
analytics for their growth however we
are all well aware of the success
stories of all the biggies on the list
thus Google analytics will continue to
be an important part of new business
strategies things you should know before
we end this session are Google analytics
4 will be soon replacing Universal
analytics from 1st July
2023 the universal analytics platform
will be no longer in action however you
will be able ble to access the reports
for some period of
time Google analytics 4 will be the new
future of analytics the concept of
linking is foundational to good rankings
and understanding the internet at large
it starts with the premise that good
content will be cited by others
recommending it to other people how we
site and recommend information online is
by linking to it we link to information
that that we find
valuable based on that the search
engines assess content by how websites
link to one another so we are going to
cover the definition and purpose of
links and the different functions that
links serve we'll also look at how links
mirror human
judgment we'll look at how search
engines evaluate links by mirroring
human judgment and how that affects
what's called Block Level
analysis and how where the location of
different links and how they are used
will greatly affect their
relevance we're going to look at how
visitors from different link sources
will behave differently based on where
they came from and also how you can
measure the effectiveness of links and
finally we're going to look at both good
and bad linking practices now links
serve a number of
purposes from a functional standpoint
they usually are our primary means of
navigation online we click on links we
go to different pages and from those
pages we find links to other Pages links
are also a method of citing other
content when we quote somebody when we
use information that we have found
somewhere else we site that information
to give credit to the original author
typically online we do that with a link
so that if someone wants to see the
original Source document it's available
to them that also helps to provide
credibility to you credibility to the
author of the original source as well as
assigning importance to the knowledge
that came from that original source and
the authority of the original
Source links also provide us with a
clear structure of how our websites are
built how the pages relate to one
another and how organized the
information can
be so let's break down the functional
part of a link this is important if
you're going to be developing anchor
text and linking to understand the
structure the
ahre equals is the start of the link tag
what you are doing is developing the
reference of where the document is
contained that's the hre reference is
what it is short for
what comes next within the quotes is the
location of the document now this can be
a full URL or you may just be linking to
a document that's on the main root level
of your
server this is the full location where
you can access the document and so
you're putting the name of the document
the extension so that it will be
linked the next part is what I have in
caps you'll notice off to the left I
have something in all blue text and
underlined which most people will
recognize as a link you see when it is
in between the document location and the
closing of the link tag the text you
have in there is what's called anchor
text you see instead of publishing the
document location and the full URL of
the document we can put the link within
text and create anchor text so all
someone has to do is click on the link
and the document loads for them this
anchor text is vitally important to
understanding how we can add additional
relevance to linking
content then we see the closure of the
link
tag this is what makes the internet the
internet is millions of pages connected
together by
Links so when we look at the functional
side of links and we look at this
example here as you can see the title of
this article is not the URL address of
the article it's a title and the title
is the link that is the anchor text of
the link and so from a search engine
standpoint search engines look to see
what words are being used in the link
and how relevant those words are to the
document that is being linked
it also looks to see where is the link
is it in the editorial information in
the article is it part of the navigation
is it in a sidebar or is it an
ad and then also search engin are
looking to see if this is a text link or
an image
link how long has that link been there
what type of link is it does it go
somewhere within your website does it go
to another website or is it a reciprocal
link which I will explain more later
they also look to see the text in the
link and the context of the page with
the link directs you
to we utilize links a little differently
you see from a human standpoint whenever
we refer information to another person
when we provide reference material to
another person or even if someone asks
us for a recommendation we provide this
information you see offline we mirror
the same behavior as we do online when
we link people ask us for information
and we provide it we just mirror that
online by making a link offline we
recommend we refer we provide
information to each other in much the
same way the way I want you to think
about it from a human standpoint is that
if you asked another person for advice
or directions or a referral are there
certain people that you would trust more
than
others I'm sure the answer to that is
yes and maybe you have some people in
mind that you are thinking about you see
we run across the same issue with search
the search engines know that there are
some websites that are much more
trustworthy than
others just like if you were to ask
someone for information I'm sure you
would ask the right person for the
information you would ask the most
knowledgeable trustworthy person you
knew who had Authority in that subject
area the search engines are trying to do
the same thing with the links that we
publish on our websites they're trying
to determine who is the most trustworthy
and relevant based on the
recommendations referrals and citations
of other websites to other websites
who are the websites that are trusted
that are authorities the search engines
are trying to do from a technical
algorithmic standpoint what we do
naturally from a human
standpoint now from The Human Side as I
had said before we need to think of
links as information that we receive
from other people Word of Mouth advice
information directions
recommendations this is where we need to
think about links not from the
standpoint of building false relevance
for a search engine but being a helpful
resource for our readers how can we help
them how can we provide information and
how can we be a credible source of
information how can we develop our
Authority within the industry and so
that people who have questions about
this content will see our websites as
authoritative
incredible
resources the best way to develop links
as you'll see is good content when
people like what they read when they
like what they see when they are willing
to recommend it to others it it's
because you have created something of
value and they'll link to you when they
feel that you are credible and that you
are authoritative with this information
only then will they share it with other
people because you have earned that
right for them to share it with others
by providing content that is informative
educational entertaining and you've
provided that service only then will
people then want to recommend it to
others by linking to
it now links serve a number of benefits
When I look at some of the incoming
links to my site one of the things I
notice is that if I get a link in
certain places that can drive a lot of
brand exposure I can have thousands of
people coming to the site looking to see
an article and that provides a lot of
exposure to a lot of
people however also getting a link from
a certain website especially if it's a
high relevant authoritative website I
can see my rankings increase because of
that but then also a good link is going
to drive people that will convert and
drive sales or leads those who become
customers so those are the three aspects
of a good link a good link will drive
traffic to your site a good link will
assist your rankings and a good link
will bring in business if you can get a
link to do all three of those at the
same time that's what I call the golden
link because it has all three benefits
usually however you're going to find
that different links will provide
different types of benefits one of these
three or maybe two out of these
three one of the things I'm usually very
focused on is the link that drives sales
or generates leads that's getting links
in the right place that will benefit me
tangibly rather than just getting
thousands of people to see
it why it benefits me financially if I
can get a link in the right place
so from here let's break down the
different types of links we have
navigational links we see these in our
navigation our primary navigation maybe
the footer of our web pages where we
have links to typical information such
as about us or contact us we also have
sidebar links this might be related
information or offers or calls to
action and then also I would break it
down into outbound or inbound type of
navigation outbound are links going to
other websites inbound links are links
that come from other websites and that
also I might send to other pages on my
own
site now I've used the term editorial an
editorial link is a link that is found
within the content of the website and by
that I mean through an article so if I
am writing an article and I L link to
someone else and site them or reference
them that is what's called an editorial
link it means that it's part of the
content a great example of this is that
the navigation on your web pages is not
part of the content it serves a function
as
navigation but it doesn't have anything
to do with supporting information with
citing an authority so information and
links that you put Within the content
and presented content of your site are
considered
editorial now there's also call to
action links where you're bringing
someone to a landing page or a
registration page or a sale
page then also we have Social Links now
these can provide a a variety of means
but typically a social link will go to a
profile maybe it's a username that takes
you somewhere else or a comment or maybe
just an image or something that goes to
a social site or that you have placed on
your own site as
well either way it's all contained
within that social network even though
the links are going on and off your site
they tend to be controlled in that
social
environment now I've used the term
reciprocal link now this
is something very specific a reciprocal
link is one where you would go to
somebody else and you would make a trade
such as if you link to me I'll link to
you and maybe you put those links on the
homepage or maybe you create a page just
for that link you see sometimes it just
doesn't make sense and so the search
engines will see that you've linked to
each other but if there's no contextual
relevance if there's no contextual
relevance most likely you won't get any
benefit because you've agreed to link to
each other for the primary purpose of
boosting rankings now this is not to say
that two websites can't link to each
other because there is some relevance
we'll look at some examples of that
later on in this
module also then we have advertising
links these can be ads banners anything
on the page that is an advertising link
that if you were to click on it you
would go to that advertiser's page those
links are typically through an ad server
and they take place in entirely
different
ecosystem but they are links and we need
to know what kind of links are
advertising and which kind of links are
functional to our
websites now when I broke down the
different types of links so we have our
navigation links we have links in our
sidebar and in our footer what Block
Level analysis does is that the search
engines look at the code of the page
they break down the page because it's
very easy to figure out which part of
the code has to do with your navigation
which part of the code has to do with
your sidebar and your footer and which
part of the code is calling ads from an
ad server what this leaves is the
editorial content your article and the
ability of search engines then to break
down your page into these different
elements the reason why they do it is
that the links contained in the
editorial space are considered to be
more relevant in terms of linking to
other websites than any of the other
types of links on your web page search
engines don't consider all parts of the
page to be equally relevant which is
okay because neither do humans we look
at the navigation as utilization pure
utility because it's just helping me
navigate among the different pages of
your website I'm not expecting to learn
anything I'm using it as a functional
means of navigating your site now your
sidebar might have some calls to action
it might have links to other pages but
it's not an article it's what you've
developed and so it might be a little
more important than your navigation but
it's not as important as what you may
have written within content your footer
navigation is basically the same you
control that it's the same on every page
and so what the search engines are
looking for are the unique content the
unique article or information that
you've published and if there is a link
within that editorial content that is
highly relevant because it has to do
with content it has to do with
information that you are sharing and so
the links there are going to be more
highly relevant and are going to be more
important for the search engines to see
you see it's the same way with humans
we're not going to look at navigation to
learn something it's functional the same
thing with the footer and as humans
we're reading the content that you have
in your article and if you link link to
another source well you've provided us
with utility but it's contextual utility
because you're citing where you found
information or you're citing an
additional Source or you are linking to
an example and it enables me as a human
to see that understand it and if I need
that additional information I can click
on it and go to it so I'm going to look
at the information on the page in that
article very differently than I'm going
to look at the headings the navigation
the sidebars or the footer because the
article is what is informing me and so
the links in the article I'm going to
look at very differently and hold them
in a higher level of
relevance now over time search engines
have had to refine the algorithm about
links you see in the early days of
search engine algorithms they used to
Simply count the amount of links then if
one site had more links than another
that made it more credible however once
people started to figure that out people
started accumulating links by really any
means necessary and they were just
looking for the sheer volume of links
because they knew if they got the most
amount of links it would affect their
rankings and so over the years the
search engines have had to change and
adjust and add more relevance to their
algorithm Define it in order to look at
different aspects of links in order to
properly determine relevance so over
time it wasn't just having a link it was
then also looking at how many people
site this site as an authority so
looking at the source of the link and
the types of pages then also looking at
the text of the link and matching it
with the text of the page does it match
is it contextual and then looking at the
type of Link doing the Block Level
analysis and then also the context the
relevancy of your site compared to the
linking site compared to the link and
the information that's being shared
there also some of the ways that they
can look at it are the age of the link
how long has that link been there humans
do the same thing when we look to see
how long someone has been in business
we're looking at
credibility and then of course there are
many many other ongoing refinements that
are going into the search engines
evaluations of links sometimes the age
of the link isn't as relevant especially
when you're looking for something that
has happened very recently an Old Link
could mean that it's old news or that
something has changed since then so
search engines are in a constant battle
to ensure that people are not gaming the
system by falsely creating relevance
through
linking the link relevance
and the algorithm is all about trying to
determine who is the most relevant and
credible within this area and that is
the focus of most search engine
algorithm refinements over the past few
years and it will be into the
future now this is where I'm going to
start bringing in some screenshots from
a link Management
program as a search engine Optimizer a
link Management program is probably
going to be one of your best friends as
you move move along in this
industry in this example this program
linkex that I'm using will track the
incoming links to my website and it'll
also provide a breakdown as to what type
of website those links are coming from
so I can see how many links I have from
blogs how many links I have from news
sites how many links from wik how many
links from directories forums social
media public relations sites
articles or additional
resources then I can also add my
competitors and I can compare where I
stand in terms of the amount of links
from each source and where my
competitors stand in this way I can be
sure that we all have a similar link
profile you see if my linking profile
looks vastly different than all my
competitors the search engines are going
to see that as well and know that
something might be different with me
Google good or bad and that's going to
raise a red flag so I want to look at
the linking profile because every
industry and almost every business's
linking profile is going to be a little
different but especially among
Industries we see that linking profiles
that is the amount of links from
different sources it's going to be
slightly different for every different
type of industry or business so this
helps me understand where my links are
coming from which is vitally important
because from a business standpoint one
thing that I've tracked consistently in
analytics is that people will act
differently and also I can predict which
source is going to send me the best
customers you see just because someone
comes from a link doesn't mean they're
going to buy or become a customer or
really become a lead many times they're
going to come look at your information
and leave and based on they come to your
site whether it's through a Blog a
directory a forum or a news site has a
lot to do with how they view your
website and it's all about the
context you see this is what I've
learned over the years is that people
will behave differently based on how
they find the
website what I found is that people from
blogs news sites and articles they tend
to stay longer do more and have a higher
chance of conversion of becoming a
customer or a lead the main reason is
because blogs and articles they have a
lot of context it's an article someone
has taken the time to write some
information out and then link to my site
which means there is a highly contextual
reason for someone to click that
link also what it means is that there's
a lot less competition for that link
when my link is in that article
compare that with social news or any
type of social site you see when you're
on a social site and you're looking at
your social stream of information
there's a lot of different people
competing for your attention a lot of
different things and it's not just in
one subject area it's usually from
multiple subject areas and so the
context is very low because there's a
lot of different types of information
and the competition for your attention
is very high
because of that people from social sites
or applications tend to visit more often
but they only tend to view one page and
leave immediately because they're
looking to see what was interesting and
then they move on to the next
subject that's the difference between
how people react based on where they
come from and so when I'm measuring
links I'm looking to see which links do
I have what's the the source and then
how do those sources behave differently
from one another and why you see if I
find that I'm getting links from sources
that people are staying longer doing
more and converting at a higher rate
then I'm going to continue to focus on
building links in those areas because it
directly affects how I monetize my
website so here's a strategy in building
links
one of the things I'm looking at is the
source of links like I said if I can
find a link Source that's providing
visitors that will stay look at my
content engage with the content and
eventually convert and convert at a
higher rate than other sources of
content or
visitors then I'm going to focus on that
source and so I'm going to look at some
high Authority websites whether they're
industry Publications news sites
education sites ites those are what are
considered high
Authority blogs articles news
sites that's what I'm looking to do I
want to find the most authoritative
website and sometimes it happens
naturally if people that work at those
websites or manage those sites if they
find you and they like your content
they'll link to it and that way you can
get more credibility more
relevancy certain people certain C
organizations certain websites have more
Authority and influence than others it
goes back to the question that I asked
you early in this module that how do you
know if someone is more authoritative
than somebody
else we also have mid Authority websites
which you can get some links on and low
Authority websites which are very easy
to get links but here's what I've
learned when it comes to link
building one link from one high quality
website can be worth hundreds or
thousands of mid to lowquality Links
ultimately it's about quality not
quantity one of the things that I will
do utilizing my link software is look at
the context of the link I want to see
how relevant this is so as I said if I
want to find a high relevant website
what I'm looking for in terms of this is
I want to see the influence of the
domain as well as the relevance of the
domain those are two factors that we're
going to look at when we're evaluating
the quality of a domain now as I'm
looking at this report here what
influence means is that it is a high
quality website that within the linking
algorithm these sites have a lot of
authority however they may not be
relevant so for example they may have a
lot of sites attributing authority to
them but they may not be relevant to my
industry which is why we have the next
column of keyword relevance you see when
I'm evaluating my links I'm looking for
the sources that are both influential
and
relevant that means that I've got a link
from a site that fits the two standards
of high Authority it's authoritative and
relevant now it's good to have links
from authoritative sites that might not
be relevant it's still
authoritative however to get the full
benefit I want it to be influential and
relevant but not to say that I'm not
looking for links from these other
sources this is just a means of
measuring what you have as well as
comparing it to your competitors and
other websites
now here's some best practices when I'm
optimizing anchor text I want to
maintain contextual relevance so I want
to use text in the text link and I want
to explain to people what's they're
linking to what they're going to find
when they click on that link if I use an
image as a link I'm going to use an ALT
attribute because if that image doesn't
show up that Al tribute is necessary to
let people know where to go but also I
do get a little tiny bit of benefit by
using that alt attribute within the
image
link I also want to look at the
relevance of the source page that I'm
linking to and make sure contextually
the link the link text and the content
of the page is contextually relevant to
the destination page I also want to be
sure that I don't overuse the keywords
that I don't make multiple links
to the same destination that I don't use
the same anchor text over and over I can
be downgraded or even penalized by the
search engine algorithm if that is found
on my
pages so as an example instead of using
click here for a howto article I might
use the exact phrase of how to fix
whatever it is and use that as the link
to the page that has the content
that's a simple way of looking at anchor
text am I directing someone to
additional information if I am then how
can I present it to them so they know
exactly what they're going to find and
Link it
appropriately I look at as developing
the next step for your readers where do
you want them to go what do you want
them to do what resources do you have
available to them how can you structure
them so that they're easily understood
and you're explaining the Final
Destination like I said if you overuse
anchor text you can be downgraded or
penalized by the search engines so what
I will tell you to do is number one
avoid over stuffing anchor content that
means needlessly repeating keywords in
the anchor text don't do that avoid
being redundant meaning don't have four
or five or six links with the same
anchor text going to the same page
that's a clear way of letting search
engines know that you're going
overboard don't just randomly Place
links throughout your text just to get
the link ask yourself are you really
helping the reader find the information
they need and do it
once and then also avoid extremely
overly prom tional words within the link
text such as best expert cheap number
one those types of things so a couple
examples we can say for travel advice
click here but I would say here is my
travel advice and Link travel advice
rewrite it be
creative if it were easy everyone would
be doing it but this is where you can
write things in a better way to get the
attention of the reader and position it
as a
resource also utilizing your url as the
link or as the anchor text as well for
the link in order to get that click as
I've got it here I would not recommend
that you use that I would recommend that
you avoid
that also the third line to check out
the best website for iPhones and iPhone
accessories utilizing overly promot
tional words is one of those ways that
you can easily get caught by the search
engines now for future considerations
when it comes to Links realize that the
majority of algorithm changes are link
based evaluation refinements because
people are constantly attempting to fool
the search engines and develop a false
link
profile you should work to create high
quality links with high quality content
I wouldn't chase after Poor or
lowquality
links now as I've mentioned before there
are a number of tools available for you
to manage and measure your backlinks
tools such as linkex MZ Raven Advanced
Link manager Majestic SEO and then also
you can use your Google analytics as
well however Google analytics only shows
you the VIS visitors that have come from
links and what they've done the basic
functions of Link management software
and there are many other types other
than what are listed here but the first
thing that it does is just provide a
catalog of incoming links from other
domains to your site and your competitor
sites they offer tools for comparison to
see which domains are linking to you
what type of link it is and on which
Pages those links are listed they'll
also report newly acquired links in the
past 30 60 90 days or something similar
to that the purpose of Link management
software is to help you assess
highquality domains versus lowquality
domains in terms of importance and
relevance like I said the first job of a
link management tool is to collect all
of your back links you add your domain
and the tools will usually spider the
domain they'll go out into search
engines and go out into many other
formats in order to find and retrace who
is linking to you what page that link is
contained sometimes what text is on that
page and what text is being used in the
link they will catalog all of your
incoming links organize them format them
and report back to you most of these
link programs provide additional filters
and management tools so that you can get
more insights about who is linking to
you how they are linking to you and the
type of
site personally I use Link decks in
order to Monitor and report on my
backlinking so the first report here
that I'm showing out of linkex is that I
see the total amount of incoming links
to my domain this says I have over 2,000
links and those 2,000 links are on about
1,000 domains on average it looks like I
have about two links from every domain
that is linking to me so this is one way
that you start to look at your links
number one the total amount of domains
that are linking to you and then the
total amount of links available this way
you can isolate domains that are linking
to you consistently and also find those
that may not be the best domains or that
are sending a lot of links that are just
not
relevant the next thing I do in
analyzing My Links is to look at the
type of Link meaning the type of site
that it's coming from this report breaks
down the amount of links coming from
blogs news sites directories forums
social sites articles or resources now
it doesn't usually get all of those
links but it does get enough to give you
an idea of how well you're doing in each
channel one of the things that I do like
about this report is it also has a
timeline so I can look at and see when
new links have been acquired and maybe
when some links have been just
disappeared that's called churn and it's
normal it's normal because many times a
link is published on social media and it
kind of just goes away or it's not
tracked anymore by your link management
software it can't find it anymore and so
linking is always Dynamic you are always
gaining new links and losing old links
there's going to be a normal amount of
churn the next report shows me all of
the domains that are linking to me it
also shows me in the next column how
many of those domains are also linking
to at least one competitor and it will
list as many competitors of I have
listed in here if they list to multiple
competitors it will let me know the
influence of that site or the authority
that site is seen because of the amount
of webs ites and credibility that
Authority has for that domain it'll also
let me know the keyword relevance how
relevant that website is overall
contextually to my domain and the
content that I have it will also let me
know how many pages on that domain have
links to my website so I can also go
through and I can filter this list by
the type of site I can filter by those
domains that are using anchor text to
see how much anchor text is being used
and what type of anchor text there are
many different ways that you can filter
through all of the domains that are
linking to you in order to get an idea
of what's happening on your domain what
are competitors doing and also the
relevance of those links to your
site now when I say that I can add
competitors this is another type of
report very similar to the one I showed
earlier where I look at my own standing
in the different types of sources of
links such as blogs directories forums
and so on I can also when I add my
competitors look to see how they are
performing in those different areas as
well and so I can compare my link
profile to my
competitors different Industries are
going to have different backlink
profiles they might be more heavily
weighted towards blogs or they might be
more heavily weighted towards forums or
social sites in this way I can look to
see if my competitors are actively link
building and how they're going about it
I can see where maybe they are excelling
in one area that the rest of the
competitors are not so I can compare
different strategies I can also compare
different timelines to see if I am
acquiring Links at a faster rate than my
competitors this is very important if
you are a newer business or a newer
website trying to
compete now specifically what I can do
is look at an individual domain in this
case this domain has three pages linking
to me and that domain also links to two
of my competitors I can look at the
specific pages and what I'm looking at
here are Snippets this should be
familiar to you because what it's
showing is the URL of the page that's
linking to my page it shows me the page
title of that page and then in this
report it lets me know if there are any
key words being used in the link in the
anchor text as well as the number of
links from that page now what this tells
me is that this is most likely a
directory something that is listing all
the different places that where you can
buy products because it's most likely
linking to the domain name seeing that
there are no keywords being used in
Anchor text and also that there are 16
outb links from that page that means
that it must be a list of some sort and
they are linking not only to me but most
likely to competitors as well so I can
track my Links at the Domain level and
at the page level I can look to see
which Pages might have more influence or
relevance to my content I can also see
the link URL the page title if any
keywords are being used in the anchor
text and also within the context of how
many additional links are are leaving
from that page if there are a high
amount of outgoing links on that page
then a link from that page might not be
as valuable since there are so many
links the less links there are coming
out from that page the more it will
benefit my site because I'm getting more
benefit from less
links now also what I'm going to do is
compare the link reports to my analytics
I'm going to go to my analytics because
linking software does not show traffic
it doesn't show how many people are
clicking on the link it only shows who's
linking to you but it does not show
visitor activity analytics will show you
visitor activity to see which domains
are most effective in sending visitors
to your site if you go back to the
primary benefits of linking visitors
branding and business analytics show me
visitors and business it shows me which
domains are sending me visitors and
which of those visitors are becoming
customers so what I can do is go to
Google analytics look at all the domains
that are referring traffic to my site I
can also click on the domain and see the
destination page that they are linking
to I can see how many visitors are
coming either monthly or annually how
often they're coming back whether
they're new users or repeat users how
long they stay how many pages they View
and how many conversions as a result of
those visits this is a great way to get
a 360° view of your linking because not
only do you want links that will help
you rank better you also want links that
will send business and customers to you
as
well building links can take many forms
ideally it is through networks
relationships and marketing that other
websites and users learn about you like
you and recommend you to others
unfortunately there is a lot of bad
outdated and untrustworthy advice to be
found about building links to your
website in this section I'll present the
best practices as accepted by the omcp
standard the objectives for this module
that you'll be able to develop a link
building strategy that you'll understand
the the value of different link types
finally you'll be able to find inbound
link
opportunities the first step in building
links is to evaluate what you have now
there are many tools available that you
can utilize to do this for you there are
automated tools that you can get that
will catalog all of the incoming links
to your website some of them are link
decks m Raven or Advanced Link manager
there are many that can do that you may
also want to utilize your analytics as
well in order to find websites that link
to you the first step is evaluating
where you are right now your incoming
links have a significant impact on your
rankings and you can do a lot of onpage
optimization and see some
results however a lot of Google's
algorithm takes into account links from
other highquality
websites now when you evaluate what you
have in this example I'm showing you a
screenshot from
linkex linkex cataloges the incoming
links to my website and it groups them
into different areas the first way it
groups them is by high value or high
influence domains
those are websites that link to me that
have a lot of influence not necessarily
in my industry but High influence based
on the amount of people that link to
them as an authority on many different
subjects the next way that it groups
that is based on relevance now this is
when it looks at the match of my content
versus the content of the other websit
it in the first example we can see the
National Library of Medicine it is a
high influence website because it is a
government website with a lot of
information that is cited frequently
because of the amount of other websites
linking to that site it has a high
amount of
influence now based on the website that
I am
measuring there is a lot of keyword
relevance meaning that that National
Library of Medicine site with the
government has a lot of content that's
very similar to my site a lot of the
same keywords are being used so not only
is this website of high influence it
also has a lot of relevance and that's
key when evaluating my
backlinks I want to look at which
websites are also referring traffic so
while I may have a link from the
National Library of Medicine I want to
look at my analytics and look to see is
it also providing visitors are visitors
following that link to my site and I
also want to look at the quality of
traffic that it produces do these
visitors stay longer than average do
they convert more than average I want to
look at the quality of traffic based on
the
source next I want to look at the
incoming links from those other websites
number one I want to make sure that the
incoming link from the other site is
both accurate and relevant meaning the
text that is used in the link is it
accurate to the content that will appear
on the page when the visitor clicks that
link is the content relevant this is
especially relevant if I have updated my
website changed the content or moved
things around I want to be sure that
that incoming link sends visitors to the
appropriate page and the appropriate
information I also want to ensure that
that link is worded correctly that it
uses the right words that is sending
visitors and setting expectations of the
content that they will
see I may need to contact the website
manager or owner and maybe ask for a
better link text or a more accurate page
destination now this requires some
interaction
with the owner or manager of another
website and you always want to be
respectful of their time and not
demanding that they make any changes in
some cases the organization may be so
big you may never find the right person
in order to optimize the text or the
destination of that link you always want
to look for accuracy in cases where your
company or website name is utilized in
the link but also if there is any
contact information such as address
phone number a description of your
business and any content make sure it's
accurate and it all points to the right
place another way to look for links is
to Simply go to a search engine and
start doing searches search for your
company your business your company name
and look for websites that may mention
you but do not have a live link to your
website many times your company will be
mentioned or cited but there will not be
a live link you can only find these
through doing searches and seeing which
websites mention you without linking to
you now this could be an opportunity to
get an Easy Link especially if you can
find some contact information and
finding the right person that could add
a link to your company information
again you'll need to be polite ask for
their help and it will help it if you
can develop the link along with the link
text and send that over giving them just
a quick and easy edit to be able to add
the information so make it as easy as
possible as an example I've provided a
sample request
format again you want to be polite you
want to be inviting and respectful of
their time and their
management sometimes like I said you may
find the right person that can help you
however the larger the company the more
difficult it will be to make this happen
this just requires your
patience and again being polite and not
expecting the company to do what you are
asking many times this is just a
formality and sometimes companies will
act on it so be sure to approach this
with the right
expectations the next thing I want to
look at are business listings these are
the easy ways to establish links and
ensure that links are where they should
be and also
opportunities look for business
directories especially if your company
has a local presence you can utilize
Chamber of Commerce lists associ lists
or local listings if they are on
websites see if they offer links that
can go to your website rather than just
the list of businesses that are in the
area even on a larger level you can look
for associations directories or listings
where you can add your business or
double check if your business is there
and always ensure that your business
name address phone number and URL r l
are correct complete and consistent with
other
listings the next level will require
some active marketing and that's where
you search for
opportunities you can go out and look
for other resource lists within your
industry or directories of businesses
within your industry and you can get a
link many times through membership or
submitting your business as a
resource however you may want to step up
your marketing you can do that by
interviewing your clients seeing if they
might be willing to provide a
testimonial and a link to your website
you may also want to go out and find
other communities online maybe some
social communities that are relevant to
your
industry get involved with those
communities fill out a profile and get
involved by contributing information by
sharing information you'll find that
people like getting information and
they'll respond by linking to your
site another option is to utilize the
tool that you had for indexing your
links from the first step you can also
add your competitors and you can look at
their back links you can look and see
which websites and which domains are
linking to your competitors but you
always need to go and see why what are
those other sites linking to and what is
the nature of that
link sometimes it may exclude you from
being able to approach competitors back
links and ask them for
links however if they're being linked to
by companies that are simply stating
here are vendors in this space and they
are linking your competitors and you're
not there then it might make a lot of
sense for you to approach and ask if you
can be listed as well however be sure
that the links to your competitors are
not from a consumer or customer
relationship in that case it might be
out of line for you to ask for a link
make sure if you approach anyone who's
linking to a competitor and asking for a
link to your site make sure the context
is right and that it makes sense for
them and that's the ultimate judge of
value does it benefit somebody else to
link to your site
we all know that it will benefit you but
when you present your link request you
need to offer value and a benefit for
others to link to you so be sure that
you present it in a way that is
beneficial and good for those people
that will be adding the link they're the
ones that have to take the work to do it
and they're also the ones that are
adding a recommendation for you and your
business
so as always you need to be considerate
and
patient now the best way to build links
is by creating something that people
like and sharing it you see the best way
to build links is by creating value
through content or information or
entertainment you see when people like
things they link to it if they find a
study or a way paper or research that
you performed they link to it if you
post a infographic that explains
something and it's attractive people
link to it you see that's what's most
amazing about linking I find that when
we put most of our effort into creating
content that people like that's what
builds the most valuable and the most
relevant links and so what type of
content well you can create infographics
videos top 10 lists or articles articles
with advice or analysis of Market data
or even
research that type of content people
love it and so when you publish it out
you utilize social media to extend the
reach and the visibility of that type of
content and recommend it to others now
people also like depending upon your
industry or your business business they
also like some personality maybe some
humor people always like expert
information they like the cute this is
why pictures of cats tend to be liked
and linked to more than almost anything
else and also the
unexpected if you can inject any of that
into your content that just makes it
more valuable more personable and again
more sharable by other people and every
time someone shares it it builds a link
to your
site you see the best linking is when
people like something when you create
something that people like and share you
might be surprised at the many
opportunities there are to get links
based on your content I've seen many
many blogs based on cooking fashion Arts
Sports music and when people specialize
within a specific topic they always find
an audience and so anything they publish
builds links even on certain social
media sites such as Pinterest people
upload pictures on articles and
infographics especially about
landscaping flowers food cars you name
it there is a special interest for
anything and you can develop links from
those social sites to your site and it
can generate
traffic even with a Blog developing
articles that talk about upcoming events
new music Sports whatever it is when you
create content that people
like it takes the longest amount of time
to build content for building links when
you develop your own content that's the
biggest investment you'll make in time
and research and writing and
presentation however the result is that
when you develop that content you will
receive the best and highest quality
links and the most valuable links are
going to be to that content as I
mentioned before one high quality link
can be worth more than hundreds or
thousands of lowquality links so my best
advice is to create content that people
like that they link to and that will be
high value link
that you'll generate to your site Google
tag manager thanks for joining and let's
get started with this simply learn
webinar so let's start out with Y GTM so
let's just say you're Sam and you have
your own Ecommerce website and you want
to understand how people are interacting
with your website well Sam today's world
of webites contain a lot of
interactivity everything from videos to
PDF downloads to commenting to form
submissions uh to all sorts of chat
functionality interactivity going on
throughout the website so there's just a
lot that you need to track outside of
just page views and so really what GTM
does is they help you track all these
things I just mentioned everything from
somebody clicking on the play button of
a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit
button of a form to somebody entering in
something on a chat function so that's
what GTM is so why GTM because it helps
us track all that interactivity so all
GTM is is really allows you to really
place a piece of java code which is just
script and this script that's added to a
web page to collect information so
that's really what a tag is it's just
some script that gets put on a web page
in order for you to collect information
like page views clicks Etc and and they
send it to thirdparty tools okay so
that's what GTM does it it basically
allows you to take all these tags that
collect information and you can use them
in GTM so if you want to for example
collect how many people you know enter a
chat functionality and start chatting
well you're going to take that script
and you're going to put it in GTM and
GTM will then allow you to start
tracking that information so that's
really what GTM is it just allows you to
put tags into a container or think of it
as a toy box you have all these toys and
you want to track well you can put all
those those toys or tags in a toy box or
container and we're going to talk a
little bit more about that but before we
get into GTM let's just say you know
you're communicating with your developer
and there's a new user request on your
web page and you want to update the tag
well your develop
considering it's probably a small update
to your website it's probably going to
not um hesitate and is going to go ahead
and turn around and do it normally and
so normally what happens is the
developer is going to go to the website
and update the tag well what if you have
a few things that you want to track all
those things I mentioned before from
downloads to clicks to you know somebody
checking out to watching a video well
your Web Master your web developer is
going to go well hold on a second now
all these requests are going to take
time I need to put them into the work CU
so to speak well what happens is when
they go into work queue usually it's
going to take some time and in some
cases you as a marketer need to launch a
campaign and you want to get that
tracking uh added to the website in time
for the campaign launch so you want to
go ahead and quickly turn around the
tracking for that particular campaign
let's just say you're launching a
campaign and you're sending people
people to a landing page that has a form
submission and you want to be able to
track how many people click on the
submit button of that form submission
well if you need to turn that around
your developer is like well I need to
put that in a work queue the timing
isn't going to always work out between
you and your developer is my point and
so that's where GTM comes in because
there is a solution update your tags
faster and that's Google tag manager so
when we say GTM that's what GTM stands
for Google tag manager it's a place for
you to add tags quickly and easily so
tags remember are just Snippets of code
that allow you to track things on your
website interactivity interactive
actively and basically when you have GTM
you can buypass the Web Master and do it
quickly and easily so that's what GTM is
all about so why GTM because we just
identified two benefits one you could
track all the interactivity on your
website and two you can bypass your web
developer or Web Master and so that's
the benefit of GTM so the benefit you
get those tags updated very quickly via
Google tag manager okay so that's what
tag manager is so what we're going to
talk about today is specifically what
tag manager is and what it does we're
going to list some of the benefits of
tag manager we're going to show you how
it works and then we're going to show
you how to get started with tag manager
tag manager if you're not familiar with
with working with web Masters and
dealing with JavaScript and tags and all
this jargon is just new to you today
okay well don't fret sit back we're
going to take it slow this is an
introduction into Google tag manager
again let's start out with what is tag
manager so we've already introduced it
to some degree because we already
introduced it as a tool where you can
put all your tags into a toolbox toy box
or container so to speak right and we
already already mentioned that hey you
can bypass your web master so you're
probably thinking well if I'm if you're
not familiar with tag manager how can I
bypass my Web Master well first of all
it's a free tool and it's a Google tool
hence the name Google tag manager and it
helps you really that's the main point
is deploy and track tags on your website
by passing your web master so that's tag
manager and so examples of tags that can
be deployed via Google tag manager are
numerous these are just some examples
like Google analytics Facebook pixel
tracking or Google ads There's No Limit
into the number of tags you can track in
tag manager there is no limit you can
add any number of tracking tags and tag
manager okay so some of the benefits
well again I we just listed two you can
put any tag into tag manager and track
that onto your website and we know you
can bypass your web developer or Web
Master and what it also does is it also
allows you to test and deploy your
JavaScript codes quicker so remember
these JavaScript codes or Snippets of
codes are just there to track certain
things on your website whether that be a
page view or somebody clicking on a play
button or tracking somebody who converts
or even just goes to your website so the
biggest benefit is you can take that
snippet of code let's just say Facebook
let's just say you're doing Facebook
marketing and you want to put that
Facebook pixel on your website so that
you could track people who come from
Facebook and convert well you don't need
to put that Facebook pixel on your
website you can go right to tag manager
and you can put that snippet of code
right in tag manager really quickly and
the other benefit here is all tags are
managed in one place and that's that to
me is really a good benefit because when
you start adding tags on your website
and you have some tags and tag manager
it just gets very confusing so ideally
all the tracking code you have on your
website needs to be in tag manager think
about that all the tracking so if you're
doing Bing or you're doing Facebook or
you're doing Twitter or you're doing
LinkedIn and you're doing Google you're
doing all this type of marketing on all
these different platforms you're going
to have tracking code for all these
different platforms and instead of
putting all that code on your website
return going to slow down the slow low
time of your web page and website you
want to put them all in tag manager so
they can be organized and you know
exactly what you're trying to track and
the the other great benefit of tag
manager is there's a versioning control
so let's just say you have added tags to
your website via GTM for the last 6
months well and let's just say you add
another tag yesterday if you added that
tag yesterday and something doesn't work
well you can just roll back to a
previous version It's that simple so you
have versioning and that's that's a good
thing when you have versioning you can
control what gets published and if
something doesn't work after it gets
published then you can roll back to a
previous version so it's a a piece of
mind so to speak just because you've
added code to your site there's no
guarantee it's going to work and so you
can always control what version you're
dealing with in tag manager and we'll
talk a little bit more about that so the
biggest benefit here to me with tag
manager is you have event tracking and
so we talked about some of the things
you could track on your website from
videos from play buttons to somebody
clicking on the stop on the video or
pausing it all the way to somebody again
chatting or let's just say somebody
clicking on that purchase button on your
website okay and you want to track all
these different things these different
interactivities and buttons well event
tracking is what you're going to use to
track all those buttons and to me this
is the biggest benefit of tag manager
and I'll show you some examples as we go
along and if we didn't mention it
already I'll mention it again it is free
tag manager is free there's no limit so
once you have tag manager going you can
add as many tracking codes as you want
there's no limit on the number of
tracking codes you can add to tag
manager okay so it's free and you can
use it to its fullest Advantage okay so
it's also high security meaning that it
has different levels of permissions okay
so you can have uh somebody just go in
and look at the different tags and
tracking codes you have in GTM or you
can have somebody who is very familiar
with tag manager and can go in and add
the tracking code to tag manager and
then po publish that tracking code when
it gets added so those are all the
benefits let's talk about how it works
now specifically how does tag Manager
work CU you're like Rob okay again a lot
of jargon you know you got tags and
JavaScript and and versioning and
Publishing and all this other stuff well
I know I'm throwing a lot at you at once
but just bear with me here okay so let's
start talking about how it actually
works so you have a website okay
whatever that domain is is you have a
website and there's chances are on your
website you have some form of
interactivity whether that be a video
whether it be a Blog whether it be a
form submission you have a website with
some interactivity and let's just say
you're even thinking about getting ready
to launch some type of campaign on maybe
Google or Facebook and you want to drive
traffic to your website fair enough
you're joining the millions of other
websites that are out there that have
interactivity that also Drive traffic to
the website so incomes Google tag
manager and so tag manager is important
because again we know we want to track
people coming from that Facebook
campaign or that Google campaign
interacting with our site so if you are
running Facebook and you are running
Google analytics well guess what you
want to put that tracking code in tag
manager so Google analytics being a
Google product works very nicely with
tag manager Facebook has its own
tracking code and but you still want to
be able to track people who come from
the Facebook campaign to your website so
you're going to get that tracking code
from Facebook and put it in tag manager
that's generally how it works so here
information from your website is shared
with another data source through tag
manager so think about that if I add
Facebook tracking code to tag manager or
let's just say I Google analytics
tracking code to tag manager tag manager
is the one that's pushing out and doing
all the heavy lifting they're the ones
that are controlling what code gets
fired and what code doesn't so if you're
putting the code in tag manager tag
manager is controlling the code think
about it that way and let's show you an
example of what that looks like so here
I am I'm in tag manager I just went to
tag manager. goole.com and here I could
see a list of tags so in our
conversation we're talking about
tracking Facebook and we're talking
about tracking Google analytics well
Google analytics is easy because it's a
Google product so here if I look at all
the different tracking code I have on my
webs it through tag manager let's just
take a look at Google analytics so if
you're going to use Tag manager you
might as well put the Google analytics
code in here so here I can see I have
Google analytics as a tag in tag manager
now for Facebook if I'm running a
Facebook campaign well I can take that
pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well
and here I can see Facebook pixel that
is that code is added to GTM I just
basically took what Facebook P me and
put it into Google tag manager so you
can see I can add Facebook and Google
analytics and again I can't stress it
enough any tracking code from any
platform I can add to Google tag manager
in order to track the behavior from
those sources so let's take a little bit
deeper dive into how tag manager works
so I just showed you an example of how
you could take Facebook and Google
analytics code and put it into tag
manager but if you're not familiar with
tag manager then how do I do that well
let's talk about the structure and how
tag manager works so when you have a tag
manager account you have a container
remember I mentioned Toy Box earlier you
have a bunch of toys if they're they're
code and you're tracking different bits
of code from different platforms like
Facebook think of those as toys and you
have a toy box okay well that's what
this code is and that's what a container
is the code is the code and that's going
to go into the toy box or container and
so so the way tag manager works is you
have tags triggers and variables so if I
take my Facebook tracking code and put
it into a container I need to set up a
tag and a trigger okay so let's take a
look at what that is so first if I go
back to tag manager I'm going to have an
account and if I have an account I'm
going to have a container so here I'm
just going to click on an account with a
container and a container is nothing
more than what website you're adding the
track in code to okay that's all the
container is we're just letting tag
manager know this is the website we're
adding all this code too so you have
tags triggers and variables that's the
structure of tag manager so tags are
just what it says tags what are we
trying to quote unquote tag well if it's
Google analytics that's easy here I can
see I've Google analytics added so if I
click on Google analytics here's my tag
and if I take a little bit of a deeper
dive there since Google analytics is a
Google product it integrates already
with tag managers it's pretty easy I can
just choose Google analytics then I'm
going to check page view and that's my
tag now every tag needs a trigger okay
so I need to tell tag manager how or
when to fire the Google analytics
tracking code so in this case I'm going
to tell tag manager to fire on all pages
so if I get somebody a visitor to my
website analytics is firing on all pages
so whatever page that visitor lands on
Google analytics is going to fire so
that's really what it comes down to is I
have a tag and I need to tell tag
manager when to trigger that tag that's
really what the structure of tag manager
is it's tags triggers and variables and
variables we're going to talk about here
in a couple minutes but you have a piece
of code you're going to go ahead and put
that into tag manager you're going to
tag it and then you're going to fire
that trigger so let's take a look at
another example here if I go back here
you can see Facebook well here's my
Facebook pixel okay that's my tag so
when is it going to fire well it's going
to fire on a specific domain or
subdomain that's basically what we're
doing we're trying to tell GTM when to
fire that particular tag so those are
the three main components a tag okay
which is going to contain the JavaScript
code that you get from say Facebook the
trigger so you're going to go into tag
manager and tell tag manager want to
fire that code that's the trigger and
then you have variables and so variables
are basically just additional
information that tag manager may need
for your tag and Trigger to work so
that's what a variable is it's there to
get the tag and Trigger to fire so
variables are divided into builtin and
userdefined variables so common used
variables include say page path or page
URL or host name or click class again
they're there and these examples I just
gave you are there to get your tag and
Trigger to work think about it that way
there just that's a component and if I
go into tag manager here and here on the
left side I can see variables so
remember I have built in and user
defined so built-in means that tag
manager already built these for me so in
case I need to get my trigger to work
with my tag I can use a variable so
those are built in and then I have user
defined so these are what I Define these
are what I created and again the
variables are there to get the tag and
Trigger to work okay so that's the job
of the variable the job of the tag is to
host that JavaScript code okay in the
case of f Facebook or analytics that's
where we're putting our code so here if
I click on AdWords remarketing again
it's a Google product so I don't really
need to even deal with code I'm just
going to select Google AdWords
remarketing okay so you could see GTM
integrates nicely with some of the other
Google products but let's just say you
have a Facebook pixel tracking code
you're going to choose custom and you're
going to put the code here so that's
part of the tag and then the trigger
again is there to get the tag to fire so
you're telling GTM when to fire the tag
and the variable is there to help you
make sure that that trigger and that tag
work together so that's how all three
kind of work together you need the tag
to put the code you need the trigger to
tell GTM when to fire the tag and code
and the variables there to help you
define when that tag and Trigger should
work or how it should work so again
review tags are they're just small codes
of JavaScript are backing pixels on your
website and so tags are allowed to
manage events like scroll track and
remarketing clicks downloads files play
buttons you name it even clicks on
external links for example let's just
say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh
icon on your site and when somebody
clicks on it they go to Facebook you
want to maybe track that you're going to
create a tag okay the trigger is there
because you need to tell GTM when to
fire that tag so it's a certain
condition whether it's you know fire the
tag if the URL equals facebook.com or
some other condition so the tag cannot
be created until the creation of the
corresponding trigger so tags and
triggers go together you can't just
create a tag and not have a trigger
otherwise your tag will never fire and
then the variable is there again it
stores the information when defining a
trigger or transferring data to tag so a
variable has a variety of data okay so
you pick and choose the variable you
want to use with that trigger okay so
you're making sure that by defining a
variable you're making sure that you're
telling GTM how that trigger should be
fired so let's take a look at another
example here of how all three play
together if I'm in this account I'm in
this container if I look down here I can
see Google optimize that's another
Google product so what I'm doing here is
I just chose Google optimize as my tag
it's already integrated so what does
that mean I don't even need to deal with
any code I'm just going to select
optimize well we have the tag Google
optimize but we need to tell GTM how to
fire that and so here we're going to
tell GTM to fire it on all pages so
that's basically a very simple example
because we're firing it on all pages so
if I want to look at something specific
again Facebook here's my tag here's my
code what's my Trigg well my trigger is
it's going to fire on specific Pages how
do I know that well if I look at the
trigger here I could see the trigger is
a page view but I'm telling it to fire
on this particular host name so the tag
and Trigger go hand in hand
so how to get started with tag manager
so first things first you have to create
that account so you're going to go to
tag manager. goole.com or you can do a
search for Google tag manager and you're
going to create your account and then
when you create your account what's
going to happen is you're going to set
up a container and when you set up a
container you have choices so you could
set it up for your website s it for an
app on iOS or maybe Android or you can
even set it up for a& ex an accelerated
mobile page so most people by default
are probably going to set up tag manager
for their website and so when you do
that when you actually select website
what's going to happen is you're going
to get some Google tag manager code in
return and so the whole idea here is
you're going to do a swap what you're
doing is basic basically you're saying
Okay Google I'm going to take this
Google tag manager code and I'm going to
put it on my website I'm going to put it
on every page of my website so notice
tag manager has two scripts one goes in
the head as high as possible the other
goes into the body tag as high as
possible and so what you're doing is
you're making a deal you're putting this
tag manager code on your website and in
return every code you deal with whether
that be Facebook or analy ICS or
optimize or remarketing or whatever it
is is going to go in GTM okay it's going
to go into the Container you created so
you need the tag manager code on your
website in order for tag manager to work
okay so when you add this code to your
website then you're free to start adding
all sorts of tags to your container but
if you don't have this tracking code on
your website then none of the tags you
add to your container are going to work
so that's the idea behind the container
and then one thing I wanted to mention
on the account is it's a Google account
so when you create your account then
make sure it's the same account you use
with say Google analytics or some other
Google product that's a good best
practice is always use the same email
address when you set up your account so
that it integrates nicely across all the
different platforms meaning you can go
from say Google analytics write to
Google tag manager and when browser
without having a log out or log in okay
so when you create the account you're
going to create your container if you
choose web then you're going to be asked
to place code on your website and when
you place that code on your website then
you are free to start using tag manager
and that means you're free to start
adding tags so if you want to know more
information about installing Google tag
manager then what I would recommend is
visit the quick start guide website of
GTM so again if you're curious as to
where that code is located in Google tag
manager well when you create an account
and you create a container that
container is going to have a specific ID
so if I click on that specific ID here's
where I can get my code okay so again
when I'm logged in to tag manager I'm
going to click on workspace but in the
top navigation I'm going to see my
unique GTM ID if I click on that that's
where my code is going to be located and
so again your code needs to go in the
head
and there's another script that needs to
go in the body and if you're not sure
how to add the code to your website well
you can always click on the quick start
guide here okay and that'll take you to
a quick start guide page a reference
page related to Google tag manager so
let's talk about creating a tag so once
you get tag manager installed I'm sure
you're excited to get going and create
that first tag so let's talk about how
to create a tag and tag manager so when
you're in tag manager all you need to do
is basically you're looking at all your
tags if you click on tag in the left
side navigation you'll see all your tags
and there's a new button there so you
just click new and so basically what
you're going to do is you're going to
create your first tag and so what I
would recommend once you get tag manager
installed on your website I would
recommend setting the first tag up as
Google Analytics so that will get you
going with tracking page views on your
website when some when somebody visits
your website okay so ideally that's what
you want to do you want to get Google
analytics as your first tag and tag
manager so what I'm going to do is
because analytics is a Google product
it's already integrated nicely with tag
manager so I'm just going to click on
Google analytics it's going to be a page
view that's what I'm tracking and now I
have to set up a variable and so what
it's going to do it's going to ask me to
set a select a variable and so what
you're going to do is you're going to
select new variable and what you're
going to do is you're actually going to
go and add your tracking ID here that's
going to be your variable so where do I
get my tracking ID in analytics well if
I'm in analytics I'm going to go to
admin and then under property settings
I'm going to see my tracking ID and all
you need to do then is go to tag manager
and paste copy first you got to copy Cy
over that tracking idid then you're
going to go to tag manager and going to
paste it and then that's going to create
a variable for you and then when you
create that variable you're going to see
it in the drop down here so I've already
created it and basically that's your tag
with a variable then what are you going
to do you're going to set up a trigger
so see I have some triggers already set
up you're going to see a default trigger
already set up for you and that's going
to be all pages so ideally what you want
to do is you want to select all pages in
order for analytics to fire on all pages
so that's what we're doing we're setting
up a trigger we're basically telling tag
manager hey if I get a visitor to any
page on my website then I want you to
fire Google analytics so that's
basically in summary how to set up your
first tag and my recommendation is your
first tag should be Google analytics and
when you set up analytics you're going
to have to set up a variable for the
tracking ID and so you get the tracking
ID again from admin property settings
copy and paste that tracking ID over
save it you have your variable that
variable is going to be included in with
the tag then your trigger is going to be
all pages and there you go you have your
first tag you have your first variable
you have your first trigger so that's
basically what you want to do and once
you've added that tag once you've added
that trigger then the only thing you
need to do now is basically publish the
tag and so anytime you save a tag you're
going to go ahead and submit it so that
way it gets published so again what
you're going to do is let's take a step
back here you're going to choose new tag
you're going to choose analytics from
the dropdown menu you're going to choose
page view then basically you're going to
add your tracking ID so you could set up
the variable and then basically that's
what you need to do okay you're going to
add that tracking ID and then waha
that's your tag with a variable and then
once you've do that then you're going to
click submit so when you click submit
you're basically saying Hey I want this
tag to go live now this tag and Trigger
and once you've done that then analytics
is ready to go and anytime somebody goes
to your website on any page tag manager
is going to fire Google analytics how to
do a proper keyword research so we
looked at Google's Keyword Planner tool
in Google ads and we typed in two
keywords and we were able to get a sense
of what the average volume is so we
definitely want to choose key words
based on the following factors we want
to choose it based on search volume
search volume is a good indicator of the
potential traffic we can obtain so again
for the key word homemade pizza dough
recipe we know that it averages 2400 a
month in search volume again we may not
get all 2400 but are we're going to get
a line share of that we also need to
look look at competition and so Google's
Keyword Planner gives us a high medium
or low in terms of the competition but
if you're somebody who wants to get a
better sense of what the competition is
and you should because competition is a
key component in choosing keywords and
so what I want to do is get a sense of
how many people are actually optimizing
for that keyword so Google's Keyword
Planner tool is going to give me a low
medium high really what I want to do is
get a better sense of that numerically
so what I can do is go into Google's
search and I can type in pizza recipes
and I could see there's about 1 billion
results that's a lot of results however
that means that every potential web page
out there on the internet that mentions
pizza recipes is going to be included in
this number here and so I want to get a
better sense of who's optimizing for
pizza recipes so I'm going to put in the
all en tile syntax and so what that is
going to ask Google to do is tell me all
the websites that have pizza recipes the
key word pizza recipes in the title tag
so if I do all in title colon space then
pizza recipes my result drops down to
336,000 so what that tells me is that
there are 336,000 results with the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag
now if I want to focus in on my other
keyword if I choose uh my other keyword
was a longer tail keyword homemade pizza
dough recipe so if I type that keyword
in so homemade pizza dough recipe or
recipes remember close variants and I
just click enter or type the keyword in
hit my Enter key I'm going to get 35
Million results but again is that really
an indicator of the type of competition
I have no because every listing that
mentions homemade pizza dough recipes is
going to be included in the search
results so I'm going to type in my all
in title colon space and then I'm going
to get a better sense of how many
websites have the keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes in the title tag and I get
2,160 different results so here I can
see the first result in the title tag
homemade pizza dough recipe second one
homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
sites or web pages that have that
keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the
thing have to understand about SEO
specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few
different keywords not just one or two
so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to
contain keywords that we can potentially
want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my
recommendation is you come up with a
theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's
our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipes so the close variance here is
pizza recipe what was the volume well we
know the volume was 33,100 for pizza
recipe so what are we going to do we're
going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition
well if we go back and type in pizza
recipes it was 683 th000 so I'm going to
type in
683 th000 what was our next keyword well
it was pizza or homemade made pizza
dough recipes so if I go back for this
particular keyword is 2400 so I'm going
to put 2400 in under my volume column
and then what was my competition well my
competition was I type that keyword back
in 2,160 so I'm going to put
2,160 so now I have an idea of what kind
of volume and what kind of competition I
have now you want to do this for a
number of different keywords and when
you do it for number of keywords what
you do want to do is obviously choose a
relevant keyword that has high volume
and low competition so another way of
saying it is the volume or ratio of
volume to competition and so basically
what we could do is take volume divided
by competition and if I make that a
percentage I can see it's 35% is the
ratio between volume and competition if
I do the same for my longer tail keyword
2400 divided by 2160 I can see that
111% so this just kind of proves the
point that yeah I'm still going to get
some volume but I have a better chance
of ranking for this longer teal keyword
homemade pizza dough recipes so you want
to be able to do that for a number of
keywords and examine the volume the
competition and the ratio between volume
and competition for your themed keywords
in this case pizza recipes so relevancy
you want to choose keywords that are
very relevant to the content that you're
writing and then again commercial
commercial intent what keywords are
going to drive more conversions and
revenue for the business so when we talk
about commercial intent we're talking
about you know are you choosing keywords
that are going to get somebody to do
what you want them to do so we could say
You Know download pizza dough recipes so
if somebody's typing in the keyword
download pizza dough recipes then
chances are they're going to find you
come to your site and take action by
downloading that pizza dough recipe so
you want to be able to also think about
the intent of the keyword is it going to
help you drive conversions and revenue
if you're an e-commerce site so search
volume is the average monthly search
volume made for a particular keyword and
phrase so we can get that number using
Google's Keyword Planner tool in the
Google ads platform we want to Target
keywords with high search volume that
will help bring traffic to the website
we want volume but we want to take into
account seasonality as well so that's
where the Google's Keyword Planner tool
comes in place because if we go back
again we can just hover over we get a
sense of any particular Trend going on
or seasonality so for example if I saw
large growth in the winter months and
not much volume growth in the summer
months then that might indicate to me
that this keyword is more popular during
the winter time so pay attention to the
graphs that you know the Keyword Planner
tool gives you use them to your
advantage to take into account
seasonality so a good example would be
funny Halloween costumes well we know
that for Halloween you're going to have
a spike probably towards the end of
September all the way through October
and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so
that's an example but in the case of
pizza recipes you know you may find that
more people are choosing to search for
pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay
attention to seasonality it will affect
search volume so competition based on
our example it's one of the most
important key metrics you don't want to
choose a keyword that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive
then it's going to be harder to rank
number one or even on page one of Google
depending on competitive it is so high
search volume low competition in other
words the ratio between the two is the
ideal combination so going back to the
spreadsheet recommend you have that
spreadsheet handy put your theme in
place okay theme pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find
the volume we use the all entitled
syntax to find the competition so we
entered both of those numbers in and we
get our ratio and so when you have these
numbers for a number of different
keywords you want to be able to choose
that ratio of high volume low
competition but always relevancy always
trumps ratio so always go with a keyword
that is going to be relevant to your
content don't choose a keyword that's
not relevant if you choose a keyword
that's not relevant it's not going to
bode well for user engagement so the
difficulty of a keyword ranges from 0 to
100 in Google's keyword tool so it's
going to be easy it's going to be medium
it's going to be hard but my
recommendation is also to get the
numerical factor in that's the all
entitle syntax and again relevancy is
what drives the traffic to your website
and keep the traffic there on your
website and also not only will it keep
the traffic on your website but
hopefully get that traffic to engage and
convert so that's the key about
relevancy you always want to choose
keywords that are relevant to your
content even if it's sacrificing volume
relevancy again trumps volume and
competition so always choose relevant
keywords first so when you do that
you're always almost guaranteeing that
at some point somebody's going to find
your content because somebody out there
might be looking for it and if they do
you're going to get found and then the
engagement is going to be better so
understand your business find key wordss
that are relevant to your business and
then focus on those key wordss that'll
help you with getting the right traffic
to your site always keep in mind the
commercial intent so these keywords are
more specific and result in conversion
rate for example buying is a good
commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your
website and buy then focus on those
types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could
be our commercial intent keyword again
there may be low search volume but those
are the type of keywords you want to
focus on because that's the type of
traffic you want to drive to your site
so some other examples of commercial
intent keywords or discount deal your
coupon shipping you don't don't be
afraid to use some of these keywords as
part of your longer tail keyword phrase
again the volume may not be high but the
traffic quality is probably going to be
better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen
your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's
going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk
about keywords we also want to talk
about our primary and secondary keyword
so every page should have at least a
primary keyword and then a secondary
keyword to work with so primary keyword
are really defining the nature of your
content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why
do we choose a primary and secondary
keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to
the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that
secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to
content and you may rank for that
secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one one
keyword want to give your yourself a
chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant
nature so for web page there can be
several secondary keywords but only one
primary keyword so your primary keyword
is always going to be relevant to your
content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may
have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the
content and it gives you a better
opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary in search Okay so
let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and
secondary keywords when choosing
keywords so if a primary keyword is
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet
plan is directly related to the content
so that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also
related to content and play off the
primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to Google's Keyword Planner
tool and get an idea of the volume for
healthy diet plan and then also the
volume and competition for some of these
secondary keywords like healthy diet for
weight loss healthy diet food low carb
diet healthy mail plans and diet plan
weight loss so if I go in to Google's
Keyword Planner and type those keywords
in I'm going to choose get results and
now here I can see healthy diet plan
keyword I'm focusing on is my primary
keyword has an average monthly search
volume of
99,900 and then some of my secondary
keywords healthy diet foods diet plan
weight loss low carb diet you know
Google will give me a number of
different keywords to work with so I'm
going to look at the search volume of
those as well and so ideally what I want
to do is be able to then look at the
volume and then look at the competition
so healthy diet plan I go into my
keyword analysis here that's my theme so
that's my keyword what's my volume for
healthy diet plan
99,900 what's my competition so my
competition is
74,700 and that's going to give me a
ratio of volume to competition of 133%
so that's what my content's about that's
a considered a short tail keyword
because it has a lot of competition and
so my ratio is 133% and what I want to
do is I want to be able to put these
other secondary keywords in here as well
maybe even go to a little longer tail
cuz I want to be able to find two key at
least two keywords I want to be able to
find my primary keyword that's relevant
to my content and then I want to be able
to find my secondary keyword which is
again related to the primary keyword
which is also related to the content and
so I want to be able to choose two
keywords basically and I want to choose
two keywords that are relevant that have
good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea
again of how to do keyword research you
want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and and
get a sense of what the volume is what
the competition is look at the ratio
between the volume and competition and
then based on the content choose that
primary keyword and then again based on
the keyword you chose choose some
secondary keywords as well because you
want to be found for not just one
keyword but multiple keywords typically
the rank number one on Google there are
some factors involved and those are
factors that are going to help Sam get
his website ranked number one on Google
so he can sell his shoes get traffic and
convert that traffic to conversions so
there are factors involved and so what
are those factors well it always starts
with keyword research so in order to
rank for a website where you sell shoes
or you sell products other products like
clothing or food or your an automobile
website you know you're a mechanic it
doesn't matter whether you're selling to
customer customers or selling to other
businesses you have to start with the
keyword research and so we're going to
go into really explicit detail on how to
conduct a proper keyword research and
then the second factor involved is high
quality content so in order to rank high
on Google search you need to have high
quality content so we're going to go
over what's involved with creating high
quality content then we're going to take
that content we're going to opt optimize
it using onpage elements and website
level factors so we're going to take
into account what's involved with your
website and what's involved with
specific pages on your website in order
to rank number one on Google then we're
going to get into the off-site
engagement so when it comes to ranking
on Google you need to optimize your
website and you need to do some elements
off your website you need to be engaging
off your website meaning on other
websites and so we're going to talk
about what's involved with offside
engagement so SEO being a major channel
for most companies and websites where
the opportunity to drive a lot of
traffic is there but you have to earn
that reward the reward is a lot of
traffic but you have to earn the reward
and there's a lot of work involved and
so ideally what we want to do is follow
what we call the 820 rule when it comes
to search engine optimization and
ranking on Google and what do we mean by
the 8020 rule well 8020 means we're
investing 20% of our effort and 80% of
the results are obtained so we want to
invest 20 and get back 80 that's
basically what we mean by 8020 so for
example if 20% of our targeted keywords
bring in 80% of the traffic then that's
following the 8020 rule or 20% of our
landing pages Drive 80% of the overall
traffic that's following the 8020 rule
or 20% % of our backlinks pass 80% of
our link jues that's the 8020 rule
meaning these targeted keywords these
targeted landing pages these trying to
Target backlinks using offsite
engagement we want to put in 20% of our
effort on those keywords landing pages
and backlinks in return for 80% of the
results so without further do let's get
started with the keyword research let's
talk about that keyword research search
for a website with shoes and and it
doesn't really matter what particular
product you have if you need to rank
number one on Google it all starts with
the keywords as I mentioned before and
so in this example if you have a website
where you sell shoes for kids you're
going to want to be found for certain
keywords so the obvious keyword here
would be shoes for kids well every key
word that you target has search volume
associated with it so that means when we
talk about search volume we're talking
about how many people on average type in
that keyword or related keyword on
google.com or Google search and there's
always an average number of searches
associated with every keyword and we
call that search volume how much search
volume so obviously if we're going to
Target a keyword we want to have as much
volume as possible however there's
always going to be competition for those
key keywords meaning there's always
going to be other websites who want to
rank number one on Google for the same
keywords and we call that competition or
difficulty so for every keyword you're
going to have volume and you're going to
have competition or difficulty and the
difficulty ranges as well depending on
the tool you use and we'll get into that
in a minute but search volume is how
much on average people are typing in
that keyword or close variance of that
keyword and the difficulty is measured
in terms of kids is highly relevant has
high volume and low competition then
that's a keyword we want to Target so we
always want to focus in on those three
areas so there's always a tradeoff with
keywords so shoes for kids might have
high volume but also might have high
competition or difficulty if we look for
another keyword that's just as relevant
for example shoes for children it may
still have high search volume but the
competition or the difficulty may be
lower and if that's the case then that
may be a better keyword for us to Target
instead of something highly competitive
like shoes for kids we can focus on
another relevant keyword like shoes for
children with just as much volume and
lower competition and the reason why we
want lower competition is because we
want to be able to rank for that keyword
so the higher the competition the harder
it is for us to rank number one on
Google for that keyword and so the whole
idea beond keyword research is analyzing
and choosing the best keywords so we
want to identify a list of keywords that
are always relevant we want to choose
the keyword that your competitors are
ranking for and we want to use
thirdparty tools to choose keywords to
identify which keywords have low
competition and what keywords have high
search volume so one thing to take into
consideration when you're doing keyword
research is that the longer the key word
phrase or in other words longtail
keywords or keywords with three keywords
in the phrase or more you're going to
always have less competition but there's
always a tradeoff with longtail keywords
meaning the longer the keyword phrase
there's going to be less volume but the
trade-off is less competition and so
what we want to do is we want to
brainstorm some ideas and find those
relevant keywords so let's look at an
example here so if we go to Google ads
so Google ads has a toe called Keyword
Planner and let's just say I have a a
website where I'm selling dried figs and
if I'm selling dried figs I want people
to buy these dried figs however in order
to attract them I want to be able to
show them that hey we have a a bunch of
recipes and if I show you a bunch of
recipes where you can use dried figs
maybe you'll buy these dried figs to
using these recipes and so we're going
to look look for keywords related to
bread recipes because if we can optimize
for our recipes page for bread then that
will attract an audience who wants to
make bread and use dried figs with those
bread recipes so that's the example I'm
going to give here and so if I look at
the Keyword Planner in Google ads if I
just type in bread recipes what Google
is going to do is they going to give me
an average monthly search volume so I
can see the average monthly Sear search
volume here is 60,500 and so in order to
keyword volume in the competition you're
getting for certain keywords so if I go
into a spreadsheet here my theme of
keywords is bread recipes my keyword is
bread recipes and my volume therefore is
going to be 60,500 however if I go back
into Google's Keyword Planner Google's
telling me the competition is low so
that's great I want high volume want low
competition but how low is low so we
want to be careful so if we're going to
put in numbers into a spreadsheet we
want to figure out what that competition
really is for the keyword bread recipes
so if I go to Google and just type in
bread recipes I'm going to be able to
see
771 billion results for the keyword
bread recipes now is 771 billion our
real competition maybe maybe not what we
want want to do is put in a syntax and
we want to put in the syntax all in
title and then colon space and then our
keyword and the reason why we do that in
search is because we want to be able to
identify the true competitive number or
the true number of websites who are
trying to rank for bread recipes and if
we put in the syntax all entitle colon
and then our keyword bread recipes we'll
be able to see that there are $998,000
results that's a lot lower than 771
billion so that means that 998,199
Google and we'll talk about that in a
few minutes but if we understand that
there are
998,199
18,000 in my spreadsheet as the
competitive number and so so now I could
see for the keyword bread recipes I have
60,500 and if my competition is
9980 then my Kei or keyword
Effectiveness index or in other words
the ratio of volume to competition is 6%
so that's nothing more than volume
divided by competition so that tells me
that my Kei or my ratio between volume
competition is 6% so remember we want
more volume than we want competition so
anytime you do a keyword research you're
going to find a number of different
relevant keywords so if I go back into
Google's Keyword Planner if I typed in
bread recipes you could see that Google
is going to give me a number of
different keywords related to bread
recipes let's just say I have another
keyword that I want to think about
optimizing for being ranked on Google
for and that's banana bread recipe very
similar keyword as bread recipes except
it's a little longer tail now if I type
in banana bread recipe in Google's
Keyword Planner now I can see the
average monthly search volume is
actually gone up it's
368,000 I can also see the competition
is low so those are good signs so now I
can see 368,000 I'm going to go ahead
and put that in my spreadsheet now I'm
going to go into Google I'm going to put
in my syntax All In title I'm going to
put in banana bread recipe I'm going to
hit enter and now I can see I have
233,000
results with the keyword banana bread
recipe in the title tag so if I look at
the title tags I can see banana bread
recipe banana bread recipe banana bread
recipe on all the listings in the Google
search results so that tells me I have
233,000 results that I have to jump over
in order to rank number one on Google so
I'm going to put 233,000 in my
spreadsheet now I can see my Kei or my
volume to competition ratio is 157
158% and so to me that's a lot better
number to work with or in other words
that's a lot better keyword because it's
just as relevant and it has a higher
ratio of volume to competition so
therefore banana bread recipe is is
going to be a better keyword to optimize
for in order to rank number one on
Google so that's the whole idea behind
keyword research you want to brainstorm
ideas there are plenty of tools out
there so the tool I recommend is Google
ads Keyword Planner Google's going to
give you how much search volume they're
going to tell you the competition but
then you're going to go into Google
search you're going to use the syntax
all in title to get a more accurate read
on the actual competitive number and so
to find out how keywords that your
competitors are ranking for you can use
those keyword tools that I mentioned
another tool that I use is M so MZ if
you go to ms.com they have a tool called
keyword Explorer so if we just type in
the keyword for example bread recipes
it's going to be able to tell us how
much volume and the difficulty so you
can use other tools that you're disposal
figure out the volume and the difficulty
there are plenty of tools out there but
the one thing I would just make sure is
you use everything at your disposal so
you can use social media to find the
most shared article for a particular
topic or keyword like bread recipes you
could check other platforms that have a
lot of shared content like Rin and Kora
where you can ask people about certain
topics using keywords to figure out how
much competition or volume they might be
you could stay up to date on industry
news to get an idea of what types of
keywords are trending but when it comes
to keywords and keyword research
remember for every web page we want to
be able to pick two keywords we want a
primary and secondary keyword so when we
do keyword research and we enter all our
keywords into our spreadsheet we want to
be able to have a number of different
keywords in this case we're focusing on
the theme bread recipes we want to have
different keywords because we want to be
able to choose a primary keyword and a
secondary keyword because we want to be
able to focus on multiple key wordss for
each page because we don't want to put
necessarily all our eggs in one basket
meaning we won't want to put all our
emphasis just on one keyword to rank
four we want multiple keywords to try
and rank four so the primary keyword can
Define the nature of our business the
secondary keyword could be just highly
relevant to our keyword at the end of
the day we want to choose multiple
keywords to try and rank on Google for
that page so for example we have a Blog
and we're using ice cream recipes and
we're blogging about ice cream recipes
we can have a primary keyword that is
about ice cream recipes or homemade ice
cream recipes we're going to always want
to find out what the volume in the
competition is our secondary keyword
could be built around found other
similar keywords like lowfat ice cream
recipes or fat-free ice cream recipes or
lowfat homemade ice cream recipes those
are complimentary keywords just like our
bread recipes and banana bread recipe so
one thing we want to do when we do
keyword research is we want to be able
to Target one keyword per content when
you can Target many we want to be able
to Target multiple keywords not
necessarily Target one key keyword and
so we want to be able to Cluster
keywords so we don't want to Target just
one we want to Target multiple keywords
per page and when we talk about
clustering if we go back to our keyword
research what we're doing is we're
clustering a bunch of keywords under the
theme bread recipes and so by looking at
the volume looking at the competition
looking at the Kei we can choose
different keywords for our page and
that's what we mean by clustering we
want to cluster keywords into a Content
theme so why Target only one keyword per
content when we can Target many because
we don't want to put all our eggs in one
basket we don't want to Target just one
keyword we want to Target many and so
that means clustering your keywords into
a theme and choosing multiple keywords
for that particular page and when we do
that we have a better opportunity to
rank high on Google Search and the whole
idea behind ranking high on Google gole
search is we can get the volume so if we
know we're ranked number one on Google
search for bread recipes or banana bread
recipe we know we stand a chance of
getting a majority of the volume
associated with that keyword and if we
can get the volume and get the traffic
then we can get the conversions so let's
move on to high quality content and talk
about the impact content has on your
ability to get your website ranked
number one on Google so let's just say
you have content on your website and the
content is ranking on you know page four
of Google and it's that blog with ice
cream recipes and if it's just content
for the sake of content is not really
informative then it's not necessarily
going to get good engagement in the eyes
of Google you know they want to rank
content that's very informative it's
very fresh it's exciting to read it's
interesting it's going to have good
engagement so if it's a recipe or an
article about any topic if it's the
content is just not informative then
you're not going to get good engagement
and when you don't get good engagement
if people don't stay on the site to
engage in the content and they just
leave the website after laying on the
page causing a bounce then the content
is just going to continue to fall down
the rankings and we want to prevent that
we want to move up the rankings we want
to be number one on Google we don't
necessarily want to fall in the rankings
for our content so content is a key
driver in being able to rank number one
on Google so if the content is on page
nine what can we do well we want to be
able to you know take that content and
do something with it we feel like we did
right engaging content so let's go ahead
and share it on social media and to me
social media is a good platform to share
your content because on social media
platforms like Facebook for example
you're building a community on that
platform that Community is already
interested in your content so if you're
sharing an ice cream recipe especially
in the summertime and you're engaging
with your community on that platform
then the likelihood of that community on
that platform is going to increase
engagement increased engagement will
send social signals to the search engin
says hey this content is good quality
likewise for any other platform most
social media platforms have engagement
metrics and those engagement metrics
pass signals is it good is it not good
do we like this content are we giving it
a thumbs up are we going to want to
follow it are we going to want to share
it and so if you share content that you
feels engaging on social platforms then
it's going to be engaging and it's
likely going to cause an increase in
engagement for example a decrease in
balances and once you share that quality
content then the likelihood of it moving
up the rankings even as far as number
one on Google is going to be greater so
you always want to start out writing
good quality content so let's talk about
good quality content because Google does
take content seriously they do take into
account what other people think of that
content so high quality content is an
important factor so how to create good
content that's always the question so
let's talk about some best practices
here remember in the last segment we
talked about keyword research so we want
to perform good keyword research why
because we want to choose keywords
remember we're choosing multiple
keywords per page one keyword could be
related to our brand one keyword could
be related to the content but another
keyword could be related to a user's
intent like recipes if you recall the
example we use with bread recipes maybe
somebody's looking to type in a keyword
that says how do I make you know a bread
or how do I make a specific type of
bread or how do I make banana bread or
what's the best recipe for banana bread
they're question related and we want to
be able to answer those questions so
that's where choosing those right
keywords that's going to respond to a
user's intent so starts with choosing
the right keywords so remember we talked
about number of different tools when we
talked about keyword research so there's
a research tool that you can use called
phrase. iio and that will help you do
quick research on you know keywords and
Trends and whatnot so if you know better
research tool that you use for keyword
research then drop us a comment below
I'd be interested in getting your
comments about keyword research and what
research tools are out there so if you
know something better than phrase. drop
a comment below and we'd be interested
in getting your perspective so keyword
research is key but creating content
that fulfills users's requirement so
answering those questions if it's a
recipe we want to answer that question
if it's directions we want to answer
that question if they don't know how to
do something we want to answer that
question and that's the whole idea
behind content content is not just to
fill a page it's to really fulfill users
requirements that's when you get good
engagement so if somebody's typing in
something on Google and they're looking
for an answer your content should answer
that question but we also want to make
the content readable so in other words
you know write for your audience don't
impress anybody with very high
vocabulary type words that somebody
doesn't necessarily know the meaning of
don't use jargon don't use a street
language for example use everyday common
language that's just easily digestible
when your audience is reading and then
we want to keep that content organized
and so when we mean organized we want to
use headers and subheaders you know
break your content into paragraphs keep
the flow organized if we can keep the
flow organized then it's going to be
easier for somebody to read and then
it's okay to add resources especially
resources from credible sites so if you
can incorporate those resources in there
then it's just going to add The
credibility to your content let the
audience know that hey I've done my
research on this topic and this this is
what this person has to say about it
this person who seems to be credible
okay so it only adds value to your
content so these are all tips to
Remember When creating content and then
the one important tip here is we want to
use white hat techniques and when we say
wh hat techniques that means you know if
we've chosen keywords that are going to
answer somebody's question we don't want
to stuff those keywords into the content
we want the content to be naturally
written so when we say op for white heck
uh Tech techniques that's what we mean
write the content naturally keep it
organized keep it readable include third
party sources and make sure it answers a
question so there are different types of
content so there's content where you
just write words it's all text based you
could also use an infographic
infographic is simply just a graphic
that visualizes exactly what you're
trying to explain for example if we want
to write an article about how to write
good engaging content we don't
necessarily have to write all that out
as a text we can create an infographic
so for example here's an infographic on
20 effective ways to basically not bore
your readers but write engaging content
so you could see this is an infographic
it's all graphically laid out so
infographics tend to be easier to
understand because they're visual
they're easy for the end user to
comprehend because there's generally no
jargon it's usually images that are
portraying the point of what you're
trying to get across and so it tends to
break it up the monotony of just text
it's more visually appealing and it's
laid out and organized so you can see
this infographic has 20 different steps
or rules and they lay those out all here
in this infographic and the great thing
I like about infographics is you could
you could share them on social media you
can re-engage them as post you could
save them on really any social platform
so infographics tend to tell a better
story versus say just writing text you
can use video and images so you don't
necessarily have to lay it all out in an
infographic you can certainly insert a
video or an image into your content
especially if it's a blog post if it's a
blog post then sometimes video and
images on its own tell the story you
don't NE necessarily need text to go
ahead and tell your story a video or an
image as they say tells a thousand words
and so images and videos are great to
use in a blog post so using different
forms of content you know you always
want to review your content when a user
dwells on your web page for a longer
time Google will tend to think okay this
person's engaged so we're going to rank
that favorably so if you're using
infographics videos and images then the
chances of somebody being more engaged
are going to increase versus just text
that's not well organized and written
out in a way that somebody doesn't
necessarily understand so be creative in
the types of content you use so longer
engaging content tends to bode well with
search engines so this is according to
HubSpot so the more word count you use
the more word you use the chances of you
ranking higher are going to be better
just take into account best practices
you want to maybe break up the content
with an image organize it make it
engaging use headers so it's not
necessarily just words it's the words
and how those words are written how
they're structured the types of keyword
you're using how you're engaging with
your audience there's a lot of factors
again as best practices we just went
over but the key is you know if you have
longer more engaging content then it's
going to bode better for you on search
engines so couple of steps to create
high quality content so you want to
begin with a comprehensive introduction
so always introduce your content
remember the content should be relevant
to the keyword so if you're choosing
keywords in your keyword research think
about answering that question if
somebody's typing in bread recipes maybe
they're looking for banana bread recipes
how to to make the best banana bread or
how to make banana bread using dried
figs we want to be able to align our
content with that keyword naturally you
want to create a title that's worthy
that's click worthy so remember if
you're in Google search and you're doing
search for something simple like bread
recipes we want to some make something
that's going to be you know engaging for
somebody to click on like easy perfect
yeast bread or easy crusty French bread
or something that's going to be engaging
you know the best bread recipes or how
to make the best homemade bread you know
something that's going to draw
somebody's attention to the title of
that blog post so we want to include LSI
keyword so what I mean by LSI keywords
in your content we mean you know
longtail keywords make it natural
headings and subheadings should consist
of keywords and variants so if you're
writing headers and subheaders include
the keyword in there and that way the
the content always stays relevant to the
audience okay shorten your sentences and
paragraphs so don't write long
paragraphs remember we want to break
this up we want to make it easy for the
end user to read and we want to always
put internal links on our blog post why
because if we have internal links then
if we have a link from one blog post to
another blog post or say our blog post
to an internal page on our our website
we want to make sure that it's relevant
content that way if somebody's reading
something and you have an internal link
let's just say from a bread recipes page
to a banana bread recipes page then they
may find it interesting click on that
link and go to the banana bread recipes
page so it's keeping somebody engaged on
your website so putting in internal
linking will help keep the the end user
engaged because you're offering up links
that's relevant to the cont content you
always want to break up that content
with images okay we want to use alt tags
meaning we want to pen the image with
text so that way if the image doesn't
load then at least the alt text will
load so we can incorporate call out
boxes and more importantly we want to
update our content regularly so we
always want to get the best recipe out
there if it's banana bread or different
ways to create banana bread or always
just coming up with ways to update the
content so we want to keep our content
our blog post fresh and then we want to
include a CTA call to action if we
include a call to action then that's
going to keep somebody engaged and have
them act on your content so these are
steps to creating high quality content
and so let's look at an example here and
this is a 3month Old Post on BuzzFeed
and it's 21 pictures that restore your
faith in humanity so it has a lot of
likes a lot of tweets and that means
it's engaged people are engaged when
reading that and so if we go and look at
it as an example we could see it in on
BuzzFeed here 21 pictures that will
restore your faith in humanity so this
was written back in 2012 again a lot of
Engagement but if we look at it we can
see immediately that it's taking into
account third party sources it's got
some content it's got images it's being
broken up by images we could see there's
call to actions on there in the form of
social so people can go ahead and go
ahead and share it if they like it okay
it includes videos it includes images
third party sources so it's a good post
because listen you know it's engaging
content it's probably answering
somebody's question about humanity and
we could see clearly that look you know
there's a lot of different examples here
from a lot of different sources and we
could take action on this content so not
just video not just images but text as
well and so it's very engaging answers
questions takes into account the
different types of content available so
this is a good post in that regard so
content's updated regularly it's
engaging and it includes sources from
high Authority websites some dos and
don'ts on the content so take into
account the best practices I mentioned
about creating highquality cont content
okay answer those questions that the end
user wants to hear you know CU that
likely is going to be their search and
so you want to be able to respond to the
end user that's part of creating high
quality content different types of
content IE in the form of infographics
or videos or text or images you can add
images from public domain sites you can
be relatable and use examples to clarify
points just like the BuzzFeed article
simplify complex words don't use
sophisticated language talk to your
audience as if you they were standing
right in front of you and use bullet
points to exemplify your examples your
points so some dos the don'ts obviously
don't lift content we don't want to lift
content from another website so that's
plagiarism so we want to have our own
unique content we also don't want to
take images from other websites and so
if you do happen to find an image that
works for your post and it's on somebody
else's website ideally that's not a good
situation but if you do happen to do
that then always give credit to the
website okay so if you took it from
xyz.com credit xyz.com for the image and
even put a link back but ideally you
don't want to take images from other
websites just as much as you don't want
to take copy you don't want to take
images use your own imagery and content
but if if you don't have imagery then
you can always go to stock photography
there are plenty of websites out there
where you can sign up for a subscription
like uh Adobe stock images as an example
you can sign up for an account and in
some cases you can sign up for a free
account and use stock imagery okay don't
give less information to your audience
give your audience what they deserve
which is the information they're looking
for they're looking for the best banana
bread recipes give them the best banana
bread recipes incorporate your own
images break it up with titles give them
a good quality piece of content that
they're going to be able to engage with
and so if you put long paragraphs in
your content then it's going to be less
engaging so try to avoid those long
paragraphs remember shorten up the
paragraphs keep the language simple add
in images answer those questions use
third party credible sources but write
it in your own words and you should be
on your way to creating good quality
content okay so now that we've talked
about high quality content in order to
get your pages ranked high on Google
search let's turn our attention to
optimizing onpage elements and discuss
some website level factors that are both
going to help you rank high on Google
search so let's just do an overview what
we're talking about when we talk about
onpage elements and website level
factors so optimize ing on page elements
include a number of different things but
primarily we're going to focus in on
metat tags also known as meta
description tags header tags also known
as title tags and URLs so those are just
some of the on page elements we want to
be able to optimize using relevant
keywords in order to rank high Google
search we also want to take a look at
some website factors that will affect
are ranking on Google search they
include website architecture having a
secure website having a sitemap and
taking a look at page speed so all of
those are some of the website factors we
need to take into account in order to
rank high on Google search so title tag
and meta description together are
considered meta tags so both play an
important role in ranking high on Google
so we want to be able to write unique
title and descriptions for each page on
our website when I say unique that means
a title and a meta description need to
be different for every page on the
website and so if you're not quite sure
what a title tag and a meta description
tag is if you go to search and just type
in any particular search query the title
tag is what's going to show up here in
bold and then the description is going
to show up below it below the URL and
that's going to describe the page so
both of these meta tags are important
because it describes what your page is
all about and that's what Google uses in
the search results pages so we want to
be able to pay attention to the length
of our metat tags so if we go back to
our search results Pages met title tags
are generally 6065 characters metad
description tags are generally 160
characters so anything really longer
than that then what's going to happen is
The Meta description tag or the title
tag will get truncated and so if we look
here for example we can see all of the
title tags here fit the 65 character
limit but if you run over the character
count on meta description then Google is
going to truncate the copy so you want
to stay within your parameters in order
to avoid getting your content truncated
and so the other thing when we're
writing title meta description tags we
want to minimize keyword repetition so
if we're optimizing for keyword we don't
want to necessarily just plug that
keyword into the title tag and meta
description multiple times we want to
make sure our title tags and meta
descriptions are naturally written so if
somebody's typing for banana bread
recipe with dried fix you know we want
to have a nice title tag and this
description that is going to get
somebody to respond uh based on their
need
and so we definitely want to avoid
keyword repetition but we want to be
able to use that keyword in the title
tag because if you remember from the
earlier segment when we did the all in
title syntax to find out exactly how
many competitors were using that
particular keyword well we obviously
want to use that keyword in the title
tag because again the title tag is an
important factor when it comes to search
engine results so we want to use the
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or
using it
repetitively in our title tag and our
meta description we want the title tag
and The Meta description to describe the
page sound natural but also be engaging
because the point is we want people to
click on our link and go to our website
from search engines so title tags with
numbers tend to result in higher click
the rates this is according to mods so
for example if you just put in a title
tag that says learn digital marketing
well that may work but if you put a
number in there like five easy ways to
learn digital marketing that might get
somebody to click on your link and go to
your website so having questions in your
metax can also increase your click the
rate for example if you just put learn
the importance of first page rankings
not too bad but they get generic but if
you put it into the formal question how
to rank number one on Google it's more
action oriented it's going to get
somebody to resonate with the question
that they have and that may be their
query how to rank number one on Google
and so these techniques will help you
get higher clicky rates and so according
to back Linko title tag with a keyword
can improve site ranking so remember we
want to include that keyword in the
title tag even though we only have 65
characters we want to include that
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing
the keyword in there we want to again
make the title
action oriented maybe with a number
maybe as a question with the keyword in
there once naturally not easy to do but
that's the beauty of SEO if you can
follow these best practices and write a
good title tag then the chances of you
improving in your search results are
going to be greater so having only one
H1 tag in your post is going to be good
so remember when somebody clicks on a
link so let's just say they do find a
title tag engaging and they click on
this this link here and they go to that
website you know you want to start out
with having that particular H1 tag
because the H1 tag especially with the
keyword in it is going to signal to
Google hey we're organizing our page and
because it's an H1 tag it's important
we're structuring the page according to
best practices so having only one H1 tag
in your post is definitely helpful
having multiple tags H tags in your post
help organize the page a lot better so
we want to add that targeted key word in
that tag and your header tag should be
relevant to the content so if we go back
to our example of the using Drive figs
with banana breads well the title says
California fig banana bread and remember
the last segment when we're talking
about high quality content will look no
further than including a video into our
cont content so not only will this video
help keep the engagement high but it
breaks up the monotony of the page and
it's from a third party source so it
adds credibility to the page so adding a
video based on the last segment of high
quality content definitely helps with
ranking high on Google search so
following hierarchal structure that
means putting those H tags in there H2
tags help break up the content and we
want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on
your different web pages of your site
meaning don't just put the same H1 tag
with the same keyword in it and keeping
it Blas we want to make those H1 tags
exciting to read but also used
appropriately to break up the content so
remember all white hat techniques we
want to avoid hidden text we want to
avoid stuffing keyw we want things to be
natural we don't want things to be
forced and your H1 tag should be 20 to
70 characters don't make long H1 tags so
if we go back to our page example a
short sweet tag here California fig
banana bread it's relevant to the
content it's short sweet it breaks up
the monotony of the content and more
importantly again any content you have
on the page should always answer the
users's intent remember people are using
search to answer questions find
information our content should be able
to answer that for them so according to
John Moher senior Web Master Trends
Analyst at Google header tags would
definitely help Google for rankings and
the search results so we want to use
header tags so when it comes to URLs we
want to use hyphens and avoid
underscores so if we look at this URL
here this uses hyphens fig and banana
bread so it's all broken up with hyphens
that's the best practice remember
canonical your Ur LS a canonical URL
signals to Google this is the original
content so we want to use original
content and if you have multiple sources
of content out there on say different
websites we want to use a canonical tag
to signal to Google this is the original
content please Index this content and
not doesn't hurt to use a favon URL
meaning a small icon it helps to break
up the monotony and help your URL stand
out we we can add targeted keywords in
the URL so again looking at the URL here
I can see we're using targeted keyword
as part of the Ural structure fig and
banana bread and notice the H1 tag is
fig banana bread so it's all consistent
and it flows naturally URLs that are no
longer existing then we want to be able
to set up a redirect for those URLs
meaning a 301 redirect is a server
response for Google that says Hey Google
this page is no longer available but it
we permanently redirected it to this
page which is now available so that's
what a 301 redirect does it helps signal
to Google and all the other search
engines that if the page is no longer
there that's fine you're just going to
go to this page this is the page that's
permanently there now and another thing
we want to do here is if you have mobile
URLs you want to include those in the
sitemap and we're going to hit on that
in just a minute but all urls should
should be mobile friendly as well as
desktop friendly meaning take into
account this best practices keep your
url short use hyphens put the keyword in
that URL and make it easy to understand
want to avoid capital letters in the
URLs the URLs are case sensitive so go
lowercase you should always go lowercase
from the URL readable URLs again the
rule of thumb here is if you understand
what the URL is then Google's going to
understand what the URL is so the
shorter the URL the easier it is to read
the easier it is to read the better
chance you have to rank high on Google
search so according to backlink to URLs
that are shorter definitely definitely
help you rank so we want to be able to
shorten those URLs keep them short and
sweet don't make them long and
unreadable so those are some on
optimized ways or on page elements that
help you optimize now we want to look at
some website level factors that will
help you optimize and rank high on
Google search so good site structure
provides better cring for search engine
Bots and what do we mean by that well we
mean having your site organized in a
fashion that Google's going to be able
to find all the pages so what do we mean
by that create a logical hierarchy
structure so if you're selling shoes you
know you're going to have a homepage
break the structure up into men's shoes
women's shoes children's shoes then
under men's shoes you could have it by
brand it could be Nike Puma Adidas on
the women's side it could be Nike Puma
Adidas on the child side it could be
Nike Puma Adidas and so you want to keep
the structure flow in a hierarchy so we
want to balance the amount of
subcategories within each category so
the men's if it has Nike Puma Adidas the
women should have Nike Puma Adidas and
so you want to code your site navigation
in CSS or HTML meaning we we want to be
able to use something that Google is
going to be able to index so most sites
are built in HTML and that's what Google
likes to index they like to index
something that they could take back to
their servers and then more importantly
build a comprehensive structure for
internal linking so internal links mean
that if you're on a site you should have
natural links pointing to other pages on
your website so to keep the flow going
and we don't want to have unnatural
inbound links you always want to have
natural internal links to keep the flow
of the user going from one page to the
other so here I could see as an example
all the ingredients in this recipe well
this has an internal link to another
page on our site and this happens to
link to page where somebody can buy the
ingredients so it's a natural internal
link so John DH of Credo has claimed
that one of the biggest changes that he
can make in fixing the creative website
is architecture so for example in Credo
John dty has increased the organic
sessions by 74% and Pages by per session
by 41% just by changing the site
architecture so you'd be surprised by
changing the site architecture what that
will do to engagement and so let's turn
our attention to secure versus
non-secure so what we mean by that is
securing your site we want to make it
sure that compliant with certain
protocols and so if we go back here we
could see that this particular site is
compliant it is secure https means it
has a secure license meaning the site is
secure so Google likes secure versus
non-secure so non-secure would be HTTP
so we want
https as our protocol and what that
means is just enabling SSL certificates
and that means when you enable an SSL
certificate that means your domain or
your protocol is going to be turned to
https so Google prefers sites that are
secure versus non-secure so if you use
hsts as a protocol that adds an extra
layer of security over the https and
hsts prevents cookie hijacking so adding
multiple layers of security always helps
in my opinion if you have an
HTTP website a non-secure website you
should look into buying an SSL
certificate getting your sites flipped
over to
https because what's going to happen is
your url structure is going to change
when your url structure changes Google's
going to recognize that because they're
going to index your site and when they
index your site they're going to see
those secure URLs and that's going to
work favorably in your favor and help
you rank higher on Google search so
websites using secure or
https have a higher chance of ranking
higher so HT TPS is a ranking signal
because Google indexes those pages so
let's also talk about sitemaps so sitap
is one of the most important ways to
improve your website ranking why well
because sitemaps are a way to organize
all your URLs into one file so we're
basically going to prioritize all our
web pages in a Sit map so if you go to
any particular website and you type in
sitemap XML you're likely going to see
all the pages on your website so usually
the sit map is located in the root
directory so if I type in sitemap.xml
I'm going to be able to see all the
pages in my root directory and I can
also prioritize them I can also alert
Google as to how often they change and
every page is going to have a date stamp
associated with it so Google can
actually see how often it changes so
remember we want our content to be
updated frequently so if content is not
updated frequently or it's not fresh
then Google's going to see that s that
date stamp that last modification down
so we want to be able to make sure our
content's updated frequently we want to
let Google know that we changed it
frequently and we want to be able to
prioritize our Pages let Google know hey
these pages are important to us so all
that can be set up in a sitemap we want
to be able to add canonical versions of
URLs in the sitemap so we want to be
able to add all our original URLs in our
sit map and so we always want to build
Dynamic URLs sitemaps for larger
websites and what do I mean by Dynamic
URLs that means that if I look at this
side map and we're always adding content
let's just say in the form of a Blog
well guess what we want those pages to
be added to the site map as they're
published so as we add pages to the blog
or to the site then they should
automatically be added to the sitemap
and so in effect what's going to happen
is we're going to be able to see the
sitemap grow with more URLs when the
sitemap grows with more URLs then that
means then Google's going to index more
pages they're going to index more fresh
pages so they're going to be able to get
those pages that are just published
quicker so that's the whole idea behind
Dynamic sitemaps is we want to be able
to capture all the URLs just as they're
published and we want to be able to
maintain our s maps and so I would
always recommend a dynamic sitemap but
you can always create your own sit map
just by going to a tool called XML
sitemap so if I just type in XML
sitemaps into Google search here I can
see XML sitemaps generator and I can be
able if I have a small website just
create a free and simple sitemap on my
own when XML sitemaps creates it or your
platform creates a dynamic site map
either way the site map's going to sit
in the root Direction
and then what we want to do in turn is
let Google know where that sitemap is so
in search console we want to be able to
submit the sitemap so you're going to
add the sitemap you're going to let
Google know where it is it should be in
the root directory and it should be
called sitemap.xml and when you do that
Google's going to be able to take those
URLs and index them so we could see we
submitted 528 URLs Google index 521 so
one thing about URLs here is when we
create a site map we're putting all your
URLs in there we do not add no index
URLs in your sitemap and what that means
is that any URL we don't want Google to
index we're just going to exclude from
the sitemap okay so we want Google to
take all the URLs we want indexed and
put them in the sitemap so according to
edgy using sit maps for SEO can increase
your website's visibility and help you
get indexed why because what you're in
fact doing is taking all your URLs that
you want index you're telling Google how
often they're modified you're telling
Google which ones are important and
you're submitting that to Google and so
Google's going to be able to take all
these URLs quicker index them quicker
and when they're index quicker you can
get ranked quicker and when you get
ranked quicker you can get traffic
quicker so that's the whole idea behind
site Maps so let's turn our attention to
page speed now so one of the last
factors for website besides architecture
making it secure and adding site Maps is
you want to take a look at how quick our
Pages load here are some tips in order
to optimize page speed because ideally
the quicker a page loads the more engag
the user is going to be if it takes a
longer time for the page to load all the
elements of that page then what's going
to happen is the user is going to get
impatient maybe leave the website all
together or go to another page and so we
want to be able to optimize images so
any image that's of large size in terms
of megabytes we want to be able to
optimize that compress the image so
that's one way to speed up page speed we
want to use a simple website design you
know HTML with CSS or cascading
stylesheets just a simple design with
simple hierarchy and website navigation
structure so nothing fancy nothing
complex just a simple website design
with optimized images we want to
leverage browser caching and we want to
upgrade the server response time meaning
all your files are sitting on the server
so when somebody goes to a web page the
server is serving up all of those files
the images the text Etc and so we want
the server to respond as quick as
possible so when it comes to page speed
we can look at the factors affecting
page speed in Google analytics so if I
go to Google analytics and I go under
behav behavior and I go under sight
speed and I go to overview I'm going to
be able to see what my average load time
is for my site and ideally we want our
pages to load as quick as possible so
that means anything under 4 seconds
anything 4 seconds or higher and it's
likely the end user is going to leave
the page there's a correlation be
between page load time and bounce rate
and so what Google actually does is give
you speed suggestions so if we do have a
page that loads slow we can just go to
speed suggestions in Google analytics
and we go to speed suggestions then
Google's going to be able to tell us hey
this particular page load fast this
particular page load slow and if it
loaded slow why is it loading slow so
here we could see the homepage as
example is loading on average of 7
Seconds well if we look here they're
going to give us some suggestions so if
I click on those page speed suggestions
it's going to load a report and a tool
called page speed insights and basically
what it's then going to do after it's
done running is it's going to tell me
all the ways in which I can optimize my
pages not only for desktop but also for
mobile so here I can see for desktop or
for mobile I can look at some ways in
which I can optimize it to increase page
speed for example sizing my images
properly server response time reducing
my server response time avoiding
multiple page redirects so there's a lot
of opportunities that we can do to speed
up page loow time and all that's found
in page speed insights and all that's
found within Google analytics so
remember optimizing code minimizing
redirects optimizing your images
upgrading your server respons all of
those are factors and so again you can
go into analytics page speed insights
and you can see exactly what Google is
recognizing as what's lowering or
slowing down your page load time so
Google takes sight speed as one of the
most important ranking factors why
because they're going to rank Pages not
only with high quality content that are
relevant to the keyword queries but they
want those pages to have a good user
experience so if somebody clicks on the
page then the user should be able to see
that content fairly quickly and so
that's why it's such an important factor
so the quicker your pages
the chances of you ranking higher are
going to be better so according to web
performance today Walmart as an example
experienced a decline and conversions so
what they did was looked at their page
speed and when they looked at their page
speed you'd be surprised what that did
just increasing it from 1 to 4 seconds
or decreasing it basically increased
conversion so there's always going to be
a correlation between how quick a page
loads and how engaged the user is
because if it's users engaged they're
going to stay on the site and if they
stay on the site then their chances of
converting are going to be higher so
just even one to 2 seconds increase in
page low low time will make a world of
difference in terms of Engagement and
conversions let's turn our attention to
offside engagement so previously we
talked about onpage elements and website
factors that affect our rankings for
search results but we also need to turn
our attention away from our website
meaning what we do on our website and
turn our attention what we can do for
our website off our website and onto
other websites so that's offsite
engagement and so let's look at an
example so that ice cream recipes blog
I'm going to talk about how to rank
YouTube videos today so it's simply
learn we take our videos on YouTube very
seriously meaning that when we create
videos we want people to see them
because we know we make good videos and
we know we have good content and we know
that our audience is going to enjoy it
and so we want our audience to see the
videos that we're creating and so we're
going to give you some tips and tricks
and methodology and ideas on how to get
your videos to rank on YouTube so at
simply learn if I go to YouTube and I
just type in machine learning you could
see we're right here is the first
organic video on YouTube for machine
learning if I jump over to Google and I
I type in machine learning Basics you
can see we're number we're number one
for machine learning Basics under videos
if I click on all we're also ranked here
as well under the video section on
organic search results another example
data science for beginners we ranked
number one for that if I look at another
keyword data science interview questions
okay we'll rank number two for that so
we're ranking for a lot of videos and
why are we ranking for a lot of
different content and videos on on
Google Search and on YouTube well we put
a lot of work in behind the scenes of
creating the video and that's what we
want to show you so part of that has a
lot to do with you know how our audience
engages and sees our video so for
example we're looking at the machine
learning Basics video here and we can
see that it has over
221,000 subscribers for this video
234,000 views we've had over 2,000
people like the video and we have had
over 2 70 plus comment on the video so
when we get our videos to rank then we
can see there's a lot of Engagement and
so that's the whole idea is when you do
a video and you want to to show up on
YouTube you want people to enjoy it you
want people to share it you want people
to like it you want people to comment on
that and that's part of the whole
ecosystem of YouTube It's you know we're
going to show you behind the scenes of
what it takes to get your videos to rank
and then we're going to show you some of
the metrics involved with some of these
videos to help you stay ranked
so without further Ado let's go into how
to get your videos to rank on YouTube so
we're going to talk about keyword
research for YouTube we're going to talk
about some ways to create high quality
videos to the importance of user
engagement just as I showed you with the
machine learning Basics video all the
shares all the commenting all the views
and subscriptions then we're going to
get into how to promote your content and
then we're going to just review a little
checklist for you and sum it all up so
let's get started with keyword research
so basically what we want to do is
Center our keywords just like our
website we want to Center our keywords
around or our content around good
keywords so the videos on YouTube are no
different than the web pages on our
website so if we have somebody who
states YouTube is the world's second
most well well-known engine well it is
because it's right behind Google it's
not a search engine per se it's a video
platform but if it was search engine
it'd probably be second right behind
Google so YouTube is pretty popular
majority people use YouTube search every
day to watch videos on a number of
different topics so they can find these
videos in Google but because YouTube's
so powerful and so popular people go
directly right into YouTube for their
searches and so the whole idea behind
YouTube being the second most well-known
search engine is centered around
keywords so if you if you have the right
keywords for your video then the chances
of you ranking higher increases on
YouTube so we're going to share with you
a few easy ways to do keyword research
this is the most important step in
getting your videos to rank on YouTube
just like for those of you who watched
any of the SEO videos we produced at at
simply learn you know that keyword
research is so essential to getting your
web pages to rank on Google well it's no
different keyword research and choosing
the right keywords is just as important
for your videos as is for your web pages
so we're going to go into a few things
to do here to find the right keywords so
we have the search suggestion you can
look at your competitors we have
different tools we can use some other
factors involved in Google itself so
let's start talking about some of these
ways to really hone in and do some good
research on your keywords to align them
with your videos so first thing is
search suggest so you YouTube has a
feature called autocomplete so if you've
done any searches on Google it's very
similar if you're typing something into
YouTube search then YouTube is going to
suggest other related popular keywords
so let's take a look at that if we go
back to YouTube for a second and I just
type in machine learning YouTube is
going to populate on the autocomplete in
the search bar some other popular
keywords that we can potentially use or
in this case if I Choose You Know
machine learning tutorial I'm going to
see a video about machine learning
tutorial so here you can see simply
learns rank number one for machine
learning tutorial but there are other
videos that show up in my search results
so we want to be able to use the search
suggestion box in the search box field
so when we're typing in something you
know YouTube just like on Google is
going to give us those suggestions so if
we're focusing uh a video on machine
learning then you we have some ideas of
some other key wordss that we could
center around because these are our
popular key wordss these are key wordss
that people are using to search on
YouTube so that's one suggestion looking
at competitors is another suggestion so
we could search for keyword used by our
competitors in their video title and
description so let me talk a little bit
about that what you want to do is you
want to go to that particular channel of
your competitor so when you go to your
particular competitors YouTube channel
you want to be able to click on the
videos tab when you click on the videos
tab then you're going to sort by most
popular and then what you could do is
see a list of videos and then when you
look at a list of videos you're going to
choose a video and then what you're
going to do then is take a look at the
keywords used in the title and
description and then once you do that
you're going to have a list of keywords
that you can use yourself for that video
so for example let's go back to YouTube
so if I go to type in simply learn
here's her Channel page just by clicking
on simply learn I click on videos ever
wonder if there's so now I can see all
the videos ever wonder if there's an
easier way go back so here I can see all
the videos sort by most popular once
they do that then I could choose a video
this is the most popular video right now
for simply learn if I click on that
video it's automatically going to start
playing but what I could do is simply
just look at you know the content
description so just by clicking show
more I can see all the content that
align with this video that's one way to
do it is simply by looking at your
competitors now what you could also do
is look at the tags associated with the
particular video and so what you want to
do is you want to look at the HTML and
so that means looking at the page source
so just like web pages what YouTube does
is they look at metatext so if your call
from SEO in order to get your pages to
rank you need to have a title tag and a
meta tag description so videos are no
different what we're doing uh for
YouTube is aligning certain keywords
with the video so if you take a look and
do a search for keywords by viewing the
page Source you're going to see all the
keywords
associated with a particular video so
for example if I go back to YouTube and
I look at the page source of a video
Let's just say this video here
Facebook's ad tutorial I'm I'm going to
pull up the page source and all I need
to do isrl F and type in keywords and
now for that Facebook video I can see
all the keywords associated with the
video so you can see there's a lot of
different keywords we're aligning with
this video and so why do we want to do
that because we want you know our video
to show up for keywords that people may
type in and so if you use that YouTube
autocomplete it's going to give you
those ideas there most popular keywords
so if they're related align those
keywords with the video so here you can
see Facebook marketing Facebook ad
strategy Facebook ads for beginners so
forth and so on so there's a lot of
keywords we've aligned here with that
particular video and again all you need
to do is look at the page source so
right clicking view page Source do a
contrl f for keywords and you'll be able
to see the keywords aligned so you could
do that for your competitor's videos as
well so you can see what keywords your
competitor is using for a video that's
most popular for their Channel and is
also ranking on YouTube and on Google so
using the autocomplete gives you those
keyword ideas looking at your
competitor's videos also gives you some
other ideas for keywords that you can
align with a video that's relevant that
you want to rank for so let's look at U
some other ideas here so you can install
plugins and there are plenty of plugins
available on the Chrome browser that
will help you see the video tags
associated with a particular video so a
couple of examples are vid IQ and Tu
buddy those are extensions that work in
Chrome and what they do is they give you
the exact tags that a particular video
is using so for example if I go back
here and I look at a video on YouTube
let's just say the machine learning
Basics video I have vid IQ installed on
my Chrome browser so just by clicking on
that vid IQ is going to give me a lot of
information about that video they're
just going to give me an overview of
their particular metrics they're going
to give me some other information
associated with Facebook some engagement
metrics really what I'm interested in is
those keywords so if I scroll down a bit
here I can see the video tags associated
with the machine learning Basics video
so vid IQ is telling me is these
keywords are associated with this video
and not only does it show me what
keywords are associated I can also see
where they rank so for machine learning
Basics this particular video ranks
number one if I go down I can see what
is machine learning and how does it work
I can see it's rank number two here I
can see machine learning algorithms it's
rank number nine so I can get some ideas
of the types of keywords that are being
used as tags for that video further down
I can also see some Channel tags but
really this is the video tags or the
idea place I want to be able to look to
get an idea of the types of keywords
that are associated with the video that
are also ranking or not ranking so
that's another way for you to really get
an understanding of what key wordss to
use at the particular video so
autocomplete you can look at the page
source of a competitor's video or you
can use a Chrome extension in this case
I'm using vid IQ to give me some
information about the video tags for
particular video so according to an
industry study using keywords and video
tags will help you rank well on YouTube
so you have to use keywords and video
tags if you want your video to rank
there's been a lot of studies YouTube is
so popular and videos are so prominent
in today's world where if you have
videos and you're going to upload it's
going to be engaged then associate the
right keywords with those videos so some
important factors when we look at
keywords what we want to do is look at
search volume we want to look at
competition we want to look at relevancy
we want to look at the primary and
secondary keywords that we want to use
so well chosen keywords will help you
rank so we just gave you some ideas on
how to do some keyword research again
those ideas were really to use the
autocomplete on YouTube or Google
they're going to give you some popular
keywords you can look what your
competitors are doing by looking at the
page source and just looking at the
keywords that are aligned with that
video or you can you can use a third
party extension in Chrome in my example
I use vid IQ that gave me the keywords
associated with that video so you have
ways to get the keywords so what we want
to do is we want to make sure we choose
keywords with high search biome they're
going to drive more traffic to your
video however we want to balance it out
with keywords that have low difficulty
and are easier to rank for so you don't
want to choose something very broad
that's just going to be very difficult
to rank for and of course we always want
to go with relevancy so if we're talking
about machine learning Basics then we
want to choose keywords associated with
that and that's where that autocomplete
comes in handy because what Google's
going to do and YouTube's going to do is
give us keywords that are very closely
related to the video that we're trying
to optimize for and so we have a number
of different keywords at our disposal
that are relevant that we can look to
see if they have good volume and low
competition and so the whole idea is we
want to choose a keyword that defines
the nature of the content and then what
we want to do is support that with
secondary keywords so we want keywords
that are highly relevant to the primary
keyword so that's the way to go about
aligning your keywords you want keywords
that are high volume low competition or
relevant and you want to choose that one
keyword that is really what the
content's about and then those secondary
keywords that support the primary so if
you have a machine learning video you
can you could choose your primary
keyword as in this case the machine
learning Basics video so well chosen
keywords help you rank well on YouTube
just like the machine learning Basics so
if I go back to our video our machine
learning Basics video if I just type in
machine learning Basics I'll be able to
pull it up and so here it is if I click
on it I'm going to go to YouTube and so
here I can see this keyword we know
humans Lo from the is well aligned
because it's in the title it's in the
copy and it's aligned as a keyword tag
with the video so we know that that
keyword has good volume low competition
is relevant because that's what the
video is about the basics of machine
learning it's an introduction to machine
learning so instead of poning in on just
introduction of machine learning primary
keyword is machine learning Basics and
then we supported that video with those
secondary keywords what is machine
learning because somebody who doesn't
know what machine learning is probably
going to type in that keyword and then
introdu of machine learning is a good
secondary keyword because it's
explaining the basics of what machine
learning is all about so primary keyword
machine learning basic secondary
keywords what is machine learning and
introduction to machine learning so
that's the whole idea behind choosing
keywords you want that keyword that
really is going to define the content
and then support that with those
secondary keywords so remember when
you're performing your keyword research
choose keywords for your videos that
Google shows on the video results page
so what I mean by that is your video can
get more views if you rank on Google as
well so the whole idea is not
necessarily to be found on YouTube it's
also to be found on Google so if I go
back to Google and I just type in data
science for beginners and I type in
videos then you could see we're ranked
number one so even if you're not looking
at the videos clicking on the videos
link on Google search you can always
just when you do a search what Google's
going to do is also put in the videos
here on part as part of the search
results so what they're going to show
you is the top videos that are ranking
for that particular key word and so we
may not rank overall for data science
for beginners but we're ranked number
one in the videos category and so if
somebody's looking for a video that's
important and you can see here that
these first two are ads so what Google
is doing is they're saying hey this is
so relevant this particular video for
the keyword query data science for
beginners that we're going to show it
above the organic listings even though
it's a video so the whole idea is to be
found on YouTube and Google because
you're increasing your visibility you're
increasing your chances of getting found
on both search platforms so according to
back Linko Google Ranks videos with
keywords like how to tutorials so you
know a lot of the videos that you find
on YouTube are going to be instructional
based and so what Google's doing is
they're saying hey if somebody types in
how to or tutorial or an introduction to
anything that's going to signal to
Google that it's instructional it's
going to help you rank so when you
search for machine learning tutorial or
how to become a machine learning
engineer you're going to get results
related to that because if you look at
these examples we have machine learning
tutorial in our title or how to become a
machine learning engineer so keep that
in mind if you're creating a video and
it's educational in nature you know use
those key terms like how to and
tutorials in the video title because
that will help you rank so let's move
over now to video title so we want to
use our Target keyword in the title of
the video and again we want to make sure
if it's educational to include that
keyword tutorial or how to so for every
video title YouTube has a limit of 100
characters so we really have to pick and
choose really wisely so if we look at
the video that we were focusing on a
couple of minutes ago so machine
learning Basics here we could see under
100 characters we have machine learning
Basics what is machine learning
introduction to machine learning and
then the brand name so that is the title
of this particular video so it takes
into account the primary keyword the
secondary keywords and the title and it
also includes that really that key term
that really Google and YouTube like and
that's what is machine learning so it's
helping us Rank by having our keywords
in the title with that key phrase what
is okay so that's a a good tidbit on
creating a good video title is to align
it with the right keywords your primary
and your secondary and so we want to use
those catchy words and numbers to gain
High click through W just like you would
on the title tag of your web page we
want to do the same with our video title
because the video title is what's going
to show up in search so if I go back to
you know search here we could see you
know data science tutorial data science
for beginners so we want to make sure in
this case you can see data science in 5
minutes so that was purposely done so
that hey I don't have time to watch a
video I only have a couple minutes data
science and 5 minutes okay great I'm
going to click on the video and now I
have an opportunity to watch something
and learn something under 5 minutes so
choosing the right words in your video
title is going to help you get that
clickthrough rate up remember
clickthrough rate is clicks divided by
Impressions and an impression is how
many times your video shows up in the
search results on YouTube or Google so
we want to keep our click the rate high
and in order to do that we want to be
able to write some really good title
tags for our video so use catchy words
like a number or how to or what is cuz
that's going to resonate with people
when they're searching now for the
description what we want to do is we
want to use the target word at the
beginning of the description the title
and the tags itself so if I go back to
my video here machine learning Basics we
know it's in the video title and right
off the bat if I look at the description
of the video here I can see this machine
learning Basics video will help you
understand what is machine learning so
our primary keyword is in the first
sentence right in the introductory of
the description and so that's going to
bode well for optimizing our video the
description length is 5,000 characters
so we have a lot of characters to work
with so if I go back to my video I click
show more we have a lot of characters to
really describe what the video is about
okay there's no shortage no shortage of
including keywords into the content so
you have 5,000 characters go ahead and
see if you can work in natur natur your
keywords but one of the key tips here is
just make sure that first sentence
starts out with that keyword that's a
good tip of course you always want to
make it sound natural as possible you
don't want to stuff it with keywords at
the same time work them in naturally
work in your keywords naturally and then
include hashtags in your description to
help the audience find your video is
easily so if I go back here you know we
want to be able to include hashtags so
hashtags it's like like anything else
you would use on social media it just
signals to the end user hey this is what
the video is all about and if I go ahead
and type in that keyword then it's our
video has a better chance cuz it's
aligned with that hashtag and then
there's Target keywords and LSI keywords
latent semantic indexing keywords we
want to be able to use those keywords as
Target keywords with our video so if you
recall the example I gave a few minutes
ago we used the Facebook as tutorial as
our example here I can see all the
target keywords associated with that
particular video so don't be afraid to
use those LSI related keywords meaning
keywords that are related to the content
use them as Target keywords with the
video so between your LSI keywords
Target keywords and then using our
primary and secondary keyword in the
title tag using our primary and
secondary keyword in the description and
then using hashtags in the description
the combination of all of that if we
chose the right keyword then we should
find that our video will eventually rank
on YouTube so just doing these small
tidbits with our keywords really help
get our video to rank so at the end of
the day we want to be able to use the
tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
looking at our competitors those
extensions like vid IQ the auto complete
to really find our good keywords and
then incorporating those keywords into
you know the title tag the description
as Target keywords hashtags we should
really be off and running with our video
on YouTube let's turn our attention to
creating high quality videos and some of
the best practices around that so along
with everything we mentioned about
choosing the right keywords we always
need to keep in mind that the videos we
create need to be of high quality so the
content itself self in addition to the
keywords is a primary factor in ranking
so in order to have keywords we need to
have content and in order to rank we
need to have you know good content so
let's talk a little bit about creating
content and what's involved with that
and what we really mean by high quality
videos so if you have a video content
that is not informative or relevant to
the topic it won't rank so that's just
common sense so you need to create
content that's align with the topic
obviously and then that way you have
keywords that are align with the content
so but if you have content really isn't
align with the topic then you're not
going to rank no matter how much you've
optimized that video so just keep that
in mind so there's a couple of things we
want to look at here so high quality
content is determined by really two
metrics so we're not sure about how good
our content is and how good of high
quality video we created we want to look
at audience retention and user
engagement so audience retention is
simply the percentage length of your
video that the audience has watched It's
the percentage your audience has watched
so focusing on audience retention is
important for people who want their
videos to rank high so if you want to
rank you need to optimize for the key
words but got to keep in mind content so
content is related to audience retention
and user engagement so audience
retention percentage length your video
of your video that the audience has
watched and for example it can be both
absolute in minutes or percentages so
audience retention can be the average
view duration or percentage of the
audience that watched then we have user
engagement so user engagement are
viewers who are engaged with your
content and so that means they're either
sharing it subscribing commenting or
liking so those are all forms of
Engagement so the percentage users who
watched or how long they watched versus
engagement or in combination with
engagement are two factors for ranking
so let's talk about some tips for
creating highquality videos so we want
to publish longer videos and so what do
we mean behind longer videos so what's
the reason for longer videos let's just
suppose we have two videos one shorter
in length and one longer in length first
video is 15 minutes long the second
video is 7 minutes long so on average if
viewers watch about 40% of both videos
then video x which is 15 minutes long
will have more than twice the watch time
of the video that's 7 minutes long so
remember duration we want you know
people to watch our videos longer so if
the video is longer in length if it's
40% then it's going to have a longer
audience engagement audience retention
so that's one of the reasons you know
from a metric standpoint so even when
viewers watch you know both videos the
time is going to differ so we want to
take into account longer videos for
primarily that reason is because you
know it gives an end user an opportunity
to watch the video longer and then it's
going to help us rank our videos longer
so we talk about watch time so if one
video has higher watch time than the
other watch time is just the number of
views times the average View ation so
another tip is we want to plan our video
script so we want to keep the content
organized my recommendation is you know
create an outline first and once you
create an outline of how the video is
going to flow then start populating with
content and so to me that's how you can
keep the flow organized okay is is
really with an outline starting out with
an outline it's no videos are no
different than say a presentation if
you've done a PowerPoint presentation
you always want to start out doing
an outline and then we want to upload
high resolution videos high resolution
we don't want to create videos that you
know are small resolution like say you
know 400 by 400 resolution or some you
know something really small we want to
create something a very high res so
according to back or link Oak more than
50% of videos on the first page of
YouTube are high definition so high
definition videos of higher quality are
going to be shown on the first page of
YouTube more more often than not so high
resolution videos organizing the content
publishing longer videos are examples of
creating high quality videos we also
want to make sure that content is
relevant to the title so if we're
talking about machine learning Basics
you know obviously the content is going
to be about you know intro to machine
learning or what is machine learning and
then the title should reflect that
content so aligning the title sets the
expectation for the users so when they
see a tittle what is machine learning
then when they watch the video they're
expecting to learn about machine
learning and what it is so if it meets
expectations then the chances are that
person who's watching the video is going
to watch it longer and that means it's
going to fulfill the viewers
requirements and when you align
everything accordingly keywords titles
content then at the end of the day the
view user is going to watch it and the
the more they watch it the higher the
engagement the higher the engagement the
better chance you have to rank some
other tips that you could use to create
high quality videos so we want to be
able to you know use examples to clarify
our content so you know don't be afraid
to go into another screen like I am if I
want to I'm talking about videos jump
into the machine learning Basics video
which I've done throughout this session
I can simply do that by keeping the user
engaged here this video is about machine
learning Basics well the titles align
with the video we made sure that we have
a nice description about what the video
is about and we're aligning the
expectations so not only that I'm
showing you example within the video
itself so we want to use examples
throughout your video to keep the user
engaged it will also help clarify what
you're trying to express in the video
itself so we want to make it visually
appealing so visually appealing means
imagery or examples and the video and
then when we talk about imagery you know
you want to use good images in your
video so use public domain sites that
are available to you like shutter stock
or flat icon I mean there are plenty of
those sites out there so feel free to
use any one of those sites to use high
quality images in your video give more
information to your audience okay giving
maximum relevant information can help
gain more views and so when we talk
about more information again it goes
back back to you know the examples you
use there's no should be no shortage of
examples here description use all 5,000
characters at your disposal imagery we
want to build up as much information as
you can in the video itself to keep the
end user the viewer engaged we also want
to create original content so always
create original content you can
certainly get ideas from YouTube if you
want to create a video about machine
learning see what else has already been
done do searches on YouTube itself but
you know when you going to create a
video yeah you can create another video
about what is machine learning but just
make sure it has your own take on it
you're the subject matter expert when
creating the video create it with your
own original content have high audio
quality and video effects so just like
you see here on this video we have
effects in it and the audio is of high
quality meaning no background noise no
Distortion and we want to be able to
speak clearly in the video so you want
to speak clearly loudly concise just as
I'm trying to do now so that you can
understand what I'm trying to say or
what the viewer's trying to to
understand when they're watching the
video so watching and listening are two
of the components and you want to make
sure both of are high quality avoid
distractions we don't want to pause you
don't want to ramble on a particular
Point too long we want to keep users
engaged so you always want to move from
one point to the other intermix it with
examples those are ways to keep these
users engaged we won't include
transcripts or subtitles for your video
so transcripts is just more content
that's aligned with the video and the
search engin will be able to pick up
that content and help your video rank so
to me that's a key component to creating
a good video is having the necessary
content go along with the video that
outline I referenced earlier in terms of
organization you always want to have a
Content outline so what topics are you
going to cover in the video that's why
you need the outline to point that out
confirm that before you actually start
creating the video okay focus on the
initial 15 seconds so that's key you
know somebody's going to click the play
button of your video and if you don't
catch them in the first 15 seconds then
they're likely going to pause the video
or just go ahead and close it out all
together so you want to be able to
capture somebody's attention right off
the bat and even before they click on
that play button you want to make sure
again you're exceeding expectations that
title is aligned with the content so in
your first 15 seconds it basically needs
to be catchy but also setting the
expectation of what the user is
expecting so in this example here we
want to pay close attention to the first
15 seconds that's when viewers are most
likely to drop off so we can look at
audience retention in YouTube so use the
options above the graph to view absolute
audience retention or relative audience
retention so audience retention is
basically how many views a video
received and the percentage of the total
number of video views and that includes
every moment of the video as a
percentage so we'll show you an example
of what that looks like so here if we go
to the machine learning Basics video we
can look at the audience retention
report and this is since it's been
uploaded the lifetime audience retention
so here we can see a nice graph the
percentage of people who viewed it and
how long they viewed it so in percentage
so here for example I can see you know
43
44% watch the video for at least 2
minutes here I can see
28.6% watch sh for 6 minutes plus so
that's the audience retention it gives
us an idea in terms of percentage how
many people or percentage of people
watch the video at what length so that's
audience retention so we want to keep
that number high at the very initial
stage of the video and we want to keep
it high throughout and that's why you
always want to create high quality
content content using those examples
using imagery making it organized
content not pausing you know going from
one point to the other those are all
best practices to keep the viewer
engaged and then we want to add
resources from well-known sites so
throughout this video we've used back
linkco there are other sources we've
used so if you have a source go ahead
and put it in your video to add
credibility and then we want to use
cards to your videos so this cards is
basically a feature that recommends
relevant videos to your audience so in
addition to machine learning Basics
there could be other videos about
machine learning that we can recommend
or YouTube can recommend to the audience
to set up end screens you want to make
sure that with end screens you can use
relevant videos to your audience towards
the end of your video so you can
recommend relevant videos towards the
end of your video you can also create
playlist so this is a feature that keeps
your audience engaged with relevant
content by Auto playing the next video
so if you enable this feature it's going
to go from one video to another pattern
interr reps keep the audience engaged so
basically it allows your audience to
stay within one video without having any
interruptions involved and so going back
to the did you know audience retention
report helps you analyze how well your
videos are engaging to the audience so
what do we mean by that well if I go
back again to my audience retention
report how engaging was it well I could
see 42% 43% watched it on average of 3
minutes and 21 seconds so to me that's
pretty good of course we always want
100% of the video the video is 7 minutes
long if almost almost half of our
audience saw over half of the video then
I would say that's pretty good people
were engaged so audience retention just
is a good report to start looking at to
help you understand how engaging is my
video and if your video is not engaging
you know you can always go back and edit
it or fix it or tweak it so remember the
average view duration for all videos and
top performing videos listed by all time
we can look at that information as well
in addition we can look at demographics
so we can get an overview of the age
gender and location and we can look at
playback locations report and what the
playback locations report does is it
helps us determine the platforms where
our videos are being streamed from when
within YouTube look at the traffic
sources where did the viewers come from
devices did they look on mobile or
tablet and so there's any doubts you
know if you have any questions please
drop a comment below but especially if
you have any doubts on the metrics so if
we go back into YouTube we can look at
analytics and if we're looking at
analytics we can see more and then this
is going to show us everything we need
to see from device type so if I click on
more I can see my playback location so
this will show me where the video was
watched it was on a watch page or a
channel page I could see the traffic
sources I can see the gender and age so
if I click on the viewer age report I
can see the percentage of views by age
so I can get a lot of
information about my video and how it's
performed who's watched it what they've
done with it where they come from all
the information they need to know and so
it's all within YouTube analytics so
again if you have have any questions
about that you know just drop a comment
below especially if you're new to
YouTube you may have some questions but
just know that every video you publish
to YouTube high quality aligned with
your keywords you're going to be able to
view the metrics by looking at YouTube
analytics so let's talk about the
importance of user engagement so
engagement is as we mentioned important
because basically we can't rank without
engagement our videos won't rank unless
we have engagement so that's why it's
important so engagement is somebody
liking the video commenting sharing it
or subscribing each one of these is
important to ranking so yes you need to
line keywords yes you need to have high
quality content so when you do both of
those and you upload your video then
it's up to the viewer and so the hard
work that you put out for the video is
hopefully going to pay dividends with
engagement so you want people to do one
of these four okay so let's talk about
what that means so how do I get
engagement so we already talked about
creating engaging content so there are a
lot of tips to creating engaging content
and so according to wordstream if your
content is entertaining then over 3/4 of
the users are going to share it so
that's part of keeping uh uh users
engaged is keeping it entertaining is
part of getting a high quality video so
remember on that high quality video when
we say entertaining the audio portion
has a lot to do with it examples has a
lot to do with it quality of the video
itself has a lot to do with it so a lot
of components so all those components on
a high quality video are going to lead
to engagement so parts of what you could
do in your videos is conduct a quiz so
meaning the quiz itself is a way to keep
people engaged in your video so that'll
also help you get some more comments so
according to Back linku video comments
help in ranking your video higher so
just as I mentioned in the last segment
about you YouTube analytics and all the
different reports available on YouTube
hey if you have questions on those just
go ahead and add a comment so that's a
way to entice your users or your viewers
to add comments is if they have
questions because you know with videos
you're not going to be able to cover
every detail or every minute detail
about a particular topic you can only
cover in some cases the topic at a high
level so users are going to have
comments or questions naturally and so
the comment section is a good way to
remind viewers hey if you have a
question or comment go ahead and put in
the comment section because that will
lend to engagement as well so we want to
add sources from high quality websites
that'll help with engagement okay use
humor in your video we want to be able
to basically you know make it human
based we don't want to be robots so we
want to be able to sound like you know
we know what we're talking about but at
the same time talk to the viewer not
necessarily at the viewer or looking the
other way and just going through the
motions so adding humor adding
personality never hurts at the end of
the day we are all human adding that
clear call to action at the end of the
video will also lead to engagement so if
we win the video with hey leave your
comments on this video or hey feel free
to to share this video with colleagues
who are interested then that's a call to
action that's likely going to lead to
more engagement reply to your comments
as well so if you have comments we
always want to reply to them likely
those comments are going to be questions
because again as I mention even in this
video about how to rank your videos on
YouTube okay there's a lot of
information and a lot of information
sometimes doesn't get covered in its
entirety and so we want to make sure
that if we miss something cuz we're only
human that we're able to respond in the
form of an answer to a question that
somebody leaves in the comment section
so more comments also lead to higher
rankings because it's engagement so when
you're getting high engagement and your
video starts to rank well you know
you're going to start feeling really
good and what is that going to do okay
that feel good is going to lead to
confidence which in turn is going to
probably lead to more videos and that's
exactly we do is simply learn we're in
the education business but we're in it
to not only educate but making sure that
our videos are shown to as many people
as possible so that we can educate as
many people as possible so it's all it's
contagious so getting ranked feels good
and then once you get ranked then you
know you probably have good engagement
okay let's talk about how to promote
your content so once you've done all the
hard work getting your video done high
quality content optimized with keywords
and then published to YouTube we want to
let everybody in the world know about it
right so we want to promote it've done
all the work we want to promote it now
so is it necessary to promote it I would
say yes because once your video is
published you want to reach out you want
to reach out to your audience not
necessarily on YouTube but on different
platforms so if you're active on
Facebook or Twitter that's an
opportunity for you to post or tweet
something about the new video so when we
say different platforms I am talking
about you know social media platforms so
depends on what you're active on so if
you're active on Facebook yeah go ahead
and post something you're active on
Twitter go ahead and tweet something it
could be you know on LinkedIn group if
you're part of a LinkedIn group about
you know machine learning then go ahead
and post something to that group to
promote the video so that's going to
help Drive traffic to the video and then
help with engagement so we want to
engage with our audience on those social
media sites it really depends on what
you're active on so if you have a large
following on Twitter then go ahead and
you know share that YouTube video link
on Twitter with the Tweet that's going
to drive traffic from Twitter to YouTube
Remember You know you're going to be
able to see audience engagement or
retention by getting people to watch the
video so you're going to be able to see
right away by promoting the video and
driving traffic to the video how
engaging it is remember the more people
you have watched the video the more
engaging it becomes the better it's
going to rank so it's an ecosystem and
promoting your content is part of that
ecosystem so it all starts with social
media if you're active on whatever
platform that is go ahead and promote it
so you can also look at you know content
based social media sites or social media
content based platforms like Reddit or
flicker for example so you can
participate in a form discussion on
Reddit so in this example here it's
about machine learning so we want to be
able to post something about machine
learning with the link to our video so
we can also go to content based sites
that are Q&A uh related like Kora for
example Kora is a really good site where
you know if you go there post
information about machine learning or
the basics of machine learning with the
link back to the video it's going to
help because not only is it going to
drive traffic but it's going to signal
to Google hey a lot of traffic coming
from Kora this is going to bode well for
this video in terms of ranking so here's
an example you know if you find a
question question that you can post on
core then you're going to get people to
click on your video and respond
accordingly on core or you can act as
the person responding to a question
that's already there so if somebody
already asked a question about what is
machine learning you can respond with
your video as the answer so you can just
simply embed your video URL as part of
your answer that'll help Drive traffic
so you can also create your own blog and
embed your vide so in the case of
machine learning here we have an example
machine learning what is it why it
matters so this goes nicely with the
video so here you can see the person the
author of this blog went ahead and
embedded the relevant video in the blog
post so they play off one another nicely
you can also opt in for influencer
markeing meaning hey you can reach out
to somebody in this example here you
know Katie nuggets posted information
about machine learning so in this case
why choose machine learning as a career
well they got information and then what
did they do they went ahead and embedded
the video about machine learning Basics
and so working with you know influencers
in a particular category or topic will
help Drive traffic to the video you can
also create a YouTube playlist so
playlists tend to rank high in YouTube
searches so if you find yourself doing a
lot of videos well go ahead and you know
go to your channel and simply in your
channel you can go ahead and create
playlist so when you create playlist
basically what you're doing is you're
organizing the content into different
playlists no different than say the
music you have set up on your you know
your iPhone or iPad or or iPod whatever
it is you're using so you're just
creating different videos in a
particular category and it YouTube likes
it it's organized it's going to help you
get your videos found quicker and easier
on YouTube Itself by putting your videos
in a playlist so here you could see we
we have entire playlist on machine
learning trending Technologies cloud
computing Big Data digital marketing
project management so a lot of different
playlists very organized if somebody
goes to the channel they going to be
able to go to the playlist that's
interesting to them and see all the
videos there so it allows not only the
end user to find what they're looking
for but it's good for YouTube because
YouTube likes those playlists so we want
to engage our Audience by posting your
video link on a Community page so you
can do that within YouTube and you can
prefer to link your YouTube channel in
your email so you can also do that so
for example if I go back to YouTube and
I'm looking at a YouTube video you know
I can always Click Share so here I'm
going to get a particular URL that's
associated with the video and I can just
embed that so I can embed the whole
thing in my email I can embed it on a
web page or a blog post so just by
clicking share I can also immediately
share it onto the social media platforms
that we mentioned Facebook LinkedIn
Reddit okay Tumblr so there's a lot of
ways to embed the video not just on a
blog post or influencer blog post but in
our email and on social media as well so
here's an example of what we can do with
a YouTube discussion so we can also
bookmark the video on a popular
bookmarking site you know like stumbled
upon or Reddit or you know there's lots
of other ones out there so there's
plenty of sites that you'll be able to
go to and bookmark that content so that
people can find it and you can always
opt for backlinks so that means that hey
if there's a blogger out there that
blogs about machine learning you can
always you know ask that blogger to
create a link back to the video and you
could reciprocate do the same thing so
that helps increase the authority of the
video so there's a lot of things you can
do to promote your video so let's do a a
quick review on everything we talked
about in terms of ranking your video on
YouTube it all starts with the keywords
so we want to identify a list of
keywords that are relevant to the video
so we can use tools to choose our
keywords but remember we want to choose
keywords that have high volume and low
competition and so where can we go to
choose those keywords well we can use
the autocomplete on YouTube we could
check out our own competitors videos or
you know we could use vid IQ or tube
budy or any of these extensions in
Chrome to help us look at the keywords
that are tagged with a particular video
so remember we want to have a primary
keyword that's aligned with the content
then we want to choose LSI keywords as
our secondary keyword or keywords that
are related to the primary keyword so we
want to create high retention videos
meaning that first 15 seconds are the
most important but throughout the video
we want to use examples we want to keep
it interacting by adding quizzes imagery
good audio good video quality so we want
to focus on the user experience and we
also want to optimize our video content
what do that mean well those keywords
that we chose we want to use them in the
title we want to use them in the
description we want to use them as
hashtags we want to use them and tag
them with the video themselves so we can
add keywords to our metat tag okay we
don't want to overdo it but we want to
add a handful of keywords that are
associated with the video so we want to
be able to write I catchy video titled
and descriptions so remember use some of
those key phrases like a number or a
question like what is machine learning
so we want to use relevant meta tags for
the videos and we want to use popular
YouTube tags so we want to be able to
tag our videos appropriately so watch
the length of your meta tags so there
are lengths involved remember keywords
at the beginning of of the title Target
keywords in the title description and
tags we want to use interesting
thumbnails to increase our click the
rate ensure that thumbnails are relevant
meaning when I say thumbnails I mean the
actual title tag itself or The Meta
description we want to use highres
videos we want to create you know videos
with good high audio quality don't be
afraid to put in video effects like some
animation don't be afraid to use
examples and then you know obviously
look at the draft of the video before
you publish it so does your video follow
an outline is it organized so these are
all the things to take into account and
there's there's plenty more you can do
you know you remember once you create
and optimize that video you want to
promote it you want to make sure that
you're sharing it on social media you
create a complimentary blog you know
generate backlinks from say other blog
posts so there are lots of things you
can do to promote your video so before
you promote it you want to organize the
content create good quality content
content align it with keywords once you
publish it you know keep organizing it
by creating this playlist and then reach
out on social reach out on different
communities related to the topic and all
those things combined will help you to
get your YouTube video ranked we're
going to talk about how to increase
YouTube subscribers so with YouTube It's
All About subscribers the number of
subscribers you have on YouTube it's
just one of the key metrics to measure
success so gaining more subscribers can
help you achieve more view counts on
your YouTube videos so it's all about
how to get subscribers and today we're
going to talk about how to get more
subscribers and before we begin let's
just show you what we did at simply
learn so if we look at the past 365 days
on our YouTube channel you can see we
started here back in uh if we look back
at March 9th 2018 we had 208 and you
could see just over the course of the
year it kept creeping up creeping up
creeping up and creeping up we've gained
you know a significant number of
subscribers over the last year and
what's our secret well it's posting
videos so you can see we've posted a
number of videos over the course of the
year and then our subscribers have gone
basically
165% over the last year so you can see
it's part of it is about posting videos
because when you post videos you have
people who can watch those videos when
you have people watch those videos you
can have engagement and when you have
engagement you have shares and people
who like it and then other people who
see it so it's kind of a halo effect so
to speak so getting subscribers takes a
lot more than just posting videos and
today we're going to talk about some
tips to help you increase those
subscriptions and so let's start out
with some of those tips we're going to
start with creating engagement in
informative content so engaging in
informative content that's where we're
going to start talking today about how
to increase subscriptions then we're
going to talk about publishing videos
frequently so it's simply learn you
could see the past 365 days we were
consistent in publishing videos
consistently throughout the month and
the weeks so another tip we're going to
talk about is how to optimize your
YouTube videos so there's a lot that
goes into optimization but this is a key
key tip to pay attention to because when
you comes to posting publishing videos
on YouTube you need to align certain
things like keywords and content and
metadata so optimize on our videos we're
going to talk a lot about that then
we're going to talk about optimizing the
YouTube channel so there's some tips and
tricks here you want to do to optimize
your YouTube channel producing high
quality videos we're going to talk about
that adding a subscriber Watermark to
your videos okay that's another tip
we're going to mention today engage with
our audience okay that's what we want to
do we want to engage with our audience
that's a really key tip and we're saving
the best for last promote your videos in
different platforms so all of these tips
we're going to talk about today so let's
get started and talk about create
engaging informative content so that's
the first place we want to start okay so
create engaging and informative content
so if we want to gain more subscribers
on our Channel we have to create highly
engaged and informative content why
because not our audience is not going to
pay attention and they're not going to
watch the video and then then the
engagement is not going to be high and
they're not going to share the video and
they're not going to tell their friends
are like it and so this is where it all
starts you have to be able to plan your
content and not only planning your
content but you got to create it so it's
engaging and informative so how do you
do that well let's talk about that so
the first thing is you have to know your
audience okay so when you create a video
who you creating the video for I mean
that's where it all starts so when
you're creating your content you're
creating your content for your audience
you're not creating it for the entire
world now we know on YouTube there's a
lot of cute videos about kittens and
jokes and you know people playing games
and you know everybody likes positive
things on YouTube but you know when
we're talking about a specific topic you
know we really have to hone in on a
target audience and so if you know who
your audience is then you can really
hone in on your content okay so that's
the first thing ask yourself who is your
audience and then build your content
around that specific audience don't
build it just for the Mass general
population because it's not going to be
engaging and informative so that's the
first place to start then you want to
engage that audience with relevant
content so if you know your audience and
depending on the topic you want to make
sure that whatever the topic is the
content matches the topic don't Veer off
course if you Veer off course you're not
going to engage your viewers your
viewers are coming to watch the video
for specific reason the reason is the
topic okay so if they're your target
audience and they want to watch the
video that's a a specific topic then the
content has to align so plan your video
script so if you know who your audience
is and you know you want to engage them
with relevant content go ahead and plan
the script out so what I normally do is
you know have an outline and then once I
have the outline then I go ahead and
create my slides if I will or my topics
points I want to talk about and then I
write out those points I want to make
sure I get all my points in and that's
what you should be doing you want to
plan it ahead of time so that you can
get all all your relevant points across
that's what makes a video informative
okay you want to ensure to give maximum
information to your audience so the key
here is maximum information so you don't
want to overload the audience but then
again you don't want to cut out
information so you want to make sure
that when you're planning your script
and you're writing the outline that
you're making sure you include all your
points that you want to get across once
you include those points then go ahead
and you know write your script and make
sure all the information for all those
points are in the script that's how
you're going to ensure you give maximum
information but you don't want to overdo
it so if you feel like it's too much
information it probably is too much
information back off a little use the
information to create another video so
it's all about knowing your audience so
all of these points play against one
another so be clear and use more
examples in your content just like we're
doing here okay just like at the
beginning of the session I showed you an
example of Simply learn subscribers over
the past 3 65 days and so that's what we
want to do we want to be clear but use
examples to punctuate the content or the
point we're trying to get across so we
want to include sources from high
quality sites so if you're going to use
examples make sure they're from relevant
high quality sites and when I mean high
quality meaning does your audience know
who that source is or that site if it's
really specific and your audience may
not know then it's probably not high
quality so just keep that in mind always
play to your audience so you want to
start your video with an interesting
hook so again I go back to this example
if you're still watching this then the
hook worked we showed you our
subscriptions we showed you how we grew
over the course of a year you could see
our growth and part of it was posting a
lot of videos with relevant and
informative content and so you see how
we did it so you're paying attention you
want to know how to do it and so part of
what we did is exactly what I'm telling
you now we know who our audience is we
plan out our scripts we use good
examples and we start our videos with
interesting hooks now when we do our
videos we also create original content
so that goes back to planning your
script okay you always want to you know
come across as original and informative
when you do that you're going to be
engaging but if you're leveraging
somebody else's content then the
engaging part may not resonate because
it's not your content to begin with so
always always always use original
content Okay so keep the content flow
organized so again that goes back to an
outline you know feel free to change up
the outline so the flow makes sense add
visuals to your content and make it
appealing always include images to me if
you can use images in your videos and
play off the video or the images then
it's just going to flow and make it a
little bit more engaging and appealing
meaning the content so visuals help
guide and Aid in the points you're
trying to make so don't make it so text
Heavy you know except uate it balance it
with some images use Simple language and
crisp sentences meaning don't chose
jargon don't come across and talk above
your audience you always want to talk to
your audience and talk in a language
that they're going to understand so it
goes back to 0 one if you know who your
audience is you're talking to them as if
they're right in front of you and not
you're above them or they're below you
you want to talk at them so add cards
end screens and pattern interrupts to
engage your audience and so YouTube
cards are just interactive panels that
slide in and out when a video is playing
so it encourages interaction by the
viewer okay so you can add up to five
cards which include images text or
clickable links so feel free to play
around with some of these features that
YouTube has to offer to make your
content more engaging so tip two publish
videos frequently so creating and
uploading videos consistently will help
you increase your YouTube subscribers so
suppose you haven't published videos for
more than say a month or two months it's
likely that that audience not going to
subscribe to your channel so think about
YouTube videos as a popular TV program
that comes on once a week when a new
episode comes on based on the regular
schedule it's consistency and that
consistency is what helps your users
stay engaged so for example if I go back
to our YouTube channel you know what
helped us gain subscribers was our
consistency in publishing videos you
could see we were consistent in
publishing a couple of videos a week
every couple of weeks and so this helps
users stay engaged they know when the
video is coming out they know that
simply learn is good for two three four
videos a month and the great thing about
publishing videos is that when somebody
does subscribe to your channel they're
going to get a notification or YouTube
has an option where they can get a
notification via email so I subscribe to
Simply learns Channel I subscribe to
other channels like Google analytics for
example so anytime Google analytics
publishes a video I get an email that
says Hey Google analytics YouTube
channel just published a video and the
great thing is I'm checking my email and
I'm getting this notification in Gmail
so guess what I can watch the video
right then and there just by clicking on
the link in the email I don't even have
to go to the channel but knowing that if
you publish consistently and somebody
does get the email once a week then it's
more likely they're going to engage
especially if the content is original
engaging and informative so frequent
video publishing equals more
subscriptions so according to Social
Media examiner YouTube channels that
publish videos more than once a week are
performing much better so if you can
afford to publish more videos more than
once a week the chances of you gaining
subscribers quicker are going to be
greater so keeping a fixed frequency can
help you quickly gain more subscribers
posting videos is like almost like
blogging I always say start small if you
can do one blog post a month and then
once you get in a routine then you can
ramp up the frequency so from one blog
post you could do two a month then four
times a month then once a week or twice
a week same with the YouTube videos you
want to get into a rhythm you know start
with once a month and ramp it up okay
you'll find that the more you ramp it up
the more subscribers you're going to get
so tip three optimize your YouTube video
so optimizing your videos will help your
content rank higher on YouTube so this
is a give must it's not a given it's a
must you must optimize your videos if
you want people to see them of course if
you don't optimize people aren't going
to see them then people aren't going to
engage and and then not subscribe so
it's just kind of a snowball effect so
this is an important tip so I mentioned
it at the beginning when we were going
over all the items we're going to
discuss this is the one item that is a
must and a given to some degree because
if you don't optimize your videos they
just not going to be found so you need
that audience to watch your video so
audiences who tend to interact more with
your content have more chance to
subscribe to your channel but they're
not going to subscribe if they don't
even watch your video so there is a
snowball effect in play here if we don't
optimize your videos so okay Rob what
are some of the tips to optimize your
YouTube video well let's go through some
of the tip so to ensure your videos
reaches the relevant audience on YouTube
you need to optimize the title
description in the video tag okay Rob
what do you mean by title description
and video tag so let's take a look at
that so when you actually create your
YouTube video you're going to have an
opportunity to put in a title you're
going to have an opportunity to put in a
description and you're going to have an
opportunity to add text so those are the
three key areas okay so once you put in
that what it looks like on the front end
is this so if I go back to YouTube and
here you can see another video that we
did about a month ago you could see what
is SEO so if that's our topic that's our
title uh or of the content of the video
then the title of the video is going to
be what is SEO and you can see we also
added in some other content for the
title so what is SEO and how does it
work SEO tutorial for beginners and then
our brand name so we have some content
to work with for the title okay and then
the description we we have a lot of
characters to work with description so
use as much as you can here to describe
what the video is about here you can see
we did that and so it's always good to
include this information okay and then
you can see we have tags up here seo seo
tutorial for beginners digital marketing
so we put in the necessary information
here on this video to help us rank
because if we don't optimize it we're
not going to rank and so you can see we
just put a lot of relevant content
around the description around the title
and around those tags by doing so we're
able to optimize this video and get
found so that's just an example three of
the things you can do to help optimize
your YouTube video so if you want to
watch more on how to optimize metatags
then I suggest maybe watching the other
video we did on the subject how to rank
YouTube videos so this goes into more
detail about how to optimize the title
The Meta description and The Meta tags
but those are three quick fields or
areas that you can use to optimize your
video so just something to keep in mind
write a long description with keywords
timestamps and links so what I mean by
timestamps but timestamp an audience can
choose the section of the video that
they want to look for and then links
prefer to include relevant Links of your
other videos so those are just some
additional tips to help keep your
content engaging so remember when your
content is engaging then people are
going to like it people going to share
it and watch it later so upload a
captivating thumbnail okay so you want
to include a thumbnail that's going to
grab people's attention you want to
upload a transcript of the video so that
goes back to when you're creating your
content when you write your original
content you want to keep a transcript of
the content of the video so that you can
upload that as well and then add a start
screen and end screen to your YouTube
videos so that way you know when
somebody plays the video they're going
to see it what it looks like up front
and then the way you finish it they're
going to see an end screen at the end
and so you just don't want to keep it
dark and black and non-descriptive so
according to back Linko using an exact
keyword in your video title can help you
with rankings so high ranking more views
more views more subscribers so that's
what I've been saying all along you need
to get these videos optimized so again
use an exact keyword in your video title
so let's go back again to that video I
just showed you a couple minutes ago
what is SEO so here we started out with
a question what is SEO that's the name
of the title that's one our exact title
of the video that's our exact keyword
okay so what is SEO and how does it work
and then SEO tutorial for beginners so
what is SEO is our exact keyword and
that's part of the video that's the
content of the video that's in the title
and we use it throughout the description
as well so using that exact keyword in
your video title can help with the
ranking so whatever your topic is your
title of the video or the topic of the
video included in the title so back
Linko also mentions that there is a
moderate correlation between a Channel's
total subscribers and rankings and so
for some of you this may be common sense
it's just like organic search if you're
not ranking you're not going to get
traffic on YouTube if you're not ranking
you're not going to get eyeballs on your
videos and you're not going to get
subscribers so higher rankings can help
you to get more subscribers but you
can't get those rankings unless you
optimize and so again just for the sake
of Simplicity going back focus in on
your title make sure your title matches
the title of the video itself when you
publishing your description use all the
amount of content available to you so
you can see this entire description has
a lot of content maximize the content
and then use text using those three
Fields those three areas can help you
optimize your video and gain the
necessary ranking you need to get
viewers which will turn into subscribers
so tip four optimize your YouTube
channel so we just talked about
optimizing our videos now we're going to
turn our attention to our YouTube
channel so one of the easiest ways to
ask your views to subscribe to your
channel is really by creating a good not
even a good a great YouTube channel
trailer you also want to add Channel
keywords a description and some good
artwork and then having sections and
playlists to keep your videos organized
these are are all good tips to creating
a good YouTube channel so let's talk
about some of these these tips here so
we want to give your audience a preview
what your channel is offering so this is
by hooking your audience with a trailer
so you can create a a trailer to you
know just give your audience an idea of
who you are as a brand what kind of
videos you're going to be posting and
give them a kind of a taste of what the
future videos are going to be like okay
you can even tell them your release
schedule in the trailer so you can start
out by saying hey hey guys we're new to
this we're going to be posting one video
a month but as we get rolling maybe two
per month and you know one per week you
know just being honest and open and
talking to your audience and get them
excited about future videos that's what
the trailer is all about so you also
want to keep it that the channel
description short interesting so in your
channel you want to have a description
of what the Channel's all about what
kind of videos are you going to be
posting so in addition to the trailer
you want to write something short and
interesting then we want to use keywords
in our Channel description just like in
the videos with what is SEO we included
what is SEO in the title we included you
know what is SEO in the description and
so we want to be true to what our
channel is so pick keywords not only
include those keywords in the videos but
include them in the channel description
pay attention to the first 100 to 150
characters of your channel description
because that's what's shown next your
channel on the search results so for
example here you could see we have a
description here simply learn is one of
the world's leading certification
training providers we partner with
companies and individuals to address and
so you could see those characters 100 to
150 are what shows up in the channel
description when somebody's trying to
understand hey simply learn just
uploaded this video who is simply learn
so you want to write short interesting
Channel description so that when
somebody's first introduced to your
video they could see what your Brand's
all about so and your description with
an appropriate call to action so short
interesting good call to action at the
end of the video a good call to action
would be hey check out our next video or
check out our latest video something
that's going to gauge somebody and get
them to watch one of your videos so you
want to pick interesting Channel Arts so
let's turn our attention to the simply
learn Channel page and here you can see
we recently had reached a milestone so
recently reached the 200,000k
subscribers so 200,000 subscribers is a
big achievement for simply learn we went
ahead and updated our channel art and
I'm sure when we reach 500k we'll update
the artwork then too but the point is
you want to keep your channel art kind
of interesting hip and cool and feel
free to change it out every once in a
while so you have that option in YouTube

so so some other tips to go with that
channel art in description is a profile
picture relevant to your brand so you
always want to maybe put a the the
company logo up there okay so here you
can see we have the company logo add
accurate relevant Channel keywords so if

playlist is totally up to you but I
would certainly create a playlist for
different sections so depending on your
product your services think about how
you want to organize don't just stick
all your videos in one playlist then
optimize the playlist titles and
descriptions for search rankings so just
like the videos themselves just like the
channel description you have an
opportunity to optimize the playlist
titles and descriptions so be very keen
on aligning the right keyword with the
playlist title so here you can see
programming language tutorials project
management tutorials digital marketing
tutorials so we're very clear on how we
go about choosing our titles cuz we want
to optimize those playlist titles okay
we can rearrange our videos in a
playlist so we want to rearrange the
videos in a way that we're maybe putting
the freshest the most newest the video
that's been published last first so
almost in descending order if you will
so we want our users to see what video
has the latest in that particular
playlist so they're seeing the most
recent first but you can rearrange your
videos any way you want feel free to
play around with it of course you can
also take the video that's the most
popular and put that up front so people
could see that first vice versa you
could take a video that maybe hasn't
gotten a lot of views or isn't ranked
particularly how High maybe put that
video up so it can get some views and
some shares and likes so how you
rearrange your videos is totally up to
you just has some rationale behind that
so choose a playlist thumbnail from a
top performing video so for example if I
go back to our YouTube page you can see
the top performing videos here you know
for example this one we got a nice
thumbnail here what is machine learning
so if I click on that most popular
videos so 3,000 likes on this video a
lot of views 250,000 plus views so have
a thumbnail to go along with that
particular video so according to
backlinko YouTube SEO ranking Factor
study discovered that channel keywords
have a small yet significant correlation
with Higher YouTube search rankings so
Channel keywords so when you're
optimizing your channel and you want to
include keywords start with your
description so if I go back to our
Channel okay if I go back about us make
sure your description has those relevant
keywords in it that's where it all
starts so in case you have any doubts if
you're not sure about everything we
talked about on optimizing the channel
go ahead and drop a comment below
because we do respond to every comment
that gets posted on our videos so if
you're not sure how to go about
optimizing your channel when you say
line key words with the channel what
does that really mean so if you want
some clarity on that go ahead and drop
as a Channel if you're not sure about
the trailer video drop us a comment
we're more than happy to expand upon the
explanation of how to best optimize your
channel okay tip number five produce
high quality videos so we need to get in
the habit of producing high quality
videos because viewers don't prefer to
watch videos that have poor audio and
video quality it's just that simple you
need to know what it takes to produce
high quality videos If you don't you're
just going to discredit you're not going
to come across as relevant you're not
going to come across as qualified
professional there's a lot of things
attached to poor quality videos so we
need to create high quality videos for
the end user so let's talk about some
ways in which you can create high
quality videos and so the first is to
avoid any noise in the background so you
want to have a nice quiet atmosphere no
distractions so people can hear you
clearly and only you clearly you want to
use good audio recording equipment
there's plenty of options available on
the internet usually I would recommend
going with something paid not overly
expensive because you get what you pay
for so if you use something free it
might not be of good quality and you
might not have all the features and
bells and whistles with a free option so
you know use good audio recording
equipment again it could be online or it
could be some software just make sure
that you're able to to produce good high
quality video and audio so when you do
purchase that audio recording equipment
you want to have something similar to an
input volume meter that way you can see
whether your audio is coming across or
not so if you're not seeing green lights
then your audio is not coming across if
it's red it might be distorted and so
you want something that's going to
signify that you're really pushing out
good quality audio you want to create
your videos in 1080 pixel size okay
that's HD and so you want to have at
least minimum 1080 so anything less than
that it's probably going to come across
as not so good maybe staticky blurry not
professional not highdef so you want to
create a highdef video and 1080 is about
the minimum you want to go and then you
want to plan your video script before
filming so goes back to some of the
other points I made earlier you always
want to have a video script available so
you know what you're saying when you're
recording your audio that way you're not
doing something on the Fly then you want
to use good lighting for video recording
so you don't want to be in a dark place
you want some nice lighting so your
video comes across well lit people could
see you they're not struggling to strain
their eyes on what it is you're trying
to show and appear because of poor
lighting again it just comes across as
professional so if you can you know
shoot a highdea video with good audio
speaking clearly having a professional
script with some good lighting then
people are going to take you serious and
they're going to start to listen and
engage and and see the video as good
quality and very relevant and
informative and share it so use slow
motion and jump Cuts wisely so there's
some features you could do with your
video you using slow motion and jump
cuts are some of the features you can
use to accentuate your points then set
up a green background for recording
again this is for you know making sure
that the video part of it comes across
in good quality quity then stabilize
your video recordings with a tripod that
way you're not moving your video camera
all around and and again it's coming
across the shaky and poor quality shoot
horizontal videos you don't want to go
vertical it tends to cut the screen so
you want to stay horizontal so that
people can see everything that should be
included in the video okay you want to
capture a wider shot using a clipon lens
again a good feature good tip to use use
that wider shot okay so you can do that
using a clip on lens and then choose
good video editing software I can't
State this enough because you're putting
all this time and effort into a video
you need to be able to edit it to cut
out you know some of the things you
didn't want to say or maybe some poor
quality or or you know you just want to
have a smooth professional output for
your video and so you got to have good
video editing software there's plenty of
options available on the internet again
I would go with something low cost but
paid usually free isn't exactly the way
you want to go if you're trying to
create a high dep good quality video and
at the very least review your work
before publishing I just said it a
minute ago I'll say it again you want to
be able to have a really professional
video and high depth when you have a
good professional video and high depth
with good audio horizontal shots you
know nice green background image nice
well lit it's going to come across as
professional and if you have a
professional video then people are going
to take you seriously they're going to
see you as a professional and then share
or subscribe and like and then they're
going to watch more videos and and
that's how you start to build up a
reputation as being a very professional
organization so just following these
simple tips I'm producing high quality
videos so you want to review your work
because if you don't you put all that
effort into it and then you're going to
realize hey your video is low quality
and then you're going to have to do it
all over again so follow these tips get
a high quality video and and you should
be on your way to ranking in fact
according to backlinko YouTube
preferably ranks HD videos so you got to
have that 1080 uh pixel size that way
you know your video is going to come
across crisp and clear and YouTube
prefers that tip six add a subscriber
Watermark to your videos so this is a
great feature in YouTube so it's a
feature that allows you to add a
watermark that can be shown on all your
videos the reason why you want that
Watermark because you want to keep
reminding your audience to subscribe to
your Channel The Watermark can be
whatever you want but normally it's
going to be some type of logo or brand
and a call to action and so how do you
add a watermark to your video well you
log into your YouTube account it's it's
pretty simple at the top right corner
you're going to select your creator
Studio icon and then you're going to go
to channel select branding and then add
a watermark to your video so if we look
at that in YouTube so here Creator
Studio on the left side navigation I'm
just going to click Channel then I'm
going to click branding and then once
you click branding you have the ability
to add your watermark and then you can
add it to the entire video at the end of
the video at a specific start time and
then just click update and that's pretty
much it so you want to be able to add
this so that you can brand your videos
with an image and then add that CTA so
this is a good good feature for YouTube
it allows you to be consistent with all
your videos by branding and adding that
call to action tip seven engage with
your audience so you want to be able to
interact with your audience as much as
possible just because it's the video and
you can't see people doesn't mean you
can't engage with them so when you
interact with your viewers especially
when you interact with them immediately
there's gratification you know everybody
likes to be responded to nobody likes to
be ignored and so when somebody is
responded to there's a higher chance
that that your viewers are likely to
going to become customers it's just
customer service is how you really want
to look at this okay so when you engage
you're creating a service for your
customers so here's some tips on how to
engage with your audience so first is at
the end of every video convey a thank
you message to your viewers you know
thank you for spending the time at every
busy day to watch this video you know
some of our videos go an hour plus long
and so when somebody's taking an hour to
watch a video it's only the least you
can do is thank them now you can thank
them and give them some information
about where to go for more information
CU if they watch the whole video they're
already engaged and they're probably
going to want to learn more so you
always want to follow up the thank you
with where to go for more information
just like our videos always convey at
the end okay you always want to ask your
audience for their feedback or ideas on
the video so with YouTube there's a
comment section and you always want to
encourage comments so comments can be in
the form of feedback so as you're
watching this video feel free to leave
feedback on other ways to engage with
your audience or some other tips to
increase your subscribers on YouTube so
we're always looking for those ideas we
want to keep it engaging so somebody may
have some other ideas that we didn't
think about and so we always appreciate
that from our audience so we very much
appreciate the feedback that our
audience gives us so not all the
feedback is always going to be positive
some of the feedback could be less than
positive or even negative there could be
mistakes so the idea behind getting
feedback is you want to look at it you
want to read it and you want to react to
it you want to react to it positively in
the form of you know what thank you for
the feedback and looking at the feedback
weighing it and incorporating the
feedback so you don't always want to
make the same mistake twice in a video
so if there's something definitely wrong
with the video that we're doing for
example and somebody looked at it and
gave us feedback on it we'd certainly
definitely take a deep look into that
and try not to do the same mistake twice
because likely that user is going to
watch the video again so you always want
to learn from your mistakes okay and you
want to turn those mistakes or turn
those comments into future videos okay
so create videos based on your
commenter's request the audience is
giving us feedback we should take that
as positive and sometimes that's
creative sometimes those ideas for more
videos okay you always want to ask
questions to your audience and reward
excellent comments Cent so we try to ask
questions in our videos and when users
respond with the answer if there's an
excellent comment or excellent answer
you know we can reward them you know
reward them in the form of say some type
of gift card or gift certificate or
promotion or or something there's always
some way to incentivize somebody who
provides excellent feedback you can
always give Emoji Hearts there's so many
emojis out there that you can use emojis
just to engage with your audience based
on the the feedback that they're giving
the point is if your audience has taking
the time to give feedback you always
want to respond to it and you want to
respond to a positive so emojis tend to
have a positive connotation to them and
so responding with an emoji especially
to a favorite comment goes a long way so
you can reward your community both on
and off YouTube for their engagement and
support and that's just being creative
you can reward in many ways many ways
not necessarily monetarily but by
recognition you can do promotions you
could do something fun there's always
ways to reward and prefer to host live
streams and interact with your audience
so you don't always have to do a
pre-recorded video there certainly
YouTube has them other platforms like
Facebook have them Instagram so you can
certainly reach out to your audience
with a live stream and that's talking
directly to your audience right there in
the flesh so when you can have an
opportunity to talk to your audience and
engage with them that's always going to
work because they can see personality
they can see what you're all about and
there's two-way conversation and so that
will lend to more of a you know
relationship so to speak with your
audience so you want to create videos
for subscribers and subscribers can get
impressed when a channel dedicates a
video for them so you know take the time
out to create a video just for your
subscribers subscribers are the ones who
are most likely going to engage with you
okay they're your loyal fan base so if
you create something for them that's a
form of a reward so you can Captivate
your viewers by uploading interesting
YouTube stories as well you can also
hear from your audience and get their
videos and use their videos and upload
them to your channel so according to
backlinko video comments have a very
strong correlation with ranking so as
you create a video feel free to talk to
your audience and ask them hey if you
have any comments feel free to put them
in the comment section right below this
video I see that a lot now with a lot of
videos and I'm going to ask my audience
right now to do the same thing if
there's anything you see about rewarding
the audience or engaging with the
audience feel free to comment we'd love
to get your suggestions because if you
can engage with the audience even more
then that's only going to net positive
results not only in rankings but with
your subscriber base so comments are the
way to go solicit comments respond to
the comments reward the comments tip
number eight promote your videos on
different platforms so promoting your
videos on different platforms has been
around for many years it's a good
strategy once you create your video on
YouTube you want people to see it you
want to get it out there so if you want
to increase your YouTube subscribers
this is a strategy you have to perform
so let's take a look at all the ways you
can use leverage different platforms to
increase your subscribers so before you
do that you want to research discover
how uh you can use different platforms
so the first thing you want to do is
look at the platforms you're already
using you're using face Facebook and
Instagram that's probably a good place
to start but there's other platforms you
can also leverage and we're going to
talk about those so social media most
companies most individuals are on in
some form or fashion amongst the most
popular like Facebook and Instagram so
you could start there so with Facebook
you can post something include the link
of your YouTube video with Facebook if
you're a business you have a business
page you're communicating with your
community and that's a great way to get
started by promoting your YouTube video
you can also do the same on Twitter or
Instagram or whatever platform you're on
go ahead and post something or tweet
something and include that link to
YouTube you can participate in forums
and blog discussions so there's plenty
of forums and blogs out there where you
can participate in discussion and
include a link to the YouTube video if
it's relevant and natural so for example
here there's a Blog about machine
learning you can include if you have a
video about machine learning in the
response to that conversation in this
example we've done that on Reddit you
can list your video in relevant and
reputable directories there's plenty of
directories out there there's plenty of
video directories okay that you can just
go ahead and publish your video on you
can use testimonial link building okay
so somebody can provide a testimonial
include the link of your video you can
opt for influencer marketing so if
there's somebody that is associated that
likes your brand or product and has has
a large following you can ask them to
post the video on your behalf it's a
great way to reach an audience fairly
quickly okay you can earn back links
from relative relevant and authoritative
websites so for example if you look at
this website here test genic okay
there's a article here about you know
certificate of achievements okay for AWS
so if you scroll down we could see our
video is included here in this
particular web page so this is a high
quality web page page okay that's
generating a backlink for us not only is
it generating a backlink it's also
generating traffic and awareness for the
video go ahead and and find out if
there's any websites that are relevant
to your video topic and see if you can
collaborate with them on producing a web
page to include that video you can also
take advantage of email marketing by
adding your YouTube link in the email
signature for example it's a simple
email any email client like Gmail or
Yahoo or even Hotmail or Outlook is
going to have an ability to or give you
the ability to add a signature in the
signature you could simply just include
a link to the video or to your YouTube
channel it doesn't have to be to a
specific video but it's a way to get
people to your YouTube page or to that
video so the whole idea is more eyeballs
more potential subscribers engage your
Audience by posting your video links on
community pages so for example you know
we're promoting something here on a
community pitch and that's going to get
some additional traffic over to us you
can always bookmark your videos on
bookmarking sites like stumbled upon
p.com again this is free very little
time to do this but it's a chance for
you to get the video out there and even
generate a back link you can collaborate
with other YouTube channels this is
always a good strategy if you're
creating a video on a particular topic
on YouTube chances are there's probably
somebody else out there doing the same
thing it doesn't have to be necessarily
a competitor it can be a complimentary
product or service and if you offer that
then go ahead and collaborate with them
and see if you can exchange your videos
on their Channel and you could take
their video and put it on your channel
in a particular playlist okay so that's
a way to collaborate with other YouTube
channels is swap videos you could join
High PR QA sites and post answers to the
questions related to your video like
core is always a good example or EAB
okay so core there's always a question
being posted and if you have the answer
to that question in the form of your
video then go ahead and post response
with a link to the video on YouTube it's
a great way to get the video noticed and
it's relevant and natural okay you can
embed videos in your blog post or if
you're using a platform like WordPress
for example very easy to go ahead and
just take that video you can even just
put the link in the uh blog post I like
this option I think blog post are always
good because you don't have to be text
Heavy with a blog post you want to
create a blog post that's nice and
balanced with an image and text but if
you put a video to support your blog
post that goes even further and blog
post themselves can be engaging and
interactive with your audience so having
a video in your blog post always goes
well in my opinion okay so you can
promote other videos in your end screen
for example at the end of your video you
can always promote something related
like we've done here in this example so
lots of ideas get your video out there
use them in email use them in your blog
post go to free bookmarking sites like
stumble upon you know collaborate with
other people on YouTube you know go to
core respond to a question use social
media to your advantage there's lots of
opportunities to get your video out
there the more you can get your video
out there the more traffic you're going
to get the more traffic you get to the
video the more subscribers you're going
to get so that's how the game is played
in order to get your video out there but
these are relatively you know low time
consuming ideas to get your video we're
going to talk about how to get traffic
to your website so thank you for joining
and let's get started so let's imagine
you're setting up your own website okay
you're clicking away You're developing
using some good tools you're developing
your designing you're doing some QA
you're testing you're sharing with
Friends and an alpha version and then
finally your website is all set up
congratulations well when you hit enter
and your website is finally published
what's going to happen well few days
later you're checking your website and
you're looking at analytics and you
notice your traffic's very low okay well
you're scratching your head because
you've done all this work with your
website but you're not getting any
traffic so the reason is you spend all
your time developing designing the
website to make it look good but you
didn't do anything or any planning or
any strategy around bringing users to
your website so the two go hand in hand
you just can't build a website without
thinking about how to drive users to the
website and so before I tell you how to
bring traffic to your website let me
tell you why this is so important okay
why do we want to bring users to our
website I mean it has to be on equal
ground as web development and design is
somebody who goes to your site and then
does something when they get to your
site so you have users and when those
users get to your site they're
generating page views and traffic and
you want to turn that traffic into
engagement okay so each Page's traffic
is configured independently of all their
pages so when you go when somebody goes
to your website they look at a page
that's a page view and certain pages on
your website you want to turn that page
view into a conversion okay whether that
be you know looking at a video or
purchasing something so think of these
pages on your website as salespeople
they're trying to convert visitors who
come to your website but first we need
to get the visitors to your website so
when you get visitors to your website
again you can generate sales which means
revenue or you can increase brand
awareness or you can earn Revenue
through sponsored post and advertisement
so if you have for example a lot of
content on your website you can turn
that into to revenue by hosting ads on
your website so when somebody clicks on
that ad you're going to earn a
percentage of that click okay what that
click is worth so having a website means
a lot of good things for you but first
you got to get the traffic there and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
tell you how to drive traffic to your
website so there's lots of different
ways in which you can bring traffic to
your website well the first is paid
advertising so paying to advertise your
products services with ads is one of the
easiest ways to drive traffic to your
website so some of the options available
are search ads social media ads or
display ads so search ads are ads that
are displayed in the search engine
results so when a user types in a
keyword query you want your ad to show
up based on that keyword query okay so
an example is digital marketing Mar
course somebody types in digital
marketing course and simply learn is the
first ad that shows up how do we know
it's an ad because you can see the word
add next to the domain so when somebody
clicks on that link simply learn is
going to pay Google so that's how search
advertising works okay the next is
social so social media marketing
involves increasing traffic or
engagement or brand awareness a lots of
different strategies but you're instead
of doing this on search you're doing it
on a social media platform okay so for
example you can advertise on any
particular platform and the way you
advertise could be with an image it
could be with a video so in this case
you could see Cobo is doing a sponsored
ad here how to succeed with Google ads
and then another form of advertising is
display so display means creating ads
that are placed on specific websites so
with display
unlike search you have a choice in the
ad format with search you only have text
ads but with display you have text Adge
image ads rich media ads video ads so
you have lots of different options in
which you can advertise on other
websites so the idea here is to get your
ad in front of the Right audience when
they could see your display Banner your
banner ad then it's going to be more
visual more ping generate some brand
interest and hopefully can get somebody
to click on that ad and over to your
website so that's paid advertising again
through search through social through
display but you can also promote your
site on social media so once your
content is gone live you could take
advantage of different social media
platforms I mean it really depends on
what you're trying to promote because
what you're trying to promote needs to
align with the appropriate social media
platform so Facebook is best suited for
Industries like food and beverage and
news and media and if you're selling a
product so you fall under one of those
categories and Facebook could be the
right platform for you if you're
involved in again beauty or food and
beverage or e-commerce then you can also
leverage Instagram which is part of
Facebook's ecosystem so if you advertise
on Facebook you can also advertise on
Instagram Andor Instagram so it doesn't
have to be and Facebook and Instagram it
could be Facebook or Instagram you also
have LinkedIn as a platform LinkedIn is
great for B2B so if you're trying to
promote industry news or or tips and
best practices or job postings then
LinkedIn is the place for you it's a B2B
platform it's great for targeting
specific Industries targeting specific
job levels or job descriptions okay so
LinkedIn is great if you're into B2B
focusing on the business side of it so
you also have YouTube now you YouTube is
part of Google's ecosystem YouTube is a
video platform okay so it's great if
you're trying to promote gaming or
entertainment if you're a vlogger okay
so YouTube's a great way to promote your
site uh by getting your product out
there in the form of a video then you
have Twitter Twitter to me encompasses a
lot of different Industries Beauty and
fitness news and media entertainment
okay you have limited number of
characters but a lot of people are
active on Twitter and it's a great way
to generate some awareness and get some
clicks over to your website so these are
just some of the most popular social
media platforms of course there are
plenty more out there the third way in
which you can drive traffic to your site
is guest post blogging so most of you
already know what blogging is all about
well if you're blogging for your own
site you can jump on somebody else's
site and blog on their behalf so having
the opportunity to guess post on another
website can be very helpful because one
that other blog could have lots of
traffic and have a a well-known brand so
if you're blogging on another blog it's
going to build your brand awareness and
potentially increase traffic to your
blog or website so it exposes to you to
targeted traffic so if you're going to
guest blog guest blog on a site that's
very relevant to your business or
industry that way you're targeting the
Right audience okay you can expand your
personal Network work so getting
yourself out there getting your brand
out there in front of a different
audience and then obviously for serves
because it generates a backlink to Surs
search engine ranking Pages means that
hey if you want to rank organically
you're going to have to generate some
backlinks so guest blogging is an a way
to generate some backlinks to your site
and an effect that's going to help you
get your pages ranked higher because
Google's going to recognize the
relationship from one blog to your blog
and build up your relevancy so some
other benefits here to guest blogging is
you can grow your social media PL
following because you can then promote
that on social media that you're guest
blogging okay again you can improve your
online Authority okay because when
you're guest blogging and you have
recognition on that guest blog if it's a
popular blog then that's going to help
your domain and Page Authority for SEO
and then the end result is going to
improve your backlink for so there a lot
of benefits to guest blogging to me at
the end of the day it's just about
reaching out to your audience using
another platform to do that in the form
of a Blog and the results of that is
going to mean more brand awareness for
you in turning that traffic from that
other blog into qualified leads so you
can also interview industry thought
leaders so that's another way an
interesting way to generate traffic to
your sites so reaching out to thought
leaders for interviews okay could
generate some credibility for you and
the other person so it's reciprocal so
it means that you're active in the
industry that you're in and it allows
you to engage with other leaders in the
industry and the indirect net result of
that could be increase traffic because
if you do the interview and you record
it or if it's via video then you can
obviously post it on other platforms and
that could in turn Drive traffic to your
website obviously just like guest
blogging it's going to increase your
reach so getting yourself out there if
nobody knows who your brand is and they
know who the thought leaders are and
they see you interviewing the thought
leaders then that's going to put you in
front of these people and so it's going
to increase your reach another way to
drive traffic to your website is just to
make sure your website's responsive and
what do we mean by responsive well we
mean does it work on multiple devices
specifically mobile so depending on the
device your website hides shows shrinks
enlarges or moves content so that it
conforms to the browser that that
person's looking at on your for your
website so if somebody's looking on
mobile at your website you want to make
sure that your website adjust
accordingly so you want to be able to
you know test and make sure it's
responsive and so is content arranged
based on importance okay does it work
across different browsers on different
devices and do the images text and
everything everything else align just
like it does on desktop so there are
plenty of tools out there on the web all
you need to do is just do a search for
you know check my website for
responsiveness you know so you you can
use plenty of tools to check to see if
your website is responsive towards
multiple devices why is that important
because if somebody goes to your website
Via Mobile and your site doesn't aligned
properly or the content's all stretched
out and somebody has to maneuver their
browser just to see your website then
chances are they're not going to come
back chances are they're not even going
to convert okay so you want to be able
to revise your device browser
combinations you want to make sure that
everything works accordingly you want to
be able to test those fonts make sure
they look good and then you also want to
make sure that people can navigate so if
they're on mobile are they going to
navigate just as easy as they can on
desktop and if you have any popups you
want to probably make sure they're remov
moved so that way when somebody's
looking at your website they're not
getting interfered with on mobile and
then of course you want to make sure
that these Pages load okay so they load
just as quick on desktop as they should
on mobile and vice versa so they should
not take a long time to load so moving
on from responsiveness on mobile to
building a brand community so brand
community refers to a group of people
who identify your brand and use your
brand as a platform to exchange ideas
and contribute content some advantages
of having a brand Community are
promoting brand evangelism and loyalty
it could be a source of feedback loyalty
and ideas so build a community build a
brand Community who you know identify
with you okay so continue to you know
treat these people as loyal customers
okay maybe give them a promotion uh to
use specifically just for them that they
can use on your website or talk directly
to them because you know that they're
followers they're repeat customers they
purchase for you multiple times so talk
to them differently as well you know who
these people are and that's what
building a Brand's all about it's about
identifying your brand with other people
okay and identify people who identify
with your brand and messaging and
talking to them as if they're part of
your own Community your own family so
you can use user generated content that
provides future marketing strategies so
the feedback you get from your own
Community could be in turn used to
promote or used in future marketing
strategies I.E advertising I.E post on
social okay it can also provide PR
opportunities so it's a chance for you
to you know put out press releases based
on the community that you build so any
brand regardless of who it is should be
able to identify if y With Their
audience their target audience and that
target audience eventually going to
become part of a community these are
group of people who identify with you
what you're trying to sell what your
cause is what your mission statement is
what your service is they identify with
you so leverage them and reciprocate
identify them talk to them separately
give them the what they deserve the
respect and loyalty that they deserve as
well because they're communicating and
they're following you as a brand so the
next thing you could do to drive traffic
is Be Active in the comment section so
engage in relevant and thought-provoking
conversations on other blogs and sites
it doesn't necessar have to be another
blog per se it could be other sites like
Reddit or core or medium sites that have
a lot of content that are broken out by
industry that allow you to engage in
conversation allow you to either upvote
or share
or respond okay so be active because
when you're active people are going to
see that hey you're a leader in the
industry you know what you're talking
about you have some some brand Equity
you have some thought and some knowledge
on the specific topic and subject so it
just puts you in a better light when you
can respond and be active on these
different platforms okay let's turn our
attention to search engine optimization
also known as SEO or organic search so
in order to drive traffic to your site
you're going to have to implement an SEO
strategy why do you want to implement an
SEO strategy because it can help you
improve your overall searchability and
visibility on search engines and
obviously that comes with advantages one
of those advantages is obviously more
traffic to the site search is still King
in terms of volumes of people using
search on a daily basis so you have a
great opportunity to be found it also
builds trust and credibility because
still a majority of the people who do a
search click on an organic search
listing and so if you're found
organically and you're ranked number one
then chances are somebody's going to
click on your listing and it provides
increased engagement in traffic and so
what that means is more traffic more
engagement and engagement is something
you define it could be again a download
of a document or the clicking on the
play button of a video or or submitting
a form or signing up for a newsletter or
calling these are all forms of
Engagement so the amount of traffic you
drive from organic search to your
website is only going to improve
engagement okay so you can also provide
an improveed user experience and what do
we mean by that well if you're getting
lots of traffic from organic search you
have a really good opportunity to do ab
test testing and when you do AB testing
you can improve user experience meaning
you're showing one variation against the
other from people coming from organic
search and so this is helpful and that
you know if you're running an AB test
the variation has a chance to improve or
outperform the original and if it
outperforms the original you're
improving user experience and then it
helps Target quality traffic so SEO to
me or all search is the only medium in
which you're meeting somebody halfway
you're you're addressing what they're
looking for so if somebody's looking for
a pair of red women's Nike shoes the
2019 model and you have that particular
product to offer well you have a chance
of showing up via organic search
somebody types in you women's red Nike
shoes size whatever at the year 2019
model then of course they're going to
probably likely click on your listing
because you have what they're looking
for and and that goes with any keyword
any industry any business any segment
any type of product you're selling so
again you have a chance to really be
visible for what people are looking for
and so that's the beauty of search
engine optimization you have a really
good opportunity here to meet people
halfway to drive quality traffic to get
them to enjoy a good user experience all
the while generating engagement and
along with SEO we want to be able to
build backlink so SEO is a two-pronged
approach meaning you have two strategies
in one on page and off page and so off
page involves backlinking so backlinks
are just links that direct users from
other websites to your own website so
with that inherently it's going to drive
traffic qualify traffic to your website
because if somebody's on a relevant
website that's linking to yours and they
click on that link and go to your
website it's likely going to be
qualified meaning they're going to be
relevant and so backlinking because it's
an off-page strategy why is it an
off-page sces strategy because if Google
crawls that other site that has a link
to you then that's going to give you
credit because Google say hey this
site's getting some links from some
relevant sites we must think they're
relevant and therefore we're going to
trust this site so by Google trusting
your site it's going to improve your
organic ranking and with the organic
rankings being improved meaning it's
going to mean faster indexing so what
does that mean so you want to be indexed
by the search engines and so the quicker
Google can find your pages even if it's
on somebody else's site then that means
they're going to follow that link go to
that page on your site and take that
page back to their servers to be indexed
okay so the quicker you can get indexed
the quicker you can get found and then
it helps with referral traffic so again
we noticed that our efforts are on SEO
organic search but if you're getting
traffic from another website hey that's
still counts that's referral traffic
okay so that's a side advantage to
having backlinks is good traffic from
other sites okay so those those are
inherently the some of the reasons to do
backlinking okay never hurts I mean
there's brand awareness reasons to being
on other sites as well there's industry
leadership meaning if you you you post
cont on Reddit okay you're coming across
as an industry leader but yet generating
a backlink which helps with SEO and
referral traffic so there's a lot of
benefits to building backlinks and the
opposite of backlinks are internal links
so you want to do internal linking and
that just means connecting one page on
your site to another and why is that
beneficial because it can help direct
visitors to other Pages they wouldn't
normally otherwise find via your
navigation so if you're active on a Blog
don't be afraid to include multiple
internal links you want to move people
through your site you want the flow of
traffic to go from one page to another
to another and so when you do internal
linking just like with backlinks it's
going to improve the indexing of your
website Google's going to follow those
links and index those pages and Google
does give credit from an SEO perspective
from an internal linking perspective so
if one page is linked to another and
that page page has really good relevance
in the eyes of Google then the other
page is probably going to benefit from
that the other reason you want to do
internal linking again you want to move
people from your one page of your site
to the other and when you do that it's
going to reduce bounce rates so bounce
rate is simply the rate of which people
land on a page and then leave so if I
have 100 people land on my homepage and
only one person went to another page and
the other 99 left the site then that's a
99% bounce rate so by putting internal
links in place you're helping people
move from one page to the other and thus
reducing the bounce rate and that's what
you want you want to keep people on your
site you want to be greedy it also
drives traffic to older post so again
when we say older post we're really
referring to blog post so if you have a
relevant blog post and you're writing a
new blog post then link the two together
if it's relevant link it I don't you
know regardless of how old it is you
know you want to show Google that these
older blog posts just because they were
written a year ago doesn't mean they're
outdated and oldfashioned okay or
useless you want to keep them alive by
linking to them so to me that's a good
strategy for internal linking link to
older blog post you know show people
you're an industry expert you've been
doing this for a while and you have lots
of content to share okay so the longer
you can keep somebody on your website
the more likely it is they're going to
engage and convert and some other
inherent benefits improves page rank so
what we mean by Page rank is simply just
a rank that Google gives pages so the
more internal linking you have the
better off you are and then it helps
spread link juice across websites and
what we mean by link juice again just
like backlinking it builds relevancy so
just keep all these inherent benefits in
mind to internal linking the end result
is keeping the flow of traffic on your
site and all these other benefits will
fall into place okay so another way in
which you can really hone in on traffic
to your website is longtail keywords and
longtail keywords to me are more than
just one or two keyword phrases okay so
they're usually three or longer keyword
in a phrase okay so longtail keywords
really nowadays account for most web
searches people really take the time to
even pose questions as a search query
say likely somebody it's unlikely
somebody's going to go into search and
just type in the word shoes they might
type in red shoes but that's unlikely
what they're probably going to type in
is you know red Nike running shoes
2019 or some variation of that okay
that's a longtail keyword and some of
the advantages of using longtail
keywords to be found for are less
competition so if you're using broad
keywords like red shoes then who doesn't
want to be found for Red Shoes well you
don't necessarily you don't want to be
found for Red Shoes CU it's too broad
you don't know what type of shoes
somebody's looking for you just know
they're looking for Red Shoes it could
be running shoes it could be work shoes
it could be you know boots it could be
slippers okay it's too broad so longtail
keywords help narrow it in and the more
narrow and focused a keyword is the less
competition is going to have and when
something's not competitive in the form
of a keyword then that means your
chances of ranking for that keyword are
going to be greater and the chances of
you ranking faster are going to be
greater and then of of course is
somebody's looking for exactly what you
have to offer then you have a higher
chance to convert that person so if you
have exactly those
2019 red Nike women's running shoes and
somebody does a search for that and
that's a longtail keyword and they click
on your organic listing you have the
right price then they're probably going
to convert so you have a really good
chance of converting somebody using
longtail keywords so my point here is if
you're looking for key wordss to use
focus on longer tail don't focus on one
or two key key word phrases what it also
does is brings targeted traffic so even
if somebody doesn't convert hey they
could be back because it's exactly what
they're looking for and if you're
focusing on longer tail keywords like I
just mentioned stay away from the
shorter ones it's just easier to
optimize your page for SEO so remember
SEO is a two-pronged approach on page
and off page we talked about off page
with internal linking and backlinks on
page is all about making sure there's
key words you choose are integrated in
with the page you want to be found for
and so if you're using a longtail
keyword it's just easy to work that
keyword in so it enables easier onpage
optimization okay let's switch away from
SEO to email marketing so let's focus on
email marketing as a form or method of
driving traffic to your website so email
marketing has been around a long time in
terms of digital marketing why because
it provides an effective way to convert
leads into sales why because you can
send personalized emails to a target
audience so when you send an email to
somebody on a regular basis you know who
that person is so what are you doing in
the email you're writing a specific
message to that person well email
marketing is the same thing except
you're just sending an email to a larger
group of people and when you send an
email to a larger group of people you're
still going to personalize the message
right you're not going to send a generic
email to 1,000 people okay nobody's
going to do that so make sure your
email's targeted and if it's targeted it
could be cost effective why because
sending large amounts of emails or let's
just say an email to a large amount of
people or a large group of people is
going to be cost effective it's not cost
per click you know it's not cost per
open okay so email usually depending on
the the email provider you're using
really is a flat fee so just really
depends on how many emails you're
sending or how how many people you're
sending the email to as well so but
email generally tends to be more cost
effective than other forms of marketing
so look at the email content provider
you're using and just get a sense of
what they charge but if you look at it
and do a comparison email generally is
cheaper than say doing paperclick
because with paperclick you're paying
for each click okay so that could be
expensive depending on the keywords so
email markings also time saving okay
meaning it's a onetime thing and done so
once you send the email it's just a
matter of you know watching and looking
at the metrics and learning what's going
on so you don't make the same mistakes
again but it is time conducive meaning
you send out one email and that's it
with payperclick you're constantly
measuring and managing the campaigns and
it provides real time marketing so when
you do send the email more than likely
majority of the people on day one or the
you send the email are going to be able
to view it open it click on some of the
links and convert so that's normally
what happens in email majority of the
people open it on day one and it kind of
tails off from there so think about it
as real time so when you send that email
and if you have a th000 people on your
email recipient list break it up send
the first 500 first with a different
subject line and then you can see the
data come in and if you don't see the
good results from the subject line or
the body of the email or you know the
page you're going to then make
adjustments before you send the other
email to the next 500 so that's a great
thing about emails you can break up the
email into two groups the first group
and then the second group with different
subject lines and you can probably send
them a little bit of time apart that way
you can learn from the first email
because with email you are generally
going to get results right away okay
within the first 24 hours so that's a
great thing about email okay so the
other thing about email it's less
intrusive so normally people who are
going to get the email are the ones who
sign up for the email so they're almost
expecting your email so when they get
your email again as long as you're not
sending an email on a daily basis
normally most companies send it monthly
or bi-weekly it's not going to be as
intrusive okay and then it also helps
build credibility increase visibility
and brand awareness meaning you're going
to build your brand in that email you're
going to put content in that email
that's going to show off your
credibility meaning you could put some
testimonials in the email you can put
some good affiliations you can put a
good article to an industry article you
just wrote so email is going to
inherently continue to build brand
awareness for you okay and it's an easy
way to track Roi so if you're e
e-commerce it's pretty clear you send
the email somebody opens it clicks on it
checks out and purchases something it's
easily TR trackable because you could
track it right from that email so one
thing I want to say there is just if you
do send an email make sure you're
tracking that campaign and you want to
be able to use an analytics program like
Google analytics if you use Google
analytics you're going to be able to
track when you send the email who clicks
on it and who converts so you want to be
able to measure an Roi for these emails
and you can that's the beauty of email
marketing okay let's move away from
email marketing to webinars so webinars
great method for Effective social media
promotion it's a great way to bring
traffic to your website so why do we
recommend webinars well because it
provides direct content contact within
your target group what do we mean by
contact with your target group well
you're going to host a webinar and
you're going to invite this targeted
group of people who are interested in
your product or service so if you have a
Facebook Community you could do a
Facebook live event or you could do a
YouTube
or you know you can even set up a
webinar on another platform but promote
it on social media and if you're
promoting something on social media
you're probably promoting it to people
who are already following you or like
you and so that's what we mean by direct
contact with your target groups you're
you're going to be able to create a
webinar and talk directly to that group
and that's going to help build brand
awareness and credibility and the great
thing about webinars is you don't need
some fancy software I mean I'm talking
talking to on a webinar right now and so
webinars are free all you need is a
video camera and a recorder that's all
and that's all built in with software so
there's plenty of software out there
that allows you just to do a webinar
really quick and easy there's lots of
opportunities in software so and a lot
of them are very cost effective so if
you want to build uh create a webinar
you can do that by spending very little
money and webinars again allow you to
talk to your targeted group your
community maybe prospective clients it
helps build credibility and in effect
Drive traffic to your website and when
somebody does attend a webinar they're
likely going to be highly engaged
because you're inviting them they're
going to opt into the webinar and the
great thing about webinars is even if
they don't attend the webinar the day
you have it it's going to be recorded so
they can always go back and watch it so
whoever watches the webinar is going to
be engaged because it's going to be a
topic they're interested in and then
users are likely to become prospective
customers so having a webinar talking
about something inherently interesting
to maybe a larger group of people you
can promote that on social media and
potentially get prospective customers to
sign up and watch the webinar and if you
do they're going to be engaged and then
take the next step oh I like what this
guy this person has to say they seem to
be credible I like their personality I
like their brand I like their their
product I'm going to go check their web
out their website okay so webinars allow
you to kind of pull in more people as
well as just your community because you
can promote the webinar and you can
promote it in advance and you can
leverage social media for that okay so
something related to webinars
incorporating video content so videos
have been proven to be a really good way
to attract new visitors and it just it
makes your website very engaging when
you have videos on your website it as
well so if you create video you have an
opportunity to post it on various video
platforms like YouTube or Vero okay
there's plenty of video platforms out
there or just embedded in a blog post or
embedded in a Facebook post or a tweet
okay so you can do a lot with video and
having video on your site is going to
increase engagement okay when you
increase engagement good things happen
that's going to lead to increased
conversions and sales or or Roi or just
like we mentioned the webinar can help
build trust with your audience so even
that webinar you could post on your
website so you want people to engage by
watching this video they watch the video
they're going to gain trust in you
because you're talking directly to that
person that user that audience that
visitor to your website and when you get
built trust it's going to increase
engagement and that's the beauty of
video unlike text or imagery videos
really do engage with the audience and
so the more video you can do the better
off you are because again you can
leverage social to draw attention to
your brand and product and service and
then you can have that video on your
website to increase engagement which in
turn increases conversions and sales and
improves Roi so always think video
there's plenty of video software out
there that you can leverage and the
great thing about video 2 is hey most
people are using mobile phones these
days smartphones
and so video works just as well on
mobile as it does on desktop so keep
that in mind you know video is going to
be engaging regardless of what device
somebody uses and then of course if
they're watching the video on Facebook
or YouTube then it's chances are they're
going to share that particular video
which is going to bode well for your
brand and traffic okay so video if
somebody likes a video it's very easy to
share video especially from a mobile
phone so you YouTube just makes it so
easy to share or like or subscribe to a
channel it just it becomes that much
easier things can go viral and Chan of
them going viral with video are going to
be greater okay so other ways to drive
traffic to your website is submit your
content to content aggregators so what's
a Content aggregator well a Content
aggregator is like Reddit that provides
a great platform for you to post your
content so that's what a Content
aggregator is really a site like Reddit
or medium or cor where you could post
content to a large number of people okay
so with Reddit people are either going
to up vote it or down vote it so the
more up votes you get or thumbs up or
likes or people who encourage that
content the more of a chance it has to
be found and so first thing out of the
gate if you do provide content to a
Content aggregator like Reddit make sure
it's good quality content that's
interesting and that should be a case
the case across the board whether it's a
a social post or blog post make sure the
content's unique professional and
interesting and then if you do say put
something on medium or you do put
something on Kora and it is professional
and interesting and thought-provoking
then people are going to react to it and
then that again could lead to traffic
but even if it doesn't lead to traffic
it helps build brand awareness so if you
have content just like videos leverage
it put the content out there okay when
you put content out there it's only
going to especially if it's good content
put it's going to put you in a good
light so don't be afraid to share your
content on the likes of Reddit or medium
or core or some of these other content
aggregator websites because good things
are only going to happen and again
referral traffic SEO brand awareness
conversions so all these are inherent
benefits of just sharing your content
okay and then finally we want to learn
from analytics okay so what do we mean
learning from analytics so there plenty
of analytics platforms out there one of
the most popular is Google analytics so
you want to make sure you're tracking
traffic on your site with Google
analytics so all you have to do is just
go to Google analytics via search sign
up add the analytics code to your
website and waa they're doing all the
heavy lifting they're going to track
traffic coming to your website and not
only they going to track traffic but
they're going to tell you how that
traffic engaged and so the benefits of
it Google analytics is hey you could
figure out where users are coming from
are they coming from that email campaign
that I sent out to a thousand people are
they coming from YouTube based on that
video I posted or they coming from
Reddit based on the content I just
posted there or they coming from organic
search it so Google analytics can help
us understand how much traffic we're
getting from organic search so it help
us measure our SEO efforts and then with
Google analytics you could segment so we
could segment by mobile we can segment
by desktop returning user new user by
campaign by Page by Language by city by
region I mean there's so many ways in
which to segment your audience and
segmenting simply is breaking up the
entire group of people who come to your
website into different segments based on
what you want to see so if you want to
look at you know females between the
ages of 18 to 24 who come from mobile
via organic search that's a segment and
you can look at that information in
analytics if that's your target audience
then you could see how they're
performing okay so an there are a lot of
benefits to Google analytics definitely
want to take advantage of segmenting in
Google analytics you could look at your
competition so there's a benchmarking
report the great thing about Google
analytics you can also look at content
and how your content's performing when

brings something unique to the table
helping you streamline your marketing
efforts engaging your audience and grow
your business so whether you're a
beginner or a season marketer these
tools can help you make significant
impact today we're going to cover search
engine optimization interview questions
and answers so thanks for joining again
and here's how it's going to work so if
you have have any questions to these
questions or answers feel free to just
comment right below this video and we'll
get back to as soon as possible we're
going to go through a series of
questions and I'm going to answer those
questions for you okay so the first
question that you might be asking an
interview is differentiate between do
follows and no follows okay so if You'
taken or listen to my SEO courses on
YouTube for SEO we we talked a lot about
do follows and no follows and and simply
put I mean do follows are just signals
to the search engines to follow the link
so there's a link on site a pointing to
site B we're going to basically tell
Google Bing and some of these other
search engines hey go ahead and follow
that link now a no follow is just the
opposite so no follow link doesn't allow
the search engine crawlers to follow it
so if we have a link on our site s site
a pointing to site B we can put a no
follow tag in there and what that's
going to do it's going to signal to the
Crawlers hey don't follow this link so
in the end if the Crawlers don't follow
the link then there's not going to be
any link juice passed and so Google is
not going to give you credit or give
that site credit for having a link
pointing to it or pointing to another
site or from another site and so it's
all about linking so we can control if
there's links on our site whether we
want the crawler to recognize those or
not simply with no follow text so just a
reminder link ju is the reputation or
Equity passed from one website to
another so if you have a link on another
website and that website is of high
quality meaning their page Authority
their domain Authority is high they have
a lot of content you know they're not
spammy they're really rich and they're
relevant then you may want to make sure
that the link pointing from that site to
your site is a no follow so that way
that Google can recognize the link from
that site to your site and basically
that reputation is going to be passed on
to you okay so that's a do follow versus
a no follow and why would we do a no
follow well it depends it really depends
a lot of social media platforms like
Facebook have no follows if you have a
lot of content you may not want to be
pushing out a lot of do follows it could
actually look bad from an external
linking standpoint and so a lot of sites
are really particular about who they
want to pass link juice on to and give
credit for the link so it's a business
decision at the end of the day there's
really no hard fast rule here except
from an SEO perspective if I have a site
and I have a lot of external links
pointing outward to other sites I'm
going to be particular about who I allow
the search engine to follow and what
links I allow not to follow okay so
here's an example of what they look like
so do follow is simply just the hre
notice the no follow has the the tag
appended to it the hre tag with a no
follow so if the search engines crawling
your site and they see that no follow
there they're not going to follow that
link and vice versa if there's a link on
another site pointing to yours and
there's a no follow there you're not
going to get credit the search engines
aren't going to pick up that link okay
so question two what is 301 redirect and
how is it different from a 302 redirect
so 301 redirects tell users in the
search specifically that an original
page has been moved and this is the key
word here permanently so permanently
moved we're going to explain that in a
minute so it's just moveed from one page
to another and so if we don't have a
page anymore we have a new page let's
just say you built a new website with
new URLs you want to make sure the old
page is pointing to the new page with a
301 redirect so if a 301 redirect is
permanent then a 302 to is temporary so
we want the search engines to recognize
that we have 301 permanent redirects in
place why because if we have temporary
then it might alert Google to not keep
that page in its search engine rankings
because it's temporary so why would
Google want to keep a temporary page or
even a page that is pointing to another
page on a temporary basis so they REM
May remove both pages from its index
okay but if we have have something
permanent in place Google may say okay
this page is permanently linking to
another page or redirecting to another
page therefore it's stable it's
permanent we're going to keep that new
page in the index and eventually remove
the old page so really something
permanent is more stable in the eyes of
the search engine something temporary
may not be as stable in the eyes of say
Google and if they don't see it as
stable then they may remove both pages
from the index okay so the ideas we want
to be found in Google search index and
we get it sometimes Pages go away for a
variety of reasons and if it does go
away just make sure you have a new page
for it and that new page is a 301
permanent redirect okay so question
three why are backlinks important in SEO
well we kind of hinted on that a bit
with the no follow because if we have a
link from another website pointing to
ours and that link from that other
website is really relevant and and and
it has a high page and domain Authority
then it's going to benefit us and so
backlinks are important because if we
have back links from high quality sites
it's going to improve the credibility of
our site especially if it's a do follow
tag so the search engines are going to
recognize the relationship between the
site that has a link pointing to us okay
so it's just going to build our
credibility it's going to increase
increase our domain Authority and then
the net effect of that is if if we're
credible and we have high domain
Authority then that's going to increase
the rankings of our pages and when the
pages increase in ranking then we're
going to get more of a Lon share of the
traffic for certain keywords that are
pages are found for and if our pages are
found and getting traffic then because
we have increased rankings we're likely
going to have increased traffic and then
it's just a snowball effect so more
traffic leads to more engagement and
conversion so the whole idea for SEO is
remember you have an onpage strategy and
an off-page strategy building external
links is part of an off-page SEO
strategy and we want to make sure that
you know we are relevant in the form of
a link or in the form of content on
other high quality sites being on a high
quality site only benefits us because
again increases our D domain Authority
Google sees us is more relevant
therefore pages are going to benefit by
ranking higher and therefore when we
rank we get more traffic so it's a
snowball effect so having backlinks is
important because it snowballs all the
way through to conversions okay so what
are the best practices to rank your
videos on YouTube this is a great
question really great question given the
importance of videos especially with SEO
cuz videos are found YouTube in itself
is a search engine so if we have a video
how are we going to get it to rank on
YouTube well first things first you
never want to put a video out there and
want it to rank if it's not engaging or
informative so make sure you go ahead
and follow the best practices of having
engaging in informative content in your
video now once you have that video in
place you want to optimize it and then
some of the key factors for optimizing
the video are you want to choose a title
that has high search volume and low
difficulty just as you would keyword for
example for a web page you want to
choose a title with a keyword in it that
has high volume and low difficulty I.E
low competition okay so you want a nice
ratio there and you know what you want
to choose a title it's going to get
people to watch the video too so it's
not all about just choosing a title just
for the sake of high volume you also
have to choose something that's relevant
that's going to be catchy as well and
then with that title goes the
description so you want a description
that's very relevant to your title okay
because most people aren't going to
click on a video just for the sake of a
title they're going to want to probably
get a sneak peek via the description of
what it is so again you want to optimize
that description but make sure the
description is is just as snazzy as the
title okay you also want to use accurate
and relevant video tags just as you
would on Twitter or Facebook tag these
videos okay so make sure your title tag
length doesn't exceed 100 characters
because it will get chopped off so again
that goes back to just writing something
really short and to the point Point
that's going to grab somebody's
attention Okay you also want to upload a
captivating thumbnail something that's
relevant then that's going to grab
somebody's attention and then again we
set it similar to the video tags we want
to use relevant hashtags again just as
you would with Twitter and Facebook go
ahead and throw some hashtags in there
that people could see because people
search via hashtagging and then this
goes about saying you did all the work
created a really great video it's
engaging it's informative you op IED it
feel free to promote your video on other
social media platforms okay don't just
stick with YouTube per say so the
benefit here is if you post it on
Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever
platform of your choice and it gets
engagement people click on the link go
to YouTube they're going to like it and
then other people are going to see that
engagement they're going to see how many
people liked it or how many subscribers
you have so promote your videos to help
you with the rank
of the video on YouTube so that does
play into it so go ahead and promote it
so other people can watch it like it
comment Etc and that's going to engage
other people to want to do the same so
what is mobile first indexing this is a
really important and timely question
mobile first indexing means Google's
just using mobile friendly content for
indexing and ranking websites so in
other words Google for example has two
Bots they have the traditional desktop
bot and they have a smartphone bot and
eventually everybody that has a website
is going to be migrated over to the
smartphone bot and so if that smartphone
bot goes to your website and starts
crawling what do you think they're
looking for their smartphone bot they're
looking for mobile friendly content if
it's not mobile friendly meaning the
page isn't designed for a smartphone
browser or let's just say the images are
way too large or have to expand the text
just to read it you know a lot of these
these issues that somebody would have
just simply trying to read something on
a web page on their mobile device
Google's not going to grab that content
so you want to make sure it's mobile
friendly so it gets indexed and so if
your website has a responsive design
Google will rank your website based on
its performance on mobile devices okay
so you want to make sure that your
website is mobile friendly and if you're
in an interview and somebody asked this
question you could even take it a step
further and say look I'm going to
measure how friendly my my website is
for mobile devices in Google search
console because Google search console
has a report that will show you what
pages on your website are not mobile
friendly and it's not a guarantee but I
could tell you if I'm Google and I'm
crawling your site with my smartphone
bot and that page or one of my pages is
not mobile friendly I'm probably not
going to index it or rank it so you want
to leverage that report in Google search
console to see what pages are mobile
friendly so that's a little bonus for
you to really impress the interviewer
who asked you this question because how
you going to know if one of your pages
is mobile friendly or not if you don't
look at a report so keep an eye on
Google search consoles mo mobile
usability report okay number six list
down the most important local SEO
ranking factors okay so organic
local ranking is just as important as
anything else in organic search because
if you have a local business you want to
use the likes of say Google my business
to show up when somebody types in you
know looking for a florist or you're
looking for a coffee shop so what you
want to do is you want to create a web
page for every product and service okay
you also want to opt for your business
listings on Google my business and and
there are plenty of other local business
directories out there like Yelp for
example or Bing even has one so go ahead
and also make sure you have a business
listing as well but since Google in the
United States has a huge market share
you want to start with Google first you
want to update your nap citations on
your website maintain consistency of
your nap okay so nap is name address
phone number so you want to make sure
that that's current and consistent so if
you have a number on your website make
sure it's the same number on Google my
business okay you can embed a Google map
on your website you could certainly
optimize the metatags and content not
only on your web pages but within your
Google my business directory so you can
add your business to other local
directories like I mentioned Yelp and
then also just as important op for
reviews and ratings okay so the more
reviews the H you have the better off
you are okay so I always say this with
or with local search three of the main
factors in showing up for local search
on say Google is obviously the keyword
the second is the proximity of where
that person is and then third is the
reviews so you can't really control the
proximity but you can control the
keyword and you can control the reviews
to some degree so work hard at getting
reviews for your business but at the
same time you can certainly work in some
keywords let's just say your product and
service pages on your website but also
you can translate that over to Google my
business okay so working in those
keywords making sure your your number
your address your name they're all
consistent and and really just spreading
your the the business out on other
directories that's really all these are
really key factors for local SEO okay so
question number seven how to avoid
duplicate content getting penalized for
duplicate content content so for example
if you have two different versions of a
web page you may result in a duplicate
content issue so it's just SEO 101 you
never want to have two two or more pages
with the same content so what do we do
well we can avoid this in having Google
penalize us by again setting up a 301
redirect remember 301s are permanent we
can also use what they call canonical
tag and a canonical tag basically alerts
the search engines as to which page is
the original okay so if we have an
original page we want to point to that
page with our canonical tag and then the
third option is op for preferred domain
in Google search console okay so if you
have multiple domains make sure you set
up a primary one in search console so
those are ways to work around it of this
three I would always go with the
canonical tags because that's just a tag
that's going to sit on the page it's
going to alert Google as to what the
original is just in case they get their
hands on the duplicate so all the pages
that have the same content are going to
have the same canonical tag pointing to
one page so again three ones are
permanent you could simply just redirect
one to the other if you end up having
duplication or you could just tell the
search engines hey this is the original
page or you can go through search
console okay number eight what are the
tactics to increase a web page speed
okay so what is some of the tactics well
when you build a site especially for
mobile you want to keep it as simple as
possible what I mean by simple as
possible really I mean hey use a simple
website design don't get overly creative
if you will most websites all websites
have images you're not going to be able
to get around that but just make sure
you optimize your images in other words
don't have such a large image size if
you don't need something very large
don't have it okay you want to improve
server response time and what do we mean
by that well your site's sitting on a
server somewhere you can own that server
or you can be renting it out from say
Amazon web services or let's just say
GoDaddy as your register they also have
web hosting well if you have it on say
God daddy server you may be sharing that
server with other businesses and at
certain times of the day other
businesses may get a lot of traffic and
suck up a lot of bandwidth what is that
going to do that's going to reduce the
server response time for your site and
so you want to make sure you have a an
idea of you know what server your web
page your website is on and you want to
be able to can have some control over
that because if your server response is
slow that's going to slow down
everything else in terms of loading in
the browser and that's not going to be
good for SEO okay optimize your code we
mean by optim minifying when we say
minifying we mean get rid of some of the
Redundant code if you have CSS you know
get rid of chop some of the get rid of
the JavaScript you're not using so
that's what we mean by optimizing code
reduce redirects okay ideally you just
want to have one redirect in place you
don't want to create a daisy chain so to
speak of redirecting and redirecting
after that that's never going to bode
well and it's going to slow things down
as well enable browser caching so if you
enable browser caching basically if
somebody comes back to the page they've
been on say two days ago they're
probably going to see a cash version of
that page and then op for the content
delivery Network as well so these are
some the ways to reduce page speed now
if you're curious about the page speed
of your website you can always go to
Google's page speed insights tool and
all you have to do is just Google page
speed insights or even just something
generic like Google page speed and
you're going to get this tool page speed
insights and all you need to do is just
plug in a URL when you plug in the URL
Google is going to analyze the URL for
both mobile and desktop and so here we
could see Google gives the score so we
could see the score for mobile and we
could see the score for desktop just by
clicking on desktop and so here I could
see some of the issues that the site may
be having in terms of page low time for
their desktop if I flip over to mobile
you know here I could see some other
issues for example they have a server
static assets with efficient cash policy
now if you're not sure what the heck
that means you can always just click on
it and you can see some specifics here
and or you can just always Google it as
well uh here you got the reduce the
impact of third party code okay so
that's another thing uh reduce
JavaScript execution time so again going
back to a lot of some of the comments we
met about coding okay so sometimes too
much code or code not functioning as
well as it should will tend to slow down
the site okay so you can use PP insights
you can always get a glimpse of how
pages are loading simply by also going
to for example Google analytics under
Behavior okay you can go to site speed
and if you click on overview okay Google
what Google does is they do a sampling
of pages over time and in this case
based on 89 Page views they have an
average page load time and so you can
get a sense of how quick specific Pages
load your site overall simply by looking
at the site speed overview report in
Google Analytics to get a sense of how
quick your pages are loading now there's
certain factors that do affect load time
so obviously the way the page is built
with the code the images Etc but also
the browser each browser loads
differently okay so you want to take a
look at it by browser also by country
every country has a different network
you can be in the United States and have
worse network service than you do say in
you know Co uh Ivory Coast in Africa
okay so it really depends on the network
you're on so and also the page every
page is built differently so you want to
get a sense of what pages are loading
quicker and which pages are not you can
simply just go to page timings in Google
analytics and you get a sense of what
pages do not load fast which ones do and
maybe hone in on the pages that aren't
loading fast and address those pages
first okay so you have two tools at your
disposal one Google analytics and one
page speed insights okay so let's look
at question number nine here so when
should an individual Target short tail
and longtail keywords okay so remember
short tail are usually one to two
keywords very Broad in nature longtail
keywords maybe three four keywords in a
query or maybe an entire sentence those
are considered longtail keywords so
usually short tail keywords have higher
volume but also higher competition
longer tail keywords usually have lower
uh volume but also lower competition but
the great thing about longtail keywords
the conversion rate will tend to be a
little bit higher than to say a short
tail because it's less vague and more
specific so you can use short tail
keywords if you're trying to drive a lot
of visitors because those keywords are
going to be vague or Broad in nature
longtail keywords are used for targeted
Pages such as product pages and articles
so if you have have a specific product
with a long name you can certainly
optimize that page for that product name
again the product name may have low
volume but if somebody types in exactly
that product name you show up the chance
of you them converting are going to be
very high so you don't have to always be
that specific with the product name but
try and be as specific as you possibly
can in order to get somebody to click on
your link in the search engine results
and get them over to your site to
convert okay so those are really the big
differences short tail very broad very
vague a lot of volume but also a lot of
competition but hey if you're ranking
for a short tail keyword you're probably
going to get a lot of traffic the
conversion rates may not be as high as
something say longtail where hey maybe
you're just toned in on a few set number
of products and you're not car you don't
care a lot about the traffic you just
care about getting the relevant traffic
to your site to convert okay number 10
what are the important elements to focus
while developing a website so we're
talking in terms of SEO okay so if
somebody ask me this question in an
interview what am I going to focus on
while developing a website well the
answers are right here yes we talked
about mobile mobile is so important
because a lot of websites are going to
be indexed with Google smartphone bot so
mobile usability is very important so we
need to make sure our website is
responsive for mobile just some basic
practices when it comes to site
architecture navigation we want to have
a simple URL structure okay no overly
cumbersome the navigation should simply
be clean and neat okay if you have five
products okay maybe you have uh in your
navigation you have something called
products with all five listed or you
have all five products in the main
navigation the key is you just want to
make it clean and neat easy for somebody
to find the the rule of thumb is if it's
good for the end user probably going to
be good for Google but if complicated
for the end User it's probably going to
be complicated for Google you always
want to create a sitemap now what is
that sitemap a sitemap is simply just a
formatted file with to that's includes
all your URLs and assets your images and
your videos they're going to be sitting
on your server as well so you want
Google or these these Bots to be able to
find your pages and assets and by the
way you want to take it a step further
and make sure you upload that site map
which is sitting in the root dire
meaning
domain.com sitemap.xml okay you want to
take that sitemap and make sure you
input that sitemap location in Google
search console that way Google search
console has a one-way ticket to grab the
elements in the sitemap another
important element to focus on while
developing a website is having a robot's
text file and all A robot's text file is
it's like a lock I always say to a house
so if you lock a door in your house
nobody's going to be able to get in that
door so it's all a robots text file is
you're telling Google and these other
Bots that are coming ACR your site
what's locked and what's not locked
meaning what they have access to what
they don't have access to so you want to
be able to make sure you have a robot's
text file if you're trying to not index
specific pages of your website because
if you tell Google don't crawl these
Pages or this directory they're not
going to get crawled if they don't get
crawled they're not going to get indexed
so robots text file is an important
element to focus on while you're
developing your website and while you're
developing your website it could be on a
you know in a directory just called new
website so you probably want to have new
website as the directory in the robot
text file and just to let Google know
don't go into this directory because
it's my new website I'm not ready to go
live yet so you don't want an indexed so
there are a lot of reasons to have
robots text files that's the main reason
sitemap you want Google to get these
pages and assets quickly okay you want
to make sure that your side architecture
navigation is in order you want to make
sure your site is mobile friendly and
you also want to make sure you have
content on your website that's the key
because that's what's going to keep
people on the website and engaged and
when I say content I don't necessarily
just mean words I also mean videos I
also mean images you know something
interactive okay you want to keep people
engaged that's the key behind it trust
me if if an end user finds your side
engaging Google is likely going to find
your side engaging okay so those are
good brownie points to bring up if
somebody asks you this question in an
interview so just a recap here it's
important to have a better site
structure so that Bots can easily access
and mix content okay with a responsive
design helps to make your website mobile
friendly and user friendly would also
increase the amount of time a user
spends on your website which may improve
your sit's ranking sitemap is simply
just a file that helps search engine
Bots to understand the structure of the
website okay how many pages there are on
your website and where they located
along with the videos and images okay
and then the robots text just instructs
the search engine crawlers to understand
what pages should not be indexed okay
this is simply just a text file and it's
added to the root directory again think
like a door think of a lock okay you can
tell you can lock whatever doors you
want in your house so with this we have
