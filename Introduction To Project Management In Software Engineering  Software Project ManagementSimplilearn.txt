so guys before we move on let us discuss
our agenda for today's session so we are
going to begin our session with
understanding the project management
moving ahead we are going to discuss
about project management activities in
software development then we're going to
have a deep discussion on five variables
in project control moving ahead we are
also going to discuss about phases or
tasks involved in software engineering
projects and at the end we are going to
conclude our session with discussion on
benefits of using phases in project so
guys let us start with understanding the
project management so guys project
management is a discipline of defining
and achieving targets while optimizing
the use of resour sources like time
money people materials energy space Etc
over the course of project which means a
set of activities of finite
duration that's the actual definition of
project management and with that I hope
so you have got a brief idea regarding
what exactly is project
management now we going to move forward
and try to understand what are the
project management activities involved
in software engineering so guys project
management activities encompasses wide
range of tasks aimed at ensuring that
software projects are completed
successfully these activities are
generally grubbed into the following
phases the first one is initiation in
this phase it includes project Charter
development where you have to create a
formal document that outlines the
project objectives stakeholders and
initial scope then it includes the
stakeholders identification where you
have to recognize all the parties
affected by the project and understand
their needs and expectations aftermath
we have the next phase which is the
planning it includes scope where you
have to clearly Define what is and what
is not included in the project under its
umbrella next comes the scheduling part
where you have to create a detailed
project timeline including milestones
and
deliverable moving ahead we have the
resource planning in this domain
where you have to determine what
resources means the people tools
materials are needed and it also
includes the budgeting where you have to
estimate the cost of project and
planning for the budget next comes the
risk management so under the planning we
have the risk management planning where
you have to identify potential risk and
developing mitigation strategies and
finally have under its umbrella the
communication planning where you have to
establish how information will be
communicated among the
stakeholders the third phase that we are
going to study about is known as
execution so guys it includes team
formation developments which mean
assembling the project team and
fostering team development then comes
task assignment where you have to assign
tasks to team members based on their
skills and project
requirements next come under it is a
quality assurance where you have to
implement the processes to ensure that
software meets the required standards
next comes under it is stakeholder
engagement where you have to keep
stakeholders informed and involved
throughout the project moving ahead we
have the fourth phase that is monitoring
and controlling so guys progress
tracking where you have to regularly
monitor Project's progress against the
plan under it we have the performance
reporting where you have to provide
updates on the project status including
any issues or risk
under it we have the next that is change
management where you have to manage the
changes in the project scope schedule
and resources then we have the quality
control under this and it includes
conducting regular checks and testing to
ensure deliverables meet the required
quality standards and finally we have
the monitoring part where it means
keeping an eye on the identified risk
and looking out for new risk and finally
we move to our last phase that is the
closure so guys guys closure includes
the final deliverables where you have to
complete and deliver the final product
to the client moving ahead we have the
project documentation under its part
where you have to compile all the
project documents for future reference
then you have to do the post project
review where you have to conduct a
review to identify Lessons Learned and
areas or Improvement then we have the
stakeholder satisfaction where you have
to ensure all the stakeholders are
satisfied with the project outcomes and
finally you have release under this
umbrella where you have to release
project team members to their next
assignments so Guys these activities
help structure the work of project
managers and teams ensuring that
software projects are completed
efficiently and effectively with clear
documentation and communication at every
stage now let us move on and discuss
about five variables of project control
in software
engineering project control in software
engineering revolves around monitoring
and managing key variables to ensure
that the project stays on tracks these
variable include the five variables of
project control in software engineering
effective project control in software
engineering involves monitoring and
managing key variables to ensure project
stays on track and meets its objective
so let us delve into these five crucial
variable the first one that we have is
School
so guys a scope encompasses all the work
required to deliver a product service or
result with the specified features and
functions it's essentially the project
boundaries and deliverables it includes
two parameters that is controls and
tools if we talk about control it means
that to maintain control over the scope
it's vital to ensure that the project
remains within the agreed upon
boundaries this involves managing any
changes through a formal Change Control
process to prevent scope creep which can
derail the project by introducing
unplanned task next we have on this
umbrella the tools used so the common
tools for scope control includes the
work breakdown structure which breaks
the project into manageable sections and
requirements documentation to outline
what needs to be done and change request
from to manage and approve any
alterations to the project
scope next we have all over here is time
time refers to the project SC sched
which includes the start and end dates
key milestones and deadlines it's about
when things need to happen if you talk
about control guys it means keeping the
project on schedule it requires regular
monitoring of progress against timeline
adjustments to the schedule might be
necessary to address delays or to
accelerate certain tasks if needed here
tools used are such as scan charts
provide a visual timeline of project
activities project schedules lays out
the sequence and timing of task critical
path analysis identifies the longest
sequence of tasks that must be completed
on time for the project to finish on
schedule and project management
softwares used are like jira Microsoft
Project which helps in planning
executing monitoring and scheduling now
let us move to the third part that is
cost cost involves the budget allocated
for the project covering all the
expenses such as labor materials
equipments and overhead if you talk
about the control parameter in this it
includes tracking project expenditures
against budget and making adjustments as
necessary this might involve
implementing the cost saving measures or
managing changes to the budget here
tools used are cost estimation models
which helps to predict expenses budget
tracking spreadsheets and provide a way
to monitor costs and earned value
management which also integrates project
scope cost and schedule measures to help
assess the project performance and
progress the fourth one that we are
going to talk about is Quality quality
refers to the degree to which the
project deliverables meet the required
standards and satisfy the customer needs
it's about delivering a product that
performs as expected as the meets of
stakeholders and
expectations it involves adhering to the
established quality standards through
systematic testing reviews and
inspections we have to also address any
defects or issues promptly which is very
crucial for maintaining the quality
tools used are such as quality assurance
plans which outlines the activities
required to ensure quality testing
Frameworks which provide a structure for
systematic testing inspection checklist
which helps in verifying that all the
quality requirements are met and quality
control charts also monitor quality
performance and finally we move to our
last that is the risk risk encompasses
the potential events or conditions that
could negatively impact the project this
could range from technical failures to
Resource shortages effective risk
controls involves identifying analyzing
and prioritizing risk developing and
implementing mitigation strategies is
very very crucial to manage these risk
proactively if we talk about tools for
risk control it includes risk registers
to document and track risk risk
assessment matrices helps to evaluate
this the variety and likelihood of risk
we also do the SWAT analysis to identify
strengths weaknesses and opportunities
and also threats and contingency plans
to outline steps to take if risk
materializes so guys by keeping a firm
grip on these five variables like scope
time cost quality and risk project
managers can navigate the complexities
of software engineering projects and
drive them to successful completion now
since we have got a brief idea regarding
what are the variables in project
control let us move to our next task
where we are going to discuss the phases
or tasks which are involved in software
engineering projects in software
engineering managing project often
involves breaking down into manageable
phases or task this structured approach
ensures Clarity organization and control
throughout the Project Life Cycle each
phase is characterized by specific
criteria and deliverables which play a
crucial role in project success the
first one that we are going to discuss
is about entry criteria entry criteria
are the conditions that must be met
before a phase or task can begin in
software engineering entry criteria
ensures that all necessary preparation
and prerequisites are completed before
the starting phase this can include the
required resources approvals and
documentations in place next one that we
have all over here is exit criteria exit
criteria ensures that a phase has met
its objectives and prod use the expected
deliverables before moving on to the
next phase in software development exit
criteria for the coding phase might
include the completed code pass unit
test and code reviews this helps to
prevent incomplete or substandard work
from being passed along to the
subsequent
phases next we have all over here is
deliverables deliverables are the
tangible or intangible outputs produced
at the end of a phase deliverable serves
as a milestone and indicates a progress
within project in software engineering
common deliverables include requirement
specification design documents Source
codes test plans and user manuals clear
deliverables help in measuring progress
and quality ensuring that each phase
contributes to the overall project
goals next one we have all over here is
called reports reports are the documents
that provide information on the status
progress and outcomes of phase or task
regular reporting keeps stakeholder
informed and allows for tracking and
assessing project performance in
software engineering reports might
include status updates risk assessment
issue logs and performance mattresses
effective reporting helps in identifying
and addressing issues early ensuring
transparency and accountability
throughout the project now let us
discuss what are the benefits of these
phases so guys in context of software
engineering breaking a project into
phases or task with defined criteria and
deliver
offers several benefits the first one
that we get is structured approach it
provides a clear and structured approach
to project management ensuring that each
phase has clear objectives and outputs
next we have the risk management here
the entry and exit criteria helps in
identifying and mitigating risk early by
ensuring that prerequisites are met and
quality standards are maintained and
finally we have all over here is quality
assurance where a clear exit criteria
ensures Ur es that each phase produces
high quality outputs contributing to the
overall quality of the final product so
guys by breaking a software engineering
project into these well- defined phases
with clear entry and exit criteria
resource allocation deliverables and
Reporting mechanisms the project
managers can effectively guide their
teams to deliver high quality software
on time and within budget with that guys
