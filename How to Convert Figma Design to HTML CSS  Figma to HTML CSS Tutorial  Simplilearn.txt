hello everyone welcome back to Simply
learns YouTube channel in today's video
we are going to talk about a really
helpful topic how to convert your figma
designs into HTML and CSS with just a
few clicks without writing any code
yourself now if you're a designer or a
developer you're probably already
familiar with figma it's one of the best
tools out there for creating website and
app designs but here's one thing once
your design is ready the next step is
turning that design into actual code so
it can go live on a website now this is
where things can get a little tricky
figma does offer a developer mode that
allows you to see the code behind your
designs but there's a catch it's the
part of figma's paid plan which not
everyone may want to invest in
especially if you're working on personal
projects or you are just starting out
but don't worry in today's video we'll
show you a much easier and more
importantly free way to convert your
figmma designs into HTML and CSS code
using some amazing tools these tools
will help you take your designs and turn
them into clean working code without
having to manually write anything
yourself this can save you hours of
effort we'll be focusing on two great
tools DWI and teleport HQ both tools are
designed to make the process as smooth
as possible you can take your figma
designs and turn them into fully
functioning websites with responsive
layouts meaning your site will look good
on both mobile and desktop screens so
whether you are a designer who wants to
bring your ideas to life or a developer
looking to save time these tools have
got you covered so let's dive in and get
started so first we'll start with theis
so theis is an awesome tool for those of
you who are looking for more
customization and control over the code
so it's great for developers who want to
go deeper and tweak the output to make
sure the code fits their exact needs now
theice not only generates HTML and CSS
but also supports more advanced
Frameworks like react or view making it
perfect for developers working on
complex web
pages so let's get started first let's
go to figma so usually you will be
having a figma design to be converted so
for this demo I'm using a web page which
is available in our figma community so
let's open this in figma so this is
basically a website with three pages so
let's just zoom in yeah first we have
the main page then we have a page for
pricing then we have a page for sign up
so our aim is to a code for this
particular website so for using the the
there are two options either you can use
the plug-in go to plugin go to manage
plugin and here you have the device
plugin so either you can do it this way
or you can go to the D's website so in
this demo we'll be going to D's website
you can sign up for free yes so now what
you have to do is you have to create a
web app choose this option start
building building so now you have to
name your application so let's just name
it as demo 1 for
now and then as you can see you can
select a framework you have HTML nextjs
react Shopify liquid so right now we'll
be working on HTML and then again you
have design system you can select
between CSS or Tailwind CSS so in this
project we'll be selecting CSS yes and
now you have to give the URL the figma
URL
okay so before you give the URL make
sure to do a quick run through of your
projects to make sure that everything is
in place and it's all right so that you
don't have to spend much time debugging
and fixing your code because that is
such a tedious job right so just check
if everything is in place and make sure
the pages and elements and it are framed
properly and the elements are grouped so
as you can see here these elements are
non grouped so let's just group it group
selection yes now it's
grouped so let's just frame this so
select
everything just a second yes right click
frame
selection yeah so now you can copy this
URL and paste it over here and then
press start building so as you can see
the device has recognized all our three
pages so either you can work in one of
the pages or you can select all the
screens so right now we'll be selecting
all the screens confirm the selection we
also they have also given the thumbnail
over here so right now we are not
working on it we're just working on the
screen so confirm selection and then you
can check these boxes like whether you
have to retain figma text Styles and the
code whether you want to keep layer
names as defined in figman and
everything so let's just click all these
apply and continue now again here you
can you know change the title we are
going to keep it the same save and
continue and here you can configure your
applications elements like if you want
to merge CSS files you know the
typography unit whether you need in
pixel or RM I'll just keep it in pixel
we want a responsive design so I have
picked it so let's save and continue so
device is downloading everything you
know extracting theme downloading
category assets optimizing groups
everything it'll take some time and
finally we have it here as you can see
it has recognized everything it has
recognized the auto identified UI
components and Custom UI components so
we have header you can even view it
three headers because we have three
pages in the main page sorry main page
pricing page and sign up and we have 19
columns we have images we have rows
header menu we have texts
footer link input everything and here
even it has recognized the buttons so
now let's just press the let's start
button yes so let's just preview this
first so as you can see we have to make
some changes because as you can see you
know the start to take has to come here
yeah so once you preview you know you'll
get an idea of what to change because
before generating the code we have to
make necessary changes in the design and
here also this is the default one you
can also you know check it in Mobile
resolution so this is how it comes in
the mobile resolution this is how it
will be seen in the laptop see as you
can see in the laptop it's fine you know
the laptop view is fine it's properly
aligned so I don't think we have to make
much changes in the laptop View and this
is the tablet view tablet view also
seems to be
fine now there's a problem over here so
once you see this you can go back and
make the changes in the design so let's
just close this for now so after the
preview you can make the necessary
changes in the design over here so so as
you can see you can make the necessary
changes over
here okay you can change the
display you can change the spacing you
can add
padding you can add the margin again the
sizing you can change the width the
height everything again you can browse
through this you can change the position
you can change the typography the font
of the text that you have
selected also you can give borders you
can change borders give effects and once
you're done with this you just have to
save the changes over here so again you
can go into each each of the section
here is the layout Tree on the left side
so in the div column we have the header
under the header we have the image this
image we have the header
menu we have the buttons here we have
the footer so after you have made the
necessary changes you can actually view
the code here yes so this is the main
HTML code also what you can do is you
can go to a specific division like uh
you can generate code for that
particular section alone to
so how easy was that you even did not
have to write a single line of Code by
yourself so there is everything you know
it's divided into classes so basically
device works on bem methodology now bem
means block element and modifier so
block means it's an independent entity
it can be a button an element will be
inside the block like an arrow sign for
the button or anything and then comes a
modifier the modifier it consists of the
color like you know the buttons color
the shade whether it's transparent
whether it's in dark mode light mode Etc
so as you can see here this is the block
inside the class this is the element and
this is the modifier now after that you
can download the code so for downloading
the code you need to select a plan so
right now we'll just view the code so
let's just press here let's go to build
the app so this is our code after
building the app as you can see we have
the folder structure we have a public
it's a static C it's holder inside which
inside the public we have the images
fonts and then we have the CSS inside
that we have the Styles you know the
stylesheet and then we have the index
HTML file so you can check the code one
by one over here so this code is of the
main page the first page this code is of
the pricing page and then this is of the
sign up page the third page so as you
can see you have got a complete you know
a complete set of code complete HTML CSS
code for the website without writing a
single line of code now what you can do
is you know you can refer from this and
you can work on vs code or if you have
you know if you're ready to pay you can
actually you know download your code now
before going to the next tool if you are

you can find the course Link in the
description box and pin comments so the
next tool that we'll be talking about is
teleport HQ so teleport HQ is perfect if
you want something quick easy and
beginner friendly so with teleport HQ
you can go from FMA design to a
responsive website with almost no effort
and it's great for those who just want
to get a site up without diving too deep
into the code so let's go and install
the plug-in the PPO touchkey plugin I've
already installed it so basically you
have to go to manage plugin and search
for teleport HQ plug in and install it I
already installed it so let me run it so
now I have selected this particular
frame you can select even multiple
frames right now I'm working in this
particular frame so there are two
options either you can copy the objects
to your clipboard then go to you know to
teleport HQ and paste it over there or
you can export it as a new project which
will directly take you to the teleport
HQ site so let's just export as a new
project it's copying the elements one by
one so once you reach here you can edit
you can just zoom out and you can edit
your design again you can check the
resolutions over here whether it's
responsive or not yes so first you can
make the necessary changes for example
if we selected this text you can change
you know it's alignment let's just keep
it middle aligned you can change the
text style you can change the size you
can change the position you can you know
like in in device you can also you know
change the margin you can add margin
padding you can change the text color
yeah you can add border you can change
the background and everything and
similarly not only on text you can do it
everywhere you can you know work on your
logo so you just have to go to your left
hand side and click the elements that
you want to edit so this is of this
particular text we're expanding to 100
Place countries so you know you can
select element by element from your left
side and edit it accordingly so here
also you can you know create new
components like you can create custom
components of your choice or also you
can add the pre-built Elements which you
can find in the library now while
editing the design you can also add
sections like in case while designing in
figma if you have forgot to add some
sections or layers you can add it over
here so for that you can go to sections
and as you can see you know there are a
variety of sections variety of templates
for each sections for example you can
add Banner blog post contact forms call
to action FAQ you can even add the whole
hero section they not found page the
pricing page sign in sign up page
anything and they have even in one
section a single section they have a
variety of templates for example let's
just try the team So Meta team is
generating the content for the section
see as you can see this is the template
that we have received for Te this is
pretty cool right so now you can just
you know these are the plays holders and
you can change the images so this is how
you can add sections now once everything
is done our next step is to view the
code and download the code we have a
publish option over here we can publish
the project but for publishing the
project we actually need a professional
plan so what you can do is we can view
and download the code now in the free
plan we can view and download the code
10 times so let's just view the code
first so here we have the
HTML code and here we have the CSS code
now let's just download it we want it in
HTML download the zip file once it's
downloaded extract all the files okay
now what you can do is let's just see
this in the browser you can open it in
Google Chrome now for making Necessary
edits in the code we have to export the
code to vs code you know the downloaded
code so for that we can just like first
vs code must be installed in your device
and then just open it with vs code so as
you can see you have the index.html file
which is the HTML code and also you have
the CSS code so as you can see you just
designed a website using figma and here
you have the code you know without
putting any effort and without writing a
single line of code this is pretty cool
isn't it so now you can make necessary
changes in the vs code and then publish
it so that's a wrap of our video I hope
