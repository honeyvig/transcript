typing each and every individual element
from this particular website into my
Excel spreadsheet right that would take
all day or if in case the data set is a
lot bigger than what it has been shown
on the website or it might be next to
Impossible right basically it's way too
hectic now there is a simplified way
where you can do the same right you just
have to go to the website where you want
to download the data from copy that URL
as it and now back to excel here in the
data section go to import option where
you can find the option which says from
website just click on that now p start
URL now press okay and it might take a
little while to import your data and add
it into your rows and
colums now it will show you multiple
options or whatever the data is
available here and you can select the
data or table which you want to have so

have this is the one so let's check the
third one this is not the one which I'm
looking for I'm looking for this
