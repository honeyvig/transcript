hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting session from simply learn in
this session we will be discussing the
windows shortcuts don't forget to stay
back until the end of this tutorial we
have some exciting suspenses and
homework for you guys on shortcuts so
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you are a tech gate in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon so that you can
never miss an update from simply learn
so without further ado let's get started
with our one point agenda that is
windows shortcuts
now the first shortcut key that we will
be discussing is windows key plus e so
this will be helpful to open your file
explorer now let's get back to the
desktop and let me show you how it's
done
now i'm on my desktop and if i would
like to open my file explorer then we
have multiple ways to do it so i can
just open cortana and type in file
explorer
so here you go you can just click on it
or
you can also do another way where i have
my file explorer pinned onto my taskbar
so i can just click on it
so going to the cortana or windows and
typing in or
spending a click on one single operation
would be a little time consuming so to
eliminate that you can just
type in windows and e
right so this will open your file
explorer all you have to do is hold the
windows button and press e so this is
one of our shortcut ways to open our
file explorer let's get back to our
presentation
now the second one in the list is alt
key plus right arrow key or left arrow
key so why is the shortcut used this
shortcut is used to switch the
directories so previously we tried to
open the windows explorer now
we will try to use the shortcut keys to
navigate through the windows explorer
now let's get back to my windows
explorer
now we are on my windows explorer so
let's open a few documents
a few more folders and everything
okay so we are in a folder now
so instead of spending a click to
get back to downloads or this pc you can
use the shortcut method that is holding
alt key plus left or right arrow key so
if you press the left arrow key
you will go back to the downloads file
and another plus will navigate you to
the this pc one
so if you press the right arrow key then
you'll get back into the bfs algorithm
so this is how you use the alt key plus
left or right key combinations together
now let's get back to the presentation
now the next one in the list is alt plus
p
now there are situations where you have
multiple files on your folder
so you will want to just open a
particular folder and you don't want to
spend your time wasting on opening all
the folders and checking each and every
one if you had the right folder open or
not so for that you can use the preview
option where your windows will show you
the preview of the folder you're trying
to open and this saves a lot of time
so let's get back to my file explorer
again now here you can see a lot of
folders and a lot of powerpoint
presentation files etc so when you press
alt plus p then the window will be open
which will show you a small preview of
your folder now let's get back to the
presentation
now the next shortcut key in our list is
ctrl c so ctrl c ctrl v and ctrl x these
are the few shortcuts we are completely
familiar with ctrl c is for copy and
then followed by that we have control x
which means cut then followed by that we
have control v paste and there is
another option to paste which is control
shift v
so this particular option is used when
you are trying to paste the information
from a different source without the
formats
so what do i mean so let me give you a
small
example of that
now we are on a random website so this
particular website is based on gradle
documentation now let us imagine that
we are again creating a new
documentation based on the same so we
want to
make use of this particular source so
we are going to copy this data and we
are trying to paste it on a new document
now when we try to paste the text onto
the new google document you can see that
the text from the website is being
copied along with the format and all the
links provided in this particular
document and we don't want any of those
links or any of the formats existing in
the website so to avoid such kind of
issues what you can do is you can use
the ctrl shift v shortcut where you have
to hold the control key hold the shift
key and then press v
so this particular method will eliminate
all the formats all the links which come
along with the text from the website so
this is a very useful method for to
eliminate all the formats from your
original source
so after control shift and b our next
shortcut is control n so let us imagine
that we are on
some window so let's imagine that we are
on this particular excel file and you
wanted to create a new excel sheet right
so
there are a few methods to create that
you can go to file then open
uh the home page and then select the new
option which will give you an option of
creating a blank workbook etc etc so
this is a little time consuming so what
if you wanted to create a new sheet
right from your existing sheet just by
using some shortcut so that would be
ctrl n and there you go you have your
new sheet readily available for all your
operations so followed by this let's get
back to the presentation for the next
shortcut key
now we have control plus
shortcut key so let us imagine that we
are on this particular website and you
forgot to bring your reading glasses and
you're feeling it difficult to read the
text so then you can use the shortcut
key by holding ctrl and pressing on plus
which will increase the font size
now
if you want to get back to the normal
thing that is if you want to reduce the
font size then you can press ctrl minus
and this will reduce the font size let
us imagine that you are in a hurry and
you don't know
what size your page is at and then there
is another shortcut key which will set
the size to default as it was originally
that is control 0 and there you go it's
reset to the original font size
so these are the few shortcuts for zoom
in zoom out and zoom to the default size
that is control 0. now the next one in
the list is ctrl shift n so we have
already known control n which will
create a new document whichever it is if
it has a word document or if it's an
excel document or whatever it is now
is there a shortcut key to create a new
folder altogether yes
there is a folder shortcut key where you
can just press and ctrl shift and n and
a new folder will be generated now let's
get back to my file explorer
now we are on my file explorer and we
have got into the gradle
folder and
all the important folders are right here
and what if you wanted to save your code
so let's imagine that you've written
some code based on cradle and you want
to save it in the same gradle folder now
to create a new folder for your code you
might have to choose the right click
option then go to the folder and create
a new folder so why spend so many clicks
on just creating one single folder when
you have a shortcut where you can hold
ctrl shift and press n and there you go
you have your new folder right so uh
this method also gives me another trick
to rename your folder so whenever you
try to rename your folder you might have
to spend two clicks on that or you might
have to right click and go to the option
of rename right this is also another
time consuming thing you can eliminate
that by just selecting your folder and
pressing f2 to rename it there you go
now let me rename it to gradle
code and there you go it's done
so simple
now what's the next one let's get back
to the presentation
yeah the rename folder which we have
done right now
so after we have understood how to
rename a folder let's continue with the
next one where we have
windows plus index so this particular
shortcut is for taskbar options now
yeah let me show you how
let us go back to the desktop
so now we are on my taskbar and we have
all the starting ones on my taskbar
which is windows cortana etc and the
first one on my taskbar is eclipse so
followed by eclipse we have two which is
the file explorer three is internet
explorer fourth one is the vpn so what
if i want to use
eclipse so i don't have to navigate to
my taskbar or pressing windows and
exploring it
and
i can instead of that i can use the
shortcut by pressing windows and
one
so which will directly start the the
first one on my taskbar the first
application on my taskbar which is the
eclipse ide now let me close that
so we have understood uh how to use
windows and index now followed by that
the next shortcut key in our list is alt
tab
now alt tab is something which will help
you a lot in real time
so for now we are on my powerpoint
window and let us imagine that we wanted
to get back to our file explorer and we
wanted to search for something let us
imagine that's the microsoft
picture or gif now we wanted to get back
to our ppt right so for that you might
want to minimize this minimize the file
explorer go to the taskbar and see for
the powerpoint one and select it right
instead of that what if you had a
shortcut key so just by pressing
alt tab you can switch back to the
window you want
right so now i wanted to go back to the
photos window and i wanted to go back to
the file explorer window
i'm doing all this by just holding alt
key and pressing tab
what you're doing here is you're just
switching the tabs
and that's how it's done
and we are back on my presentation again
now the next shortcut after all tab is
windows tab now what is windows 10 so
windows tab is completely similar to alt
tag but the only difference is it will
show all the tabs which are currently
active so
let us imagine that you wanted to switch
to a particular tab and you don't know
how many tabs are open so when you press
windows tab then it will show you all
the active tabs on your windows screen
and then you can just navigate and get
back to the window you want to choose
right so we are back onto a presentation
again now followed by that the next
shortcut key we have on our list is left
hold and shake so this is a little
interesting
so
what if you wanted to you know see all
the windows at one place
or you wanted to minimize all the
windows so you can just hold the left
arrow key
on the tab and shake it a little bit and
you can
see all the windows are minimized
right so that's how it's done you'll
have only one window active on your
screen
now followed by that the next
shortcut is
alt plus f4 so alt plus f4 is really
helpful to close the applications
so let us imagine that we are on the
file explorer and if you want to uh you
know close this particular file explorer
then you have to navigate to f4 now for
some reason let us imagine that our
mouse pointer is not working and only
source you have is the keyboard so
during that situation you can just hold
the alt key and press f4 to close the
application you're in
and the next one is ctrl f4 which also
does the similar job but with a little
you know change
now let us go back to the file explorer
let us open a new
powerpoint window
so now we are on the powerpoint window
so let us imagine that you are doing
something very important and you don't
want to share your screen
or let us imagine you're talking with
your friends and suddenly someone looks
at your screen and they ask what is this
so you don't want to share that
particular you know
confidential information so during that
situation you can just hold ctrl key and
press f4 and your application will be
closed it is completely similar to the
alt f4
now what is the difference
it did not close the application
completely
okay you might say the window got close
but let us try one more
time so we are currently on the
powerpoint let me press ctrl f4 the
slides have gone but the application did
not close so this is the beauty of using
control f4 so if you want to keep your
application running but you just want to
eliminate the information on your screen
then you can use ctrl f4 or if you want
to terminate the application completely
then you can use alt f4
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
so that brings us to the next shortcut
in our list that is
windows l
so let me open the
slideshow yeah so
our next shortcut is windows l so this
is something really important and
helpful and much used in the real life
times so let us imagine that
suddenly someone comes to your screen
and you want to you know stop your work
and lock everything then the shortcut
key for that is holding the windows key
and pressing l so that will bring you
directly to the lock screen now your
windows has been locked so let me unlock
it again
there you go i'll be redirected to my
welcome sheet
so that's how you try to lock your
windows so followed by the lock screen
our next shortcut key is windows plus d
so this particular shortcut will help us
to minimize all the active windows and
redirect us directly to the desktop so
let me show you how it works
now let me press the previous shortcut
key that is windows tab and you can see
we have so many tabs open right now on
my screen and currently we are in the
google
tab so
if you want to just minimize everything
down and just get back to your desktop
as it is
then you can just press the windows d
and there you go all the tabs have been
closed and you're right on your home
screen
now let's get back to
our presentation now followed by that
the next shortcut key is control action
window for that we'll be using the
windows key and the alphabet a
now let me show that how it's done
so windows d and we are on the desktop
so
the control action window is something
which is this one
okay so here you'll have all your
notifications and all your messages and
everything so there's a shortcut key for
that so just press
windows and a and there you have your
control center
now followed by that the next shortcut
is ctrl g so this is very interesting
shortcut so here you can have like
everything on one place if you're a
gamer
and if you want to record your screens
like there is a trend going on like
where you'll be playing some famous
games like pubg and all and you wanted
to record your screen so you can do that
so just press windows plus g and
you'll have your shortcut on the window
so
here you go where you can you know start
your games and you can also record your
screen and you can measure your
performance and everything so all
together
in one place
so next we have
windows plus shift plus s which comes
handy when you want to take a snapshot
of your screen
so let me show you how so currently let
me try that windows as
shift on s here
so there you go and let me take a
snapshot of the screen and
it's been recorded
so why do we have this shortcut because
uh if you want to use your
you know sniping tool then you want to
navigate to windows and sniping tool
and then you'll have that right this
could be a little time consuming so
instead of that just press window shift
and s and there you go your
screen is ready to take a screenshot
that's how it's done now let's get back
to our presentation again
so the next shortcut key we have on our
list is the virtual desktop that will be
using windows control and d so there
might be situations where you want to
have multiple desktops so one does stop
dealing with all your editing things and
another desktop dealing with a few other
browsing things what you do for regular
you know
like facebook instagram etc so you can
do that so you can just hold windows key
then control and d
and a new
desktop will be created all together so
this is our existing desktop so let me
try that
and there you go we have our new desktop
and in this new desktop you can see no
icons on the taskbar are active
all the active windows were in the
previous desktop so how to navigate back
to our original desktop no worry that
can be done by windows
control and arrow keys
so there you go i have pressed windows
control and left arrow key and we are
back to our original desktop and all our
active applications are here
so that's the next shortcut that's we
are going to discuss now that is
control key left or right arrow key
along with windows
next shortcut in our list is ctrl alt
delete this is the
very helpful shortcut which will bring
you out of nightmares
so there are situations where your
windows gets hanged so due to some
random application which is consuming a
lot of ram so it's not responding so
then you can press ctrl alt and delete
keys and your taskbar will be active on
your screen
then you can eliminate any of the
unnecessary applications like photos i'm
ending that
that's how it's done
now the next one is a custom shortcut so
what's a custom shortcut is there
anything that customizable in shortcuts
in windows yes you can do that let me
show you how
so right now we are on my desktop and
you can see that we have one shortcut on
my desktop and i use tableau regularly
so i want to create a shortcut using my
keyboard using which i can launch my
tableau within seconds so that can be
done so go back to the
w shortcut right click and navigate to
properties and there you go you have a
row which says shortcut right now there
is none so you can edit it by holding
ctrl alt and
okay let me take t for tableau and press
ok
and right now you need to provide some
administrative permissions for that and
it will be set
so that's how it's done
so currently in this particular one the
shortcut has been set
so now we are on the last shortcut key
for windows today now this one is a
little suspense for you guys
so let's take it as a homework for you
guys now so all you need to do is press
the windows button and hold it then
press x
then after that release the both the
keys and
try pressing the u key from the keyboard
twice so you need to do is press windows
button hold it there then press x
followed by that you can release both
the keys and try to tap on the alphabet
u for two times
try this out and let me know what
happened in the comment section below
so with that we have come to an end of
this session on windows shortcuts if you
have any queries regarding any of the
shortcuts discussed in this session or
