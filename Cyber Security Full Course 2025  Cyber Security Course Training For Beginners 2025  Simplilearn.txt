future in cyber security meet an she
often shops from www. shoppingcart tocom
she has her information like email ID
address and credit card details saved on
the website to enable a faster and
hassle-free shopping
experience the required information is
stored in a server one day an received
an email which stated her eligibility
for a special discount voucher from
shopping cart.com in order to receive
the coupon code she was asked to fill in
her shopping cart.com account
credentials this didn't seem fishy to
her at the time as she thought it was
just an account verification step little
did she realize the danger she would be
facing she was knocked off her feet when
a substantial amount of money was wiped
off her account how do you think this
happened well yes the email she received
was fake an's shopping cart.com account
witnessed unauthorized access from a
third party this type of attack is known
as a Cyber attack and the person who
carries it out is called a hacker could
an have prevented this attack indeed she
could have with the help of cyber
security cyber security involves
techniques that help in securing various
digital components networks data and
computer systems from unauthorized
digital access there are multiple ways
to implement cyber security depending on
the kind of network you are connected to
and the type of cyber attacks you are
prone to so let's take a look at the
various cyber attacks that Anne could
have been exposed to one of the most
common types of cyber attacks is a
malware attack like Trojan adwar and
spyware to name a few had Anne
downloaded any suspicious attachments
online her system could have gotten
corrupted by certain malicious viruses
in embedded within the attachments next
is a fishing attack the type of Cyber
attack which an experienced here the
hacker usually sends fraudulent emails
which appear to be coming from a
legitimate Source this is done to
install malware or to steal sensitive
data like credit card information and
login
credentials another type of attack is
the man in the middle attack here the
hacker gains access to the information
path between an's device and the website
server the Hacker's computer takes over
Ann's IP address by doing so the
communication line between an and the
website is secretly
intercepted this commonly happens with
unsecured Wi-Fi networks and also
through malware password attack is one
of the easiest ways to hack a system
here Ann's password could have been
cracked by using either common passwords
or trying all possible alphabetical
combinations to prevent future cyber
attacks Ann sought to implement a few
cyber security practices first she
installed a firewall as the name
suggests it is a virtual wall between
Ann's computer and the internet
firewalls filter the incoming and
outgoing traffic from your device to
safeguard your network and they can
either be software applications or
Hardware
reinforcements secondly and implemented
honey pots just like how flowers attract
bees dummy computer systems called
honeypots are used to attract attackers
these systems are made to look
vulnerable in order to deceive attackers
and this in turn defends the real system
in addition to these she also decided to
use unique alpha numeric passwords
antivirus software and started avoiding
mailes from unknown senders that was
Ann's story cyber attacks are not just
confined to individuals but also to
public and private organizations the
cyber attacks carried out in such places
are more deadly and they result in
colossal losses
motives of such attacks are many
starting from tampering with crucial
data to monetary gains let's have a look
at a few of the cyber attacks that
companies are subjected to various
public sector organizations and large
corporations face the advanced
persistent threat a in this form of
attack hackers gain access to networks
for a prolonged period in order to
continuously gain confidential
information companies also witnessed the
denial of service attack where networks
are flooded with traffic which in turn
leaves legitimate service requests
unattended a variant of this is the
distributed denial of service DDOS
attack when multiple systems are used to
launch the attack when a hacker
manipulates a standard SQL query in a
database driven website it is known as a
SQL injection attack by doing so hackers
can view edit and delete tables from
databases amidst a plethora of cyber
attacks it is indeed a challenge for
organizations with several networks and
servers to ensure complete Security this
is not an easy task and to help with
this cyber Security Professionals are
hired to work on identifying cyber
threats and securing a company's Network
there are multiple job roles in the
field of cyber security if hacking
fascinates you then the role of an
ethical hacker is something to be
explored such professionals try to exp
Network's vulnerabilities just like how
a hacker would do but only to identify
those vulnerabilities and resolve them
for protection against an actual Cyber
attack but if you are looking to design
robust security structures then the role
of a security architect is more apt a
chief information security officer ciso
plays a crucial role in Enterprise
security and is entrusted with the
overall safety of the information in an
organization so here's a question for
you identify the type of Cyber attack
where the hacker system takes over the
client's IP address a DDOS attack B man
in the middle attack c fishing attack d
password attack give it a thought and
leave your answers in the comment
section below three lucky winners will
receive Amazon gift vouchers with the
increase in the production of global
Digital Data it is anticipated that
cyber attacks will quadruple in the near
future organizations are going to need
cyber security professionals who can
prevent these attacks a career in the
field of cyber security is lucrative and
a very smart decision for professionals
now we humans are highly tech-savvy in
today's times with the extensive use of
the internet and modern Technologies
there is a massive challenge in
protecting all our Digital Data such as
net banking information account
credentials and medical reports to name
a few have you heard about the deadly
one to cry ransomware attack the attack
happened in May 2017 in Asia and then it
spread across the world within a day
more than 230,000 computers were
infected across 150 countries the oneac
cry crypto worm encrypted the data and
locked the users out of their systems
for decryption of the data the users
were asked for a ransom of $300 to $600
in Bitcoin the users who used the
unsupported version of Microsoft Windows
and those who hadn't installed the
security update of April 2017
were targeted in this attack the one a
cry attack took a toll on every sector
top tier organizations like Itachi
Nissan and FedEx had to put their
businesses on hold as their systems were
affected too now this is what you call a
Cyber attack to prevent such attacks
cyber security is implemented we can
Define cyber security as the practice of
protecting networks programs computer
systems and their components from
unauthorized digital attacks
these illegal attacks are often referred
to as hacking hacking refers to
exploiting weaknesses in a computer
network to obtain unauthorized access to
information a hacker is a person who
tries to hack into computer systems this
is a misconception that hacking is
always wrong there are hackers who work
with different motives let's have a look
at three different types of hackers
black hat hackers are individuals who
illegally hack into a system for a
monetary gain on the contrary we have
white hat hackers who exploit the
vulnerabilities in a system by hacking
into it with permission in order to
defend the organization this form of
hacking is absolutely legal and ethical
hence they are also often referred to as
ethical hackers in addition to these
hackers we also have the gray hat
hackers as the name suggests the color
gray is a blend of both white and black
these hackers discover vulnerabilities
in a system and report it to the
system's owner which is a good act act
but they do this without seeking the
owner's approval sometimes gray hat
hackers also ask for money in return for
the spotted
vulnerabilities now that you have seen
the different types of hackers let's
understand more about the hacking that
is legal and valid ethical hacking
through an interesting story Dan runs a
Trading Company he does online training
with the money his customers invest
everything was going well and Dan's
business was booming until a hacker
decided to to hack the company's servers
the hacker stole the credentials of
various trading accounts he asked for a
lump some Ransom in exchange for the
stolen credentials Dan took the Hacker's
words lightly and didn't pay the hacker
as a result the hacker withdrew money
from various customers accounts and Dan
was liable to pay back the customers Dan
lost a lot of money and also the trust
of his customers after this incident Dan
gave a lot of thought as to what could
have gone wrong with the security
infrastructure structure in his company
he wished there was someone from his
company who could have run a test attack
to see how vulnerable systems were
before the hacker penetrated into the
network this was when he realized he
needed an employee who thinks like a
hacker and identifies the
vulnerabilities in his Network before an
outsider does to do this job he hired an
ethical hacker John John was a skilled
professional who worked precisely like a
hacker in no time he spotted several
vulner abilities in Dan's organization
and closed all the loopholes hiring an
ethical hacker helped Dan protect his
customers from further attacks in the
future this in turn increased the
company's productivity and guarded the
company's
reputation so now you know hacking is
not always bad John in this scenario
exposed the vulnerabilities in the
existing Network and such hacking is
known as ethical hacking ethical hacking
is distributed into six different phases
let us look at these faces step by step
with respect to how JN our ethical
hacker will act before launching an
attack the first step John takes is to
gather all the necessary information
about the organization's system that he
intends to attack this step is called
reconnaissance he uses tools like inmap
and hping for this purpose Jon then
tries to spot the vulnerabilities if any
in the Target system using tools like
inmap and nexos this is the scanning
phase
now that he has located the
vulnerabilities he then tries to exploit
them this step is known as gaining
access after Jon makes his way through
the organization's networks he tries to
maintain his access for future attacks
by installing back doors in the Target
system the metas sploit tool helps him
with this this phase is called
maintaining access Jon is a brilliant
hacker hence he tries his best not to
leave any evidence of his attack
this is the fifth phase clearing tracks
we now have the last phase that is
reported in this phase JN documents a
summary of his entire attack the
vulnerabilities he spotted the tools he
used and the success rate of the attack
looking into the report Dan is now able
to take a call and see how to protect
his organization from any external cyber
attacks don't you all think JN is an
asset to any organization if you want to
become an ethical hacker like John then
there are a few skills that you need to
acquire first and foremost you need to
have a good knowledge of operating
environments such as Windows Linux Unix
and Macintosh you must have reasonably
good knowledge of programming languages
such as HTML PHP python SQL and
JavaScript networking is the base of
ethical hacking hence you should be good
at it ethical hackers should be well
aware of security laws so that they
don't misuse their skills finally you
must have a global certification on
ethical hacking to successfully bag a
position of an ethical hacker like John
few examples of ethical hacking
certification are certified ethical
hacker certification C CompTIA pentest
plus and licensed penetration tester
certification to name a few simply learn
provides a cyber security expert Masters
program that will equip you with all the
skills required by a cyber security
expert you could have a look at it by
clicking the link in the description so
here's a question for you in which phase
of ethical hacking will you install back
doors in the Target system a scanning B
maintaining access C clearing tracks D
reconnaissance give it a thought and
leave your answers in the comment
section below three lucky winners will
receive Amazon gift vouchers the endless
growth of Technology IES in this area is
directly proportional to the number of
cyber crimes cyber crimes are estimated
to cost $6 trillion in 2021 hence to
tackle these cyber crimes organizations

annual salary of a certified ethical
hacker is $91,000 in the US and
approximately rupes 7 lakhs in India so
what are you waiting for get certified
and become an ethical hacker like John
and put an end to the cyber attacks in
the world picture an employee at her
computer working with data in a
background a hacker secretly access her
company's or his company's confidential
files he or she steals sensitive
information and sells it to criminals
who then hold the company ransom for a
profit it sound like something out of
movie but unfortunately it's a common
occurrence in today's online landscape

the description box below so today we
will start our tutorial with an example
imagine a world where every 39 seconds a
Cyber attack occurs affecting businesses
governments and individuals alike and in
a digital age where data is the new goal
cyber security has become one of the
most critical fields to master and if
you have ever wondered how hackers
breach system or how companies protect
themselves against these threats you are
in the right place in this video we are
going to take you on a journey into the
fascinating world of cyber security
you'll break down the steps you need to
learn cyber security from building a
strong foundation in networking and
programming to mastering Advanced
Techniques like ethical hacking and
threat analysis we'll also share some of
the best resources and certifications
that can Propel your career forward and
this video will provide you with a clear
road map for you so get ready to unlock
the secrets of cyber security and start
your journey towards becoming a digital
Defender so here first we'll start with
the essential skills for an ethical
hacker or when you will learn cyber
security what skills you will need so
here we will see the list and the number
one is strong understanding of
networking so ethical hackers or cyber
Security Professionals need to have
understanding of networking protocols
how data travels across networks and the
vulnerabilities associated with
different network configurations then
comes programming and scripting so
Proficiency in programming languages
like python C C++ and scripting
languages is is crucial for writing
custom exploits and tools and then comes
cyber security fundamentals a solid
grasp of basic cyber security Concepts
including threats vulnerabilities risk
management and security principles is
fundamental and then comes operating
system familiarity with various
operating systems including Windows
Linux and Unix is essential for
understanding the vulnerabilities and
security configurations and then comes
web application security so knowledge of
web technologies that is web application
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection
crite scripting and security best
practices for web development and then
comes penetration testing tools so the
Proficiency in tools like metas sploit
and map wire shock bub suit and other
penetration testing tools used to assess
system vulnerabilities so these tools
you should have handson and these are
the skills that a cyber security
professional must possess and then comes
cryptography so understanding of
encryption decryption cryptographic
algorithms and their role in securing
data and then comes wireless security
expertise in wireless network security
including Wi-Fi encryption protocols and
vulnerabilities and then comes security
compliance and standards knowledge of
security standards and compliance
regulations such as pcic DSS HIPAA and
gdpr and then comes incident response so
being prepared to handle security
incidents and breaches effectively
including forensics and Analysis and
then comes social engineering awareness
so understanding of social engineering
tactics used by attackers to to
manipulate individuals into revealing
confidential information and then we
have the last that is ethical mindset as
a skill so an ethical hacker or a cyber
security professional must adhere to a
strong code of ethics and prioritize
responsible disclosure when
vulnerabilities are there and now we'll
start with how to learn cyber security
and we'll see the road map so the number
one thing you should have is Educational
Foundation so ethical hacking is all
about using your skills for good that is
helping to protect systems and data from
cyber threats and let's start from the
very beginning and build a strong
Foundation together number one is basic
education so first things first you need
to finish high school and during High
School try to focus on subjects like
mathematics computer science and it and
these subjects are essential because
they teach you how computers work and
how to think logically imagine you're
are building a house and math and
computer science are like the bricks and
morar you will need to construct a
strong study structure and then comes
higher education so After High School
consider pursuing a degree in computer
science information technology or cyber
security now you might be wondering do I
really need a degree well a degree can
definitely help it gives you a solid
foundation and is often preferred by
employers however it's not the way to
become an ethical hacker and if you're
passionate and committed you can learn
the necessary skills on your own and
many successful hackers or cyber
Security Professionals have taken this
selftaught truth and remember it's not
just about the degree it's about the
skill skills and knowledge you gain
along the way and employers are looking
for people who can solve problems and
think creatively whether they have a
degree or not now that you have covered
the educational Basics let's move on to
the exciting part that is developing the
essential technical skills you will need
and this is where you will start to
build your hacker toolkit with essential
skills and ready to gear up with some
serious learning so let's dive in and
here you'll see developing essential
skills number one is programming and if
I tell you why it's important so
programming is like learning a new
language but for communicating with
computers so why it's important and now
we'll see what to learn so start with
python because it's beginner friendly
and Powerful then pick up C and C++ for
understanding lowlevel operations and
JavaScript for web based hacking and
then we'll see how to practice so write
small scripts automate task and
eventually build your own hacking tools
and after that comes networking so let's
see why it's important so networks are
like the Roads connecting all computers
and understanding networking is crucial
because it's where most hacking happens
and what to learn for this so learn
about IP addresses subnets protocols
like tcpip and how data travels across
networks and how to practice so set up
your own network Lab at home using
virtual machines and experiment with
different networking setups now coming
to operating systems with the essential
skills only and the first thing we'll
see is why it's important so most
teching tools are designed for specific
operating systems especially Linux and
and then comes what to learn so get
comfortable with Linux that is dros like
Kali Linux that are designed for
security task and understand the basics
of Windows and Mac OS and then comes how
to practice so use Linux as your main OS
and play around with terminal commands
and understand file system structures
and then we have security Concepts and
we'll see the first thing that is white
important so security concepts are like
the rules of the game knowing them helps
you understand how to break and fix
things and then we have what to learn so
focus on encryption that is how data is
protected firewalls how to defend
networks vpns how to secure connections
and idas how to detect intrusions and
let's see how to practice them so
Implement these security measures in
your own systems and try to bypass them
to see how they work so these are the
core skills that form the backbone of an
ethical hackers knowledge or a cyber
security Professional Knowledge and it's
not just about learning them but
practicing and applying them in the real
world scenarios great you have build a
Sol Educational Foundation if you are
following this and developed essential
skills now let's talk about
certifications and certifications are
like Badges of Honor that show you have
got the Knowledge and Skills to be an
ethical hacker and they can open doors
to job opportunities and validate your
expertise so now we'll talk about some
of the key certifications that you can
consider so number one is CH that is
certified ethical hacker and talking
about whites important so the C is one
of the most recognized certifications in
the ethical hacking World it CES the
fundamental of ethical hacking and
teaches you the mindset and tools
hackers use and now we'll see what it
demonstrates so by earning this
certification you show that you
understand the core principles of
ethical hacking including how to scan
test and hack systems and how to get it
or achieve it so you can study the CH
curriculum which includes topics like
footprinting scanning enumeration and
system hacking then pass the CH exams to
get certified now coming to the next
certification that is coma Security Plus
and first we'll see why it's important
so Security Plus is a great starting
point for a career in cyber security it
covers a wide range of security topics
from network security to risk management
and if I tell you what it demonstrates
so this certification proves you have
the foundational knowledge required for
any cyber security role and it's often a
stepping stone to more advanced
certifications and how to get it so
prepare by studying the comta Security
Plus material focusing on key areas like
threats attacks vulnerabilities and
security architecture you can pass the
Security Plus exam to earn your
certification now coming to the next
certification that is ocp or offensive
security certified professional first
thing we'll note about it is why it's
important so ocp is known for its
Hands-On practical approach and it's
highly respected in the industry because
it requires you to actually perform
hacking techniques in a controll
environment and if I tell you what it
demonstrates so earning the OSP shows
you you can identify exploit and
document vulnerabilities in various
systems and it's proof of your practical
hacking skills and if I tell you how to
get it so you can complete the offensive
Securities penetration testing with K
Linux course and then pass the rigorous
OSP exam which involves a 24hour hacking
challenge so this is all about OSP now
moving to the next certification that is
cissp so first thing is why it's
important so cissp is an advanced
certification aimed to those looking to
move into higher level security roles
like management or architecture and if I
tell you what it demonstrates it shows
you how to have a deep understanding of
cyber security principles and you can
design Implement and manage a
best-in-class cyber security program and
how to get it you can study the eight
domains of the cissp that is common body
of knowledge which includes security and
risk management asset security and
security engineering you can pass the
cissp exam and meet the work experience
requirements to get certified and these
certifications not only validate your
knowledge but also make you stand out in
the job market they are a testament to
your dedication and expertise in the
field of ethical hacking so next we will
explore how to gain practical experience
and this is where you will put your
knowledge to the test and Horn your
skills in real world scenarios so ready
to dive into some handson action so
let's move on so the next part is number
fourth that is gain practical experience
so I will say that's awesome that you
have go to education developed essential
skills and earn some certifications now
we are coming to this part that is now
it's time to get hands on and gain
practical experience experience this is
where the real fun begins applying what
you have learned in real world scenarios
number one is labs and simulations so
labs and simulations provide a safe
environment to practice hacking skills
without the risk of breaking any laws
they allow you to experiment and learn
from your mistakes so you could use the
platforms like hack the Box try hack me
and cyber SEC laabs that are fantastic
resources and these resources offer a
variety of challenges and scenarios that
may make real world systems and networks
so internships and level positions
provide Real World experience and a
chance to apply your skills in a
professional setting they also help you
build a network on Fitness St contacts
you can seek out internships or jobs in
it Network Administration or cyber
security so these roles will give you
hands-on experience with the systems and
Technologies you will be protecting as
an ethical hacker you can check job
boards company websites and Linkedin for
openings and don't be afraid to reach
out to companies directly to inquire
about internship opportunities you can
tailor your resume to highlight your
skills and certific ations and be
prepared to discuss your hands-on
experience from labs and simulations and
after that comes the bug Bounty programs
so bug Bounty programs are an essential
or excellent way to test your skills in
the real world scenario companies offer
these programs to identify security
vulnerabilities in their systems and
they reward you for finding and
Reporting these issues so platforms like
hacker one and Bug Crow connect ethical
hackers with companies offering bug
bounties and these platforms provide a
legal and structured way to test your
skills and you can create profiles on
hacker one and bu and you can start by
reading through the rules and scope of
each program to understand what's
allowed and you can begin with lower
risk programs and gradually move to more
complex ones as you find and Report
vulnerabilities you will gain
recognition and potentially earn money
for your foundings and after that we
have practical experience that is
invaluable and it's where Theory meets
reality and by practicing in Labs
gaining Real World Experience through
internships and participating in bug
Bounty programs you will hone your
skills and build a strong portfolio
and after that comes stay updated so
cyber security is a rapidly evolving
feed and staying updated is crucial for
maintaining your Edge and here's how you
can keep your knowledge fresh number one
is continuous learning so the landscape
of cyber security is always changing
with new threats and Technologies and
you can keep up with the latest news
blogs and forums and great resources
like crabs on security dark raing and
the Reddit netc community so make it a
habit to read articles and participate
in discussions regularly and you can
also subscribe to newsletters and follow
key influencers in the cyber security
space and then we have conferences and
workshops so these events are excellent
for networking and learning about the
latest trends and techniques and key
conferences like DFC blackhead and RSA
conference are most attend events for
ethical hackers and you can attend these
events either in person or virtually and
you can take advantage of workshops
seminars and networking opportunities to
connect with other professionals and
then we have online courses continuous
education helps you keep your skills
sharp and up to- dat and platforms like
corsera udmi and Cy offers a wide range
of courses on various cyber security
topics and you can enroll in courses
that cover new tools techniques and
Concepts and I have already mentioned a
course with simply learn that is proven
and technically guaranteed so you can
regularly update your skills and
knowledge through these platforms now
coming to sixth point that is join the
community so being part of the cyber
security Community is invaluable for
your career growth and here's how you
can get involved number one is
networking so networking with other
professionals can provide valuable
insights support and job opportunities
and the professional organizations like
the information system security
Association Isa and the EC Council are
great places to start you can attend
meetings join discussion groups and
participate in events and building a
strong Network can open doors to New
Opportunities and collaborations and
then we have mentorship so Mentor can
guide you share resources and help you
navigate your career path you can look
for experienced ethical hackers who are
willing to m you you can reach out
through professional networks
conferences or online communities and
having a mentor can provide you with
personalized advice and support and now
we see the companies hiring ethical
hackers so there are many companies
across various Industries those are
looking for skilled ethical hackers and
some prominent employers include Tech
giants like Amazon asenta Google Apple
Intel Microsoft and Facebook and cyber
security firms like firei Po Alto
networks and crowd strike they're
consulting firms and then we have Deo
PWC and KPMG and then we have financial
institutions like JB Morgan JS and Bank
of America and we have also
telecommunication companies like veryone
and AT&T Healthcare organizations like
United Health Group and government
agencies like the NSA and FBI so job
roles for ethical hackers and those
penetration testers conduct simulated
attacks to find vulnerabilities then we
have cyber security analist they monitor
and analyze security systems then we
have security consultant they advise
organizations on best security practices
then we have security engineer they
develop and maintain security systems
and then we have incident responder so
investigating and responding to security
baches are their role and then we have
the average salaries for these so
salaries for ethical hackers vary by
location and experience so if I talk you
about in India so entry level positions
typically earn between 4 lakhs and 6
lakhs per year while senior roles can
command between 15 lakhs and 25 lakhs
per year and in the United States and
salaries range from $770,000 to $90,000
per year but with senior positions
earning can be vary between
$130,000 to $170,000 per year let's do
the basics first and then we'll come to
the point of
discussion right so let's move on to our
topic of the evening and our first
domain Enterprise infrastructure
security all right uh we discussing
about risk management so let's start the
tonight's topic uh and uh proceed right
so we'll be discussing about risk
management in the information security
where you'll understand the concepts of
cyber security the CIA tried uh we'll
enumerate various factors involving risk
management uh we'll be able to uh
understand the definition between
quantitive and qualitative risk analysis
and also categorize various type of
security control method right and uh
normally we start with a scenario all
right we start with the scenario and the
scenario is you have joined a major
corporation as a cyber security
specialist in your new role as a cyber
security specialist you must help in
securing the organization's Information
Systems right that's your job as a cyber
security expert a specialist now your
job enters in protecting systems from
cyber risk threats and vulnerabilities
by monitoring and detecting uh
investigating analyzing and responding
to security events like Insurance events
so uh the task uh you have been given
are identify the potential threats uh to
the organizations CRI assets identify
vulnerabilities to organization assets
determine risks uh and for identify risk
perform something known as risk analysis
and recommend appropriate responses this
is what you'll be learning uh on the job
as we proceed the basics first uh what
is cyber security very simple everyone
of us knows it refers to the process of
securing sensitive data and critical
systems from cyber threats right we'll
cover what is a threat what is sensitive
data what is vulnerabilities exploits as
we proceed in our discussions right uh
the goal is to protect the
confidentiality integrity and
availability we'll cover I tried that is
c i c stands for confidentiality I
stands for integrity a stands for
availability of a organization critical
Assets Now the assets would be your
networks your computers your programs
your data your human being your
facilities anything is an asset for an
organization you agree with me all of
you what is an asset in an organization
anything which is a property of an
organization anything which gives uh
helps boost the organizations uh
productivity per right understood right
right so that is the goal of cyber
security to protect the organization
allow it to flourish continue doing
business right so let's come to our
Blackboard and I will start
our topic discussions the first topic uh
will be discussing about
security and risk management
right would you want everything in white
or would you prefer a red font how does
it look white or red font your choice
white is
better okay great thank
you so I intend to share this with you
once uh every session is complete yeah
jues is f wonderful okay uh white
background is it or black background
with white font this is what I do I use
black background with white font but I
can always change it no problem you can
I have it like this also the white
background with black font good let's
start with our discussion so what I do
normally okay let's have the
introductory discussions yeah okay let's
start with security and risk management
so I'll give you the introduction then
we'll uh move on further uh uh on our
topics right so let's have this
discussion completed okay what is the
issue right so information
security and risk management are
analogous with each
other
analogous with each other this is how I
will create notes share it with you at
the end of the day now as you see in uh
it is clear I we can increase the font a
bit more for all of us to see have a
better look right the security and risk
management domain forms the Baseline for
all information security Concepts and
practices now in this topic we'll be
focusing on
Concepts and key
areas such as the asset
protection confidentiality integrity and
availability
security governance and
principles
compliance legal and Regulatory issues
that pertain to information security in
the global
context professional
ethics personal security
policies risk management
principles threat
modeling business continuity
planning security risk considerations in
acquisition strategy and
practice security education training and
awareness right at the primary this is
what we'll be covering throughout as we
proceed right so we'll be discussing all
of these one by one now uh this is
something uh which I'm covering through
my own notes uh through my understanding
of what I have learned throughout the
years right so uh remember this is the
Practical part of it which we are
discussing you'll have to go back and
understand it uh during the weekend or
week whenever you are let's start with
an
illustration so let's start with an
illustration let me get my pen activated
there is uh please allow me a minute so
that I can set up my white
pen and writer and just give me I think
I missed the connector somewhere okay
great so let's start with a particular
illustration I think I will do one thing
I can't find my pen as of now so I can
create over here itself let's draw
shapes and type it there itself so uh
first thing I will cover the topics one
by one black yeah asset
insert so consider
this
asset I'll have to I want to get this
book over here right yeah so consider an
asset in an organization right now uh we
will cover the definition let me
complete the diagram and I'll explain it
to you what do you mean by asset and why
we need to discuss on it right so
there's asset then uh when you have an
asset you you need to protect the asset
right you need to protect so assets as I
said can be a human resource can be
computers can be your facilities can be
anything right
uh
let's understand an
asset
basically
requires protection so let's copy this
get it over here okay I'm creating a
diagram for ease of
understanding oh yeah I think this
should be good yeah so it needs
protection once the diagram is ready we
can talk about it in Greater
detail right now this protection will be
based on something and what is that
something what is that something is okay
the C8 fired which we'll be discussing
in our top fix ahead so the protection
has to be based on let's have this thing
again
baste we need
requires
requires this thing requires
protection and this protection will be
based on shapes do I have a triangle
yeah will be based on the C I a Triad
which is C stands
for uh let's make it
bigger Okay C stands for confident
confidentiality right can I copy this uh
and the a stands for
availability uh yeah it would have been
easier I did find the find the pen but
connector to my
yeah so a stands for
availability uh there's an i over here
so let's
have and I which says it is
integrity we'll be covering all these
terminology so those who have are
confused not sure what is happening do
not worry we'll cover it right this is
your CIA a Triad this is your CIA Triad
so understand we have a asset which
requires protection and this protection
will be based
on
the is based on the CI trial right so
important remember so let's have this
color coded for
e and actually I'm beautifying it
nothing else so right
so that's it make this as green so that
you can see it
better green right so you have an asset
it needs protection the protection will
be based on the CIA R right now what is
an asset at the onset what is an asset
asset is it's not straight let's make it
St an asset is nothing but let me make
it here we increase the arrows length so
that I can add here and what is an
asset yeah uh asset is your Hardware
software information people personal let
me see how can I get it here oh
interesting okay so your physical
Hardware now this is creating trouble
for me I don't know uh it should have
worked normally it does but I normally
make these diagrams using my pen I never
use this so this is what is causing the
issue and if I type it is typing
somewhere
else yeah so like I said uh and uh I
assume we are out of the
initial issues right so let's start so
like I said uh the asset uh which we
were discussing what is an asset is
asset is nothing but your Hardware
so your
software right then it could
be so it could be your uh people right
and information right all of them are
considered to be Assets Now this is yes
everything is an asset your facilities
also can be called an asset so assets
can Hardware software people information
and as is the case soer all of them will
require will require excuse
me yeah all of them will require
protection all of them will require
protection okay so uh we need to protect
it now we've already talked the
protection will be based on RC I
confidentiality integrity and
availability per say right so let's uh
this oh excuse
me it is
misbehaving no interesting it is not
allowing me to delete this is the line
visible okay you are also able to see
this line which has come up
right okay yeah my apology is the you it
should not have happened like
that interesting it is a
glitch okay now let's move on further
and we'll discuss it if the issue comes
up now this CIA will primarily be given
uh or will be decided based on certain
certain other aspects right and those
aspects would be your
security
security compliance we'll cover this so
uh you'll understand it better
compliance and policies all right so
this CIA will will be primarily based on
security compliance and policies now
again this
also will be ensured through the CIA
will be ensured through let me move it a
bit like this can I just use it like
this yeah it will be Ensure
to
ensured
through security
governance
security
governance
right
and through
compliance compliance this will be
demonstrated through compliance right
now uh
understand uh let's get these boxes in
place so here it
is yeah just trying to get everything in
place um second blocks is the compliance
box over here and we'll make it slightly
looking
right
yeah okay here it is excuse me yeah
coming back to our discussion understand
this security
governance will be driven through
compliance so this security governance
will be driven through
compliance
so
driven
through compliance okay so as of now
most of you must be feeling that this is
all jish but we'll cover it as we
proceed so don't worry right so uh this
is a diagram which we'll be referring
regularly hence I'm creating the diagram
over here right now this compliance will
be
primarily based on certain aspects such
as so the compliance will be based on
certain things which will'll be covering
one by one that is legislations or
regulatory uh so let's say
legislative
legis
dative then
regulatory
regulatory
privacy related
issues all right privacy related issues
right
uh
also uh it will be for example let's say
it will be based on pcss now we'll cover
what is pcss as we proceed regulations
Hippa or
gdpr
gdpr right so we'll cover this as we
proceed Now understand uh the most
important thing we need to understand is
an asset it is Hardware software people
information facility everything and all
of it right now this asset needs to be
protected right the asset needs to be
protected and this protection will be
based on confidentiality integrity and
availability right now this CI a will be
demonstrated using compliance which is
primarily based on legislative
regulatory privacy related issues and
regulations and uh the security
governance will ensure it right now what
is security governance it is nothing but
management practices right standards
policies
procedures that is security governance
so a few things to be remembered over
here where here it is so remember
security governance is nothing
but
management
practices right then it will be your
standards
policies and
procedures procedures we'll cover the
definition uh after this right you
should remember that security governance
in can be ensured by proper management
practices standards policies and
procedures right basically this complete
stuff will give you or will
provide
insights I need to slow down
insights into something known as
security controls the protection me
mechanisms right your uh personal
security and
professional
ethics all
right okay now go all of this in is
interrelated hence we are covering it
like that now this particular aspect
of security controls excuse me I it
select
yeah all these aspect of security
controls personal security professional
ethics will
be controlled by or can be ad
using your
compliance right we'll be adhering this
using adhering this using compliance
right now each term we be exping
explaining as we proceed ahead so don't
get confused right so this will
be
AED dear through right security
compliance okay is the diagram clear
right is the diagram clear asset needs
protection asset is nothing but Hardware
software people information protection
will be done through the use of
CIA uh compliance Integrity availability
uh okay uh this is primarily okay one
more box we'll create so that I can
differentiate otherwise my handwriting
is okay here it is so yeah now this
compliance CIA will be basically based
on security compant and policies right
now you can ensure the CIA by ensuring
you have proper security governance
which is management practices standards
policies and
procedures and this can be demonstrated
using compliance all right and
compliance can be added through security
controls personal security and
professional ethics right this is what
we are covering all in all in this
particular topic right so let's move on
with the explanation for each topic
mentioned over here any question so far
anything you would like to understand
anything which you like to discuss right
now we can discuss if you have any
questions we'll be covering
it
okay yeah anything you like to discuss
now please go ahead no wonderful
wonderful so let's come back to our
primary
discussion and here we
begin uh yes I will share the topic
notes uh d with you I will share this
particular page
itself this particular page I will be
sharing with you so do not worry uh I'll
share this document you can ask you can
go through this document whenever you
want and now we have a few questions
we'll address the questions one by one
so normally what I do is uh good the get
the questions here itself so let's
say can I
just give me a second I am setting up
the question so all questions which will
be discussed we add it here itself so
that I can talk about it and give you uh
an Insight so now all those questions
which will be answered uh for the topic
will be here so the first question is
who does the rule uh the question is who
decides the question is from caution
right so let me
just paste
it text only right so the question is
who does uh who decides okay the
spelling okay that does not matter who
decides the rule of
compliance okay so here's the answer for
you uh let me
dictate so the rules of compliance
are typically determined by a
combination
of regulatory
bodies industry standards
organizations governmental agencies and
sometimes International
agreements does that answer your
question
C information in asset means what so the
question
is what information asset means okay so
let me give you the answer on it now
information asset typically refers to
data and knowledge that is contained
within an
organization right so let's talk about a
bit
more now this particular aspect of
information can be either
tangible or or
intangible owned by individuals or an
organization right now this information
can take various forms and is often
critical to the functioning of an
asset uh there
are various types of Assets in case of
information intellectual property
uh Financial
assets physical
assets digital
assets human
capital do you understand if you talk
about information all these can be
called as assets which are either
tangible or intangible what is tangible
or intangible tangible is something
which you can touch intangible which
cannot be touched right like the air you
know it is there but you cannot touch it
same uh if you want to touch a tree it
is there both are
assets okay now how can we ensure that
the Integrity is maintained as per a CIA
now this is a uh topic which will be
discussing in our integrity uh
discussions per se but I can give you an
introduction on it right I can give you
an introduction on it and what is it
about now maintaining
Integrity maintaining
Integrity as a part of the CIA
Triad in information security is crucial
for ensuring that the data remains
accurate trustworthy and
unaltered uh this can be achieved by
strategies such
as data
encryption Access Control
data
validation audit
trials Version
Control uh security training and
awareness backup and
recovery so let's start with our topic
discuss so we address questions now
we'll uh work on the
uh terminologies which we used over here
one by one now important things to
remember important
points to remember
here okay let's understand this one by
one the first point assets
require
protection right so this is me typing
now uh there was too many typos
happening second
protection is based
on the
requirements of
confidentiality
integrity and
availability right for the
asset uh
security is
ensured
through security
governance that
compromises comprises rather
management
practices and
management and
management
oversight right
security is
demonstrated
through
compliance that
could be
legal or
regulatory in
nature let's try this
now compliance consists of adherence to
applicable legal and regulatory
requirements uh applicable
policies
standards procedures and
guidelines and personal Securities and
policies
also compliance can be affected by
security
issues now these are some of the
important points which we should
remember before we understand each topic
separately right before we understand
the complete terminologies which we saw
until now right so as you see over here
we talked about this diagram as an
introductory nature in this diagram we
need to understand these important
points and topics right this is
something which will allow you to better
understand what is happening and why are
we looking into this particular aspect
right in the diagram this is important
you should remember right so let's
proceed with our further
discussion right wherein we'll be
defining each of the topics one by one
over here so the first
thing let me just cover this question
for
you I will not number it I think
numbering would be difficult but let's
have the question State over here so is
Cia
tried company or organization specific I
should have asked you this question but
let's do it this
way now the CIA
Triad uh is not specific to any
particular company or organization
instead it is a fund FAL Concept in
information
security that applies universally across
various industri sectors and
organizations also the CIA trial
basically provides a framework for
understanding and addressing the core
objectives of information
security and these core objectives
are
confidentiality integrity and
availability these will be discussed as
we proceed
ahead
yeah all right so I think not many typos
this should work right so uhin doesn't
answer question it is not organization
specific at the onset wonderful your
question is addressed and put into the
notes for ease of
understanding of everyone now uh can you
give an example of security governance
can you give an example of security
governance we slightly jumping the gun
but I can give an example uh let's
say let's say let me think of an example
for you I will not type it I will just
explain it to you like this now let's
consider an example of a banking
industry yes you belong to which
industry are you working or are you a
student let's I'm just asking it so that
I can uh it'll be easy for me to
discuss yeah working in which industry
are you now let's consider an example of
uh security governance in the banking
industry for or the sector now if you
talk about
confidentiality or uh uh in case of the
banking industry ensuring
confidentiality would be Paramount for
protecting the customers and sensitive
information right because it is
financial now Banks Implement various
measures such as the encryption access
control and authentication mechanisms to
prevent unauthorized access to customer
accounts and transaction data right so
for example online bank banking platform
will use uh secure web Comm uh
communication right secure conne
connection on https yeah so you'll be
using https connectivity and multiactor
authentication to ensure that only
authorized users can access this account
that is confidentiality if you talk
about integrity you basically
maintaining the Integrity of financial
transactions by having check sums
digital signatures right to basically
verify the electronic transactions and
availability would be ensuring that when
a customer wants to access the banking
platform the online banking platform it
is available whenever it is demanded
without interruption the that is the CIA
now in this example security governance
in the banking industry will incorporate
the principles of the CIA to protect the
customer data maintain the Integrity
ensure the availability by placing
requisite processes mechanisms standard
operating processes your guidelines and
policies in place so you have to
implement the CIA protect the CIA having
a certain set of what what did we call
processes practices mechanism standards
guidelines in place and we'll cover
those definition as we yeah uh Zarin
your question is answered okay let's
let's proceed with the uh topic which we
were discussing let's start with asset
what is an asset so we discussed about
asset but we need to CL clearly
understand what do we understand by the
asset and
uh what all does an asset compromise of
right so let's proceed does that okay
now this is something which always
happens I'm just checking it and it has
again
Happ okay yeah yeah it is
now
uh asset can be
tangible that is perceptible by
touch uh an example of a tangible asset
could be a desktop computer or a
laptop assets can be intangible
also uh which are basically not
physically present you cannot touch it
for example uh corporate image or
intellectual property such as the
patents are intangible
assets clear so far so T assets are
tangible and intangible tangible is
basically what you can touch what you
can uh uh perceive uh with a touch right
intangible is something which is
understood we cannot just touch it
right now assets are used by the
organization for business purposes a
business
processes every asset whether tangible
or intangible has a certain intrinsic
value to the
business the value can be
monetary or of
importance or of both
for
example a simple firewall that cost less
than 10,000
$110,000 may be protecting important
business applications worth millions of
dollars is that understood so uh let's
take an example over here for example if
you have the Coca-Cola as an
organization right what is the most
unique selic Point wonderful see sh and
me are thinking on the same line so he's
given the same example of Coca-Cola
which has Coke as a primary uh what do
you say uh product which they sell right
and it it has a unique formula which is
kept secret for very very long now if
your server which is bought for say ,000
$10,000 has this formula kept inside the
server server itself is$ 10,000 but the
formula is worth millions of dollars
right so what is the server is the
tangible asset what is the data which
has the formula is a intangible asset
right so every asset whether it is
tangible or intangible you have value
Associated to it and the value will be
based on either monetary or
or uh the intrinsic value of the uh
asset per right so it is important for
the organization that is what you should
understand the weather
is
right right I think that's the right
weather yeah okay understood why asset
and how asset is important how you
should understand uh an organization may
get affected now if this particular
Coca-Cola's formula Coke formula is lost
as in it is available on the dark web
whaton Coca-Cola lose its unique selling
point it's competitive advantage in the
market will they will
right yeah they will right you agree
with me all of
you yeah so you should remember this is
what is an asset and when you have an
asset it needs to be protected if you
don't protect an asset you will lose it
and if you lose it that compromise may
get you out of the business you may file
for bankruptcy the organization May file
for bankruptcy right so that is why we
need to protect the
asset so if an asset is
compromised for example stolen or
modified and that data or secret
information is
disclosed it will have an impact that
could lead to mon
loss customer
dissatisfaction and or legal and
Regulatory
non-compliance right so this is what is
a problem you may have loss of customers
uh uh loss of money you may loss uh
regulatory issues may come up you'll be
fined you'll be punished there will be
penalties as an organization that is
something which will cause a lot of
issue question
says yeah I'll do that yeah thank you
can you please explain how people are an
asset
now uh see understand the people are the
most valuable assets within an
organization
because uh they have skills knowledge
experience creativity and relationship
that employee possesses which will
contribute
significantly to the success and
competitiveness of the
organization now anything which
contributes to the organization success
is considered as
a uh asset
so yeah so when you talk about uh human
beings right uh and how information
skills of the workforce can be
considered it can be considered under
say intellectual Capital right that is
collective knowledge expertise skills of
an employees similarly Innovative
Innovation and creativity can be
considered uh such that when employees
are able to innovate generate ideas
right uh customer relationship uh again
employees often develop very very strong
customer relationship let me just put it
in the bullet point Ro itself so let's
talk one by one on these so first one is
uh
intellectual
Capital so this is where the collective
knowledge expertise and skills of the
employees will represent intellectual
cap
capital uh Innovation and
creativity where employees basically uh
the ability of an employee to innovate
generate new ideas and solve complex
problems again can can be considered as
a critical asset for an organization
particularly where the industries are uh
or the industry have a rapid changing
scenario technology is changing
regularly right so that is where
employee can be considered or human
being can be considered as an
asset right so this is where you need to
understand why human being is considered
an asset right similarly uh you will
have customer relationship where in a
lot of organizations have employees
directly in touch with the customers now
customers trust these employees uh they
prefer to talk to these employees this
is where customer relationship uh and
the this is where your employee becomes
a uh asset right you cannot let go the
asset because you may even lose the
customer and even your organization
culture comes into play and that culture
basically uh uh
significantly uh what do you
say prefers the employees to be trained
in a certain way to be addressed in a
certain way making them an asset which
is which becomes indispensable or at
least a big time uh have big time
importance to the organization yeah
doesn't answer your question
Z okay why do you consider them an asset
because there are a lot of things which
they handle and this is uh all these
things which they handle can be
considered
as something which allows the
organization to grow in Long term right
okay until it types let's
proceed now assets are basically uh
grouped or generally grouped in a
certain uh certain ways and so how are
assets
generally
grouped so let's have this one by one so
first one is physical assets so let me
uh tell you what are physical assets So
Physical assets again are tangible in
nature and are examples could be say
um your
buildings
buildings
uh
Furniture
right uh HVAC systems
HVAC systems
right uh and so on so forth right so
these are considered as assets which are
physical in nature or physical assets
right so these are how you
can group Assets in various segments one
is physical let's move to the next one
which is Hardware
ass Hardware Assets Now when you talk
about Hardware assets these are in
information security per se if you talk
about
examples it would include your
servers desktops or desktop
computers
laptops
laptops
router
network
cables and so on so forth yeah so these
are the hardware Assets in information
security per so you are you can
differentiate your assets based on this
so we understanding what are the
different groupings of assets we talked
about physical we talk about Hardware
now the next one logically will come as
software
asset what are software assets okay
these are uh intangible assets if you
can refer to software as a intangible
assets right now uh these basically uh
can be utilized or are utilized
organization by having licenses right
yeah licenses or your intellectual
property can be uh considered over here
uh uh let's example would
be your operating system OS your dbms
database management system right uh
office
applications you're procuring it you do
not have uh you do not have your own
system you're buying it under license to
be utilized then your web
servers web
servers uh server softwares as we call
it
softwares right and so on so forth can
be considered as software assets clear
so
far yeah ad says the same product may
cause loss to other company Coca-Cola
example very true
right so those
are software assets right now another
group or another classification of
assets could be
information
information
assets assets right so if you talk about
information assets again these are
intangible in nature and they are owned
by an organization now this is these are
not
owned but licensed right
licensed right in this case these are
owned by the
organization right so example could be
your business
processes business
processes organizations business
processes then uh
policies
procedures
procedures
um customer
information right uh personal
information then uh agreements
[Music]
and
formulas
which are
developed inh
house in house right those
are so now uh developed inhouse or even
purchase so they are holding them after
purchasing right those are your
information assets clear so far physical
Hardware information
uh software and personal and the last
one is
personal
assets now uh these are basically people
associated
with associated with the
organization right for
example your employees
contractors uh maybe
vendors third party
Consultants right um what
else okay maybe these all few more will
come up here and there so these are your
personal
assets personal assets right got it so
you can group your assets into following
classifications physical Hardware
software information and personal all
these are important clear so far and
interestingly
after let's talk about asset now that we
know what is an asset let's talk about
asset
protection right so now if you remember
in our diagram we made an asset and say
it needs to be protected because it is
an asset so asset
protection we talk about asset
protection and what is it
about in information security
domain asset protection involves
security management practices that are
subjected to business and compliance
requirements such practice is for asset
protection are called security
controls various types of security
controls would
be physical entry controls to an office
building that allow only authorized
persons monitoring controls such as CCTV
for surveillance of critical
assets right so you have various
protection mechanisms and those prote
protection mechanisms are we referring
to physically stopping someone
monitoring it using
CCTV uh controls such as locks for
Hardware asset for protection from
theft uh tamper proofing controls such
as hashing and encryption for software
and data
assets copyrights are patent for
information access to protect legal
rights identity management systems to
protect personal assets from identity
theft all these are various controls or
prot protection mechanisms in place
right so now when you have an asset we
need to protect that asset for
protecting asset there are various
implementation which can be done a few I
have listed over here yeah now we should
understand that these are not
comprehensive list of security controls
it is now this list is an adhoc list as
of now so it will be basically decided
now this kind of asset protection
mechanism will basically be decided on
uh risk uh risk analysis your evaluation
of the risk assessment of the risk right
similarly controls will be identified
through risk mitigation strategies risk
assessment risk uh uh what do you say uh
decision of risk based on management
policy and this is where your analysis
of risk management or risk management
procedures will come into play so asset
prot
requires or has a requirement that it
would be based on risk in order to
understand the risk we will have to
understand risk assessment and select
the control based on the uh risk
analysis which is done right so we'll be
discussing this based on the
confidentiality integrity and
availability concept so uh if you have a
software be it open source or whatever
and it is being utilized to uh say uh uh
create value for business
okay anything which creates value will
be considered an asset remember that if
be it open source right now when you
talk about open source you can
categorize it into say software assets
right you're not owning it but you can
use it and when you use it you are
trying to look for value does that is
that uh understood ad is saying open
source software is not included in this
assets we can include it I have not made
it comprehens
you can add a lot of things into it you
just I give you an understanding of an
answer
okay okay all right so where are we uh
since I'm talking a lot about risk
management let me give you a small
introduction of risk assess uh
management before we proceed for our
discussions on uh the CIA the
confidentiality integrity and
availability now what why am I uh
referring to it always let where's my
connection this is something which is
important understand uh when you sit for
interviews for your uh as a say GRC
professional for cyber security what is
GRC stands for governance risk and
compliance
GRC right governance risk and compliance
you'll be asked such questions so you
have first job in Risk Management uh
would be to something known as inventor
inv
eviz assets so you will basically make a
list of assets held by an organization
these assets will be
prioritized
prioritized now these will be based on
what uh the prior will be done on
something known as business impact
analysis the
impact uh this as asset will have if
it's compromised in fact if asset is
compromised do you understand it now
when shya said that Coca-Cola is an
asset you list out the asset now if the
Coca-Cola's asset Coca-Cola's formula is
lost then what will happen you'll have a
big impact on the organization now that
impact is what will decide the priority
of an asset for an organization once
your assets are invent IED you will
understand the uh value of the assets uh
compromise based on something known
as
quantitative
and
qualitative analysis we'll cover this in
our future
discussions these analysis will allow us
to get something known as a dollar value
for your asset for asset right and what
will be the issue in case they are
compromised once we have these dollar
values with us then based on this value
uh we will be
based based on these
calculations we will select controls
we
will
select
controls right controls controls are
what protective mechanisms now in case
Coca-Cola's formula you can say controls
can
be controls can
be
encryption yeah Access Control
Access Control right your say
cctvs your uh guard
dogs right these are controls protective
mechanisms right and once the controls
are in place we cannot stop over there
we'll have to
review the
controls
periodically periodically because it may
so happen after a certain time period
these controls may not be effective or
the data may not require that of
protection okay this is where your
complete structure of uh Asset
Management asset Security Management and
risk management comes into play now this
is a this is in inux the risk management
discussion which we are going to right
this is the introduction I have given
you so don't worry uh just take it as
I've shown you and I'll give you an
example let's say uh let's connect all
these steps as asked over here let's say
uh in the example take an example of our
friend Coca-Cola right coca cocaa right
Coco Cola and their formula for
Coca-Cola now if you consider this
formula as your
asset what would you do you will think
that first question in when you sit for
analysis of a risk with respect to uh
this formula is that
uh who firstly
uh what is the
threat
associated with
this
asset right so now you tell me what
threat is associated with this formula
exactly
breach of uh data right breach of data
uh is a
threat uh now if this next question to
be addressed if you know what is the uh
threat
Associated if you know what is the
threat Associated which is breach of
data then you need to un answer next
question how much
loss how much loss will happen if this
is loss if this happens if this things
becomes successful or you can call it
as
if the
risk
materializes
materializes then what is the case right
so if you now know that the asset is
Coca-Cola's formula the threat is breach
of data then you will know the weakness
now what is this this is the weakness or
vulnerability vulnerability you know the
vulnerability you know the threat right
once you know the vulnerability the
weakness and the threat and you need to
understand the impact it will have on
the business find out the dollar value
so you'll have to calculate the dollar
value based on say what do you feel
about it what will happen to the
business we will say I feel I know that
the business will be out of uh I mean it
will it won't be able to function we
will lose competitive advantage that is
known as
quanti or sorry that is known as
qualitative
analysis what you feel about it the
feeling of it yeah so impact is high
medium or low what is called the impact
would be
high medium
or low and at the same time you can also
use another calculative method which is
known
as
quantitive analysis now you'll use
analysis this is where you'll use
mathematics and get something known as
dollar value so you know that there will
be a $10 million loss in case this
formula is lost I'm just giving your ad
hoc number what do you get you get the
understanding what is the impact on the
business now you know that based on this
value
now
based on this
value we now
know
what will
happen if
this as
asset is
lost right we know right understood we
know this right that if this asset is
loss was calculated it we understood it
now based on that you will select a
select
a
protective
mechanism to
protect this asset
asset understood is that
understood say we have the formula
coming up when we come to this is just a
generalized discussion you have we have
the formula coming up right so now we
know for example let's say when I said
uh when I said the
loss or the value of this comp my asset
is said $10 million right $10 million
now you will Pro protect put a control
put a control
which will not cost or which will be
less than the loss of uh compromise as
in we want something which is costing us
or saving us from this loss and does not
cost itself uh $10 million and more the
the cost of the control as is the case
over here right so we select something
which is saving on the uh compromise and
also not costing us us that that much so
if by any chance the cost of the control
is higher than the compromise itself the
management will not approve you
understand that right if cost of
control is greater
than
loss
after compromise as in let's say if the
data is lost I lose $10 but in order to
protect the data I need $100 will the
management approve it
yes will the manager approve
it Senior Management will approve it is
it no right financially economically
does not make a sense that's the reason
you put a control if the control is
within now that this is again with
respect to risk strategy this is where
so you'll think of risk strategy in this
case so you will either uh excuse me
strategy you will either
accept risk
RK mitigate
risk uh avoid
risk right except mitigate avoid and
what is it another
one uh accept mitigate avoid what is the
fourth one anyone
knows transfer very nice transfer thank
you so what is accept I accept that this
is loss is going to happen I do not
intend to do anything mitigate I will
reduce the levels of the impact I will
reduce the impact aoid I'll just totally
leave it and transfer I'll basically do
an insurance something like that okay
that is where risk strategy come into
place okay so the control in this case
will be placed will be
encryption uh of the
formula uh
guards
dogs
CCTV uh building with access control
everything yeah so on so forth
understood is it I just ran through the
example to explain it but we'll be
covering it as we proceed in the session
what we understood last time was about
risk management we understood what is
the cyber security before we proceed uh
further uh how many of you are
proficient in Linux have been handling
lenux operating system uh wherein you
can do uh commands on the terminal
uh maybe run an application to uh
scanning and all through the terminal
how many of you are uh proficient
internet right so this is your Ki Linux
machine which you'll be using now that
Ki is up uh excuse me let me just
complete a few Theory things once the
theory is complete uh we'll be
discussing uh Linux today primarily uh
the command line uh of Linux terminal
and how you navigate around the Linux
machines okay I'm setting a small 15
questions Linux quiz for all of you
which we'll be running now just to
understand about Linux uh comfort of
your
people uh the class code just a sec I'll
share it uh we'll have this quiz running
right now
Linux
Basics plus uh create a in and then we
log in just use the uh the class code is
given on your url can you see the URL if
I just use your own uh if on your screen
can you see on this part of the URL uh
you have the class code mentioned that
you can
use uh and the answer just login Linux
basics
uh one
sec uh the class code ganga you're
already a part of the class right oh the
link expired no problem I'll share it
with you
so uh we talked about CIA Tri uh the
confidentiality integrity and
availability as such uh how it needs to
be
protected uh we understood the CIA Tri
we understood what is confidentiality
Integrity availability and the attacks
on them uh basically uh each threat each
particular uh uh what do you say the
pillar of cyber security that is the
confidentiality integrity and
availability has various threats
Associated to it uh those will be
intentional attacks primarily the man in
the middle attacks the packet sniffing
attacks the hacking attacks there could
be accidental leakage through UNT
employees right someone who is
misconfigured something right there
could be issues with authentication
authorization and failures okay because
there's lack of lease privilege need to
know there could be Hardware or software
failures that's a threat to the
confidentiality again how do you protect
yourself if there's an issue for uh if
there's a threat to the confidentiality
you encrypt you ensure there's Access
Control mechanisms in place you have
administrative controls now the biggest
example of administrative controls is
the documentation which is done the
various uh agreements which are done for
example when you join a new
organization normally you sign something
known as uh the acceptable use policy
how many of you have signed a acceptable
use policy and a non-disclosure policy
in an organization just say yes on the
chat if I have right Sha has done it
Niha Leander everyone has seen now what
is this this is basically a
administrative control a counter measure
a protection mechanism in order to
protect the organization against breach
of confidentiality right so that is a
administrative control okay uh rest all
is very clear right then comes Integrity
as we all know Integrity is something
wherein we do not want unauthorized
changes to data by unauthorized or
authorized users now remember one very
interesting fact about integrity
Integrity is to be protected at any
given moment for either the data at rest
or the data in transit data at rest
which stored with you which has which is
archived with you or the organization
and data at uh Transit data in motion is
something wherein data is moving on the
network that Network could be internet
that Network could be intranet right and
it has to be protected anyone anyone
does anything as an if it's an
authorized user making unauthorized
changes that is not should not happen if
it's an unauthorized user obviously
there should not be uh allowed to do any
changes to the data that is integrity
and the protection required for it I've
already covered the threat there should
not be accidental modification uh there
should not be intentional
alteration uh another threat is system
malfunction now sometimes your system
just crashes and it causes uh what do
you call it but your basically there's a
corruption in the data that is system
malfunction issue and there could be
environmental factors now if you have a
uh hard disk which is a magnetic hard
disk with you and you place it on a uh
say a speaker on your at home which has
a magnet Building inside you will
realize that your data will get
corrupted right these are environmental
factor or if there's a strong uh em uh
environment electromagnetic environment
around the magnetic hard your data will
get correct Ed so that is what is the
threat to integrated yeah so we've
covered this I'm just covering the
slides per what is the production
mechanism you use cryptographic hash to
ensure that the data can be checked if
there's a integrative breach or not it
cannot avoid uh a threat to Integrity
but it can tell you if the data has been
compromised or not right similarly check
some database Integrity referential
Integrity yeah so we are checking about
the the Integrity right we are checking
if the data is being has been changed in
transit or not for example let's say you
have an organization wherein the data is
backed up every few hours in a backup
facility away from the main facility now
this data uh will be utilized whenever
there's a situation there's an incident
where in the backup is to be uh called
upon for restoring the systems now in
order to the backup in order that the
backup should work we also have to
regularly check check if the data is
still relevant if the data is still good
the Integrity is not compromised right
that is where your hashes will come into
play we have cryptographic discussions
coming ahead but understand what is a
cryptographic hash cryptographic hash is
something which is a oneway function uh
by one way function I mean to say that
uh any input given to this algorithm the
cryptographic hash algorithm or hashing
algorithm will make give you a fixed
output of a string of characters these
string of characters are non-reversible
as in if you have these string of
characters you cannot go to the input
first thing secondly a small change in
the input will have a corresponding
large change on the output that means if
the data is being sent on the uh data
has been compromised even by minutest of
the birs there'll be huge change in the
hashing value and that tells you that
the data has been tampered with the
attack is on the Integrity of the data
you understood cryptographic hash yeah
at least the concept you got it right
we'll have a greater discussion coming
on it at least the hash is clear uh the
Integrity is clear wonderful thank you
Zarin ARA let's move on okay uh then
availability now very simple if you go
on amazon.com and you try and order a
particular
product so an example it's very easy uh
for hashing algorithm uh for
cryptographic hash let's give you an
example uh
hash calculator actually I wanted but
let's see yeah yeah it
is yeah which is the online hashing
algorithm right uh
now now let's say Amit is sending data
to s
right and the data
says we will have a
secret
meeting at
2200 hours tonight right so this is your
message with Amit is sending sending to
sayi you are working in say the CIA or
or any intelligence agency and you're
sending this data to one another and uh
we are we want to the both of them want
to ensure that the data is not changed
in the transit so what they do they
decide that we will receive the data
irrespective but we will pred decide an
algorithm for hashing now that algorithm
as for them we can have several
algorithms as you see on the screen over
here let's say they site an hashing
algorithm of md5 this is one of the few
hashing algorithm just an example they
decide that the Integrity check will be
done with md5 algorithm right between
both of them them Sai and Amit now this
is the message which is sent along with
the message the hashing value is also
sent so what what does Amit do he first
creates the message then runs the md5
algorithm and gets the hash value so
what does amid do let's say I will send
you on the chat also uh this is your
message and the hash value I'll put it
on the chat itself so this is the hash
value so what Amit does he sends the
message encrypted unencrypted however
and hash value along with the message
can you see on the chat Amit has sent
both the details right so I've sent it
on the slack Channel too now what
happens is Avinash is a hacker who is
standing in between both of them there's
a amit's computer or the messaging
system is
compromised what Avinash does he changes
this to say he just adds instead of 2200
OD he makes it 2300 ODS can you you see
Small Change not much change right rest
all stays the same and uh he sends this
message to uh he sends it ahead right
now when uh our friend uh Sai receives
this message he calculates the hashing
value right now ainash the hacker does
not know what uh algorithm is utiliz for
hashing just uh assume that he does not
know anything so what s does when he
receives the message he sees the hash
value right he sees the hash value so
this is the message I'm sending on chat
right now and the hash value uh which uh
our friend s calculates is visible over
here now let's compare both the values
let's compare both the values so for
this the hashing value got to First yeah
so this is the hashing value and the
previous example this is the hashing
value can you see does the hash value
match tell me do the hash values match
his team they don't what does it tell
Sai when he calculates the hash value
and seees that the values do not match
because he has the previous value sent
by Amit and he has now calculated
calculated his own md5 hash algorithm
value for this particular data what does
uh s know now SII says that data has
been tampered with it is not a shity
that it's a compromise
because uh sometimes when you send data
on the network it may so happen the data
gets corrupted right so there's a
possibility that either there's a
compromise or there's a system failure
but the data has compromised the data
has tampered right the data is changed
obviously the data cannot be relied on
do you get the concept uh yeah this is
how hash works this is how your
integrity check works so now this is
exactly what happens when the data flows
from the
internet when uh you send data from a
client to a server along with the data a
hash value is sent and this is exactly
what happens between the client and
server pre calculated hash is sent and
post receipt of the data the server also
calculates the
hash yeah the server also calculates the
hash Bas that's the point uh when size
receives this message he knows the uh
that he has to meet at 2300 hours but he
also knows the data is tampered with
obviously he will not follow the
instructions the data he says the
message has been tampered with that
means somebody has a malicious intent of
changing the data somebody has changed
it and when something is changed you
don't work on it and then there are
other channels to confirm what was the
message and all that is a different
thing already yeah just say yes if you
do
yeah this receiver has absolutely no
idea what change has been done he just
knows the data is changed he has
absolutely no idea what has changed but
he knows the data is changed and once
you know the data is changed you just
drop the data simple right I will not
follow the instructions or you will ask
for retransmission in the network
language because the hash changed value
changed yes the hash value is sent by
the sender to the receiver
yes there are ways and means to crack
the hash there are ways and means to
protect the hash we'll come to that we
will yes yes every time uh we receive a
message we will calculate the hash value
compare it this is exactly what happens
on the network also on internet also
everything depends on everything but
hash will give you the Integrity
check as in it confirm if the data has
been compromised tampered or changed or
not yeah there are enormous number of uh
algorithms attacker can keep on trying
however long he wants or she wants how
would uh tell me you have received a
message 10 times with different hash
values from the sender will you still
believe in the message you won't right
the hashes algorithm are pre- decided
between the sender and receiver it's a
part of initial hand check I'll show you
a demo on that uh I can give you a demo
on that but we'll divert completely the
attacker can spoof IPS but in data the
attacker cannot control the hash value
yeah I can show you in fact I am going
to show you uh uh internet transaction
how does the internet transaction
happens wherein how you start the
connectivity how hashes are how
algorithms are exchanged how data is
transmitted how everything is calculated
it will work yeah we it's a part of uh
my syllabus uh not just simply learns an
additional thing to tell which I I will
show it to you if you want to understand
the name I'll be talking about TCP
handshake uh on the network I'll be
talking about TLS hand check uh do you
understand what is a TLS
hand do you know what is a TLS yes full
form please if you don't know it TS is
yeah yeah tell me see when data is
transmitted over the Internet it is
known as transport layer security yeah
that is encrypted right when the sent so
the TLs is a transport layer security
approach and this is where your data is
encrypted along the net in the network
and for that the algorithms are pre
decided the handshake tells so um now
that we have jumped into it let me tell
you what happens is let's say I am
talking to mahavir so I cannot just talk
to mahavir right I will first seek his
permission I will say mahavir may I talk
to you mahavir will say yes let's talk
what am I doing I'm sending a
synchronous request to mahavir mahve is
sending me synchronous acknowledgement
as in Mah is saying yes we can talk I
say yes that's good I send an
acknowledgement this synchronous uh
request sent from me to mahavir
synchronous acknowledgement sent from
mahavir to me and I sending yes final
yes acknowledgement is what is as sinak
act t uh TCP handshake this is known as
TCP handshake once you have the TCP
handshake completed
then we decide mahavir I belong to
Karnataka I speak Canada uh I also know
Hindi I also know English uh which
language do would you prefer now what am
I doing we are deciding on a common
communication protocol uh so mahavir
will say I belong to Rajasthan uh I know
Rajasthani I know English I know Hindi
uh we can talk in English what is it
happening we are deciding on protocols
we are deciding on the communication
line we are iding on the encryption
algorithms we are deciding on hashing
algorithm this is known as a TLS hand
chei once you decide on the language we
also decide what code to you do you use
dagri do you use English do you use uh
any other uh what do you say uh script
what is it we are discussing the
encryption
mechanism now when mahavir and me are
talking everything is pred decided what
codes will you use for encryption
English right uh how frequently will we
speak now once we finish this approach
we when we finish everything that now we
have decided to talk we decided our
algorithms and we say now let's we are
done with talking we'll close the
connection that's a reset right we'll
cover that at the onset understand what
is this so this is exactly what happens
on the network a lot of handshaking
happens a lot of data is exchanged uh
within with each other only then your
communication happens everything happens
with a blink of an eyelid because the
modern day communication system so you
won't know about it but it happens and
this will be done I will show this on
live example I've given you a analog
analogous example I will show you using
wire shark how does it look on the
network right I love giving that example
it's an awesome example and I'll show
you how it works uh with time so we'll
understand Linux today uh if time
permits we'll go further ahead and will
also understand this TLS hand check in
the cryptography uh TLS TCP hand check
in the cryptography modu in Greater
detail so yeah so let's move to the
threats I'm glad you understood yeah so
CIA th so what is the threat to the
availability I was coming to Amazon when
Amazon you're trying to order a product
and Amazon is down what is happening an
authorized user is not able to place an
order you will get frustrated right and
that is an attack on availability Amazon
will lose business uh and reputation at
the same time right so that is what is
so uh it can be a denial of service
attack or a Dos dos stands for denial of
uh distributed denial of service attack
right that's a malicious intent for
stopping services offer service provider
simple as that right so this is a there
can be a uh see if you have a Data
Center and there's a power failure what
is it it may also lead to denial of
service availability attack on the
network right if there's a power failure
similarly if you're hwac system your AC
what do you call it hwac what's the full
form hwac keep on forgetting it your
climate control system basically in the
uh uh yeah the full form is heating
ventilation and air conditioning hwac
now when you have this climate control
system uh inside your data center it
fails that may also lead in server being
uh the server performance is being
hampered so your availability is HED
that is what is the point say I am
attacking I am an attacker and you are a
web server right uh I am I am sending
you unlimited number of request uh let's
say uh Aruba wants to uh get some
service from the web server but since
I'm sending unlimited number of requests
the server is not able to cater for
request from any authorized user yeah
the server is not able to cater for
request because there are too many
requests coming from a attacker a single
attacker that is denial of service
attack now if I tell 100 people I pay 10
10 Rupees to 100 people and all of them
I tell them to send continuous request
to a particular server that is
distributed denial of service as in I
have distributed data to multiple
locations okay this is an analogous
example we'll have a technical example
shown to you you can use a tool by the
name of hping 3 to send icmp request now
we will cover that as we proceed ICM
request that so many pings are being
sent to the server that server is unable
to service a authorized request right
that's a uh D dos and do suppression
wonderful glad you understood it let's
move how do you Ensure High availability
okay you have a uh data center you'll
have a standby data center backup system
right which will work if one goes down
the other will take on immediately you
may have backups in place archives in
place which works right so that helps as
this same time you have protection
mechanisms the IPS is the inent
prevention systems inent uh detection
systems you may have uh firewalls in
place right you may have raid five
configs as Kell has given that allows
you to ensure that your data your
service available at all given times to
the users right so that's availability
now we also discuss about risk again we
gave a formula right risk was impact
into likelihood basically It's a
combination of probability of or a
likelihood of an event right now event
can be positive and negative but what
what we are discussing over here we're
talking about a negative incident event
which is happened that is a risk uh with
reference to negative incident let's say
uh there's a data brid we can have two
different incidents talked about let's
say your power uh connectivity to the
data center goes down it's an event
right a negative event
and what is the risk because that
happens your server availability your
net system availability may go down
right at the same time there's a
possibility that there's a hardware
damage which will happen agreed so
that's a risk now what is a risk it is
the probability that this power system
will go down that is risk do you
understand risk as such it's combination
of likelihood that something will happen
of this sort that is risk it's a prob
ability yeah now in formula's case you
can say uh risk can be impact into
likelihood impact multiplied by
likelihood what is the possibility of a
right we talked about data center now
what is the possibility your data in
this data center may be breached that's
a likelihood what is the probability
that it will have and once the data is
breached what would be impact on the
business as such how much will be the
damage that is the impact right this
damage can be calculated in terms of
dollar values money right or reputation
as such so we discussed about
Coca-Cola's formula last time so what is
the risk associated to it it is the
likelihood that this Cokes formula is
breached right what is the likelihood it
is a percentage value and if this
formula is breached what would be the
impact with reference to the damage
potential and the dollar value and
reputation loss for the organization
high right so the risk is high because
impact is higher likelihood is a
possibility so impact multiplied by
likelihood will give you risk do you
understand risk now likelihood M to
impact that's risk with me all of you
risk
understood right so uh I gave this
example already the same thing which is
available on the screen uh a server is
an asset to an organization in This
Server I give this example during a last
discussion in This Server about 25% of
the data is in unencrypted format
there's a 25% data which is an
unencrypted format and what uh if a
particular uh vulnerability that is a
weak rule in the firewall allows a
threat agent compromise this data okay
then this risk is
materialized okay I am talking about the
terminology risk is materialized there's
a loss of uh data to the organization
and what is a counter measure you
basically ensure that the weak rule in
the firewall
is replaced amended
reconfigured yeah got it okay okay
coming back to right so that is the
example over here right so examples of
the risk there could be a fire a threat
agent can be a fire a clueless user or
uneducated un aware user can be a threat
agent malicious Insider now there's a
user there's a employee who's not
promoted due to whatever reason has may
have malicious intent for compromising
the organization right so that's a
malicious Insider hacker someone who has
uh alterior motives to gain Financial uh
benefits by compromising an organization
using his or her skills right that is a
hacker is that clear so a risk can be
associated with natural disasters uh can
be associated with unawareness of a
employee user vendor contractor human
being right and can be Associated a
malicious external entity and technical
option also where in your Power Systems
HVAC systems May Fail you understand
those are the examples of risk great
okay we also discussed about asset we
are uh red discussing asset can be
tangible intangible tangible something
which you can touch intangible something
we understand but cannot touch right
tangible your server is a tangible thing
the data inside of server is an
intangible thing your reputation of an
organization is a intangible thing right
these this is an asset so anything which
has value to the organization can be
considered as an asset right okay uh in
connection with uh asset there are two
major terminologies we should understand
one is sensitivity one is criticality
now sensitivity is nothing but a unit of
impact that dis unauthorized disclosure
of information may have an organization
as in when a uh risk
materializes the amount of impact
this risk or unauthorized disclosure
we'll have on the organization is
sensitivity is sensitivity we talk about
criticality per se again it's a measure
of impact that failure of a system to
function as required will will have an
organization so it will determine how
important an asset is to the business
will the business continue to work or
not will the business continue to
business or not will the business have a
repetition uh loss or not that's his
sensitivity and criticality yeah okay
asset classification now we discussed
about uh inventorying various assets and
organization right when we inventor
assets we also need to prioritize the
assets right and this prioritization of
the assets have has to be done in a
certain using certain processes so what
do you do you prioritize the asset based
on based on the business value Val right
now we've already discussed this and I'm
sure you remember that what what do you
mean by the business value you asked the
question what will be the impact on the
business if this asset is lost that will
give you the business value right so
Coca-Cola's formula big business value
so high priority asset maybe uh a CCTV
camera going faulty on the gate uh maybe
less uh business value lesser impact
right so that's asset
classification now this uh business
value can be asside based on combination
of criticality and the sensitivity this
will also allow us to understand if a
particular asset is of higher value what
are the risk associated with it how much
is the asset uh exposed to a risk what
is the likelihood what is the impact who
all would be interested in this
particular
asset the competitors the malicious
insiders the hackers yeah the miscon so
on you know who's the threat agent what
is the risk what could be the impact and
what is the sensitivity and criticality
so you get an understanding when you
know what is your asset so once you know
what is important would be uh the threat
to that important thing uh which is
important to us right and based on that
we can have the classific classification
level assigned to an asset so uh the
classification can be secret top secret
confidential unclass yeah that kind of
uh classification once you know that a
particular data Coca-Cola's formula for
C is a top
secret uh has top secret data
classification we know that only only
certain people can should handle this
data and you should have requisite
protection mechanisms on this data right
very very strong protection mechanisms
one of them being encryptions now once
you know that uh what classification
level is it what production mechanisms
in place we will Define uh you can
allocate the resources to the asset
again remember I told you uh last time
also that these production mechanisms
should make uh business sense it should
be economically viable you cannot have
data which is worth say 100 or asset
which is worth $100 having a protection
mechanism of $200 on it right it should
always be it should always make business
sense it should always make economical
sense right so this is how you will be
doing asset classification you will
understand why asset classification is
done and how does it help us right asset
classification great
great okay you already talked about
identification of asset you must first
identify something to protect uh then
manage the
risk think if the asset is tangible or
intangible right and ensure that there
are production mechanisms placed in
there understand the criticality and all
yeah that's asset identification now
with this we come to the basic Linux
command Linux commands which we are
supposed to discuss right a small
introduction to Linux okay so as you see
on the screen screen uh for all those
who have not seen Linux
before uh we are talking about K Linux
right now most of the Linux flavors will
have their own uh layout generally it
will be same uh like Windows has the
start button uh this particular dragon
on the left side left corner top will
give you the menu for all applications
which are installed on this particular
machine uh the browser is seen over here
on the tab on the uh what do you call it
this particular panel the top panel
which has a watch on the right side uh
timer and the calendar on the right side
you can shut down the machine using the
button uh given over here we are not
going to shut it down
cancel uh the connectivity is seen over
here you'll have data connectivity
reflected over here your mic speakers
everything will be reflected over here
you can also see the browsers
on the menu wherein if you look at all
applications uh you'll find the browser
listed over here itself so there's a
Chromium browser installed there's a
Firefox installed we'll be primarily
using Firefox in our uh work over here
so let's open okay uh for the browser
for internet connectivity so similar to
Windows machine your Firefox on Linux
looks same so if you see this is how
your Firefox br looks browser looks so
you can open any URL you want over
here simple right so like Windows even
Linux uses a similar same browsers for
that matter uh the Internet Explorer or
the edge browser will not work on Linux
otherwise Firefox okay Safari for Mac
will not have option in Linux but
otherwise Firefox Chrome and several
other browsers are working uh
interoperable between various operating
systems right so you can use a browser
to surf the Internet now Linux is
primarily known to various uh people as
a uh what do you say it has an
availability of something known as a
terminal which allows you to run
commands which is very popular about
between Linux users which is very
popular between the Linux users and this
is what allows them to do a lot of tasks
without actually open any application
running it by typing it on the terminal
now what you see on the screen I clicked
on the red uh box over here which is the
terminal for the K Linux machine uh this
allows you to run various commands on
the uh machine for doing various tasks
we need to do uh on the dragon if you go
you'll find other terminals also
available we'll be using the ter
terminal already available in this
particular machine right similar layout
will be there on our UB to machine also
if you open that right uh let me expose
you to the terminal a bit more okay what
you see over here is Kali add the first
thing which comes over here is known as
the username the Kali over here is the
username username the user right uh and
the given K after this is the system
name if you can call it the system name
right so let's say if I make it if I
change
user can you see so the user from Kali
changed to root user so like Windows has
admin
user uh Linux has something known as a
root user we are a root user on a
Kali uh system yeah do you get
it and what you see over here is the
current
directory slome SL Cali Kali is the
current
directory
understood we just understanding layout
over
here now do you see the difference the
root user is the admin user in case of
Khali uh capable of running uh
administrative level privileges on a
Linux machine
so this is the root
user I shift it to the root user by
using command sudo Su now uh we'll be
covering this when I do sudo Su and give
a password uh the admin password which I
already given and you don't see it you
will find the user changes from normal
Khali user which is a low privilege
account to a high privilege root admin
account yeah uh even Android is a Linux
based system okay and what you see this
the second Khali is the system per se
this is the system name yeah this is the
system name after that what you see on
the slome Sali is known as the current
directory location there is a current
directory location in Linux everything
is known as a directory right everything
is known as a directory so understand
the termin as of uh when you come to the
Khali user you see this still day it is
known as still day right and this is
also the current directory basically a
short hand for users home directory a
short hand for users home directory this
still day this this and this is
same okay users home
directory now let's talk about commands
which we can run on Linux now what is a
command understand command is nothing
but uh a software program so when
executed on a command line CLI command
line interface it performs the action on
the computer now again I'll say again
command uh is a software program when
executed on a CLI that is command line
interface it performs a action on the
computer so to execute a command first
step is to type the name of the command
to execute a command the first step is
to type the name of the command right so
in this example the command I'm typing
is
LS what is it
LS and I
enter what do you see what is happening
on the screen right now what am I doing
in Alis all those who know lenux will
tell you that uh it is a command to list
the contents of the present
directory yeah this is a command which
is listing the contents of the present
directory so by itself the ls command is
listing files and directories in the
current working directory at this point
you shouldn't uh shouldn't worry too
much about the output of the command
instead focus on understanding how to
format and execute commands right so the
Lis command covered is incomplete uh
we'll be covering this as we proceed
ahead right this is listing the details
LS right uh now many commands can be
used by themselves with no further input
the way we saw LS right some commands
however require additional input to run
correctly uh so those inputs will be
something looking something like this so
if you say clear the screen command this
will be a command then you'll give some
option and possibly some arguments
right so this is the general structure
of commands which will be listed on the
terminal yeah so options are basically
used to modify the core behavior of the
command this options given over here
will be utilized to uh modify the core
behavior of a command while arguments
are used to provide additional
information what additional information
may be a file name or a user usern name
each option and argument is normally
separated by a
space okay however you there are some
options wherein uh they could be
combined also so this is the general
layout of command command options and
arguments now you have to keep in mind
that Linux unlike Windows is case
sensitive we have to keep in mind that
Linux un unlike Windows is case
sensitive so whenever you use commands
and options and arguments and variables
and file names we have to exactly put
the uh case sensitive word anything
wrong you'll not list for example let's
say I want to move into the downloads
directories downloads
directory I'm CD I'm changing directory
just understand what I'm telling right
now so immediately I move to the down
downloads can you see the directory
location has changed to download
visible all of you right
now just understand I used D capital and
spelling downloads however if I say
CD
downloads what error does it say it says
no such file or directory
exists for us human beings this and this
is same where even for Windows I think
uh case does not matter but in case of
Linux the case matters a big deal it
will not do the command if the case does
not Mar up okay so let's move
on with
arguments
so uh we talked about the command
options and arguments now when you type
uh when you see the format of say
command command options
argument
right yeah so an argument can be used
this argument or arguments can be used
to specify something for command to act
upon so if LS is the given command which
we saw before so let's say let's delete
this if LS is a uh given command it see
it's a class in it itself Linux has a
lot of things to do but I'll give you an
concept and then we'll after Linux we'll
have a good break okay so like I said uh
if the Alis command is given uh the name
of the directory as an argument it will
list the contents of that directory so
let's say if I just use LS it will give
me the contents of the present directory
if I use LS and say uh give me contents
of say
documents it will give me the contents
of document directory as of now we have
nothing listed in the documents
directory hence it is giving me uh uh
blank over here let me see if I can find
uh another directory do I have this
directory with me yeah so if I say
lscp it will list out details on this de
now as of now don't worry what directory
I have gone into just understand I have
listed uh directory listings from
another location by giving an argument
of the directory name to the ls command
yeah this is how now you can also use
multiple arguments to list out details
for example
uh we used one uh LS command to list out
a directory we can use the same LS
command by giving another space to list
out another directory say let's say uh
we use
to uh Slash
HC you can use what
SS
s you see two different directory
listings can be visible this is the
below one is for directly SSS directory
the above one is for triple P directory
right so I can use uh LS command with
multiple arguments and list out contents
of two different directories right given
as arguments over there understood
that's in basic arguments which we have
there right now we have when we talked
about command options arguments we have
discussed about arguments let's talk
about options so what are the options we
talking about this is the one we are
talking command options
arguements this is where we've discussed
about command discussed about arguments
let's discuss about
options let's discuss about
options Now options can be used with
commands to expand or modify the way a
command behaves again options can be
used with commands to expand or modify
the way a command behaves for example
uh if you use option Dash L right
uh for LS
command it will give long listing
providing additional information about
the files that are listed so if I just
do normal
LS this is the listing and if I do LS
and DHL is long listing it will give me
additional details what are the
additional details over
here the size uh uh of the file the
permissions of the file right so on so
forth will be given over here
right now you have to note that we have
used a small L small case L over here- L
right uh that is a lower Place L if you
use cap uh
uh what do you say a easy way to
remember this would be Dash L is a
pneumonic for long listing right this
is- L can be considered as a long
listing yeah okay yeah so we are
understand it is case sensitive okay
similarly if you want uh to look into
directories recursively you can use
R right ls-
R okay so now uh I'm sorry not
recursively I stand corrected this
prints the results in a reverse
alphabetical order so if you see if I
did just LS it is going in a uh
descending alphabetical order a a c d e
FG if you do dasr it will do a reverse
way right it will reverse it that ls- R
similarly you can do long listing long
listing by using-
LR yeah so file permissions the file
size the date it was created
and it is done given in the reverse
lineup moving from n to D in this case
right reverse lineup so in most cases
options can be used in conjunction with
other options so what we have done we
have combined two options long listing
and reverse uh uh listing of the files
together right so we have given separate
options together the combination of
these options will result in long list
output in Reverse alphabetical order as
you seen over here right now uh you have
if you ask me will the order matter no
that is not important that is not
important in this
case yeah so coming back a few more
things I need to cover now when you do
ls- L this by default gives you the file
sizes in bytes H when you do ls- L It Is
by default giving you the sizes of the
file in bytes so these are the sizes the
4 496 496 1769 are sizes of the files
which are in bytes if you want to make
it human readable right uh as if you
understand uh the Lang make it easier
for humans to understand you can
use ls-
LH right and this will give you view the
file size in human rable format so 4K 4K
4K 16 m 16 right so this is what is a
human readable
format right now options are generally
are single letters as you see Dash l h
and all however sometimes there are
words or phrases as well right uh
typically older commands use single
letters while the newer commands use
complete words for options right single
letter options uh are proceeded by
single Dash Okay like uh when you do ls-
L it's a single letter with single Dash
right however when you use full uh word
options you'll be using Double Dash so
let me just clear the screen right
you'll be using Double Dash for example
if you remember
ls- H will give you human readable uh
we'll have to do long in to make it
better
understanding so this will give you
human readable uh format in a single
letter the same thing you can do by
using a complete word a full word op
just
human readable and just enter it will
give you the same
output but you can use these similar
options so such options also come up if
you have a single letter one dash if you
have a word Double Dash yeah so if you
want to see directory listing in human
letter readable format for any
directory uh let's say which one we have
SSS directory
uh it is if I say slash Etc SL
SS it will give me human Ral format the
same format I can get it using
a word as an
option which is
space human
rable enter the same options will come
up nothing changes only thing options
sometimes the options will be like this
sometimes it will be like this right oh
excuse me okay similarly uh so when a
command is executed in a terminal it is
stored in a location uh in a history
list per se so it is this is designed to
make uh it easy to execute same commands
so later eliminating the need to retype
the entire command so your commands are
basically saved somewhere in the history
to allow you to retype you can use your
up Arrow to go through the commands I'm
using my up Arrow right now to go
through all the commands Okay and now
the entire history of the commands is
run which are run in the current session
can can be displayed using the up Arrow
repeatedly one by one right now when you
do the up arrow and press enter the
command will run again simple so if I go
go on doing this up arrow and just press
enter the command will run again which
is saved in the history so you don't
have to type your commands right in case
you want to edit a command you can use
the left and right arrow to edit edit it
so in case I want to list out instead of
ss I want to list out say the PPA
directory I can change it and enter it
allows me so you can use the history uh
to move around uh to move around the
commands which are used prior the left
and right arrow to change the positions
and uh use for editing right
uh let's see in case you want to see all
the commands instead of using Arrow
which were done today you can type
history excuse
me and it will list out all the commands
so we have run a total of 35 commands in
the session has started right everything
will be listed over
here see the history command I gave a
wrong command also visible
yeah m is telling type the command uh
giving space before the command it will
not show in history interesting let's
try it out so if I just give a space
prior to the command and say um let's
use a new command
date right enter so it has given me the
date right now let's try history it's a
interesting uh thing we need to
discuss yeah it's not showing
interesting M thank you so what Mur has
told us if I use the see if I use
date okay it's not doing it wonderful so
where do you use it m this command how
does it
help so if I do date right now and do
history you will see the date is listed
at the 37th command over here however if
I add a space at the start of the
command and type uh let's use another
command
uh what command code should I use let's
use n
map enter and now check
history okay that in map command is not
there oh interesting that's interesting
great so
uh I'm using Google over here to
download the cheat sheet
so you can also use Google that is
easier but uh
okay yeah this is a eight page document
for
Linux complete detail right so I'll
share this one too for
you cheat sheet
close yeah so the cheat sheet is
uploaded you can have a look not
everything can work out uh using these
cheat sheets but uh you need
practice excuse me right you need to
find and do
practice okay now one more important
thing uh you should understand something
known as external commands now external
commands are basically binary executable
stored in the directories that are
searched by the shell so if a user types
LS command then the shell searches
through the directories that are listed
in the pathway variable right uh so if a
command does not behave as expected or
if a command is not accessible that uh
it should have been accessible uh then
you can uh it will be extremely tedious
to find this file right manually so you
can use a command by the name of which
okay you can use which so if you want to
know more about a command another
important thing uh let's complete this
first which and you can give the command
name say which LS okay
oh
okay say which LS it should give you a
path actually this should give you this
should have given you a location of a
command where the ls is there if I just
say which python will it give
me which python
yeah so uh it did not give it for Lis
but let's see if I know where is python
uh variable or where is python if if in
in short in a generalized understanding
where is python installed you can find
it using which Command right this helps
you to understand if a particular file
is installed or not available in the
system only right so that's your
python uh uh that's your Wich command
what else
now uh we saw directory listing right LS
we have discussed the uh initial command
options arguments similarly if you have
to change the directory you can use
CD and CD stands for change directory
and the directory name which is uh to be
changed to you can just select and you
will find the directory has been changed
can you see that you can use the CD
command to move within the directories
if you want to understand the present
present working directory you can find
use that using
PWD present working directory that will
give you present working directory got
it so uh now if you do not know
something about a command you can use
the manual which is in Linux
man command so if you want to get
details about any command just say man
and the command's name it will list out
the details about the command it will
give you
what is this LS command it will give you
list directory contents how do you use
it synopsis is given it will give you
description about this file and options
which we can use about use this with
this right so this is how uh man
commands you in case you do not know
what is man you can find out details
using man Manual of the man itself can
you see I opened a manual for man
command itself so it is an interface to
system reference manuals what is it it
is an interface to system reference
manual and it will give you a
description of each thing which you can
do with this command uh the examples are
given see I give you this example right
man Lis display the manual page for the
item LS or the program
LS got it similarly if you say uh man
man. 7 it will give you the manual page
for macro page man in section seven so
you can find a section in a particular
manual using the number itself right so
that's your
manual okay uh what else let me see okay
in case you want to get help for a
command uh then you can use let's say
Dash as help right if does not exist you
can use Double Dash and full word either
of it works can you see
when I said Dash L it did not work - H
it did not work when I said Dash DH help
it gave me details about this command so
one way getting detail about a command
is using manual if you want a small
descriptive uh understanding you can use
dash dash help as is the case over here
to find out details about the command
right all options
right uh okay
now we talked about Lis we talked about
CD we talked about
PWD uh present working directory we
understood where are we with respect to
the location we could change the
directory now a bit about the directory
structure of Linux so Linux has a
particular direct dric systems structure
so now on a Windows system the top level
directory is is called my computer all
of you are already aware of it right uh
so it is the top level directory on
Windows the physical devices such as the
hard drives USB drives the network
drives show up under the my computer uh
option and are each assigned a drive
letter right uh such as the C drive D
drive that is how Windows works the
directory
structure which Linux has is slightly
different uh let me just show you
directory
structure
of so if I just open
okay excuse
me so this is the directory structure of
Linux as you see on the
screen let me explain it to you now as
you see in the screen uh these uh the
directory
structure uh is an example over here as
a screen it uh it is present within the
virtual environment right of the uh
Linux machine now like Windows Linux
directory structure typically is called
file system also has a uh a top level so
uh it is called the root directory the
one you see on the top is the root
directory and it's symbolized by slash
character the slash character over here
can you see yeah so and it this root Rel
is the slash character additional there
are no drives in the Linux remember each
physical device is accessible under a
directory as opposed to a drive letter
in the windows it is oppos understand as
of now and you'll be uh we'll be
discussing it further when we move
inside so to view contents of a
directory you will be using LS as we
already know so if you want to
understand uh see the contents of a root
directory you can just say LS /l and
you'll get the contents of a ro
directory can you see that we are
getting the contents of a root directory
by using ls- L same thing which is given
in the diagram over here right I'm
getting this boot Etc proc Dev mentioned
over here so you can you see boot Etc
yeah all the directories which are in
the root directory can we see now here
right where is it where we yeah so now
we can list out the contents of the
directory of the root directory as we
saw in the path over here right using
the ls command we've already done that
now we should notice that there are many
directories with descriptive names right
like the slash boot directory which will
which contains files to boot the
computer if you want to see the slash
boot you can just CD
SL
boot LS and you'll find the uh files to
boot the computer inside this directory
hence the name boot right so like
Windows uh this is the master directory
boot the my computer directory like like
my computer uh and you'll have the
details over here the boot directories
right root directory will have boot
directory boot directory will have
computers files which allow the computer
to boot boot boot person right now the
term home directory often confuses a
various people right home directory
often is confused confused by various
people let me just come back here yeah
so to begin with on most Linux
distribution there is a directory called
home can you see this home directory
over
here right under the root directory
there's a home directory now under this
home directory
there's a directory for each user on the
system so if I just go to let's say I go
back to my root
directory I say Lis you'll find the boot
directory I'll find the home directory
right inside the home
directory I will
find the directory for each user as of
now this computer has only one user
hence only one uh uh directory for user
is mentioned oh here wonderful what I
can do is let's create a
user let's create a user and I'll show
you if I create a user if I have to
create a user I can use command sudo
user ad uh user
ad and what name should we give let's
give a
enter so user is created now like I said
in the root directory there's a home
folder uh home folder will which has or
rather which has users of that
particular computer if I just see
form you will
oh has not cre just a sec Why didn't it
show the
user where did we create
it it should have created the user in
the root
directory I created a user right it did
not give an error what I did I created a
user to be listed over here but somehow
that user is not available in this
directory that's interesting I will have
to look where did I go
wrong okay let's come back to that later
I actually wanted to show you but yeah
so now uh like I said if you go to the
home directory you will find the users
listed over there now the directory name
is same as the name of the user so when
I said LS
slome
sorry Lis
SLC since there's a k user I see the
Kali name as the directory name over
there right so if you have say a system
admin user you'll find the system admin
name given in the folder over here right
so we are in the Kali user and the Kali
user folder is seen over here okay
moving on uh okay the home directory
again remember it's an important
directory to begin with when a user
opens the cell it automatically is
placed in the home directory right
typically where you work that's the uh
importance of
directory uh like I said PWD will give
you the present working directory if you
do p WD it will give you the present
working directory if I use change the
user to sud
sudo Sudo
Su
yeah and if I say PWD the present work
directory is still home right but the
the user is root but the user is
root right so present working directory
basically points to the working
directory okay we have a few questions
let me address it one by
one uh balraj is saying is there any
difference in the folder color it seems
different colors of folders n so uh okay
in a typical lenux terminal the color of
the folders vary right uh because of the
configuration per se now uh depending on
the distribution uh we'll have different
colors uh so by default directories are
often displayed in different colors to
differentiate there from the regular
files uh so let's say if I just say uh
as you see just a
sec as you see over here this is a uh
tarred file a compressed file which has
a different color a regular directory
has a different color if I make a file
uh executable then the name will it will
become
green
yeah okay what is the difference between
Pudo and
Sue
okay basically I am using the super user
uh Command right so sudo and Sue again
uh uh in most Linux and operating uh
Linux systems or Unix system uh we uh
let's say
um if you want to do something in
elevated privileges right if you want to
execute some command in elevated
privileges you will use the pseudo
command or in full form it is super user
do so let me just type it for you the
Pudo basically stands for
yeah see sud sudo stands for super user
do they've not given a full form oh have
they given it no now this is basically
to execute a
command uh in a super user and to
execute a command in a uh elevated
privilege they use sudo so basically
Pudo allows you uh allows a user to
execute a command as another user
typically the root user what is it the
root user so when I say I'm running
let's say I'm ex exiting this to normal
user now if I say want to open a
particular application which requires
administrative privileges I may not be
able to run it so let's say I say net
discover so this is another command uh
discover we'll use it does not have net
discover is it net
discover okay
see it is it says this is most likely
caused by lack of administrative
privileges associated with your user
account so then the user account is not
allowed to run a command because there
are privilege rest however if I just use
pseudo just pseudo and net
Discover it will allow me to run the
command can you see the command has
started working what is it I am
elevating privilege uh David just that
answer your question sudo allows a user
to execute a command uh typically as a
super user or a root user got it if you
say what is Sue just this so I can tell
you man
ex man sue does it give me yeah so what
is Sue run a command with substitute
user and group ID so now basic basically
Su stands for switch user if you can use
the full form Su stands for switch user
sudo stand for super user to right now
this Su allows a user to become another
user typically again you can change it
to administrator or some other user
person got
it yeah wonderful uh if it's about
Terminals and you're working
on a terminal on a Linux use manual
command or help command to get more
details it will be much more easier so
if I say nmap I can use Manual of nmap
to give me details nmap is a tool which
is a network scanner we'll be using wait
for it yeah so this is nmap I press Q I
can quit it
similarly yeah similarly I can use nmap
dash for
help yes all s can be tested in the lab
I am doing it in the simply learn
lab if I just n-h it will give me help
command so your help is available on the
terminal so you can get more
details can we change the password of
the user AC the lab using
commands uh maybe you will not have the
permission if the lab vendor is smart
enough which he is because I know him uh
he will not allow you to change the
password of the lab
user okay should not actually you can
try it out okay but there's no guarantee
I would not recommend it uh you can play
around with your own machines with
respect to credentials however it is not
recommended that you uh do it over here
okay wonderful
um right where
we right so moving
on so as we saw we can change the
directories using C CD and you can move
within directories we saw what is a home
directory we saw uh what is a root
directory what is the structure of the
directory right uh if you move to a
particular directory use CD if you say
let's say if you're moving uh into CD
documents directory right there are
multiple directories okay not here CD if
you have to move out of a directory you
can use CD dot dot and you see you can
revert back to the previous directory
you're moving one directory up using the
CD dot dot now if you say move to a
directory CD
downloads
downloads one
sec happened yeah let me clear the
screen when is can we do any
installation launch any application
using Kali yes yes you can
um if you want let me just complete this
I'll show you that too so if I move to
the CD directory somehow my lab has got
stuck okay I move to the download
directory if I move further into okay
there's no sub directory in the
downloads
it where was a subdirectory
available let's move to a subdirectory
somewhere but my lab is wait wait wait
yeah
scratched just a second let the terminal
open
up H uh V is asking can we install
anything yes I'll show you that but let
the lab start give me a
minute okay here's the lab okay the
terminal is open I do not want another
one let's clear the
screen yeah so uh do I have any the
directory in downloads no let's see if
we have something in the home
directory documents do not have anything
okay let's create one uh that will be
easy so if I move into a directory I
want to create a directly I can use
command make
di sorry mkd make D and I can make a
folder a right so that's how I create a
directory in inside a
directory right AAP I can move into the
directory like this a as you see I am
inside the directory I can list out the
contents of the directory if it anything
is present over
there see nothing in the directory if I
want to create a file I can use a
command
touch to create a file a DOT uh
text do text
enter now what is that created it has
created a blank
page blank document a. text as you see
the size of this page is zero because
nothing is inside right now there are
two three ways of uh creating the file
one is what I showed you other one is
you can use Nano which is an Editor to
create a file or change a file so we'll
create
a1. text using Nano
enter so this is a kind of structure so
this is
a test
document this is a test document right I
can say control
X and Y for saving the document and
enter right CR X Y enter now if I say I
if I list out details L
s-l I will
find two files listed over
here one with 25 bytes of data one with
zero bytes one was created with touch
other was created with Nano similarly to
Nano there are other editors which can
be utilized one of the few famous one is
whim so you can use whim to just let's
do edit the a
file all right so I'm editing so this is
another editor which allows you to edit
the file but it is certain there is
particular method in which you can edit
the file if I want to enter something in
this uh Wim command I say I for insert I
have to type insert as soon as I type
insert you'll see a insert prompt is
given over here now I can type over here
this is
a test
file right and we can add
to uh how do I see save it I say I type
uh press escape on the
keyboard right you see the insert prompt
is gone then do
colon uh just type colon W for right and
Q for
quit enter I will write the changes and
quit now if I
say LS
DOL enter you will find that the 22 byte
worth data is created in the previous
file the time of change and everything
is visible over here seen all of you
clear with
me
yeah okay
great okay let's move on now once you
another way of uh can you repeat this
again which one the whim one okay arind
is telling me if I use x it will uh
directly do everything okay we'll try
that so if I say
whim and the file name so uh uh s and I
enter this is the file I see I can make
changes to the file let's say I delete
this
two and type new
alphabet sorry I have to press I for
insert once I insert I can type anything
I want to
right now in order to save the file
there are two options one was Escape I
say po W for right Q for quit another
option our friend uh arind has given
wherein I
can use colon and X to exit let's see if
it
works yeah I have exited let's look if
the change has been Incorporated in our
file so c a.
text you see so
Vim you open the Wim file then you
press I for
insert make changes as per
requirement and then you can use colon
and X to save and exit I used to use
colon and WQ right both of them are same
yeah okay understood
say okay great uh we have a question
from David David is asking does Linux
have something like batch files in
Windows okay yes Linux has a similar
concept uh to Windows batch files uh
dobat files if you call it and they are
known as shell
scripts yeah David they known as let me
just exit
this what it
yeah okay so there are shell scripts now
these shell scripts are text files
containing commands that are interpreted
and executed by the shell interpreters
right so that's our shell scripts so
we'll be using shell script so if you
want to uh create a uh say a simple
shell script now that you have come to
this and we are using editors another
editor which will help us do is a gedit
so I'm we are create we talked about
Nano we talk about wh another XB editor
is gedit do we have gedit in this let's
see we'll have to
install so in case G edit I say I don't
have this file I say enter Linux will
tell me that the file does not exist and
we can install it now this is the
question and somebody was asking that
can I install applications yes you can
use sud sudo app
install and the application which is to
be installed G edit in this case let's
install this uh application and it can
install it can you see it's being
installed on my Khali mine so anything
you have to install you can use Pudo app
install and the name of the application
and you'll be able to install it as you
see on the screen it is happening right
now where in this application wasn't
there and we are installing
it yes
sure if you do not have a application
you can use
Pudo app install and the application
name to install the
application simple say Pudo app install
and the application name in this case I
have installed gedit which is a textex
based editor for Linux machines where
are you yeah yes
okay great so now that we are uh we've
seen whim we've seen
Nano we've seen whim we've seen Nano now
let's work on our options to use a text
based
editor let's work on our options to use
a text based editor such as gedit so if
I say
gedit and I say
a uh I give the file name right
enter a text based editor like uh
Windows has a notepad a similar thing
will pop up like this and I can change
change the file as for my liking over
here also can you see I can change
it I'm changing the
file
yes now uh David was asking do we have
batch files so in Linux we have shell
scripts let's create a small script file
now this is Bash scripting uh not a part
of your course but an interesting thing
if you want to learn however it is not
compulsory you just need to understand
it okay so let's start uh I am creating
a bash file a simple script uh let's say
slash bin
bash and we are going
to uh echo or print out on the screen uh
we want to print
out say
um hello how are
you I'm doing it in the editor right and
I add a question mark a
quote right also uh we will ask the bash
script to list out files in the current
directory like this right so uh in order
to save this document it is simple I
just say control s like we do in Windows
and the file is saved the file is saved
we can close
this okay control L I have cleared the
screen I say LS
you will find the file is here ap. text
right the the file which we created and
the file size must have changed if you
remember it was 20 uh bytes now it is 46
bytes and
uh there is no execute this file is not
an executable in order to create this
file uh make this file executable you'll
use the command
change mod CH mode
right uh plus X for making making it
executable and the file
name right uh I should have saved it as
s
actually okay let's use
it pH so yeah so now that we have a file
uh uh created over here we can also copy
the file or move the file in the same
location so if I just say um
copy
ap.
text come
on yeah as AP Dosh in the present
location can I do
that yes all people who are who know
Linux can I copy change the name of the
file in the present location
yeah if there's an error Linux will give
you a warning if the operation is done
the Linux will not give in Waring if you
want to look at it sorry
l-l you see I created a file of same
size and name with a different extension
so ap. text was a file I have copied it
as a.
which is a shell script file do you
understand I copied a file using CP CP
is copying a file now this a.ch can be
given uh execution uh executing uh
privileges that we can execute this file
by using CH
mode plus X and I say
AP
Dosh all right I'm making a shelf file
enter you see it has given no errors
that mean it has worked so if I now do
al-
L can you see the file color has changed
can you see what was the file color
before it was a white color now it is
become green color that signifies the
file is now executable do you understand
that that signifies the file is now
executable yeah David your batch file we
have created a shell file over here okay
so in your uh Journey as a penetra
ethical hacker uh as a penetration
tester you may have to make files
executable you will be doing it using
such kind of commands change mode CH
mode commands got it now if you want to
run this file you can just use dot slaap
so you have to run a command just dot is
present working directory and you want
to run the uh this file in the present
working directory so do dot is the
present working directory present
directory present location and the name
of the file to run and we have made it
executable as soon as you say enter it
should give us the command what is it
say hello how are you and it is listing
the contents of the present directory
can you see that what we've done so we
have progressively moved from creating a
directory to creating a file to creating
a shell using various editors then
making the shell exe shell file
executable or batch file executable and
then running the file on the terminal
getting an output on the screen is that
clear all of you this is something you
need to redo when you practice it is
important that you redo
this
okay great so and thanks David for
getting it to my notice uh this is
something which is
uh should be known to us right thank you
so let's see a few questions yes says
what is root terminal and
terminal okay is in context of lenux a
terminal is a program that provides text
based interface what you see on the
screen to interact with the operating
system okay it is giving you a text
based inter intercept uh uh correction
text based inter face to interact with
the operating system while a root
terminal is a terminal session that runs
with super user privileges now do you
understand terminal gives you interface
root terminal will give you super user
Privileges and same thing can be done
with your
privileges yeah okay
uh okay uh Zarin it will be the same the
commands will stay the same nothing
changes uban 2 is a Debian based
operating system K Linux is also a deian
based operating system so all these
commands in exact same format will work
in to also yeah okay
great okay so next question so we have a
question from cell which is from where
the Linux find the application now uh in
case of Linux uh there's something known
as official package repositories
right so no most Linux distributions
have official software repositories or
storage mechanisms where users can find
and install the application when we used
uh when you use just let me clear the
screen when you use app right that is
Advanced package tool what is it
Advanced package tool this allows you
this is a package manager which allows
you to download packages from the
repository of uh the deban oper system
lenux operating system and so on so
forth for Debian you use AP
Dean sorry right use app for
uh for let's say red hat operating
system Fedora Cento I think Centos also
you use yum that is a uh I it is
possibly yellow updator modified or
something I forgot all right so that's
how you do it
also uh there are other options where in
there are third party repositories
software websites you can download like
you do in Windows similarly you can
download and install applications this
is one option I have given
right most cyber people prefer working
on Linux it's much more convenient
lesser uh issues come up at least I
prefer and I've seen 90% of people who I
work with I prefer using lenux
yeah okay
uh okay uh again another question from
Co does the syntax matter while
searching the application yes if you
know if you remember I told you Linux is
case sensitive so you have to ensure the
S case is correct so if you're if you're
looking for Firefox uh let's say this
machine has Firefox I want to open
Firefox I just type Firefox like this
and it will open Firefox but if I don't
get the case correct it will not open
the application simple as that can you
see from the terminal without actually
using the
mouse I can open an application I just
say
Firefox I'll tell something interesting
I'm doing over
here can you see I just changed the case
the first case f and Firefox did not
open if I say
fire fox
without uh change uh with the right case
and I enter it will open
Firefox got it so you can search and
open applications for the terminal so if
I want to open up say BP suit I can type
BP Tab and enter it will open this is a
proxy which will'll be using
subsequently so you can open
applications directly from terminal by
running a command you don't have to use
Mouse and uh Mouse as such so the first
step to start start with cyber security
journey is learn Linux Linux is like
Solid Ground on which cyber Security
Experts build their Knowledge Learning
Linux is essential as it provides the
foundation for understanding the
technical aspect of cyber security
you'll gain Proficiency in command line
operations system administration and
file management mastering Linux enables
you to navigate various security tools
and perform tasks efficiently it's the
starting point for anyone aspiring to be
a cyber security expert as it Fosters a
deep understanding of systems in a work
and all these skills Le a foundation for
cyber security so after understanding
Linux your next step should be
networking networking forms the
foundation of the internet and plays a
vital role in cyber security it involves
how computers and devices communicate
and share information imagine networking
as the road system of the digital world
connecting various devices and allowing
data to flow between them at its core
networking revolves around two essential
components Mac addresses and IP
addresses a MAC address is unique at
identifier assigned to each network
interface card like a physical address
for your computer meanwhile an IP that
is Internet Protocol address is like a
digital postal code for devices on a
network enabling them to locate and
communicate with each other
understanding these fundamentals is
vital for cyber security it allows you
to spot irregularities in data traffic
identify potential threats and Safeguard
information Additionally you will learn
about network architectures security
models and tools like firewalls
intrusion detection system all of which
which contribute to creating a secure
digital environment the third thing you
can do is understanding web so the
internet is common place where many
cyber threat begin which is why
understanding web security is really
important in this part of learning path
we will look at things like HTTP https
HTML and JavaScript to see how websites
and web apps work we'll also talk about
some problems like SQL injections cross
site scripting and cross site request
fery csrf that can make web St plus
secure learning how to find and fix
these issues is a big deal for a cyber
security pro because it helps to keep
web app safe when you get how webtech
works you can do a better job stopping
cyber techs that Target web stuff you
will also get to know about HTTP
requests HTTP responses and request
headers which are the building blocks of
how web communication happens all right
the next thing is practice yes to get
better at something you need to practice
to do this you can set up a home lab
where you can experiment with different
cyber security techniques in a safe
environment alternately you can use
online platforms like hack the Box try
hackme or virtual hacking Labs which
provide real world scenarios to test
your skills these practice sessions help
you learn more about cyber security and
develop your problem solving abilities
remember the more you practice the
better you become at keeping digital
information safe from cyber threats all
right now the next step would be
certification you can explore various
cyber security certifications you can
start your journey towards cyber
security expertise with the postgraduate
program in cyber security by simply
learn it is meticulously designed to
equip you with the skills required in
the rapidly growing field dive into the

work experience now you can also listen
to what our Learners has to say about
the course hi I'm Philip I'm 61 years
old and last year I upskill with simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security
after working 30 years in the it sector
and various different profiles I'm happy
to tell you that I was able to clear and
pass my cissp and ccsp certification
exams on the first attempt after taking
the course course I must say was packed
with practical examples it was led by
highly skilled certified instructors
with many companies before a security
analyst and architect on a contract
basis but I needed some stability which
I got with the job I just started with
infosis as a cyber security consultant
happened on a first all right now let's
discuss the prere requirements of a
cyber security road map so the first
would be a bachelor's degree a solid
Educational Foundation is crucial most
individuals start with bachelor's degree
in a related field like computer science
information technology or cyber security
this provides fundamental knowledge in
Computing and Technology Next Step would
be completing a certification start with
enrolling in a program like Advanced
executive prog program in cyber security
and you will open doors to a world of
expertise this comprehensive program in
partnership with triple it Bangalore and
npci equips you with deep understanding
of defensive cyber security application
security malware analysis and ethical
hacking and more you'll gain practical
skills through Hands-On labs and real
world case studies allowing you to
confidently tackle complex cyber threats
this qualification enhances your career
prospects enabling you to spot
opportunities for disruption in the
cyber security industry stay ahead of
the Curve and protect digital assets
with this Advanced programs key features
and Industry relevant knowledge Next
Step would be be updated the cyber
security landscape is constantly
evolving staying updated with the latest
threats Technologies and best practices
is essential engaging in continuous
learning through Workshop seminar and
online courses and forums to remain
current in the field these prerequisites
form the foundation for a successful
cyber security rout man they provide the
knowledge skills and credentials needed
to pursue a career in cyber security
effectively now let's have a look at
cyber security jobs and salaries cyber
Security Professionals have
opportunities across various sectors
including government Finance Healthcare
education and entertainment some of the
popular job roles for cyber security

a result companies and organizations are
making it a priority to fortify their
digital defenses so this was about the
cyber security road map 20 24 by
following these step-by-step process
that is the learning path the pre-
requirements the company's hiring and
salary Etc you can move a step forward
in your cyber security Journey today we
are going to talk about some really
interesting and Powerful hacking gadgets
you should know about in 2024 but
remember this is just for learning we
don't want anyone getting into trouble
so moving on the best way to keep your
computers and devices safe is to know
about the risk so some risk are easy to
cater using strong passwords and don't
download from Bad websites and don't
hand your unlocked device to strangers
but there are also hidden dangers that
can cause big problems some tools look
innocent but can be very dangerous here
are seven gadgets that look normal but
are actually powerful hacking tools
these tools are made for Security
Experts to test system but they can be
misused so let's kick things off with a
device that's small but in incredibly
powerful that is Raspberry Pi so
Raspberry Pi is a compact and affordable
computer that has revolutionized the
tech world originally designed for
educational purposes it has become a
favorite among hobbist makers and even
professionals despite its small size it
boast impressive capabilities including
multiple USB ports HDMI output and
support for various operating systems
like Linux and Windows 10 iot core the
Raspberry Pi can be used for a wide
range of projects from simple
programming and gaming to complex iot
systems and home automation the
Raspberry Pi can also be dangerous
hacking tool with the right software it
can be used to perform a variety of
hacking task for example it can run K
Linux a popular operating system for
penetration testing this allows it to be
used for Network scanning password
cracking and even setting up Rogue
access points to intercept data its
small size makes it easy to hide and its
affordability means it's accessible to
many in the wrong hands this innocent
looking device can become a powerful
tool for malicious activities now that
we have seen the potential of the
Raspberry Pi which by the way is one of
the personal favorites for tinkering
let's move on to another seemingly
simple but powerful device the Wi-Fi
adapter so Wi-Fi adapter might seem like
a simple device used to connect to
wireless networks but it can be a potent
hacking tool in the wrong hands these
adapters when paired with the right
software can intercept and monitor
Wireless Communications making them
invaluable for network analysis and
penetration testing for example they can
be used with tools like air crack NG to
crack Wi-Fi passwords hackers can use
Wi-Fi adapters to perform attacks such
as packet sniffing and man in the middle
attacks these activities can lead to
unauthorized access to networks data
theft and sever security breaches it's
like having a digital spy in your pocket
while essential for legitimate security
testing it's crucial to be aware of
their potential misuse and to secure
your own wireless networks against such
threats speaking of Wi-Fi you won't
believe how sneaky this next device is
let's take a look at a device that takes
Wireless hecking to a whole new level
the Wi-Fi pineapple the Wi-Fi pineapple
looks like a standard router but it is a
sophisticated device used for hacking
wireless networks it allows attackers to
create Rogue Wi-Fi access points
tricking users into connecting and
revealing their login credentials
imagine connecting to what looks like a
free public Wi-Fi only to have your data
intercepted this device is capable of
advanced man inth middle attacks
monitoring and recording data from all
connected devices Additionally the Wi-Fi
pineapple can capture Wi-Fi handshakes
which can then be used to crack Network
passwords its powerful feature makes it
a favorite among penetration testers for
assessing network security but in the
wrong hands it can be used for malici
ious activities highlighting the
importance of robust wireless security
so from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth which is
everyone these days right let's now
explore a powerful tool for Bluetooth
hacking the ubertooth 1 the ubertooth
one is an open- Source Bluetooth testing
tool that appears to be a simple USB
dongle despite its unassuming appearance
it can monitor and analyze Bluetooth
Communications making it a valuable
asset for those testing the security of
Bluetooth devices think of it as a spy
for Blu Bluetooth traffic the ubertooth
one can capture Bluetooth packets
perform Bluetooth attacks and even
Explore vulnerabilities in Bluetooth
networks its ability to dissect
Bluetooth traffic makes it a powerful
tool for both legitimate security
research and potential misuse
understanding its capabilities helps
highlight the importance of securing
bluetooth enabled devices against
unauthorized access and attacks
continuing with radio frequency tools
which honestly sounds like something out
of a spy movie so let's discuss the hack
rf1 and its versatile capabilities so
the hack rf1 is a versatile software
defined radio SDR platform that can
transmit and receive radio signals from
1 MHz to 6 GHz it looks like a standard
electronic device but can be used for a
wide range of hacking activities imagine
being able to capture and manipulate
signals across a broad spectrum with the
hack rf1 users can capture and analyze
various radio signals Jam frequencies
and even po signals to manipulate
communication systems this tool is
particularly useful for exploring and
testing the security of wireless
communication systems while it serves an
essential role in legitimate research
and development the hack rf1 also
demonstrates the need for robust
security measures to protect against
radio frequency based attacks so now
let's look at a tool that takes
advantage of a computers trust in USB
devices and trust me this one sneaky the
USB rubber ducky so the USB rubber duck
key is a device that looks like a
regular flash drive but acts like a
keyboard typing commands into any
computer it's plugged in to hackers use
it to execute pre-programmed scripts
that can steal data install malware or
take control of the target device it's
like a tiny digital ninja this tool
exploits the trust computers have in USB
devices making it a poent weapon for
cyber attacks it's a reminder to be
cautious about plugging in unknown USB
devices as they could be rubber duase in
Disguise ready to unleash harmful
commands and compromise your system
security so finally we have got a real
undercover Gadget here let's uncover the
secret capabilities of the land turtle
the land turtle looks like a typical USB
ethernet adapter but it's a covert
hacking tool used to Monitor and
infiltrate networks don't let its
innocent appearance fool you it provides
hackers with several capabilities such
as Network scanning DNS poofing and data
capture
the land turtle can be discreetly
plugged into a network allowing access
to gather sensitive information and gain
uned access its ability to operate
undetected makes it particularly
dangerous emphasizing the need for
vigilance and robust network security
measures to prevent unauthorized devices
from connecting to your systems so there
you have it guys we have explored some
of the most powerful and dangerous
hacking gadgets out there these tools
can do a lot of damage if they fall into
the wrong hands that's why it's so
important to stay informed and Vigilant
about cyber security next on our docket
is a live demonstration where we solve a
set of cross-site scripting problems
starting from the basic level to the
topmost level six we're going to start
at level
one in this web application it
demonstrates the common cause of cross
side scripting where user input is
directly included in the page without
proper
escaping if you interact with the
vulnerable application window here and
find a way to make it execute JavaScript
of our choosing we can take actions
inside the vulnerable window or directly
edit its URL bar this task needs only
basic knowledge let's see why the most
primitive injections work here right
away let's do a simple query and inspect
the resulting HTML
page I'm going to use this
phrase with a sing single quote as a
special
character we can now inspect the HTML
page we can see here in this
line the special character single code
appears in the result over
here the provided query text is placed
directly in a b tag as in a body element
we need to perform a reflected xss into
the web application because they are
non-persistent xss attacks and the pad
should be included in the URL to perform
successful
exploitation we can use any payload but
we're going to use the simple one to
perform an alert in this web application
it's simple and can be shown
easily just going to write the script
over here
and we're going to press
search as you can see we have
successfully launched our first
cross-site scripting attack we can see
an alert box popup with the necessary
message and a similar process can be
used to steal browser cookies and
passwords albe it with different
commands
now we have the option to move to level
two in this web application it shows
that how easily xss bugs can be
introduced in complex chat
applications chat app conversations are
stored in a database and retrieved when
a user wants to see the conversation
therefore if a malicious user injects
some JavaScript code all visitors will
be infected this kind of cross site
scripting attack is more powerful and it
is more riskier then reflected crossed
scripting attacks and that's why is
known as stored
xss I posted my
query with a special character of a
single quote and this is what I
get whatever I typed in simply appeared
on the page right after I click on share
status let's see the
source you can see here the text I
posted seems directly put inside a block
code tag so even a simple script tag we
used in level one should work here but
it will not let us examine the code to
understand
why we're going to toggle the code of
here and check the index.html
file important
part is line 32
the generated HTML fragment which is the
HTML variable in the code is added to
the male HTML using the inner HTML
method so when the browser passing this
HTML fragment it will not execute any
script tag defined within that HTML
fragment HTML parser will not execute a
script tag when it passes htmls via this
method this is why the script tag like
we used in level one is not going to
work here our solution is to use events
events will execute the defined
JavaScript we're going to use an image
over here
and when we press on share
status in the above injection we are
loading an image that doesn't exist
which causes to trigger an on error
event in on error event the it will
execute our alert
method with that we are able to beat
level two and we can now move up to the
next level in our
challenge as you can can see clicking on
any tab causes the tab number to be
displayed in the URL
fragment this hints that the value after
the hashtag controls the behavior of the
page that is it is an input variable to
confirm let's analyze the
code as you can see in line 43 inside
the event
handling the value provided after the
hash in the
URL is directly passed onto the chew tab
method no input validation is being
performed the value passed to the choose
tab method is directly injected into the
IMG tag in line
17 this is an unsafe assignment and it
is the vulnerable part of the code now
all we have to do now is to craft a
payload that would adjust the IMG tag to
execute our JavaScript
remember the script tag from level one
would not work here since the variable
HTML is used to add the Dom dynamically
hence the events are ases here once
again I will choose to use the existing
IMG tag and change the source to
something that doesn't exist hence
forcing it to fall in to execute an on
error even which I will pass the
URL e
once we visit that URL we can see that
our Java popup has opened up here with
the same message of xss level 3 has been
completed with this we can now move on
to level four which is going to present
a different kind of
attack in this we application there is a
timer on the page that means whatever
numbers we put in the Box a countdown
starts and then when it finishes the
application alerts that the countdown is
finished
and we can see the time is a popup
appearing over here and this resets the
timer again now it is obvious that the
value entered in the text box is
transferred to the server over the timer
parameter in the
URL let us examine the code to see how
the timer parameter is being
handled we're going to visit timer. HTML
over
here and we're going to check over
here in line
21 the start timer method is being
called in the onload event however the
timer parameter is being directly passed
to the start timer method we need to
perform a popup Alert in the web
application which escapes the content of
the function start timer without
breaking the JavaScript code the
parameter value is directly added to the
start timer method without any filtering
what we can try to do here is to inject
an alert function to be executed inside
the on loone event along with the start
timer method
we're going to remove this
argument and put our script over
here now when me press on create
timer and we have a popup with the xss
level 4
complete we can now move on to level
five
in this web application this application
xss is different because this challenge
description says cross-side scripting
isn't just about correctly escaping
data sometimes attackers can do bad
things even without injecting new
elements into the Dom it's kind of open
redirect cuz the attack payload is
executed as a result of modifying the
Dom environment in the victim's browser
this environment is used by the original
client side script so that the client
side code runs in an unexpected manner
the vulnerability can be easily detected
if the next Link in the signup page is
inspector the href attribute value of
next link is confirm which is exactly
the value of the next URL query
parameter as you can see over here this
means using the next query parameter can
be used to inject a JavaScript code to
the href attribute of the next link the
following is the best way to do it as
soon as the user clicks on the link the
script will be triggered
we going to press anything random and
now that we click next we can see the
xss level 5 that we had provided in the
URL as a parameter to the next
variable since the value of next
provided appears on a popup we can
consider the attack a success and move
on to the final level six
six in this sub application it shows
some of the external Javascript is
received if you analyze the URL you can
see that the script is loaded already
the vulnerability lies within how the
code handles the value after the
hashtag if you check on line 45 the
value right after the hashtag is taken
as the gadget name
and then in line
48 the value is directly passed on to
the include Gadget method and the
include Gadget method that we can see
over
here you can see in line
18 a script tag is created and the URL
Gadget name parameter value is directly
used as the source attribute of the
script tag in line
28 this means we can completely control
the source attribute of the script tag
that is being created
that is with this vulnerability we can
inject our own JavaScript file into the
code we can inject a URL of our own
hosted JavaScript into the web
application's URL after the hashtag and
the URL should not be using https but
anything like that to bypass the regular
expression for security
checking going to remove the pre-stored
URL and we're going to load our own Java
script
file finally we have reached the end of
our
challenge we complete
six different varieties of cross
scripting attacks and use different
solutions for all of the six questions
with work from home being the norm in
today's era people spend considerable
amount of time on the internet often
without specific measures to ensure a
secure session apart from individuals
organizations worldwide that host data
and conduct business over the internet
are always at the risk of a DS attack
these DS attacks are getting more
extreme with hackers getting easy access
to the graph three of the six strongest
DS attacks were launched in 2021 with
the most extreme attack occurring just
last year in 2020 lately cyber criminals
have been actively seeking out new
services and protocols for amplifying
these DS attacks active involvement with
hacked machines and botet allow further
penetration into the consumer space
allowing much more elaborate attack
campaigns apart from General users
multinational corporations have also had
their fair share of of problems GitHub a
platform for software developers was the
target of a DS attack in 2018 widely
suspected to be conducted by Chinese
authorities this attack went on for
about 20 minutes after which the systems
were brought into a stable condition it
was the strongest DS attack to date at
the time and made a lot of companies
reconsider the security practices to
combat such attacks even after years of
experimentation Ros attacks are still at
large and can affect anyone in the
consumer and corporate space hey
everyone this is B from Simply learn and
welcome to this video on what is a Dos
attack let's learn more about what is a
Dos
attack a distributed denial of service
attack or dos is when an attacker or
attackers attempt to make it impossible
for a service to be delivered this can
be achieved by thating access to
virtually anything servers devices
Services networks applications s and
even specific transactions within
applications in a Dos attack it's one
system that is sending the malicious
data or requests a DS attack comes from
multiple systems generally these attacks
work by Drowning a system with requests
for data this could be sending a web
server so many requests to Ser a page
that it crashes under the demand or it
could be a database being hit with a
high volume of queries the result is
available internet bandwidth CPU and RAM
capacity become
overwhelmed the impact could range from
a minor annoyance from disrupted
services to experiencing entire websites
applications or even entire businesses
taking offline more often than not these
attacks are launched using machines in a
botnet a botnet is a network of devices
that can be triggered to send requests
from a remote Source often known as the
command and control center the bots in
the network attack a particular Target
thereby hiding the origin perpetrator of
the DS campaign but how do these devices
come under a botnet and what are the
requests being made to the web servers
let's learn more about these and how dos
attack
work a Dos attack is a two-phase process
in the first phase a hacker creates a
bot net of devices simply put a vast
network of computers are hacked via
malware ransomware or just simple social
engineering these devices become a part
of the botn net which can be triggered
any time to start bombarding a system or
a server on the instruction of the
hacker that created the bot net the
devices in this networks are called Bots
or zombies in the second phase a
particular Target is selected for the
attack when the hacker finds the right
time to attack all the zombies in the
botnet network send these requests to
the Target thereby taking up all the
servers available bandwidth these can be
simple ping requests or complex attacks
like SN flooding and UDP flooding the
aim is to overwhelm them with more
traffic than the server or the network
can accommodate the goal is to render
the website or service
inoperable there's a lot of wiggle room
when it comes to the type of Dos attack
a hacker can go with depending on the
target's vulnerability we can choose one
of the three broad categories of DS
attacks volume based attacks use massive
amounts of bogus traffic to overwhelm a
resource it can be a we s it or a server
they include icmp udap and spoofed
packet flood attacks the size of volume
based attack is measured in bits per
second these attacks focus in clogging
all the available bandwidth for the
server thereby cutting the supply short
several requests are sent to the server
all of which warrant a reply thereby not
allowing the target to cater to the
general legitimate
users next we have the protocol level
attacks these attacks are meant to
consume essential resources of the
target server they exhaust the load
balancers and firewalls which are meant
to protect the system against the dors
attacks these protocol attacks include
SN floods and Smurf DDOS among others
and the size is measured in packets per
second for example in an SSL handshake
server replies to the Hello message sent
by the hacker which will be the client
in this case but since the IP is poofed
and leads nowhere the server gets stuck
in an endless loop of sending the
acknowledgement without any end in
sight finally we have the application
Level attacks application layer attacks
are conducted by flooding applications
with maliciously crafted requests the
size of application layer attacks is
measured in request per second these are
relatively sophisticated attacks that
Target the application and operating
system level
vulnerabilities they prevent the
specific applications from delivering
necessary information to users and hog
the network bandid up to the point of a
system crash examples of such an attack
are HTTP flooding and bgp hijacking a
single device can request data from a
server using HTTP post or get without
any
issues however when the requisite botnet
is instructed to bombard the server with
thousands of requests the database
bandwidth gets jammed and it eventually
becomes unresponsive and
unusable but what about the reasons for
such an attack there are multiple lines
of thought as to why a hacker decides to
launch a Dos attack on unsuspecting
targets let's take a look at a few of
them the first option is to gain a
competitive Advantage many dos attacks
are conducted by hacking communities
against rival groups some organizations
hire such communities to stagger their
Rivals resources at a network level to
gain an advantage in the playing field
since being a victim of a DS attack
indicates a lack of security the
reputation of such a company takes a
significant hit allowing the rivals to
cover up some
ground secondly some hackers launch
these DS attacks to hold multinational
corporations at Ransom the resources are
jammed and the only way to clear the way
is if the target company agrees to pay a
designated amount of money to the
hackers even a few minutes of inactivity
is detrimental to a company's reputation
in the global market and it can cause a
spiral effect both in terms of market
value and product security index most of
the time a compromise is reached and the
resources are freed after a
while DS attacks have also found use in
the political segment certain activists
tend to use DS attacks to voice their
opinion spreading the word online is
much faster than any local Rally or
Forum primarily political these attacks
also focus on online communities ethical
dilemas or even protest against
corporations let's take a look at a few
ways that companies and individuals can
protect themselves against Ros
attacks the company can employ load
balancers and firewalls to help protect
the data from such attacks load
balancers reroute the traffic from one
server to another in a DS attack this
reduces the single point of failure and
adds resiliency to the server data a
firewall blocks unwanted traffic into a
system and manages the number of
requests made at a definite rate it
checks so multip triple attacks from a
single IP and occasional slowdowns to
detect a DS attack in
action early detection of a Dos attack
goes a long way in recovering the data
lost in such an event once you've
detected the attack you will have to
find a way to respond for example you
will have to work on dropping the
malicious DS traffic before it reaches
your server so that it doesn't throttle
and exhaust your bandwidth here's where
you will filter the traffic so that only
legitimate traffic reaches the server by
intelligent routing you can break the
remaining traffic into manageable chunks
that can be handled by your cluster
resources the most important stage in
DOS mitigation is where you will look
for patterns of Dos attacks and use
those to analyze and strengthen your
mitigation techniques for example
blocking an IP that's repeatedly found
to be offending is a first
step Cloud providers like Amazon web
services and Microsoft Azure who offer
high levels of cyber security including
firewalls and threat monitoring software
can help protect your assets and network
from DS criminals the cloud also has
greater bandd than most private networks
so it is likely to fail if under the
pressure of increased DS
attacks additionally reputable Cloud
providers offer Network redundancy
duplicating copies of your data systems
and equipment so that if your service
becomes corrupted or unavailable due to
a DS attack you can switch to a secure
access on backed up version without
missing a beat one can also increase the
amount of bandwidth available to a host
server being targeted since DS attacks
fundamentally operate on the principle
of overwhelming systems with heavy
traffic simply provisioning extra
bandwidth to handle unexpected traffic
spikes can provide a measure of
protection this solution can prove
expensive as a lot of that bandwidth is
going to go unused most of the
time a Content delivery Network or a c
DN distributes your content and boost
performance by minimizing the distance
between your resources and end users it
stores the cached version of your
content in multiple locations and this
eventually mitigates dos attacks by
avoiding a single point of failure when
the attacker is trying to focus on a
single Target popular CDN include acomi
CDN Cloud flare AWS cloudfront
Etc let's start with our demo regarding
the effects of DS attacks on a syst
system for our demo we have a single
device that will attack a Target making
it a Dos attack of sorts once a botet is
ready multiple devices can do the same
and eventually emulate a DS attack to do
so we will use the virtualization
software called VMware with an instance
of parad security operating system
running for a Target machine we will be
running another VMR instance of a
standard Linux distribution known as
Linux light in a Target device we can
use wire shockk to determine when the
attack begins and see the effects of the
attack
accordingly this is Linux light which is
a target machine and this is parro
security which is used by the hacker
when trying to launch a DS attack this
is just one of the dros that can be
used to launch the attack we must first
find the IP address of our
Target so to find the IP address we open
the terminal
we use the command if
config and here we can find the IP
address now remember we're launching
this attack in VMware now the both the
instances of parro security and Linux
light are being run on my local network
so the address that you can see here is
192.168
72129 which is a private address this IP
cannot be accessed from outside the
network basically anyone who is not
connected to my Wi-Fi when launching a
tags with public servers or public
addresses it will have a public IP
address that does not belong to the
192168
subnet once we have the IP
address we can use a tool
called HP
3 hping 3 is an open- Source packet
generator and analyzer for the TCP IP
protocol to check what are the effects
of an attack we will be using
Yark Yark is a network traffic analyzer
we can see whatever traffic that is
passing through the Linux light drro is
being displayed over here with the IP
address the source IP and the
destination IP as to where the request
is being transferred to once we have the
Dos attack launched you can see the
results coming over here here from The
Source IP which will be par security Now
to launch the hping 3 command we need to
give PSE sudo access to the console
which is the root
access now we have the root axis for the
console the hping 3 command will have a
few arguments to go with it which are as
you can see on the
screen minus s and a flood
a hyphen
V hyphen p8 and the IP address of the
target which is 192 168 72.1
129 in this command we have a few
arguments that such as the minus s which
specifies SN packets like in an SSL
handshake we have the SN request that
the client sends to the server to
initiate a connection The Hyphen flood
aims to ignore the replies that the
server will send back to the client in
response to the SN packets here the
parent security OS is the client and
Linux light being the
server minus v stands for verbosity as
in where we will see some output when
the requests are being sent the hyphen
p80 stands for Port 80 which we can
replace the port number if we want to
attack a print port and finally we have
the IP address of our
Target as of right now if we check wire
shock it is relatively clear and there
is no indication of a DS attack incoming
now once we launch the attack over
here we can see the requests coming in
from this IP which is 192 168
72128 till now even if the network is
responsive and so is Linux
light the requests keep on coming and we
can see the
HTTP flooding has started in flood
mode after a few seconds of this attack
continuing the server will start
shutting down now remember Linux light
is a drro that can focus on and that
serves as a back
end now remember Linux light is a drro
and such Linux drro are served as
backend to many servers across the world
for example a few seconds have passed
from the attack now the system has
become completely irresponsive this has
happened due to the huge number of
requests that came from par
security you can see whatever I pressed
nothing is responded even the wire shark
has stopped capturing new request
because the CPU usage right now is
completely 100% and at this point of
time anyone who is trying to request
some information from this Linux drro or
where this Linux drro is being used as a
backend for a server or a database
cannot access anything else the system
has completely stopped responding and
any request any legitimate request from
legitimate users will be
dropped once you stop the attack over
here it takes a bit of time to settle
down now remember it's still out of
control but eventually the traffic dies
down and the system regains its strength
it is relatively easy to gauge right now
the effect of a Dos attack now remember
this Linux light is just a VM instance
actual website servers and web databases
they have much more bandwidth and are
very secure and it is tough to break
into that is why we cannot use a single
machine to break into them that is where
a DS attack comes into play what we did
right now is a Dos attack as in a single
system is being used to penetrate a
Target server using a single request now
when a Dos attack multiple systems such
as multiple parro security instances or
multiple zombies or bots in a botnet
network can attack a Target server to
completely shut down the machine and
drop any legitimate request thereby
rendering the service and the target
completely unusable and
inoperable as a final note we would like
to remind that this is for educational
purposes only and we do not not endorse
any attacks on any domains only test
this on servers and networks that you
have permission to test on cyber
security has become one of the most
rigid Industries in the last decade
while simultaneously being the most
challenged with every aspect of
corporate culture going online and
embracing cloud computing there is a
plethora of critical data circulating
through the internet all worth billions
of dollars to the right person
increasing benefits require more complex
attacks and one of these attacks is a
Brute Force attack a brute force or
known as Brute Force cracking is the
Cyber attack equivalent of trying every
key on your keying and eventually
finding the right one boot Force attacks
are simple and reliable there is no
prior knowledge needed about the victim
to start an attack most of the systems
falling prey to Brute Force attacks are
actually well
secured attackers let a computer do the
work that is trying different
combinations of usernames and passwords
until they find a one that works due to
this repeated trial and error format the
strength of password matters a great
dral although with enough time and
resources brute force will break a
system since they run multiple
combinations until they find the right
passcode hey everyone this is B from
Simply learn and welcome to this video
on what is a Brute Force attack let's
begin with learning about Brute Force
attacks in
detail a Brute Force attack also known
as an exhaustive search is a
cryptographic hack that relies on
guessing possible combinations of
targeted password until the current
password is discovered it can be used to
break into online accounts encrypted
documents or even Network peripheral
devices the longer the password the more
combinations that will need to be tested
a br Force attack can be timec consuming
and difficult to perform if methods such
as data aisc are used and at times
downright
impossible however if the password is
weak it could merely take seconds with
hardly any effort dictionary attacks are
an alternative to Brute Force attacks
where the attacker already has a list of
usernames and passwords that need to be
tested against the target it doesn't
need to create any other combinations on
its own dictionary attacks are much more
reliable than brute force in a real
world context but the usefulness depends
entirely on the strength of passwords
being used by the general
population there is a three-step process
when it comes to brute forcing a system
let's learn about each of them in
detail in step one we have to settle on
a tool that we are going to use for
brute forcing there are some popular
names on the market like
hashcat Hydra and John the Ripper while
each of them has its own strength and
weaknesses each of them perform well
with the right configuration all of
these tools come pre-installed with
certain Linux distributions that cater
to penetration testers and cyber
security analysts like K Linux and
security after deciding what tool to use
we can start generating combinations of
alpha numeric variables whose only
limitation is the number of characters
for example while using Hydra a single
six-digit password will create 900,000
passwords with only digits involved add
alphabets and symbols to that sample
space and that numbers grows
exponentially the popular tools allow
customizing this process let's say the
hacker is aware of the password being a
specific eight-digit word containing
only letters and symbols this will
substantially increase the chances of
being able to guess the right password
since we remove the time taken to
generate the longer ones we omit the
need for including digits in such
combinations these small tweaks go a
long way in organizing an efficient
Boost Force attack since running all the
combinations with no filters will
dramatically reduce the odds of finding
the right credentials in time in the
final step we done these combinations
against the file or service that is
being broken we can try and break into a
specific encrypted document a social
media account or even devices at home
that connect to the internet let's say
there is a Wi-Fi router the generated
passwords are then fed into the
connection one after the other it is a
long and arduous process but the work is
left to the computer other than someone
manually clicking and checking each of
these
passcodes any password that doesn't
unlock the router is discarded and the
Brute Force tool simply moves on to the
next one this keeps going on until we
find the right combination which unlocks
the
router sometimes reaching the success
stage takes days and weeks which makes
it cumbersome for people with low
computing power at their disposal
however the ability to crack any system
in the world purely due to bad password
habits is very appealing and the general
public tends to stick with simple and
easy to ous
passwords now that we have a fair idea
about how Brute Force Works let's see if
we can answer this question we learned
about how complex passwords are tougher
to crack by Brute Force among the ones
listed on the screens which one do you
believe will take the longest to be
broken when using Brute Force tools
leave your answers in the comment
section and we will get back to you with
the correct option next
week let's move on to the harmful
effects of getting a system compromised
due to Brute Force attacks
a hacked laptop or mobile can have
social media accounts logged in giving
the hackers free access to the victim's
connections it has been reported on
multiple occasions where compromised
Facebook accounts are sending malicious
links and attachments to people on their
friends
list one of the significant reasons for
hacking malware infusion is best done
when spread from multiple devices
similar to Distributing spam this
reduces the chance of circling back the
source to single device which belongs to
the hacker once brute forced A system
can spread malware via email attachments
sharing links file upload via FTP
Etc personal information such as credit
card data usage habits private images
and videos are all stored in our systems
be it in plane format or root folders a
compromised laptop means easy access to
these information that can be further
used to impersonate the victim regarding
Bank verification among other things
once a system is hacked it can also be
used as a mail server that distributes
spam across lists of victims since the
hack machines all have different IP
addresses and Mac addresses it becomes
challenging to trace the spam back to
the original hacker with so many harmful
implications arising from a boot Force
attack it's imperative that the general
public must be protected against such
let's learn about some of the ways we
can prevent ourselves from becoming a
victim of Brute Force attacks
using passwords consisting of alphabets
letters and numbers have a much higher
chance of its standing Brute Force
attacks thanks to the sheer number of
combinations they can produce the longer
the password the less likely it is that
a hacker will devote the time and
resources to bruteforce them having
alpha numeric passwords also allows the
user to keep different passwords for
different websites this is to ensure
that if a single account or password is
compromised due to a breach or a hack
the rest of the accounts are isolated
from the
incident two-factor authentication
involves receiving a one-time password
on a trusted device before a new login
is allowed this OTB can be obtained
either via email SMS or specific 2fa
applications like Ai and Aegis email and
SMS based otps are considered relatively
less secure nowadays due to the ease
with which SIM cards can be duplicated
and mailboxes can be hacked and
applications that are specifically made
for tofa course are much more reliable
and
secure captures are used to stop Bots
from running through web pages precisely
to prevent brute forcing through their
website since Brute Force tools are
automated forcing the hacker to solve
capture for every iteration of a
password manually is very challenging
the capture system can filter out these
automated Bots that keep refreshing the
page with different credentials thereby
reducing the chances of Brute Force cons
considerably a definite rule that locks
the account being hacked for 30 minutes
after a specific number of attempts is a
good way to prevent Brute Force attempts
many websites lock account for 30
minutes after three failed password
attempts to secure the account against
any such attack on an additional note
some websites also send an email
instructing the user that there have
been three insecure attempts to log into
the
website let's look at a demonstration of
how Brute Force attacks work in a real
world situation the world has gone
Wireless with WiFi taking the re in
every household it's natural that the
security will always be up for debate to
further tou the security index and
understand Brute Force attacks we will
attempt to break into the password of a
Wi-Fi router for that to happen we first
need to capture a handshake file which
is a connection file from the Wi-Fi
router to a connecting device like a
mobile or a laptop the operating system
used for the process is parot security a
Linux distribution that is catered to
penetration testers all the tools being
used in this demo can easily be found
pre-installed in this operating system
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more to start our demo we're going to
use a tool called air gedon which is
made to hack into wireless network
specifically
at this point it's going to check for
all the necessary scripts that are
installed in the
system to crack into a Wi-Fi and to
capture the handshake file we're going
to need an external network card the
significance of the external network
card is a managed mode and a monitor
mode for now the WL X1 named card is my
external network adapter which I'm going
to select to be able to capture data
over the air we're going to need to put
it in monitor mode as you can see above
it's written it is in manage mode right
now so we're going to select option two
which is to put the interface in monitor
mode and it name is now dou land zero
monitor the monitor mode is necessary to
capture data over the air that is the
necessary reason why we need an external
card since a lot of inbuilt cards that
come with the laptops and the systems
they cannot have a monitor mode
installed once we select the mode we can
go into the fifth which is the handshake
tools
menu in the first step we have to
explore for targets and it is written
that monitor mode is necessary to select
a Target so let's explore for
targets and press enter
we have to let this run for about 60
seconds to get a fair idea about the
networks that are currently working in
this locality for example this ESS ID is
supposed to be the Wi-Fi name that we
see when connecting to a network go24
recover me these are all the names that
we see on our mobile when trying to
search for the Wi-Fi this BSS ID is
supposed to be an identifier somewhat
like a MAC address that identifies this
network from other devices the channels
features on one or two or there are some
many channels that the networks can
focus
on this here is supposed to be a client
that is connected to one such Network
for example the station that you can see
5626 this is supposed to be the MAC
address of the device that is connected
to a router this BSS ID is supposed to
be which wi-fi it is connected to for
example 5895 d8 is this one which is the
go24 router so we already know which
router has a device connected to it and
we can use our attack to capture this
handshake now that we it has already run
for 1 minute now that we press contrl
C we will be asked to select a Target
see it has already selected the number
five which is the ge24 router as the one
with clients so it is easy to run an
attack on and it is easy to capture a
handshake
for select Network 5 and we run run a
capture
handshake it says we have a valid WPA
WPA2 Network Target selected and that
the script can
continue now to capture the handshake we
have a couple of attacks a do or a do
air replay attack what this attack does
is kick the clients out of the network
in return when they try to reconnect to
the Wi-Fi as they are configured that
way that when a client is disconnected
it tries to reconnect it immediately it
tries to capture a handshake file which
in turn contains the security key which
is necessary to initiate the
handshake for our demo let's go with the
second option that is the do air replay
attack select a timeout value let's say
we give it 60
seconds and we start the
script we can see it capturing data from
the ge24 network and here we go we have
the WPA handshake file
once the handshake file is captured can
actually close this and here we go
congratulations in order to capturing a
handshake it has verified that a pmk ID
from the target network has successfully
been captured this is the file that is
already stored a do cap file for the
path we can let's say we can keep it in
a
desktop okay we give the
path and the Hand Shi file is generated
ated we can already see a Target over
here same go24 router with the BSS
ID now if we return to its main
menu we already have the handshake file
captured with us now our job is to Brute
Force into that handshake capture file
the capture file is often encrypted with
the security key of the Wi-Fi network if
we know how to decrypt it we will
automatically get the security key so
let's go to the offline WPA P2 decrypt
menu since we'll be cracking personal
networks we can go with option
one now to run the Brute Force tool we
have two options either we can go with
the air crack or we can go with the
hashcat let's go with airc plus crunch
which is a Brute Force attack against a
handshake file we can go with option
two it can already detect the capture
file that we have generated
so we select
yes the BSS ID is the one which denotes
the ge24 router so we're going to select
yes as well the minimum length of the
key for example it has already checked
that the minimum length of a Wi-Fi
security key which is a WPA2 psk key
will always be more than eight digits
and Below 64 digits so we have to select
something in between this range so if we
already know let's say that the password
is at least 10 digits we can go with the
minimum l length as 10 and as a rough
guess let's say we put the maximum
length as
20 the character set that we going to
use for checking the password will
affect the time taken to Brute Force for
example if you already know that or we
have seen a user use the password while
connecting to the router as something
that has only numbers and symbols then
we can choose accordingly let's say if
we go with only uppercase characters and
numeric characters
go with option
seven and it's going to start
decrypting so how aircrack is working
right here you can see this pass phrase
over here the first five or six digits
are a it starts working its way from the
end from the last character it keeps
trying every single combination you can
see the last the fourth character from
the right side the D it'll eventually
turn to
e because it keeps checking up every
single character from the end this will
keep going on until all the single
characters are tested and every single
combination is tried out since the
handshake file is encrypted using the
security key that is the WPA2 key of the
router whichever pass phrase is able to
decrypt the handshake key completely
will be the key of the Wi-Fi router this
is the way we can Brute Force into Wi-Fi
routers anywhere in the world cber
attacks are frequently making headlines
in today's digital environment at any
time everyone who uses a computer could
become a victim of a Cyber attack there
are various sorts of cyber attacks
ranging from fishing to password attacks
in this video we'll look into one such
attack that is known as botet but before
we begin if you love watching Tech
videos subscribe to our Channel and hit
the Bell icon never to miss an update to
begin with let's take a look at at some
of the famous botet attacks the first
one is Mirai botet which is a malicious
program designed to attack vulnerable
iot devices and infect them to form a
network of bots that on command perform
basic and medium level denial of service
attacks then we have the zo bot is
specifically designed for attacking the
system for Bank related information and
data now let's see what exactly a botnet
is botnet refers to a network of
hijacked interconnected devices that are
installed with malicious codes known as
malware each of these infected devices
are known as Bots and the hijack
criminal known as bot Herer remotely
controls them the Bots are used to
automate large scale attacks including
Data Theft server failure malware
propagation and denial of service
attacks now that we know what exactly a
bot net is let's dive deeper into
learning how bot net works during the
preparation of a bot net Network the
first step involves preparing the bot
net Army after that the connection
between the botnet Army and the control
server established in the end the
launching of the attack is done by the B
Herer let's understand through a
illustration firstly we have a b Herer
that initiates the attack according to
the control server commands the devices
that are infected with the malware
programs and begins to attack the
infected system let's see some details
regarding the preparation of the bot net
Army the first step is known as the
prepping the botn net Army the first
step is creating a botnet is to infect
as many as connected devices as possible
this ensures that there are enough Bots
to carry out the attack this way it
creates Bots either by exploiting the
security gaps in the software or
websites or using fishing attacks they
are often deployed through troan
horses for the next step we have
establishing the connection once it
hacks the device as per previous step it
infects it with a specific malware that
connects the device back to the control
bot server a bot Herer uses command
programming to drive the bot's
actions and the last step is known as
launching the attack once infected a bot
allows access to atmin level operation
like Gathering and stealing of data
reading and rewriting the system data
monitoring user activities performing
denial of service attacks including
other cyber
crimes now let's take a look at the B
architecture the first type is known as
client server model the client server
model is a traditional model that
operates with the help of a command and
control center server and communication
protocols like IRC
when the bot Herer issues a command to
the server it is then related to the
clients to perform malicious
actions then we have peer-to-peer model
here controlling the infected Bots
involves a peer-to-peer Network that
relies on a decentralized approach that
is the BS are topological interconnected
and acts as both C and C servers that is
the server and the client to the hackers
adopt this approach to avoid detection
and single point
failure in the end we will see some
points on some counter measure against
bot net
attacks the first step is to have
updated drivers and system updates after
that we should avoid clicking random
popups or links that we often see on the
internet and lastly having certified
antivirus anti-spyware softwares and
firewall installed into a system will
protect against malware attack the
internet is an endless source of
information and data still in some cases
we come across some occurrences like
cyber attacks hacking force entry which
may affect a Time on the web hi everyone
and welcome to the simply La Channel
today we will discuss a topic that
secretly records our input data that is
known as e loggers but before we begin
if you like watching Tech videos
subscribe to our Channel and hit the
Bell icon to never miss an
update to understand the key logging
problem better let's take a look look at
an
example this is June she works in a
business firm where she manages the
company's data
regularly this is Jacob from the
information Department who is here to
inform her about some of the security
protocols during the briefing she
informed him about some of the problems
her system was facing with which
included slow reaction speed and unusual
internet
activity as Jacob heard about the
problems with the system he thinks of
the possibility what could be the reason
behind these problems a system was
facing
with the conclusion that he came across
was the key loging
issue unknown to the problem her system
was facing with she asked him about some
of the details regarding
it for today's topic we learn what
exactly key loggers are and how they
affect our system what are the harmful
effects that key logging can bring into
the system to begin with we learn what
what exactly the key logging program
is as the name suggests key logger is a
malicious program or a tool that are
designed to record key strokes that are
typed during data input and record them
into a lock file then the same program
secretly sends these loog files to its
origin where they can be used for
malicious acts by the
hacker now that we know what the key
logging program is let's take a look how
the enter into the
system searching for a suitable driver
for a system can often lead to the
installation of the key logging program
into the system if we often visit
suspicious sites and uncertified
software are installed into our system
then if we use unknown links or visiting
unknown websites which come through
unknown addresses can also be a reason
behind the key logging issue entering
into the system and lastly there are
often cases where different popups that
we often see on social sites or
different media sites can lead to the
installation of key loging program into
a
system now that we know how the problem
gets into the system let's take a look
how to identify whether the system is
infected by the key logging
issue the key logging issue can be
identified if there are often cases when
a keyboard lags behind the system the
data that we enter sometimes it's stuck
in between when we type through the
input then there are cases when the
system freeze occurs unknowingly to what
exactly could be the reason behind them
and also there are delayed reaction time
for different applications that run on
the system and lastly there are
different cases when we often see
suspicious internet activity on the
system that we don't know about this
could lead to the ident identification
of a problem into the
system now we'll take a look at
different types of key loggers that are
present on the net which can harm our
system
differently the first problem that key
loggers arounds is API based the most
common key logging case which uses apis
to keep a log of the type data and share
it to its origin for malicious purposes
each time we press a key the key key
logger intercepts the signal and logs it
then we have form grabbing based key
loggers as the name suggests they are
based key loggers that store the form
data that is if we often use web forms
or different kinds of forms to enter
different data they can be recorded into
the system by the program and send it to
its
origin then we have kernel based key
loggers these key loggers are installed
deeply into the operating system where
they can hide from different antivirus
if not checked properly and they record
the data that we type on the keyboard
and send it to its
origin and lastly we have Hardware Key
loggers these key loggers are present
directly into the hardware that is they
are embedded into system where they
record the data that we type on the
keyboard now let's take a look how
hackers differentiate different type of
recorded data and exploit
them when hackers receive information
about the target they might use it to
Blackmail the target which may affect
the personal life of the Target and also
blackmail them for different money
related
issues then in case of company data that
is recorded by the key logging program
can also affect the economic value of
the company in the market which may lead
to the downfall of the
company also in some cases the key
logging program can also log data about
military Secrets which may include
nuclear codes or security protocols
which are necessary to maintain the
security of a
country now let's take a look whether
mobile devices get infected with the key
logging issue or
not in the case of hand devices
infection of key loggers are low in
comparison to the computer systems as
they use onscreen keyboard or virtual
keyboard but in some cases we often see
different tyes of malicious programs
getting installed into the hand device
if we often visit different uncertified
websites or illegal websites or torrent
sites and also the device that is
infected with the key logging issue or
different kind of malicious program can
often lead to the exploitation of data
that includes photos emails or important
files by the hacker or the Cyber
criminal that install the particular
malicious program into the
system now to prevent our system from
getting infected by the key locking
program let's take a look at different
points the first point includes using of
different antivirus softwares or tools
which can prevent the entering of
malicious program into the
system then keeping system security
protocols regularly updated is also a
good
happen and lastly using virtual keyboard
to input our sensitive data which may
include Bank details login details or
different passwords related to different
websites now that we have some
understanding about the topic of key
loggers let's take a look at the demo to
further increase the knowledge about the
topic for the first step we have to
download some of the important libraries
that are required into the system
which
is this library now we'll run
it the system says the library is
already installed into the
system now let's take a look what
exactly modules are required from the
particular
library from this Library we'll
import the keyboard module which will
help us to record the data that we type
on the
keyboard now from the same we'll also
import key
module and The Listener
module and
also the logging module which will help
us to record the data into a log
file for the next part we'll write a
piece of code that will allow us to save
that data that is recorded by the
program into a text file that will be
named as key log text file along with
the date and time stamp let's take a
look now we'll provide it with the file
name that will be given as
key log do txt
file and also so the part where the
format of the data is
recorded put the brackets over here to
contain the file name now we'll write
the format in which the data will be
recorded into the log file which will be
given as
the format would be the message and the
time stamp which would be given
as along with the time
stamp as
percentage and ending it with the
bracket now for the next step we'll
design two of the functions that will be
used into the program that will be
termed as while press function and while
release function let's take a
look while press
function would be a function that will
come into play when the keyboard key has
been pressed
is
pred
and this would go for the format that we
designed in the above
line
and logging
the Press
key
info or string file to be
recorded into the lock file
now now we'll design a function that is
while
release that will come into play when
the Escape key has been pressed that is
the program will terminate itself and
the program will stop from
running and in the
end we require for the functioning of
the program to Loop these functions that
is while press and while release to
continue its
cycle that will be going for while press
and
on release will contain while release
function
as listen
now and now this part would join the
different threads and store them into
the log file now that we have completed
the code for the program let's run it
we have to wait for a moment so the
program runs it
now to verify the program let's open
notepad and on the notepad we'll
write hello
world which will be the basic whether
the program is working or not let's take
a look
and we'll go for the main page on
Jupiter notebook and refresh the page go
to the
bottom over here we see the key log text
that is the text file that we created
let's open
it and over here we have the data that
is created as we started with
Note then this is the hello world part
that we created just
now which shows that the program we
created is working properly now that we
have reached the end of the module let's
take a look at the summary firstly we
learn what exactly key logos are then we
understood what different modes are
present how the system get infected with
the key loging problem then we learn how
to detect the problem into our system
then we learn what different types of
key loggers are present on the net we
also understood how hackers use the
recorded dat data from the program and
we also learn whether mobile devices get
infected with the key logging problem or
not and lastly we understood what
different points can be taken to prevent
the entering of the key logging problem
into the system and before we begin if
you're someone who is interested in
building a career in cyber security or
to become an ethical hacker by
graduating from the best universities or
a professional who elicits to switch
career with cyber security or ethical
hacker by learning from the experts and
try giving a short to simp simply learns
postgraduate program in cyber security
with modules from MIT schi College of
computing the course link is mentioned
in the description box below that will
navigate you to the course page where
you can find a complete overview of the
program being offered before we learn
about the Pegasus platform let us
understand what spyware is and it's
working spyware is a category of malware
that can gather information regarding a
user or a device straight from the host
machine it is mostly spread by malicious
links via email or chat application
when a link with the malware is received
clicking on this link will activate the
spyware which allows the hacker to spy
on all our user information with some
spy systems even clicking on the link
isn't necessary to trigger the malicious
payload this can ultimately cause
security complications and further loss
of privacy one such spy system that is
making the rounds in the tech industry
today is Pegasus the Pegasus is a
spyware system developed by an Israeli
company known as the NSO group it runs
on mainly mobile devices spanning across
the major operating systems like the
Apple's IOS on iPhone and the standard
Android versions this is not a newly
developed platform since Pegasus has
existed since as early as 2016 a highly
intricate spyware program that can track
user location read text messages scan
through mobile files access device
camera and microphone to record voice
and video Pegasus has all the tools
necessary to enforce surveillance for
any Cent clent that wishes to buy its
services initially the NSO group had
designed the software to be used against
terrorist factions of the world with
more and more encrypted communication
channels coming to the Forefront Pegasus
was designed to maintain control over
the data transmission that can be a
threat to National Security
unfortunately the people who bought the
software had complete control over who
how and up to what level they can put
surveillance limits on eventually the
primary clients became Sovereign Nations
spying on Public Information that is
supposed to stay private became really
easy with the service multiple devices
can be affect With the same spyware
system to create a network information
this network keeps feeding data to the
host to understand how a network can be
created let's know how a mobile device
can be affected by Pegasus we all
communicate with friends and family over
instant messaging applications and email
in some instances if you check your
inbox on a regular basis you must have
noticed that that we receive some spam
emails that the mail providers like
Gmail and Yahoo can just filter into the
spam folder some of these messages
bypass this filter and make their way
into a person's inbox they look like
generic emails which are supposed to be
safe the Pegasus pyware Target such
occurrences byp passing malicious
messages and links which install the
necessary Spy software on the user's
mobile device be it Android or an iPhone
this isn't unique to the email ecosystem
since it's equally like to be targeted
by SMS text WhatsApp Instagram or even
the most secure messaging apps like
signal and threa once the malicious
links are clicked a spyware package is
downloaded and installed on the device
after the spyware is successfully
installed the perpetrator who sent the
payload to the victim can monitor
everything the user does Pegasus can
collect private emails passwords images
videos and every other piece of
information that passes to the device
Network all the data is transmitted back
to the central server where the primary
spying organization can monitor the
activities at a granular level this is
not even surface level since complex Spy
software like Pegasus can access the
root files on our mobiles these root
files hold information that is crucial
to the working of the Android and iOS
operating systems leaking such private
information is a massive blow to the
security and the privacy of an
individual the information that may seem
trivial like the name of your wife Wi-Fi
connection or the last time you ordered
an item from Amazon are indeed all
valuable information this exploitation
is primarily possible due to the zero
day vulnerabilities known as bugs in the
software development process the zero
day bugs are the ones that have just
been discovered by some independent
security company or a researcher once
they are found reporting these
vulnerabilities to the developer of the
platform which would be either Google
for Android or Apple for iOS is the
right thing to do however however many
such critical bugs make their way onto
the dark web where hackers can use them
to create exploits these exploits are
then sent to innocent users with a link
or a message like we had discussed
before Pegasus was able to affect the
latest devices with the all the security
patches installed but some bugs are not
reported to the developers or just
cannot be fixed without breaking some
core functionality these become the
Gateway for spyware to enter into the
system you can never be 100% safe but
you sure can give it all in protecting
yourself the one thing where Pegasus
stands out is a zeroc click action
feature usually in spam emails the
malicious code is activated when the
user clicks the malware link a user
doesn't need to click the link in the
new version of the Pegasus and a few
other spyware programs once the message
arrives in the inbox of WhatsApp Gmail
or any other chat applications the
spyware gets activated and everything
can be recorded and sent back to the
central server the primary issue with
being affected by spyware as a victim is
detection unlike Crypt Miners and
Trojans spying Services usually do not
demand many system resources which makes
them tough to detect after they have
been activated since many devices slow
down after a couple of years any kind of
Performance Set due to such spyware is
often attributed to poor software
longetivity by the users they do not
check meticulously for any other causes
that is causing the Slowdown when left
unchecked these device devices can
capture voice and video from the mobile
sensors while keeping the owner in the
dark let's take a moment to check if we
are well aware of the causes of such
attacks how do users fall prey to such
spyware programs a by installing
untested software B by clicking on the
third party links from email and
messages C by not keeping the apps and
phones updated or D all of the above let
us know your answers in the comment
section below and we will rev the
correct answer next week but for what
about the unaffected devices the
vulnerable ones while we cannot be
certain of our security there are a few
things we can do to boost our device be
it against Pegasus or the next big spyer
on the market let's say we are safe now
and we have the time to take the
necessary steps to prevent a spare
attack what are the things we can go for
a primary goal must always be to keep
our apps and the operating system
updated the latest security patches the
vulnerabilities that the exploits Target
are often discovered by developers from
Google and apple which send the security
patches quickly this can be done for
individual apps as well so keeping them
updated is of utmost importance while
the most secure devices have fallen prey
to Pegasus as well a security patch from
developers may help in minimizing the
damage at a later stage or maybe negate
the entire spyware platform altogether
another big factor is the spread of
malware is the trend of sideloading
Android applications using do APK files
downloading such apps from a third party
website have no security checks involved
and are mostly responsible for adware
and spyware invasions on user devices
avoiding the side loading of apps would
be a major step in protecting yourself
we often receive spam emails or text
from people we may not know on social
medias they are accompanied with links
that allow malware to creep into our
device we should try to follow the
trusted websites and not click on any
links that redirect us to unknown
domains spy is a controversial segment
in governance while the ramifications
are pretty extreme in theory it severely
impacts user privacy against
authoritarian regimes sufficient
resources and a contingent plan can
alter the false ve of democracy
altogether even if our daily life is
rather simplistic we must understand
that privacy is not about what we have
to hide instead it portrays the things
we have to protect it stands for
everything we have to share with the
outside world both rhetorically and
literally hey everyone today we look at
the hack which took the World by storm
and affected multiple governments and
corporations the solar wind attack the
global statistics indicate that upward
of 18,000 customers have been affected
potentially needing billions to recover
the losses incurred before we have a
look at this hack Make sure to subscribe

Bell to never miss an update from Simply
learn the date is December 8th 2020 fire
a global leader in company specializing
in cyber security released a blog post
that caught the attention of the entire
it Community a software known as Orion
which was developed by solar wind
incorporator had become a victim of a
remote access Trojan or a rat the breach
was estimated to be running since the
spring of 2020 and went virtually
unnoticed for months the reveal sent the
developers of the Orion software into a
frenzy as they quickly released a couple
of hot fixes for the platform in order
to mitigate this threat and prevent
further damage but how did this come
into existence we first need to
understand the platform which was
responsible for this breach soloin a
software company based in Texas United
States had developed a management
platform known as Orion Hing to
corporations and governments worldwide
Orion was responsible for the monitoring
and management of it Administration this
included managing the client servers
virtualization components and even the
organization's Network infrastructure
that bought the platform solar wind
claims they have more than 300 ,000
clients including US government agencies
and several Fortune 500 companies this
entire chain can be classified as a
supply chain attack in this variant of
cyber crime the hackers Target
relatively weaker links in an
organization's chain of control and
delivery these are preferbly services
rendered by a third party since there is
no direct jurisdiction over it in this
case the Orion platform was the primary
target the culprit however was software
updates the update server for solar
Orion had a malicious version attached
with malware or a Trojan to be precise
this was made possible since the code
repository that handled the software
updates was breached once the update
server repository was compromised the
source code of the applications became
open to modification and malicious code
found its way onto the software the
remote access troen was attached to a
potential update nicknamed the Sunburst
update this update gave hackers pack
door access to any client that uses the
correct version on its release many
clients believe the update to be
legitimate since it came from the right
source and they had no reason to believe
otherwise American government agencies
were supposedly hit the hardest as the
list of victims included the US
Departments of Homeland Security
treasury and health several private
companies like Cisco Nvidia and Intel
were compromised according to a list
published by the cyber security firm TRC
most of the companies had issues quick
updates to fix this vulnerabilities
introduced by the software while the
actual perpetrators have never been
found it is believed that this was an
act of crossborder corporate Espionage
conducted by state sponsored hackers
either from Russia or
China before we move forward let's take
a recap of the things we learned what
category of malware was responsible for
the solar wind hack was it one a virus a
remote access troan a spyware or a worm
let us know your answers in the comment
section right away and we will reveal
the correct answer in a week coming to
possible reparations the Biden
government has launched a full
investigation on the effects and the
repercussions of this breach there are a
couple of things that we as consumers
must always tend to when working our way
through the worldwide web using a
password manager is highly recommended
which can generate secure alpha numeric
passwords you must also use different
passwords for different accounts thereby
reducing the chances of a single point
of failure should one of those accounts
get breached usage of two-factor
authentication applications is also
encouraged since it access a safety net
if hackers directly get a hold of our
credentials clicking on unknown links
transmitted via emails is also a strict
no as is installing applications from
unverified sources the solar wind hack
is estimated to cost the parent company
nearly $18 million as reparations making
it one if not the biggest hacks in
cyberspace history as recently as of
July 2021 the hackers access some us
attorneys Microsoft 365 email accounts
as part of the attack criminal
organizations like the FBI and CIA are
determined to figure out the culprits
responsible for this debacle however the
intricacy and the full extent of the
breach makes it a way more complicated
job than it looks on paper the day is
26th February
2022 the world is hit with breaking news
that Russian State tv channels have been
hacked by Anonymous a activist
collective in movement who have made a
name taking part in multiple Cyber Wars
in the past decade this was in response
to the Russian aggression on Ukrainian
territory in the hopes of annexation
Anonymous hacked the Russian State TV
networks to combat propaganda in Russia
and highlight the damage to life Meed
out by the Kremlin in Ukraine they also
hacked 120,000 Russian troops personal
information and the Russian Central Bank
stealing 35,000 files this served as a
clear indicator of how cyber War can
change the momentum in battle something
which people had never seen so closely
so what is cyber War a digital assault
or series of strikes or hacks against a
country is sometimes referred to as a
cyber War it has the ability to cause
havoc on government and civilian
infrastructure as well as disrupted
cenal systems causing State harm and
even death in this day and age the
internet plays a bigger role than just
watching videos and learning content
it's where you have your personal data
and carry Financial transactions so
rather than resorting to physical
violence cyber War has become the new
means to cause Havoc considering the
vulnerability of the data passing
through the internet in most
circumstances cyber warfare involves a
nation state attacking another in
certain cases the assaults are carried
out by terrorist organizations or
non-state actors pursuing a hostile
nation's aim in June 2021 Chinese
hackers targeted organizations like
Verizon to secure remote access to their
networks stuck net was a computer worm
designed to attack Iran's nuclear
facilities but evolved and expanded to
many other Industrial and energy
producing sites in
2010 since the definition of cyber war
is so vague applying rules and sanctions
based on digital assault is even tougher
making the field of cyber warfare a
lawless land not bound by any rules or
policies there are multiple ways in
which these attacks can be carried out a
major category of Cyber attack is
espionage Espionage intels monitoring
other countries to steal critical
Secrets this might include compromising
vulnerable computer systems with botn
Nets or spear fishing attempts before
extracting sensitive data in cyber
warfare the next weapon in cyber war is
sabotage government agencies must
identify sensitive data and its dangers
if it is exploited Insider threats such
as disgruntled or irresponsible
Personnel or government staff with ties
to the attacking country can be used by
hostile countries or terrorists to steal
or destroy information by overwhelming a
website with bogus requests and forcing
it to handle them denial of service
attacks prohibit real users from
accessing it attacking parties may use
this form of assault to disrupt key
operations and systems and prevent
citizens military and security officials
and research organizations from
accessing sensitive websites but what
benefits does Cyber War offer in
contrast to traditional physical Warfare
the most important Advantage is the
ability to conduct attacks from anywhere
Global without having to travel
thousands of miles as long as the
attacker and Target are connected to the
internet organizing and launching Cyber
Wars is relatively less tedious Than
Physical Warfare people living in or
battling for a country are subjected to
propaganda attacks in an attempt to
manipulate their emotions and thoughts
digital infrastructure is highly crucial
in today's modern world starting from
communication channels to Secure Storage
servers crippling a Country Split print
and control on the Internet is very
damaging but what are some of the ways
we as Citizens protect ourselves in the
case of a cyber war in the unfortunate
event that your country is involved in
Warfare be sure to fact check every
piece of information and follow only
trusted sources in that frame of time
even conversations online should be
limited to a need to know basis
considering propaganda campaigns have
the power to influence the tide of War
drastically it is highly crucial to
follow basic security guidelines to
secure our devices like regularly
updating operating systems occasionally
running full system antivirus scans Etc
if your country or organization is being
attacked having devices segregated in a
network goes a long way in bolstering
security try to avoid sharing a lot of
personal data online in this era of
Instagram and Facebook divulging private
information can be detrimental to
keeping a secure firewall for your data
the more information an attacker has
access to the higher his chances of
being able able to devise a plan to
infiltrate the FES and if you're someone
who is interested in building a career
in cyber security that is by graduating
from the best universities or a
professional who sits to switch careers
with cyber security by learning from the
experts then try giving a short to
Simply learns postgraduate program in
cyber security with modules from the MIT
schwarzman College of Engineering and
the course link is mentioned in the
description box that will navigate you
to the course page where you can find a
complete overview of the program being
offered during data transmission there
are various external factors which can
affect the transmission of data over a
network channel to prevent such cases
from happening we use Internet Protocol
security which we'll be discussing in
the session on IPC explain hi guys and
welcome to yet testing video by simply
learn but before we begin if you are
watching Tech videos subscribe to our
Channel and hit the Bell icon to miss an
update from us now without further Ado
let's take a look at the agenda for this
session to begin with we will look into
what is IP SEC continuing with why do we
use IPC in a
network followed by components of
IPC modes of Ip security as for the last
topic we will look into working steps
involved in IP security let's begin with
the first setting that is what is IP
SEC IP SEC Internet Protocol security is
defined as a set set of framework and
protocol to ensure data transmission
over a network
channel this protocol was initially
defined of two main protocols for data
security over a network channel which
were authentication header which is
responsible for data integrity and
anti-replay
services and the second protocol is
encapsulating security payload in short
ESP which includes data encryption and
data
authentication now let's move on to the
next setting that is why do we use IPC
in a
network IP SEC is used to secure
sensitive data and information such as
company data clinical data Bank data and
various sensitive information regarding
an institution which are used during
data transmission over a network
channel the use of vpns that are virtual
private networks and apply IPC protocols
to encrypt the data for inin
transmission let's continue with why do
we use IPC
Services IPC is also used to encrypt
data for application layer in the OSI
model and provide security for sharing
data over Network routers and data
authentication let's take a look at the
working of ipx
services to begin with we have two
different systems system 1 and system 2
which will establish a network channel
and then the encryption of data will
takes place when one host will share the
data to the second host during this ipx
services will secure the data that is to
be transferred over the network channel
by applying router encryption and
authentication now let's move on to the
next topic that is components of Ip sec
the ipx services comprises of multiple
protocols that ensure the data
transmission over the network channel
the first one is encapsulating security
payload protocol in short
ESP this protocol of Ip security
provides data encryption and
authentication
services and it also authenticates and
encrypt the data packet in the
transmission
Channel moving on we have authentication
header in short as
similar to ESP the authentication header
also provides all the security services
but it does not encrypt the data it also
protects the IP packet and adds
additional headers to the packet header
the modified IP datagram looks this way
where the IP components are included at
the second position the seventh position
and the sixth position along with the
authentication of data services over the
network channel
moving on we have Internet key exchange
ik
ke this protocol provides protection for
Content data and also changes the
attribute of the original data to be
shared by implementing sha and md5
algorithms they also check the message
for authentication and then only is
forwarded to the receiver site for
example this is the original data packet
we are used to with IP head apart TCP
UDP and data whereas this is the
modified IP site data packet where ESP
header is added between IP header and
the TCP
protocol now let's move on to the next
heading that is modes of Ip
SEC there are basically two types of Ip
modes available for data transmission
over the network channel where the first
one is tunnel mode this mode of
transmission is used to secure gateway
to Gateway data
it is applied when the final destination
of the data is to be connected to a
sender site through a connection Gateway
over the Internet for example we have
two host host a and host B through the
host a we are sending a message to host
B which will pass through a Gateway at
host a point and it passes through a
gateway to host B
then this a basic format for Gateway to
Gateway data
transmission and the given IP datagram
format is used for tunnel mode now let's
move on to the second mode of IPC that
is transport mode this mode of Ip SEC is
used to protect protocols like TCP or
UDP and is used to ensure endtoend
communication unlike tunnel mode the
transport mode data at authentication
header and encapsulating security
payload for security purpose in the IP
header this is the modified IP datagram
for transport mode the point to be noted
is the IP SEC header is always added
between IP header and TCP
Eder now let's move on to the last
heading for this session on IP SEC that
is the working steps involved in IP
Security in general there are five steps
involved in the working of Ip sec to
ensure data transmission over a network
channel the first step is host
recognition in the first step the host
system will check if the pket is to be
transmitted or Not by automatically
triggering the security policy for the
data which is implemented by the sender
side for proper
encryption then the second step is known
as ik Phase 1 in this step the two po
devices the sender and the receiver site
will authenticate each other to
establish a secure network
channel it is comprised of two modes the
main mode this provides much better
security with a proper time
limit and the second mode known as
aggressive mode as the name suggests it
establishes the IPC protocol much faster
in comparision to main mode let's move
on to the third step which is ik phase
two after the second step the host
decide the type of cryptography
algorithm to apply over the session in
the network channel and the secret key
for the algorithm to be used to encrypt
the data for
transmission then we have IP SEC
transmission this step involves the
actual transfer of data over the network
channel using various protocols used in
ipx security which are implemented under
the turn
condition and the last step is IPC
termination after the completion of data
exchange or session timeout the IPC
tunnel is terminated and the security
key established is discarded by both the
host system network security is a set of
technologies that protects the usability
and integrity of a company's
infrastructure by preventing the entry
or proliferation within a network it
architecture comprises of tools that
protect the network itself and the
applications that run over it effective
network security strategies employ
multiple lines of defense that are
scalable and automated each defensive
layer here enforces a set of security
policies which are determined by the
administrator beforehand this aim set
securing the confidentiality and
accessibility of the data and the
network the every company or
organization that handles a large amount
of data has a degree of solutions
against many cyber threats the most
basic example of network security is
password protection it has the network
the user chooses so recently network
security has become the central topic of
cyber security with many organizations
involving applications from people with
skills in this area it is crucial for
both personal and professional networks
most houses with highspeed internet have
one or more wireless routers which can
be vulnerable to attacks if they're not
adequately
secured data loss theft and sabotage
risk may be decreased with the usage of
a strong Network security system the
workstations are protected from
hazardous F thanks to network security
additionally it guarantees the security
of the data which is being shared over a
network by dividing information into
various sections encrypting these
portions and transferring them over
separate Pathways network security
infrastructure offers multiple levels of
protection to th man in the midle
attacks preventing situations like
eavesdropping among other harmful
attacks it is becoming increasingly
difficult in today's hyperconnected
environment as more corporate
applications migrate to both public and
private clocks additionally modern
applications are also frequently
virtualized and dispersed across several
locations some outside the physical
control of the IT team Network traffic
and infrastructure must be protected in
these cases since assaults on businesses
are increasing every single day we now
understood the basics of network
security but we need to understand how
network security works in the next
section in slide in more detail network
security revolves around two processes
authentication and
authorization the first process which is
authentication is similar to access
cards which ensure that only those have
the right to enter a building in other
words authentication checks and verifies
that it is indeed the user belonging to
the network who is trying to access or
enter it thereby preventing unauthorized
inions next comes
authorization this process decides the
level of access provided to the recently
authenticated
user for example Network admin needs
access to the entire network whereas
those working within it probably need
access to only certain areas within the
network based on the network users role
the process of determining the level of
access or permission level is known as
authorization today's Network
architecture is complex and faces a
threat environment that is always
changing and attackers that are always
trying to find and exploit
vulnerabilities
these vulnerabilities can exist in many
areas including devices data
applications users and
locations for this reason many Network
Security Management tools and
applications are in use today that
address individual
threats when it's just a few minutes of
downtime can cause widespread disruption
and massive damage to an organization's
bottom line and reputation it is
essential that these protection measures
are in place
beforehand now that you know a little
about network security and its working
let's cover to the different types of
network
security the fundamental tenant of
network security is the layering of
protection for massive networks and
store data that ensure the acceptance of
rules and regulations as a whole there
are three types the first of which is
physical security the next being
Technical and the third being
administrative let's look into physical
security first this is the most basic
level that includes protecting data and
Network to unauthorized Personnel from
acquiring control over the
confidentiality of the network this
include external peripherals and routers
that might be used for cable connections
the same can be achieved by using
devices like biometric systems physical
security is critical especially for
small businesses that do not have many
resources to devote to security
personnel and the tools as opposed to
large
firms when it comes to technical network
security it focuses mostly on
safeguarding data either kept in the
network or or engage in network
transitions this kind fulfills two
functions one is defense against
unauthorized users the other is a
defense against malevolent
actions the last category is
Administrative this level of network
security protects user Behavior like how
the permission has been granted and how
the authorization process takes place
this also ensures the level of
sophistication the network might need to
protect it through all the attacks this
level also suggest necessary amendments
that have to be done to the
infrastructure I think that's all the
basics that we need to cover on network
security in which our next topic we're
going to go through two mediums of
network security which are the transport
layer and the application
layer the transport layer is a way to
secure information as it is carried over
the Internet with users browsing
websites emails instant messaging Etc
TLS aims to provide a private and secure
connection between a web browser and a
website server
it does this with a cryptographic
handshake between two systems using
public key cryptography the two parties
through the connection exchange a secret
token and once each machine validates
this token it is used for all
Communications the connection employs
lighter symmetric cryptography to save
bandwidth and processing power since the
application layer is the closest layer
to the end user it provides hackers with
a largest threat surface poor app layer
security can lead to Performance and
stability issues Data Theft and in some
cases the network being taken down
examples of application layer attacks
include distributed denal of service
attacks or DD attacks HTTP floods hql
injections cross-site scripting Etc most
organizations have an arsenal of
application layer security protections
to combat these and more such as web
application firewalls secure web Gateway
Services Etc now that we have the theory
behind network security has been covered
in detail let us go through some of the
tools that can be used to enforce these
network security
policies the first tool to be covered in
the section is a firewall a firewall is
a type of network security device that
keeps track of incoming and outgoing
Network traffic and it decides which
traffic to allow or deny in accordance
to a set of security rules for more than
25 years firewalls have served as
Network Security's first line of defense
they provide a barrier between
trustworthy internal protection Ed and
regulated networks from Shady external
networks like the internet at some point
the next tool which can be used to Boler
network security is a virtual private
Network or VPN for short it's an
encrypted connection between a device
and a network via the Internet the
equipment connection AIDS the secure
transmission of sensitive data it makes
it impossible for unauthorized parties
to e stop on the traffic and enables
remote work for the user the usage of VN
technology is common in both corporate
and personal networks next we cover the
importance of intrusion prision systems
in network security or IPS Frameworks an
intrusion prevention system is a network
security tool that continually scans a
network for harmful activity and
response to it when it does occur by
reporting blocking or discarding it it
can be either Hardware or software it's
more sophisticated than an intuition
detection system or an IDs framework
which can just warn an administrator and
merely identify harmful activities while
in the case of an IPS it actually takes
against that activity the next tool in
this section and the final one are going
to be behavioral analytics behavioral
analytics focus more on the statistics
that are being carried over and stored
through months and years of usage on
some kind of similar pattern is noted
whe the it administrator can detect some
kind of attack the similar attacks can
be stopped and the security can be
further
enhanced now that we have covered all
that we need to know about network
security the necessary tools it's
different types Etc let's go to the
benefits of network security as a
whole the first which is protection
against external threats the objective
for cyber assaults can be as varied as
the Defenders themselves although
they're typically initiated for
financial gain whether they are
industrial spies activists or cyber
criminals these Bad actors all have one
thing in common which is how quick
clever and Cort attacks are getting a
strong cyber security posture that
considers routine software updates May
assist firms in identifying and
responding to the abuse techniques tools
and the common entry
points the next benefit is protection
against internal threats the human
aspect continues to be the cyber
security systems weakest link Insider
risk can originate from current or
former workers third party vendors or
even trusted partners and they can be
unintentional careless or downright even
aside from that the rapid expansion of
remote work and the personal devices
used for business purposes while even
iot devices in remote locations can make
it easier for these kind of threats to
go undetected until it's too
late however by proactively monitoring
networks and managing access these
dangers may be identified and dealt with
before they become expensive
disasters the third benefit is increased
productivity it nearly impossible for
employees to function when networks and
personal devices are slow to a crawl by
viruses and other cyber attacks during
the operation of website and for the
company to run you may significantly
minimize viols and the amount of
downtime required to fix the breach by
implementing various cyber security
measures such as enhanced firewalls
virus scanning and automatic backups
employee identification of possible
email fishing schemes suspicious links
and other malicious criminal activities
can also be aided by Education and
Training another benefit is
brand trust and
reputation customer retention is one of
the most crucial elements in business
development customers today place a
premium on maintaining brand loyalty
through a strong cyber security stance
since this is the fastest way to get
other businesses back get referrals and
sell more tickets overall additionally
it helps manufacturers get on the vendor
list with bigger companies as a part of
the supply chain which is only as strong
as its weakest link this opens
possibilities of potential future
endeavors and development with the rise
in censorship and general fear over
privacy loss consumer security is at an
all-time high risk technology has made
our life so much easier while putting up
a decent Target on our personal
information it is necessary to
understand how to simultaneously
Safeguard our data and be up to date
with the latest technological
developments maintaining this balance
has become easier with cryptography
taking its place in today's digital
world so hey everyone this is B from
Simply learn and welcome to this video
on cryptography but before we begin if
you love watching Tech videos subscribe
to our Channel and hit the Bell icon to
never miss an update from Simply learn
so here's a story to help you understand
cryptography meet an Anne wanted to look
for a decent discount on the latest
iPhone she started searching on the
internet and found a rather Shady
website that offered a 50% discount on
the first purchase once Anne submitted
her payment details a huge chunk of
money was withdrawn from a bank account
just moments after devastated and
quickly realized she had failed to
notice that the website was a HTTP web
page instead of an https one the payment
information submitted was not encrypted
and it was visible to anyone keeping an
eye including the website owner and
hackers had she used a reputed website
which has encrypted transactions and
employees cryptography a rphone
Enthusiast could have avoided this
particular inent this is why it's never
recommended to visit unknown websites or
share any personal information on them
now that we understand why cryptography
is so important let's take a look at the
topics to be covered today we take a
look into what cryptography is and how
it works we learn where cryptography is
being used in our daily lives and how we
are benefiting from it then we will
understand the different types of
cryptography and their respective uses
moving on we will look at the usage of
cryptography in ancient history and a
live demonstration of cryptography and
encryption in action let's Now
understand what cryptography
is cryptography is the science of
encrypting or decrypting information to
prevent unauthorized access we transform
our data and personal information so
that only the correct recipient can
understand the message as an essential
aspect of modern data security using
cryptography allows the Secure Storage
and transmission of data between willing
parties encryption is a primary route
for employing cryptography by adding
certain algorithms to Jumble up the data
decryption is the process of reversing
the work done by encrypting information
so that the data becomes readable again
both of these methods form the basis of
cryptography for example when simply
learn is jumbled up or changed in any
format not many people can guess the
original word by looking at the
encrypted text the only ones who can are
the people who know how to decrypt the
coded word thereby reversing the process
of
encryption any data pre- encryption is
called plain text or clear text to
encrypt the message we use certain
algorithms that serve a single purpose
of scrambling the data to make them
unreadable without the necessary tools
these algorithms are called ciphers they
are a set of detailed steps to be
carried out one after the other to make
sure the data becomes as unreadable as
possible until it reaches the receiver
we take the plain text pass it to the
cipher algorithm and get the encrypted
data this encrypted text is called the
cipher text and this is the message that
is transferred between the two parties
the key that is being used to scramble
the data is known as the encryption key
these steps that is the cipher and the
encryption key are made known to the
receiver who can then reverse the
encryption on receiving the message
unless any third party manages to find
out both the algorithm and the secret
key that is being used they cannot
decrypt the messages since both of them
are necessary to unlock the hidden
content wonder what else we would lose
if not for
cryptography any website where you have
an account can read your passwords
important emails can be intercepted and
their contents can be read without
encryption during the transit more than
65 million messages are sent on WhatsApp
every day all of which are secured
thanks to endtoend
encryption there is a huge Market
opening up for cryptocurrency which is
possible due to blockchain technology
that uses encryption algorithms and
hashing functions to ensure that the
data is secure if this is of particular
interest to you you can watch our video
on blockchain the link of which will be
in the description of course there is no
single solution to a problem as diverse
as explained there are three variants of
how cryptography works and is in
practice they are symmetric encryption
asymmetric
encryption and hashing let's find out
how much we have understood until now do
you remember the difference between a
cipher and Cipher text leave your ANS in
the comments and before we proceed if
you find this video interesting make
sure to give it a thumbs up before
moving ahead let's look at symmetric
encryption
first Sy symetric encryption uses a
single key for both the encryption and
decryption of data it is comparatively
less secure than asymmetric encryption
but much faster it is a compromise that
has to be embraced in order to deliver
data as fast as possible without living
information completely vulnerable this
type of encryption is used when data
rests on servers and identifies
Personnel for payment applications and
services the potential drawback with
symmetric encryption is that both the
send and receiver need to have the same
secret key and it should be kept hidden
at all times Caesar Cipher Enigma
machine are both symmetric encryption
examples that we will look into further
for example if Alice wants to send a
message to Bob she can apply a
substitution Cipher or a shift Cipher to
encrypt the message but Bob must be
aware of the same key itself so he can
decrypt it when he finds it necessary to
read the entire message symmetric
encryption uses one of the two types of
ciphers stream ciphers and block ciphers
block ciphers break the plain text into
blocks of fixed size and use the key to
convert it into Cipher text stream
ciphers convert the plain text into
Cipher text one bit at a time instead of
resorting to breaking them up into
bigger chunks in today's world the most
widely used symmetric encryption
algorithm is AES 256 that stands for
advanced encryption standard which has a
key size of 256bit with 128bit and 196
bit key sizes also being available other
primitive algorithms like the data
encryption standard that is the dees the
triple data encryption standard 3des and
Blowfish have all fallen out of favor
due to the rise of AES AES chops UPS the
data into blocks and performs 10 plus
rounds of obscuring and substituting the
message to make it
unreadable asymmetric encryption on the
other hand has a double whammy at its
disposal there are two different keys at
play here a public key and a private key
the public key is used to encrypt
information pre-transit and a private
key is used to decrypt the information
post Transit if Alice wants to
communicate with Bob using asymmetric
encryption she encrypts the message
using Bob's public key after receiving
the message Bob uses his own private key
to decrypt the data this way nobody can
intercept the message in between
transmissions and there is no need for
any secure key exchange for this to work
since the encryption is done with the
public key and the decryption is done
with a private key that no one except
Bob has access to both the keys are
necessary to read the full
message there is also a reverse scenario
where we can use the private key for
encryption and the public key for
decryption a server can sign
non-confidential information using its
private key and anyone who has its
public key can DEC skipped the message
this mechanism also proves that the
sender is authenticated and there is no
problem with the origin of the
information RSA encryption is the most
widely used asymmetric encryption
standard it is named after its Founders
reest Shamir and Edelman and it uses
block ciphers that separate the data
into blocks and obscure the information
widely considered the most secure form
of encryption albit relatively slower
than AES it is widely used in web
browsing secure identification vpns
emails and chat
applications with so much hanging on the
keys secrecy there must be a way to
transmit the keys without others reading
our private data many systems use a
combination of symmetric encryption and
asymmetric encryption to bolster
security and match speed at the same
time since asymmetric encryption takes
longer to decrypt large amounts of data
the full information is encrypted using
a single key that is symmetric
encryption that single key is then
transmitted to the receiver using
asymmetric encryption so don't have to
compromise either way another route is
using the Diffy helpman key exchange
which relies on a one-way function and
is much tougher to break into the third
variant of cryptography is termed as
hashing hashing is a process of
scrambling a piece of data beyond
recognition it gives an output of fixed
size which which is known as the hash
value of the original data or just hash
in general the calculations that do the
job of messing up the data collection
form the hash function they are
generally not reversible without
resilient Brute Force mechanisms and are
very helpful when storing data on
website servers that need not be stored
in Blain text for example many websites
store your account passwords in a hashed
format so that not even the
administrator can read your credentials
when a user tries to log in they can
compare the entered password's hash
value with the hash value that is
already stored on the servers for
authentication since the function will
always return the same value for the
same
input cryptography has been in practice
for
centuries Julius Caesar used a
substitution shift to move alphabets a
certain number of spaces beyond their
place in the alphabet table a spy can't
decipher the original message at first
glance for example if he wanted to pass
confidence IAL information to his armies
and decides to use a substitution shift
of plus two a becomes c b becomes D and
so on the word attack when passed
through a substitution shift of plus
three becomes dww dfn this Cipher has
been appropriately named the Caesar
Cipher which is one of the most widely
used
algorithms the Enigma is probably the
most famous cryptographic Cipher device
used in ancient history it was used by
the Nazi German armies in the world wars
they were used to protect confidential
political military and administrative
information and it consisted of three or
more rotors that scrambled the original
message depending on the machine State
at that time the decryption is similar
but it needs both machines to stay in
the same state before passing the cipher
text so that we received the same plane
text message let's take a look at how
our data is protected while we browse
the internet thanks to cryptography here
we have a webbased tool that will help
us understand the process of RSA
encryption we see the entire workflow
from selecting the key size to be used
until the decryption of the cipher text
in order to get the plain text back as
we already know RSA encryption algorithm
falls under the umbrella of asymmetry
key
cryptography that basically implies that
we have two keys at play here a public
key and a private
key typically the public key is used
used by the sender to encp the message
and the private key is used by the
receiver to decp the message there are
some occasions when this allocation is
reversed and we will have a look at them
as well in RSA we have the choice of key
size we can select any key from 512 bit
to 1024-bit all the way up to a 496 bit
key the longer the key length the more
complex the encryption process becomes
and thereby strengthening the cipher
text although with added security more
complex functions take longer to perform
the same operations on similar size of
data we have to keep a balance between
both speed and strength because the
strongest encryption algorithms are of
no use if they cannot be practically
deployed in systems around the world
let's take a 1024-bit key over here now
we need to generate the keys this
generation is done by functions that
operate on past freezes the tool we are
using right now generates the sudo
random keys to be used in this
explanation
once we generate the keys you can see
the public key is rather smaller than
the private key which is almost always
the case these two keys are
mathematically linked with each other
they cannot be substituted with any
other key and in order to encrypt the
original message or decrypt the cipher
text this pair must be kept together the
public key is then sent to the sender
and the receiver keeps the private key
with himself in this scenario let's try
and encrypt a word simply learn
we have to select if the key being used
for encryption is either private or
public since that affects the process of
scrambling the information since we are
using the public key over here let's
select the same and copy it and paste
over
here the cipher we are using right now
is plain RSA there are some modified
ciphers with their own pros and conses
that can also be used provided we use it
on a regular basis and depending on the
use case as well
once we click on encrypt we can see the
cipher text being generated over
here the sud random generating functions
are created in such a way that a single
character change in the plain text will
trigger a completely different Cipher
text this is a security feature to
strengthen the process from Brute Force
methods now that we are done with the
encryption process let's take a look at
the decryption
part the receiver gets this Cipher text
from the sender with no other key or
supplement he or she must already
possess the private key generated from
the same pair no other private key can
be used to decrypt the message since
they are mathematically linked we paste
the private key here and select the same
the cipher must always so be the same
used during the encryption
process once we click decrypt you can
see the original plane text we had
decided to encrypt this sums up the
entire process of say encryption and
decryption now some people use it the
other way around we also have the option
of using the private key to encrypt
information and the public key to
decrypt it this is done mostly to
validate the origin of the message since
the keys only work in pairs if a
different private key is used to encrypt
the message the public key cannot
decrypt it conversely if the public key
is able to decrypt the message it must
have been encrypted with the right
private key and hence the rightful owner
now here we just have to take the
private key and use that to encrypt the
plain text and select the same in this
checkbox as well you can see we have
generated a completely new Cipher text
this Cipher text will be sent to the
receiver and this time we will use the
public key for
decryption let's select the correct
checkbox and decrypt and we still get
the same
output now let's take a look at
practical example of encryption in the
real
world we all use the internet on a daily
basis and many are aware of the
implications of using unsafe websites
let's take a look at Wikipedia here
pretty standard https website where the
H stands for secure let's take a look at
how it secures the
data wi shck is the world's foremost and
most widely used Network protocol
analyzer it lets you see what's
happening on your network at a
microscopic level and we are going to
use this software to see the traffic
that is leaving a machine and to
understand how vulnerable it
is since there are many applications
running in this machine let's apply a
filter that will only show us the
results related to
[Music]
Wikipedia let's search for something
that we can navigate the website with
okay once we get into it a little you
can see some of the requests being
populated over
here let's take a look at the specific
request these are the data packets that
basically transport the data from our
machine to the internet and vice
versa as you can see there's a bunch of
gibberish data here that doesn't really
reveal anything that we searched or
watched similarly other secured websites
function the same way and it is very
difficult if at all possible to Snoop on
user data this way to put this in
perspective let's take a look at another
website which is a HTTP web
page this has no encryption enabled from
the server end which makes it vulnerable
to attacks there is a login form here
which needs legitimate user credentials
in order to GR access let's enter a
random pair of
credentials these obviously won't work
but we can see the manner of data
transfer unsurprisingly we weren't able
to get into the platform instead we can
see the data
packets let's apply a similar filter
that will help us understand what
request this website is
sending these are the requests being
sent by the HTTP login form to the
internet if we check here see whatever
username and password that we are
entering we can easily see it with the
wire shark now we used a dummy pair of
credentials if we select the right data
packet we can find our correct
credentials if any website had asked for
a payment information or a legitimate
credentials it would have been really
easy to get a hold of these to reiterate
what we have already learned we must
always avoid HTTP websites and just
unknown or not trustworthy websites in
general because the problem we saw here
is just the tip of the iceberg even
though cryptography has managed to
lessen the risk of cyber attacks it is
still prevalent and we should always be
alert to keep ourselves safe online
there are two types of encryption in
cryptography symmetric key
cryptography and asymmetric key
cryptography both of these categories
have their pros and cons and differ only
by the implementation today we are going
to focus exclusively on symmetry key
cryptography let us have a look at its
applications in order to understand its
importance
better this variant of cryptography is
primarily used in banking applications
where personally ident identifiable
information needs to be encrypted with
so many aspects of banking moving onto
the internet having a reliable safety
net is crucial symmetric cryptography
helps in detecting bank fraud and boost
the security index of these payment
gateways in
general they are also helpful in
protecting data that is not in transit
and rests on servers and data centers
these centers house a massive amount of
data that needs to be encrypted with a
fast and efficient algorithm so that
when the data needs to be recalled by
the respective service there is the
Assurance of minor to no
delay while browsing the internet we
need symmetric encryption to browse
secure https websites so that we get an
allaround protection it plays a
significant role in verifying website
server authenticity exchanging the
necessary encryption Keys required and
generating a session using those keys to
ensure maximum security this helps us in
preventing the rather insecure HTTP
website format
so let us understand how symmetric key
cryptography works first before moving
on to the specific
algorithms symmetry key cryptography
relies on a single key for the
encryption and decryption of information
both the sender and receiver of the
message need to have a pre-shared secret
key that they will use to convert the
plain text into Cipher text and vice
versa as you can see in the image the
key used for encryption is the same key
needed for decrypting the message at the
other end the secret key shouldn't be
sent along with the cipher text to the
receiver because that would defeat the
entire purpose of using cryptography key
exchange can be done beforehand using
other algorithms like the defy Helman
key exchange protocol for
example for example if Paul wants to
send a simple message to Jane they need
to have a single encryption key that
both of them must keep secret to prevent
snooping on by malicious
actors it can be generated by either one
of them but must belong to both of them
before the messages start flowing
suppose the message I am ready is
converted into Cipher text using a
specific substitution Cipher by Paul in
that case Jane must also be aware of the
substitution shift to decp the cipher
text once it reaches her irrespective of
the scenario where someone manages to
grab the cipher text mid transit to try
and read the message not having the
secret key renders everyone helpless
looking to snow in the symmetric key
algorithms like the data and encryption
standard have been in use since the
1970s while the popular ones like the
AES have become the industry standard
today with the entire architecture of
symmetric cryptography depending on the
single key being used you can understand
why it's of Paramount importance to keep
it secret on All
Occasions the side effect of having a
single key for the encryption and
decryption is it becomes a single point
of failure anyone who gets their hand on
it can read all the encrypted messages
and do so mainly without the knowledge
of the sender and the receiver so it is
the priority to keep the encryption and
decryption key private at all times
should it fall into the wrong hands the
third party can send messages to either
the sender or the receiver using the
same key to encrypt the message upon
receiving the message and decrypting it
with the key it is impossible to guess
its origin if the sender somehow
transmits the secret key along with the
cipher text anyone can intercept the
package and access the information
consequ ly this encryption category is
termed private key cryptography since a
big part of the data's Integrity is
riding on the promise that the users can
keep the key secret this terminology
contrasts with asymmetry key
cryptography which is called public key
cryptography because it has two
different keys at play one of which is
public provided we manage to keep the
keys secret we still have to choose what
kind of ciphers we want to use to
encrypt this information in symmetric
key cryptography there are broadly two
categories of ciphers that we can employ
let us have a
look stream ciphers are the algorithms
that ENC basic information one bit at a
time it can change depending on the
algorithm being used but usually it
relies on a single bit or bite to do the
encryption this is the relatively
quicker alternative considering the
algorithm doesn't have to deal with
blocks of data at a single time every
piece of data that goes into the
encryption can and needs to be converted
into B binary format in stream ciphers
each binary digit is encrypted one after
the other the most popular ones are the
rc4 salsa and Panama the binary data is
passed through an encryption key which
is a randomly generated bitstream upon
passing it through we receive the cipher
text that can be transferred to the
receiver without fear of man in the
middle attacks the binary data can be
passed through an algorithmic function
it can have either X or operations as it
is most of the time or any other meth
mathematical calculations that have the
singular purpose of scrambling the data
the encryption key is generated using
the random bitstream generator and it
acts as a supplement in the algorithmic
function the output is in binary form
which is then converted into the decimal
or heximal format to give our final
Cipher
text on the other hand block ciphers
dissect the raw information into chunks
of data of fixed size the size of these
blocks depend on the exact Cipher being
used a one 28 bit block Cipher will
break the plain text into blocks of
128bit each and encrypt those blocks
instead of a single digit once these
blocks are encrypted individually they
are chained together to form a final
Cipher
text block ciphers are much slower but
they are more tamper proof and are used
in some of the most widely used
algorithms employed
today just like stream ciphers the
original Cipher text is converted into
binary format before beginning the
process once the conver version is
complete the blocks are passed to the
encryption algorithm along with the
encryption key this would provide us
with the encrypted blocks of binary
data once these blocks are combined we
get a final binary
string this string is then converted
into hexadecimal format to get a cipher
text today the most popular symmetric
key algorithms like AES Dees and 3des
are all block Cipher methodology
subsets with so many factors coming into
play there are quite a few things
symmetrically ktog graphy excels at
while falling short in some
other symmetrically cryptography is much
faster variant when compared to
asymmetric cryptography there is only
one key in play unlike asymmetric
encryption and this drastically improves
calculation speed in the encryption and
decryption similarly the performance of
symmetric encryption is much more
efficient under similar computational
limitations fewer calculations help in
better memory management for the host
system bulk amounts of data that need to
be encrypted are very well suited for
symmetric algorithms since they are much
quicker handling large amounts of data
is simple and easy to use in servers and
data forms this helps in better latency
during data recall and fewer mixed
packets thanks to its simple single key
structure symmetri key cryptography
algorithms are much easier easier to set
up a communication Channel with and
offer a much more straightforward
maintenance duties once the secret key
is transmitted to both the sender and
receiver without any prior mishandling
the rest of the system aligns easily and
everyday Communications becomes easy and
secure if the algorithm is applied as
per the documentation symmetric
algorithms are very robust and can enip
vast amounts of data with very less
overhead Dees algorithm stands for data
encryption standard it is a symmetric
key Cipher that is used to encrypt and
recpt information in a block by block
manner each block is encrypted
individually and they're later chained
together to form our final Cipher text
which is then sent to a receiver DS
takes the original unaltered piece of
data called the plain text in a 64-bit
block and it is converted into an
encrypted text that is called the cipher
text it uses 48 bit Keys during the
encryption process and follows a
specific structure called the fistal
Cipher structure during the entire
process it is a symmetric key algorithm
which means DS can reuse the keys used
in the encryption format to decrypt the
cipher text back to the original plane
text once the 64-bit blocks are
encrypted they can be combined together
before being
transmitted let's take a look at the
origin and the reason Dees was
founded Dees is based on a fistal block
Cipher called Lucifer developed in 1971
by IBM cryptography research sear a host
fistal Dees uses 16 rounds of this
fistal structure using a different key
for each round it also utilizes a random
function with two inputs and provides a
single output variable DS becames the
organization's approved encryption
standard in November 1976 and was later
reaffirmed as a standard in 1983 1988
and finally in 1999 but eventually DS
was cracked and it was no longer
considered a secure solution for all
official roots of
communication consequently triple Ds was
developed triple Ds is a symmetric key
block Cipher that uses a double Ds
Cipher encrypt with the first key delete
encryption with the second key and
encrypt again with a third key there is
also a variation of the two keys where
the first and second key are duplicate
of each other but triple Ds was
ultimately deemed too slow for the
growing need for fast communication
channels and people eventually fell back
to using DS for cting messages in order
to search for a better alternative a
public wide competition was organized
and helped cryptographers develop their
own algorithm as a proposal for the next
global standard this is where the rile
algorithm came into play and was later
credited to be the next Advanced
encryption standard for a long time DS
was the standard for data encryption for
data security its rule ended in 2002
when finally the advanced encryption
standard replaced Dees as an acceptable
standard following a public competition
for a
place to understand the structure of a
fistal Cipher we can use the following
image as a reference the block being
encrypted is divided into two parts one
of which is being passed onto the
function while the other part is exord
with the function's output the function
also uses the encryption key that
differs for each individual round this
keeps going on until the last step until
where the right hand side and the left
hand side are being swapped here we
receive our final Cipher text for the
decryption process the entire procedure
is reversed starting from the order of
the keys to the block sorting if the
entire process is repeated in a reverse
order we will eventually get back our
plane text and this Simplicity helps the
speed overall This was later detrimental
to the efficiency of the algorithm hence
the security was
compromised a fistal block CER is a
structure used to derive many symmetri
block ciphers such as DS which as we
have discussed in our previous
comment pistol Cipher proposed a
structure that implements substitution
and permutation alternately so that we
can obtain Cipher text from the plain
text and vice versa this helps in
reducing the redundancy of the program
and increases the complexity to combat
Brute Force
attacks the fistal Cipher is actually
based on the Shannon structure that was
proposed in
1945 the fistel cipher is the structure
suggested by horse feil which was
considered to be a backbone while
developing many symmetric block ciphers
the Shannon structure highlights the
implementation of alternate confusion
and diffusion and like we already
discussed the fistal Cipher structure
can be completely reversed depending on
the data however we must consider the
fact that to decrypt the information by
reversing the fal structure we will need
the exact polinomial functions and the
key
orders to understand how the blocks are
being calculated we take a plane testt
which is of 64bit and that is later
divided into two equal halves of 32 bit
each in this the right half is
immediately transferred to the next
round to become the new Left half of the
second round the right hand is again
passed off to a function which uses an
encryption key that is unique to each
round in the fistal Cipher whatever the
function gives off as an output it is
passed on as an xor input with the left
half of the initial plane text the next
output will become the right half of the
second round for the plane text this
entire process constitutes of a single
round in the fistal
Cipher taking into account what happens
in a polinomial
function we take one half of the block
and pass it through an expansion box the
work of the expansion box is to increase
the size of the half from 32bit to 48
bit textt this is done to make make the
text compatible to a 48 bit Keys we have
generated
beforehand once we pass it through the
EXO function we get a 48-bit text as an
output now remember a half should be of
32-bit so this 48-bit output is then
later passed on to a substitution box
this substitution box reduces its size
from 48 bit to 32bit Output which is
then later exort with the first half of
the Plaine text
a block Cipher is considered the safest
if the size of the block is large but
large block sizes can also slow down
encryption speed and the decryption
streen generally the size is
64-bit sometimes modern block ciphers
like AES have a 128bit block size as
well the security of the block sever
increases with increasing key size but
larger key sizes may also reduce the
speeds of the process earlier 64-bit
keys were considered sufficient modern
ciphers need to use 128bit Keys due to
the increasing complexity of today's
computational
standards the increasing number of
rounds also increase the security of the
block Cipher similarly they're inversely
proportional to the speed of
encryption a highly complex round
function enhances the security of the
block Cipher Al way we must maintain a
balance between the speed and
security the symmetric block Cipher is
implemented in a software application to
achieve better execution speed there is
no use of an algorithm it it cannot be
implemented in a real life framework
that can help organizations to encrypt
or decrypt the data in a timely manner
now that we understand the basics of Fel
ciphers we can take a look at how Dees
manages to run through 16 rounds of the
structure and provide the cipher text at
the end now that we understand the
basics of FAL cyers we can take a look
at how DS manages to run through 16
rounds of this structure and provide a
cipher text in simple terms DS takes the
64-bit plane text and converts it into a
64-bit Cipher text and since we are
talking about asymmetric algorithms the
same key is being used when it is
decrypting the data as
well we first take a 64-bit ke plane
text and we pass it through an initial
permutation function the inial permit
function has the job of dividing the
block into two different parts so that
we can perform fisal Cypher structures
on
it there are multiple rounds being
procured in the DS algorithm namely 16
rounds of fistal Cipher structure each
of these rounds will need keys initially
we take a 56-bit cipher key but it is a
single key we pass it onto a round key
generators which generates 16 different
keys for each single round that the
fistal Cipher is being run these keys
are passed on to the rounds as 48 bits
the size of these 48 bit Keys is the
reason we use the substitution and
permutation Bongs in the polinomial
functions of the facial
ciphers when passing through all these
rounds we reach round 16 where the final
key is passed on from the round key
generator and we get a final permutation
in the final permutation the rounds are
swapped and we get our final Cipher text
this is the entire process of Dees with
16 rounds of hisel cyers encompassed in
it to decrypt a cipher text back to the
plane text we just have to reverse the
process we did in the DS algorithm and
reverse the key order along with the
functions this kind of Simplicity is
what gave Dees the bonus when it comes
to speed but eventually it was
detrimental to the overall efficiency of
the program when it comes to security
factors BS have five different modes of
operation to choose from this one of
those is electronic code book each
64-bit block is encrypted and decrypted
independently in the electronic codebook
format
we also have Cipher block chaining or
the CBC method here each 64-bit block
depends on the previous one and all of
them use an initialization
Vector we have a cipher feedback block
mechanism where the preceding Cipher
text becomes the input for the
encryption algorithm it produces a su a
random output which in turn is exor with
the plain
text there is an output feedback method
as well which is the same as Cipher
feedback except that the encryption
algorithm input is the output from the
preceding
Dees a counter method has a different
way of approach where each PL Tex block
is exor with an encrypted counter the
counter is then incremented for each
subsequent block there are a few other
alternatives to these modes of operation
but the five mentioned above are the
most widely used in the industry and
recommended by cryptographers
worldwide let's take a look at the
future of DS
the dominance of Dees ended in 2002 when
the advanced encryption standard
replaced the DS encryption algorithm as
the accepted standard it was done
following a public competition to find a
replacement nist officially withdrew the
global acceptance standard in May 2005
although triple Ds has approved for some
sensitive government information through
2030 n also had to change the DS
algorithm because its Kei length was too
short given the increased processing
power of the new computers encryption
power is related to the size of the key
and DS found itself a victim of ongoing
technological advances in Computing we
have received a point where 56-bit was
no longer a challenge to the computers
of tracking note that because DS is no
longer the nist federal standard does
not mean that it is no longer in use
trip DS is still used today and is still
considered a legacy encryption
algorithm to get a better understanding
of how these keys and Cipher Tex look
like we can use use an online tool for
our benefit as we already know to
encrypt any kind of data a key is
mandatory this key can be generated
using mathematical functions or
computerized key generation program such
as this website offers it can be based
on any piece of text let's say the word
is simply
[Music]
learn in our
example once the key is settled we
provide the plain text or the clear text
that needs to be encrypted using the
afor mentioned key suppose a sentence
for this example is this is my first
message we have satisfied two
prerequisites the message and the key
another variable that goes into play is
the mode of
operation we have already learned about
five different modes of operation while
we can see some other options here as
well let us go with the CBC variant
which basically means the cipher block
chaining method one of cbc's key
character istics is that it uses a
chaining process it causes the
decryption of a block of Cipher text to
depend all on the preceding ciper text
blocks as a result the entire validity
of all the blocks is contained in the
previous adjacent blocks as well a
single bit error in a cipher text block
affects the decryption of all the
subsequent blocks rearrangement of the
order of these for example can cause the
decryption process to get
corrupted regarding the manner of
displaying binary information we have
two options here we can either go with
base 64 or the heximal format let's go
with the base 64 right
now as you can see the cipher text is
readily available b64 is a little more
efficient than hex so we will be getting
a smaller Cipher text when it comes to
base
64 albeit the size of both the formats
will be the same the hex has a longer
Cipher text since B 64 takes four
characters for every three bytes while
hex will take two characters for each
bite hence b64 turns out to be more
efficient now to decut the cipher text
we go by the same format we choose Bas
64 we copy the cipher text onto a
decryption tool and we have to make sure
that the key we are using is exactly the
same we choose similar mode of
operation and we choose the correct
encoding format as well which is BAS 64
in this
case as you can see the decryption is
complete and we get a PL text back even
if you keep everything the same but we
just change the encoding format it will
not be able to decrypt
anything unfortunately DS has become
rather easy to crack even without the
help of a key the advanced encryption
standard is still on top when it comes
to symmetric encryption security and
will likely stay there for a
while eventually with so much computing
power growth the need for a stronger
algorithm was necessary to safeguard a
personal data as solid as Dees was the
computers of today could easily break
the encryption with repeated attempts
thereby rendering the data security
helpless to counter this dilemma a new
standard was introduced which was termed
as the advanced encryption standard or
the AES
algorithm let's learn what is Advanced
encryption standard
the AES algorithm also known as the
reind algorithm is a symmetric block
Cipher with a block size of 128 bits it
is converted into Cipher text using keys
of 128 192 or 256 bits it is implemented
in software and Hardware throughout the
world to encrypt sensitive data the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology also known as nist started
development on AES in 1997 when it was
announced the need for an alternative to
the data encryption standard the new
internet needed a replacement for Dees
because of its small key size with
increasing computing power it was
considered unsafe against entire key
search attacks the triple Ds was
designed to overcome this problem
however it was deemed to be too slow to
be deployed in machines
worldwide strong cases were present by
the Mars rc6 Serpent and the two fish
algorithms but it was the rindal
encryption algorithm also known as as
AES which was eventually chosen as the
standard symmetric key encryption
algorithm to be used its selection was
formalized with the release of federal
information processing standards
publication 197 in the November of 2001
it was approved by the US Secretary of
Commerce now that we understand the
origin of AES let us have a look at the
features that make AES encryption
algorithm
unique the AES algorithm user is a
substitution permutation or SP Network
it consists of multiple rounds to
produce a cipher text it has a series of
linked operations including replacing
inputs with specific outputs that is
substitutions and others that involve
bit shuffling which is
permutations at the beginning of the
encryption process we only start out
with a single key which can be either a
128bit key a 192bit key or a 256bit key
eventually this one key is expanded to
be used in multiple rounds throughout
the encrypt ion and the decryption cycle
interestingly AES performs all its
calculations on bite data instead of bit
data as seen in the case of the dees
algorithm therefore AES treats 128 bits
of a clear text block as 16 bytes the
number of rounds during the encryption
process depends on the key size that is
being used the 128bit key size fixes 10
Rounds the 192bit key size fixes 12
rounds and the 256bit key holds 4 14
rounds a round key is required for each
of these rounds but since only one key
is input into the algorithm the single
key needs to be expanded to get the key
for each round including the round
zero with so many mathematical
calculations going on in the background
there are bound to be a lot of steps
throughout the procedure let's have a
look at the steps followed in
AES before we move ahead we need to
understand how data is being stored
during the process of AES
encryption everything in the process is
stored in a 4 into four Matrix
format this Matrix is also known as a
state array and we'll be using these
State arrays to transmit data from one
step to another and from one round to
the next
round each round takes straight array as
input and gives a straight array as
output to be transferred into the next
round it is a 16 byte Matrix with each
cell representing one byte
with each four bytes representing a word
so every state array will have a total
of four words representing
it as we previously discussed we take a
single key and expand it to the number
of rounds that we need the key to be
used in let's say the number of rounds
are n then the key has to be expanded to
be used with n +1 rounds because the
first round is the key zero
round let's say say n is the number of
rounds the key is expanded to n + one
rounds it is also a state array having
four words in its vicinity every key is
used for a single round and the first
key is used as a round key before any
round
begins in the very beginning the plane
text is captured and passed through an
exor function with a round key as a
supplement this key can be considered
the first key from the n+1 expanded set
moving on the state array resulting from
the above step is passed on to a bite
substitution
process beyond that there is a provision
to shift rows in the state arrays later
on the state array is mixed with a
constant Matrix to shuffle its column in
the mixed column segment after which we
add the round key for that particular
round the last four steps mentioned are
part of every single round that the
encryption algorithm goes through the
state arrays are then passed from one
round to the next as an input in the
last round however we skip the mixed
columns portion with the rest of the
process remaining
unchanged but what are these bite
substitution and row shifting processes
let's find out regarding each step in
more
detail in the first step the plain text
is stored in a state array and is exor
with the k0 which is the first key in
the expanded key set
this step is performed only once on a
block while being repeated at the end of
each round as per iteration
demands the state array is exor with the
key to get a new state array which is
then passed office input to the sub byes
process in the second stage we have bite
substitution we leverage an Xbox called
as a substitution box to randomly switch
data among each element every single
bite is converted into a heximal value
having two parts
the first part denotes the row value and
the second part denotes the column value
the entire State array is passed through
the sbox to create a brand new state
array which is then passed off as an
input to the row shifting process the 16
input bites are replaced by looking at a
fixed table given in the design we
finally get a matrix with four rows and
four
columns when it comes to row shifting
each bit in the four rows of the Matrix
is shifted to the left an entry that is
a fall off is reinserted to the right of
the line the change is done as follows
the first line is not moved in any way
the second line is shifted to a single
position to the left the third line is
shifted two positions to the left and
the fourth line is shifted three
positions to the left the result is a
new Matrix that contains the same 16
bites but has been moved in relation to
each other to boost the complexity of
the program
in mixed columns each column of four
bytes is now replaced using a special
mathematical function the function takes
four bytes of a column as input and
outputs for completely new
bytes we will get a new Matrix with the
same size of 16 bytes and it should be
noted that this phase has not been done
in the last round of the
iteration when it comes to adding a
round key the 16 bytes of The Matrix are
treated as 128 bits and the 128 bits of
the round key are exort if it is the
last round the output is the cipher text
if we still have a few rounds remaining
the resulting 128 bits are interpreted
as 16 bytes and we start another similar
round let's take an example to
understand how all these processes work
if our plane text is the string
2192 we first convert it into a heximal
format as as follows we use an
encryption key which is that's my K Fu
and it is converted into a heximal
format as
well as per the guidelines we use a
single key which is then later expanded
into n+ one number of keys in which case
it's supposed to be 11 keys for 10
different
rounds in round zero we add the round
key the plane test is exort with the k0
and we get a state array that is passed
off as an input to the substitution byes
process when it comes to the
substitution byes process we leverage an
sbox to substitute the elements of each
bite with a completely new byte this way
the state array that we receive is
passed off as an input to the row
shifting process on the next
step when it comes to row shifting each
element is shifted a few places to the
left with the first two being shifted by
zero places second row by one place
third row by two places and the last by
three the state array that we received
from the row shifting is passed off as
an input to mix columns in mix columns
we multiply the straight array with a
constant Matrix after which I receive a
new state array to be passed on onto the
next
step we add the name State array as an
exor with the round key of the
particular iteration whatever state
array we receive here it becomes an
output for this particular
round now since this is the first round
of the entire encryption process the
state array that we receive is passed
off as an input to the new
Round We repeat this process for 10 more
rounds and we finally receive a cipher
text once the final State array can be
denoted in the hexad decimal format this
becomes our final Cipher text that we
can use for transferring information
from the sender and
receiver let's take a look at the
applications of AES in this
world AES finds most use in the area of
wireless security in order to establish
a secure mode of authentication between
routers and clients highly secure
mechanisms like WPA and WPA2 psk are
extensively used in securing Wi-Fi
endpoints with the help of RS
algorithm it also helps in SSL TLS
encryption that is instrumental in
encrypting our internet browser sessions
AES Works in tandem with other
asymmetric encryption algorithms to make
sure the web browser and web server are
properly configured and use encrypted
channels for
communication AES is also prevalent in
general file encryption of various
formats ranging from critical documents
to the med media files having a large
key allows people to encrypt media and
decrypt data with maximum security
possible AES is also used for processor
Security in Hardware Appliances to
prevent machine hijacking among other
things as a direct successor to the dees
algorithm there are some aspects that
AES provides an immediate advantage in
let us take a
look when it comes to ke key length the
biggest flaw in DS algorithm was that
small length was easily vulnerable by
today's standards ases has manage to NAB
up 128 192 and 256bit key lens to
bolster the security further the block
size is also larger in AES owing to more
complexity of the algorithm the number
of rounds in Dees is fixed irrespective
of the plane text being used in AES the
number of round depends on the key
length that is being used for the
particular iteration thereby providing
more Randomness and complexity in the
algorithm the DS algorithm is considered
to be simpler than AES even though AES
beats Dees when it comes to relative
speed of encryption and decryption this
makes Advanced encryption standard much
more streamlined to be deployed in
Frameworks and systems worldwide when it
compares to the data encryption standard
hello in our last video on cryptography
we took a look at symmetric key
cryptography we used a single private
key for both the encryption and
decryption of data and it works very
well in theory let's take a look at a
more realistic scenario now let's meet
Joe Joe is a journalist who needs to
communicate with Ryan via long distance
messaging due to the critical nature of
the information people are waiting for
any message to leave Joe's house so that
they can intercept it now Joe can easily
use symmetric cryptography to send the
encrypted data so that even if someone
intercepts the message they cannot
understand what it says but here's the
tricky part how will Joe send the
required decryption key to Ryan the
center of the message as well as the
receiver need to have the same
decryption key so that they can exchange
messages otherwise Ryan cannot decrypt
the information even when he receives
the cipher text if someone intercepts
the key while transmitting it there is
no use in employing cryptography since a
third party can now decode all the
information easily key sharing is a risk
that will always exist when symmetric
key cryptography is being used
thankfully asymmetric key encryption has
managed to fix this problem this is B
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video on asymmetry key cryptography
let's take a look at what we are going
to learn today We Begin by explaining
what asymmetry ke cryptography is and
how it works we take a look at its
application and uses we understand why
it's called public key cryptography and
then learn a little bit about RS
encryption and then we learn about the
advantages of asymmetry key cryptography
over symmetry key
cryptography let's understand what
asymmetry key cryptography
is asymmetric encryption uses a double
layer of protection there are two
different keys at play here a private
key and a public key a public key is
used to encrypt the information pre-
Transit and a private key is used to
decrypt the data post Transit these pair
of keys must belong to the receiver of
the message the public keys can be
shared via messaging blog posts or key
servers and there are no restrictions as
you can see in the image the two keys
are working in the system the sender
first encrypts the message using the
receiver's private key after which we
receive the cipher text the cipher text
is then transmitted to the receiver
without any other key on getting the
cipher text the receiver uses his
private key to decrypt it and get the
plane text back there has been no
requirement of any key exchange
throughout this process therefore
solving the most glaring flaw faced in
symmetry key
cryptography the public key known to
everyone cannot be used to decrypt the
message and the private key which can
Decap the message need not be shared
with anyone the sender and receiver can
exchange personal data using the same
set of keys as often as
possible to understand this better take
the analogy of your
mailbox anyone who wants to send you a
letter has access to the box and can
easily share information with you in a
way you can say the mailbox is publicly
available to all but only you have
access to the key that can open the
mailbox and read the letters in it this
is how the private key comes to play no
one can intercept the message and read
its contents since it's encrypted once
the receiver gets its contents he can
use his private key to decrypt the
information both the public key and the
private key are generated so they are
interl and you cannot substitute other
private keys to decrypt the data in
another another example if Alice wants
to send a message to Bob let's say tre's
call me today she must use Bob's public
key while encrypting the message upon
receiving the cipher message Bob can
proceed to use his private key in order
to decrypt the message and hence
complete SECU is attained during
transmission without any need for
sharing the
key since this type of encryption is
highly secure it has many uses in areas
that require High confidentiality
it is used to manage digital signature
so there is valid proof of a document's
authenticity with so many aspects of
business transitioning to the digital
sphere critical documents need to be
verified before being considered
authentic and acted upon thanks to
asymmetric cryptography senders can now
sign documents with their private Keys
anyone who needs to verify the
authenticity of such signatures can use
the sender's public key to decrypt the
signature since the public and the
private keys are linked to each other
mathematics Ally it's impossible to
repeat this verification with with
duplicate Keys document encryption has
been made very simple by today's
standards but the background
implementation follows the similar
approach in blockchain architecture
asymmetry key cryptography is used to
authorize transactions and maintain the
system thanks to its two key structures
changes are reflected across the
blockchain's peer-to-peer Network only
if it is approved from both ends along
with the symmetric key cryptography
stamp approve architecture its
non-repudiation characteristic also
helps in keeping the network
stable we can also use asymmetric
cryptography combined with symmetric
cryptography to monitor SSL or TLS
encrypted browsering sessions to make
sure nobody can steal up personal
information when accessing banking
websites or the internet in general it
plays a significant role in verifying
website server authenticity exchanging
the necessary encryption Keys required
and generating a session using those
keys to ensure maximum security instead
of the rather insecure HTTP website
format security parameters differ on a
session by session basis so the
verification process is consistent and
utterly essential to Modern data
security another great use of the
asymmetric key cryptography structure is
transmitting keys for symmetric key
cryptography with the most significant
difficulty in symmetric encryption being
key exchange asymmetric keys can help
clear the shortcoming the original
message is first encrypted using a
symmetric key the key used for
encrypting the data is then converted
into the cipher text using the
receiver's public key now we have two
Cipher texts to transmit to the receiver
on receiving both of them the receiver
uses his private key to decrypt the
Symmetry key he can then use it to
decrypt the original information on
getting the key used to encrypt the data
while this may seem more complicated
than just asymmetry key cryptography
alone symmetric encryption algorithms
are much more optimized for vast amounts
of data on some occasions
encrypting the key using asymmetric
algorithms will definitely be more
memory efficient and
secure you might remember us discussing
why symmetric encryption was called
private key cryptography let us
understand why asymmetric falls under
the public key
cryptography we have two keys at our
disposal the encryption key is available
to everyone the decryption key is
supposed to be
private unlike symmetry key cryptography
there is no need to share anything
privately to have an encrypted messaging
system to put that into perspective we
share our email address with anyone
looking to communicate with us it is
supposed to be public by Design so that
our email login credentials are private
and they help in preventing any data
mishandling since there is nothing
hidden from the world if they want to
send us any encrypted information this
category is called the public key
cryptography there are quite a few
algorithms being used today that follow
the architecture of asymmetry
cryptography none more famous than the
RS
encryption RS encryption is the most
widely used encryption or public
encryption standard using asymmetry ke
approach named after its Founders reest
Shamir and Adelman it uses block ciphers
to obscure the information if you are
unfamiliar with how block ciphers work
there are encryption algorithms that
divide the original data into blocks of
equal size the block size depends on the
exact Cipher being used used once they
are broken down these blocks are
encrypted individually and later chained
together to form the final Cipher
text widely considered to be the most
secure form of encryption albe it
relatively slower than symmetric
encryption algorithms it is widely used
in web browsing secure identification
vpns emails and other chat
applications with so many variables in
play there must be some advantages that
give asymmetrically cryptography an edge
over the traditional symmetric
encryption methodologies let's go
through some of
them there is no need for any reliable
key sharing channel in asymmetric
encryption it was an added risk in
private key cryptography that has been
completely eliminated in public key
architecture the key which is made
public cannot decrypt any confidential
information and the only key that can
decrypt doesn't need to be shared
publicly under any
circumstance we have much more extensive
key lens in RSA encryption and other
asymmetric algorithms like 248 bit key
and 496 bit Keys larger keys are much
harder to break into viab brute force
and are much more
secure asymmetric key cryptography can
use as a proof of authenticity since
only the rightful owner of the keys can
generate the messages to be decrypted by
the private key the situation can also
be reversed encryption is done using a
private key and decryption is done by
the public key which would not function
if the correct private key is not used
to generate the message hence proving
the authenticity of the
owner it also has a tamper protection
feature where the message cannot be
intercepted and changed without
invalidating the private key used to
encrypt the data consequently the public
key cannot decp the message and it is
easy to realize the information is not
100% legitimate when and where the case
requires now that we have a proper
revision let's understand what digital
signatures are before moving on to the
gorithm the objective of digital
signatures is to authenticate and verify
documents and data this is necessary to
avoid tampering and digital modification
or forgery of any kind during the
transmission of official
documents they work on the public key
cryptography architecture with one
exception typically an asymmetry key
system encrypts using a public key and
decrypts with a private key for digital
signatures however the verse is
true the signature is encrypted using a
private key and is decrypted with the
public key because the keys are in
together decoding it with the public key
verifies that the proper private key was
used to sign the document therefore by
verifying the signatures Provence let's
go through each step to understand the
procedure
thoroughly in step one we have M which
is the original plain text message and
it is passed onto a hash function
denoted by h hash to create a
digest next it bundles the message
together with the hash digest and
encrypts it using the sender private
key it sends the encrypted bundle to the
receiver who can decrypt it using the
senders public
key once the message is decrypted it is
passed through the same hash function H
hash to generate a similar
digest it compares the new newly
generated hash with the bundled hash
value received along with the message if
they match it verifies data
Integrity in many instances they provide
a layer of validation and security to
messages through non-secure Channel
properly implemented a digital signature
gives the receiver reason to believe
that the message was sent by the claimed
sender digital signatures are equivalent
to traditional handwritten signatures in
many respects but properly implemented
digital signatures are more difficult to
Forge than the handwritten type digital
signature schemes in the sense used here
are cryptographically based and must be
implemented properly to be effective
they can also provide non-repudiation
meaning that the signer cannot
successfully claim that they did not
sign a message while also claiming their
private key remains secret further some
non-repudiation schemes offer a Tim
stamp for the digital signature so that
even if the private key is exposed the
signature is valid to to implement the
concept of digital signature in real
world we have two primary algorithms to
follow the RSA algorithm and the DS
algorithm but the latter is a topic of
learning today so let's go ahead and see
what the digital signature algorithm is
supposed to
do digital signature algorithm is a fips
standard which is a federal information
processing standard for digital
signatures it was proposed in 1991 and
globally standardized in 1994 by the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology also known as the nist it
functions on the framework of modular
exponation and discrete logarithmic
problems which are difficult to compute
as a force brute
system unlike DSA most signature types
are generated by signing message digest
with the private key of the originator
this creates a digital thumbprint of the
data since just the message digest is
signed the signature is generally much
smaller compared to the data that was
signed as a result digital signatures
impose less load on processors at the
time of signing execution and they use
small volumes of bandwidth DSA on the
other hand does not encrypt message
digest using private key or Decap
message digest using public key instead
it uses mathematical functions to create
a digital signature consisting of two
160 bit numbers which are originated
from the message digests and the private
key these make use of the public key for
authenticating the signature but the
authorization process is much more
complicated when compared with RSA DSA
also provides three benefits which is
the message authentication Integrity
verification and non-
repudiation in the image we can see the
entire process of DSF validation a plain
text message is passed onto a hash
function where the digest is generated
which is passed onto a signing function
signing function also has other
parameters like a global variable G of
random variable K and the private key of
the
sender the outputs are then bundled onto
a single pack with a plain text and sent
to the receiver the two outputs we
receive from the signing functions are
the two 160 bit numbers denoted by S and
R on the receiver end we pass the plane
text to the same hash function to
regenerate the message digest it is
passed on to verification function which
has other requirements such as the
public key of the sender Global variable
G and SNR received from the
sender the value generated by the
function is then compared to R if they
match then the verification process is
complete and data Integrity is verified
this was an overview of the way the DSA
algorithm works you already know it
depends on logarithmic functions to
calculate the outputs so let us see how
we can do the same in our next
section we have three phases here the
first of which is key
generation to generate the keys we need
some
prerequisites we select a queue which
becomes a prime devisor we select a
prime number P such that P minus 1 mod Q
equal to 0 we also select a random
integer G which must satisfy the two
formulas being mentioned on the screen
right now once these values are selected
we can go ahead with generating the keys
the private key can be denoted by X and
it is any random integer that falls
between the bracket of zero and the
value of Q the public key can be
calculated as y = g ^ x mod P where y
stands for the public key the private
key can then be packaged as a bundle
which comprises of values of p q G and X
similarly the public key can also be
packaged as a bundle having the values
of p q G and Y once we're done with key
generation we can start verifying the
signature and this
generation repeat once the keys are
generated we can start generating the
signature the message is passed through
a hash function to generate the digest
Edge first we can choose any random
integer K which falls under the bracket
of 0 and Q to calculate the first first
160 bit number of assigning function of
r we use the formula G ^ K mod P into
mod Q similarly to calculate the value
of the second output that is s we use
the following formula that is shown on
the
screen the signature can then be
packaged as a bundle having R and
S this bundle along with the plane text
message is then passed on to the
receiver now with the third phase is we
have to verify the signature we first
calculate the message digest received in
the bundle by passing it to the same
hash function we calculate the value of
w U1 and U2 using the formulas shown on
the screen we have to calculate a
verification component which is then to
be compared with the value of R being
sent by the sender this verification
component can be calculated using the
following formula once calculated this
can be compared with the value of R if
the values match then the signature
verification is successful and our
entire process is complete starting from
Key generation to the signature
Generation all the way up to the
verification of the
signature with so many steps to follow
we are bound to have a few advantages to
boot this and we would be right to think
so DSA is highly robust in the security
and stability aspect when compared to
Alternative signature verif ification
algorithms we have a few other ciphers
that aim to achieve the Simplicity and
the flexibility of DSA but it has been a
tough ask for all the other
suits the key generation is much faster
when compared to the RSA algorithm and
such while the actual encryption and
decryption process May falter a little
in comparison a quicker start in the
beginning is well known to optimize a
lot of
Frameworks DSA requires Less storage
space to work its entire High cycle in
contrast its direct correspondent that
is RSA algorithm needs a certain amount
of computational and storage space to
function efficiently this is not the
case with DSA which has been optimized
to work with weaker hardware and lesser
resources the DSA is patented but nist
has made this patent available worldwide
royaltyfree a draft version of the
speculation fips 1865 indicates that DSA
will no longer be approved for digital
signature generation but it may be used
to verify signatures generated prior to
the implementation date of that
standard the RSA algorithm is a public
key signature algorithm developed by Ron
reest ADI Shamir and Leonard Edelman the
paper was first published in 1977 and
the algorithm uses logarithmic functions
to keep the working complex enough to
withstand brute force and streamlined
enough to be fast post deployment RSA
can also encrypt and decrypt general
information to securely exchange data
along with handling digital signature
verification let us understand how it
achieved this we take our plain text
message M we pass it through a hash
function to generate the digest H which
is then encrypted using the sender's
private key this is appended to the
original PL text message and sent over
to the
receiver once the receiver receives the
bundle he can pass the text messes with
the same hash function to generate a
digest and the cipher text can be
decrypted using the public key of the
sender the remaining hashes are compared
if the values match then the data
Integrity is verified and the sender is
authenticated apart from digital
signatures the main case of RSA is
encryption and decryption of private
information before being transmitted
across communication challenge this is
where the data encryption comes into
play when using RSA for encryption and
decryption of General data it reverses
the key set usage unlike signature
verification it receives the receiver's
public key to encrypt the data and uses
the receiver's private key in decrypting
the data thus there is no need to
exchange any keys in this scenario there
are two broad components when it comes
to RSA cryptography one of them is key
generation key generation employs a step
of generating the private and the public
keys that are going to be used for
encrypting and decrypting the data the
second part is the encryption and
decryption functions these are the
ciphers and steps that need to be run
when scrambling the data or recovering
the data from the cipher text you will
Now understand each of these steps in
our next
subtopic keeping the previous two
concepts in mind let us go ahead and see
how the entire process works starting
from creating the keer to encrypting and
decrypting the
information you need to generate the
public and private Keys before running
the functions to generate Cipher text
and plain text
they use certain variables and
parameters all of which are explained we
first use two large prime numbers which
can be denoted by P and Q we can compute
the value of n as n = p into q and
compute the value of Zed as P minus1
into Q
-1 a number e is chosen at random
satisfying the following conditions and
a number D is also selected at random
following the formula Ed mod Z equal to
1 and it can be calculated with the form
given
below the public key is then packaged as
a bundle with n and E and the private
key is packaged as a bundle using n and
D this sums of the key generation
process for the encryption and
decryption function we use the formula C
and M the cipher Tex can be calculated
as c = m ^ e mod n and the plain text
can be calculated from the cipher text
as C power D mod n when it comes comes
to a data encryption example let's take
p and Q as 7 and 13 the value of n can
be calculated as
91 if we select the value of e to be
five it satisfy all the criteria that we
needed to the value of D can be
calculated using the following function
which gives it as 29 the public key can
then be packaged as 91a 5 and the
private key can then be packaged as 91a
29 the plain text if it is 10 which is
denoted by m Cipher text can be
calculated the formula c = m^ e mod n
which gives us 82 if somebody receives
this Cipher text they can calculate the
plain text using the formula C to the^ D
mod n which gives us the value of 10 as
selected as our plain
text we can now look at the factors that
make the RSA algorithm Stand Out versus
its competitors in the advantageous
topics of this
lesson RSA and deson depends on using
the receiver's public key so that you
don't have to share any secret key to
receive the messages from others this
was the most glaring flaw faced by
symmetric algorithms which were
eventually fixed by asymmetric
cryptography
structure since the key pairs are
related to each other a receiver cannot
intercept the message since they didn't
have the correct private keys to decrypt
the information if a public key can deip
the information the sender cannot refuse
signing it with his private key without
admitting the private key is not in fact
private
anymore the encryption process is faster
than that of the DSA algorithm even if
the key generation is slower in RSA many
systems across the world tend to reuse
the same keys so that they can spend
less time in key generation and more
time on actual Cipher text
management data will be tamper proof in
transit since meddling with the data
will alter the usage of the keys the
private key won't be able to decp the
information hence alerting the receiver
of any kind of manipulation in between
the receiver must be aware of any third
party who possesses the private key
since they can alter the data mid
Transit the cases of which are rather
low imagine creating an account on a new
website you provide your email address
and set a password that you are
confident and you would not forget what
about the website owner how securely are
they going to store your
password for website administrators they
have three Alternatives they can either
store the passwords in a plain text
format they can encrypt the passwords
using an encryption and decryption key
or they can store the passwords in a
hash value let's have a look at each of
these when a password is stored in clean
text format it is considered to be the
most unsafe option since anyone in the
company can read your passwords a single
hack and a data server breach will
expose all the accounts credentials
without needing any extra effort
to counter this owners can encrypt the
passwords and keep them in the servers
as a second alternative but that would
mean they also have to store the
decryption key somewhere on their
servers in the event of a data breach or
the server hack both the decryption key
and encrypted passwords will be leaked
thus making it a single point of
failure what if there was an option to
store the passwords after scrambling
them completely but with no way to
decrypt them this is where hashing comes
to play since only the hash values are
stored in the server no encryption is
needed with no C text passwords to
protect your credentials are safe from
the website administrators considering
all the pros hashed passwords are the
industry standard when it comes to
storing credentials
nowadays before getting too deep into
the topic let's get a brief overview of
how hashing
Works hashing is the process of
scrambling a piece of information or
data beyond recognition
we can achieve this by using hash
functions which are essentially
algorithms that perform mathematical
operations on the main plane text the
value generated after passing the pl
text information through the hash
function is called the hash value digest
or in general just the hash of the
original data while this may sound
similar to encryption the major
difference is hashes are meant to be
irreversible no decryption key can
convert a digest back to its original
value however a few hashing algorithms
have been broken due to the increase in
computational complexity of today's new
generation computers and processors
there are new algorithms that stand the
test of time and are still in use among
multiple areas for password storage
identity verification
Etc like we discussed earlier websites
use hashing to store the users passwords
so how do they make use of these hash
passwords when a user signs up to create
a new account the password is then run
through the hash function and the
resulting hash value is stored on the
servers so the next time a user comes to
log to the account the password he
enters is passed to the same hash
function and compared to the hash stored
on the main server if the newly
calculated hash is the same as the one
stored on the website server the
password must have been correct because
according to Hash functions terminology
same inputs will always provide the same
outputs if the hashes do not match then
the password entered during login is not
the same as the password entered during
the signup hence the login will be
denied this way no PL text passwords get
stored preventing both the owner from
snooping on user data and protecting
users's privacy in the unfortunate event
of a data breach or a
hack apart from password storage hashing
can also be used to perform Integrity
checks when a file is uploaded on the
internet the file's hash value is
generated and it is uploaded loed along
with the original information when a new
user downloads the file he can calculate
the digest of the downloaded file using
the same hash function when the hash
values are compared if they match then
file Integrity has been maintained and
there has been no data
corruption since so much important
information is being passed on the hash
function we need to understand how they
work a hash function is a set of
mathematical calculations of created on
two blocks of data the main input is
broken down into two blocks of similar
size the block size is dependent on the
algorithm that is being
used hash functions are designed to be
one way they shouldn't be reversible at
least by Design some algorithms like the
previously mentioned md5 have been
compromised but more secure algorithms
are being used today like the sh F of
algorithms the digest size is also
dependent on the respective algorithm
being used 5 has a digest of 128 bits
while sh 256 has a digest of 256 bits
this digest must always be the same for
the same input irrespective of how many
times the calculations are carried out
this is a very crucial feature since
comparing the hash value is the only way
to check if the data is untouched as the
functions are not
reversible there are certain
requirements of a hash function that
need to be met before they are accepted
while some of them are easy to guess
others are placed in order to preserve
Security in the long
run the hash function must be quick
enough to encrypt large amounts of data
at a relatively fast paas but it also
shouldn't be very fast running the
algorithm on all cylinders makes the
functions easy to boot force and a
security liability there must be a
balance to allow the hash function to
handle large amounts of data and not
make it ridiculously easy to boot Force
by running through all the possible
combination
the hash function must be dependent on
each bit of the input the input can be
text audio video or any other file
extension if a single character is being
changed it doesn't matter how small that
character may be the entire digest must
have a distinctly different hash value
this is essential to create unique
digests for every password that is beam
store but what if two different users
are using the same password since the
hash function is the same for all users
both the digest will be the same this is
called a hash Collision you may think
this must be a rare occasion where two
users have exactly the same password but
that is not the case we have techniques
like salting that can be used to reduce
these hash cisions as we will discuss
later in this
video you would be shocked to see the
most used passwords of 2020 all of these
passwords are laughably insecure and
since many people use the same passwords
repeatedly on different websites hash
collisions risk are more common than one
would
expect let's say the hash functions find
two users having the same password how
can they store both the hashes without
messing up the original data this is
where salting and peppering come to
play salting is the process of adding a
random keyword to the end of the input
before it is passed on to the hash
function this random keyword is unique
for each user on the system and it is
called theof Sal value or just the salt
so even if two passwords are exactly the
same the salt value will differ and so
will the digest there is a small problem
with this process though since the salt
is unique for each user they need to be
stored in the database along with the
passwords and sometimes even in plain
text to speed up the process of
continuous verification if the server is
hacked then the hashes will need to be
brute forced which takes a lot of time
but if they receive the salts as well
the entire process process becomes very
fast this is something that peppering
aims to
solve peppering is the process of adding
a random string of data to the input
before passing them to the hash function
but this time the random string is not
unique for each user it is supposed to
be common for all users in the database
and the extra bit added is called the
pepper in this case the pepper isn't
stored on the servers it is mostly
hardcoded onto the website source code
since it's going to be the same for all
credentials this way even if the servers
get hacked they will not have the right
pepper needed to crack into all the
passwords many websites use a
combination of salting and peppering to
solve the problem of hash collision and
bolster security since BR Force takes
such a long time many hackers avoid
taking the effort the returns are mostly
not worth it and the possible
combinations of using both salting and
peppering is humongous
with the consensus aiming towards an
educated public on digital privacy it's
no surprise to see an increasing
interest in encryption algorithms we
have already covered the major names
like the dees and the AES algorithm md5
algorithm was one of the first hashing
algorithms to take the global stage as a
successor to the md4 despite the
security vulnerabilities encountered in
the future md5 Still Remains a crucial
part of data infrastructure in a
multitude of environments
the md5 hashing algorithm is a one-way
cryptographic functions that accepts a
message of any length as input and it
returns as output a fixed length digest
value to be used for authenticating the
original messages the digest size is
always 128 bits irrespective of the
input the md5 hash function was
originally designed for use as a secure
cryptographic hash algorithm to
authenticate digital signatures MD 5 has
also been depreciated for users other
than as a non- cryptographic check sum
to verify data integrity and detect
unintentional data
corruption Ronald dest founder of RSA
data security and Institute professor at
MIT designed md5 as an improvement to a
prior message digest algorithm which was
the
md4 as already iterated before the
process is straightforward we pass up PL
text message to the md5 hash functions
which in turn perform certain method ma
matical operations on the clear text to
scramble the data the 128bit digest
received from this is going to be
radically different from the plane text
the goal of any message digest function
is to produce digest that appear to be
random to be considered
cryptographically secure the hash
functions should meet two requirements
first that it is impossible for an
attacker to generate a message that
matches a specific hash value and second
that it is impossible for an attacker to
create two messages that produce the
same hash value even a slight change in
the plane text should trigger a drastic
difference in the two digest this goes a
long way in preventing hash collisions
which take place when two different
plane Texs have the same
digest to achieve this level of
intricacy there are number of steps to
be followed before we receive the digest
let us take a look at the detailed
procedure as to how the md5 hash
algorithm works
the first step is to make the plain text
compatible with the hash function to do
this we need to pad the bits in the
message when we receive the input string
we have to make sure the size is 64 bits
short of a multiple of
512 when it comes to padding the bits we
must add one first followed by zeros to
round out the extra characters this
prepares a string to have a length of
just 64 bits less than any multiple of
512
here and out we can proceed On To The
Next Step where we have to Pat the
length bits initially in the first step
we appended the message in such a way
that the total length of the bits in the
message was 64 bits short of any
multiple of 512 now we add the length
bits in such a way that the total number
of bits in the message is perfectly a
multiple of
52 that means 64 bit lens to be precise
are added to the message final string to
be hashed is now a definite multiple of
512 The Next Step would be to initialize
the message digest buffer the entire
hashing plane text is now broken down
into 512 bit blocks there are four
buffers or registers that are of 32 bits
each named a b c and
d these are the four words that are
going to store the values of each of
these subblocks
the first iteration to follow these
registers will have fixed heximal values
as shown on the screen
below once these values are
initial of these 512 blocks we can
divide each of them into 16 further
subblocks of 32 bits each for each of
these subblocks we run four rounds of
operations having the four buffer
variables a b c and d these rounds
require the other constant variables as
well which differ with each round of
operation the constant values are stored
in a random array of 64 elements since
each 32bit subblock is run four times 16
such subblocks equal 64 constant values
needed for a single block iteration the
subblocks can be denoted by the alphabet
M and the constant values are denoted by
the alphabet
T coming to the actual round of
operation we see are four buffers which
already have pre-initialized values for
the first iteration at the very
beginning the values of buffers b c and
d are passed on to a nonlinear
logarithmic function the formula behind
this function changes by the particular
round being worked on as we shall see
later in this video Once the output is
calculated it is added to the raw value
stored in buffer a the output of this
addition is added to the particular
32-bit subblock using which we are
running the four
operations the output of this requisite
function that needs to be added to a
constant value derived from the constant
array K since we have four different
elements in the array repeat since we
have 64 different elements in the array
we can use a distinct element for each
iteration of a particular block The Next
Step involves a circular shift that
increases the complexity of the hash
algorithm and is necessary to create a
unique digest for each individual input
the output generated is later added to
the Valu St in the buffer B the final
output is now stored in the second
buffer of B of the output register
individual values of c d and a are
derived from the preceding element
before the iteration started meaning the
value of b gets stored in C value of C
gets stored in D and the value of D in a
now that we have a full register ready
for this subblock the values of a b c d
are moved on as input to the next
subblock
once all 16 subblocks are completed the
final register value is saved and the
next 512-bit block begins at the end of
all these blocks we get a final digest
of the md5
algorithm regarding the nonlinear
process mentioned in the first step the
formula changes for each round it's
being run on this is done to maintain
the computational complexity of the
algorithm and to increase randomness of
the procedure the formula for each of
the four rounds uses the same parameters
that is b c and d to generate a single
output the formulas being used are shown
on the screen right
now algorithm unlike the latest hash
algorithm families a 32-bit digest is
relatively easier to compare when
verifying the digest they don't consume
a noticeable amount of dis storage and
are comparatively easier to remember and
reiterate passwords need not be stored
in plain text format make making them
accessible for hackers and malicious
actors when using digest the database
security also gets a boost since the
size of all the hash values will be the
same in the event of a hack or a breach
the malicious actor will only receive
the hashed values so there is no way to
regenerate the plain text which would be
the user passwords in this case since
the functions are irreversible by Design
hashing has become a compulsion when
storing user credentials on the server
nowadays
a relatively low memory footprint is
necessary when it comes to integrating
multiple Services into the same
framework without a CPU overhead the
digest size is the same and the same
steps are run to get the hash value
irrespective of the size of the input
string this helps in creating a low
requirement for computational power and
is much easier to run on older Hardware
which is pretty common in server farms
around the world
we can monitor file corruption by
comparing hash values before and after
Transit once the hash is match file
Integrity checks are valid and we can
avoid data
corruption hash functions will always
give the same output for the similar
input irrespective of the iteration
parameters it also helps in ensuring
that the data hasn't been tampered with
on route to the receiver of the
message we use our Wi-Fi everyday for
work and we use the internet for
entertainment and communication the
dependency on technology is at an
all-time high thanks to the radical
developments and innovation in these
last two decades a big portion of this
belongs to ensuring secure channels of
communication and data
transmission the secure hash algorithm
are a family of a cryptographic hash
functions that are published by the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology along with the NS say it was
passed as a federal information
processing standard also known as fips
it has four different families of hash
functions ssj 0 is a 160 bit hash
function published in 1993 and it was
closed down later after an undisclosed
significant flaw sh1 is also a 160 bit
hash function which resembles the
earlier md5 algorithm this was designed
by the NSA to be a part of the digital
signature algorithm
sh2 is a family of two similar hash
functions with different block sizes
known as the Sha 256 and the Sha 512
they differ in the word size sha 256
uses 32 bits words while sha 512 uses 64
bit words sh3 is a hash function
properly known as kak it was chosen in
2012 after a public competition among
non NSA designers it supports the same
hash lens as H2 and its internal
structure differs significantly from the
rest of the Sha family as we have
already iterated the process is straight
forward we pass a plain text message to
the sh hash function which in turn
performs certain mathematical operations
on the clear text to scramble the data
the 160 bit digest received from this is
going to be radically different from the
plain text the goal of any hash function
is to produce digest that appear to be
random to be considered
cryptographically secure the hash
function should meet two requirements
first that it is impossible for an
attacker to generate a message that
matches a specific hash value and second
it should be impossible for an attacker
to create two messages producing the
exactly same hash value even a slight
change in the plane text should trigger
a drastic difference in the two digest
this goes a long way in preventing hash
collisions which takes place when two
different plane text have the same
digest the a family functions have some
characteristics that they need to follow
while generating the digest let's go
through a few of
them the length of the clear text should
be less than 2^ 64 bits in the case of
sha1 and
s256 this is essential to keep the plain
text compatible with the hash function
and the size needs to be in comparison
area to keep the digest as random as
possible
the length of the hash digest should be
256 bits in the Sha 256 algorithm 512
bits in the Sha 52 algorithm and so on
bigger digest usually suggests
significantly more calculations at the
cost of speed and space we typically go
for the longest digest to bolster
security but there must be a definite
balance between the speed and security
of a hash
function by Design all hash function of
the Sha 512 sh 256 are
irreversible you should neither get a
plain text when you have the digest
beforehand nor should the digest provide
the original value when you pass it
through the same hash function again
another case of protection is that when
the hash digest is passed into the Sha
function for a second time we should get
a completely different digest from the
first instance this is done to reduce
the chance of Brute Force attacks
to achieve this level of intricacy there
are a number of steps to be followed
before we receive the digest let us take
a look at the detailed procedure as to
how the Sha algorithm
works the first step is to make the
plain text compatible with the hash
function to do this we need to pad the
bits in the message when you receive the
input string you have to make sure the
size is 64 bit short of a multiple of
512 when it comes to padding the bits
you must add one first followed by the
remaining zeros to round out the extra
characters this prepares our string to
have a length just 64 bits less than any
multiple of
512 here on out we can proceed to The
Next Step where we have to Pat the
length bits initially in the first step
we appended the message in such a way
that the total number of bits in the
message was 64 bits short from becoming
a multiple of
512 now we add the length of bits in
such a way that the total number of bits
in the message is a perfect multiple of
512 that means 64 bits plus the length
of the original message becomes a
multiple of 512 this becomes a final
string that needs to be
hashed in the next step we have to
initialize this chaining
variables the entire plane text message
can now be broken down into blocks of
512 bits each unlike other hash
algorithms like md5 which use use four
registers or buffers sha family use five
buffers of 32 bits each they are named a
b c d and e these registers go through
multiple rounds of operation where the
first iteration has fixed hmal values as
can be seen in the
screen moving on we have to process each
of the 512-bit blocks by breaking each
of them into 16 subblocks of 32 bits
each each of them goes through four
rounds of operation that use the entire
register and have the 512-bit block
along with the constant array out of
those four rounds each round has 20
iterations so in general we have 80
rounds sum
total the constant value of K is an
array of 80
elements of those 80 16 elements are
being used each round so that comes out
to 80 rounds for each of those
elements the value of T differs by the
number of rounds as can be seen in the
table below
a single formula is necessary to
calculate the output of each round and
iteration the formula can be AB CDE e
registor is equal to e plus a nonlinear
process P along with a circular shift of
A+ WT + KT in this formula ABCD is the
register value of the chaining variables
as we discussed before p is a logical
process which has a different formula
for each round
S5 is a circular shift by 5 bits and WT
is a 32bit string derived from the
existing subblock this can be calculated
depending on the iteration at
hand KT signifies a single element of
the 80 character element array which
changes depending on the particular
round at hand for the values of WT the
first 16 values are the same as that of
the subblocks so there is no extra
calculation needed for the next 64
elements the value of WT can be
calculated as shown in the formula here
to better understand this let's take a
look at how each of this goes in a
sequential process we have our initial
register using the five words of 32 bits
each in the first step we put the values
of a b c and d to the subsequent
register as the
output next we use a nonlinear process P
that changes depending on the round and
uses the values of b c P and D as
input whatever output is generated from
the nonlinear process it is added with
the value of the E
registor next the value of a is circular
shifted by five bits and is added with
the output generated in the previous
step the next step is adding the value
of WT and the constant element of KT the
current output is then stored in the
register a similarly this iteration is
repeated every round and for each
subblock in the process once all the
registers are complete and all the
subblocks are joined together to form
the single Cipher text message we will
have our hash output regarding the
nonlinear process P that uses the values
of b c and d as input the formula
changes every round to maintain a
complexity of the program that can
withstand Brute Force attacks depending
on the round the values are passed
through a logical operation which is
then added with the values of WT KT and
so on now that we understand how to get
our hash digest from the plain text let
us learn about the advantages we obtain
when using the Sha hash algorithm
instead of relying on data in a plain
text
format digital signatures follow
asymmetric encryption methodology to
verify the authenticity of a document or
a file hash algorithms like sh 256 and
the industry standard sha 512 go a long
way in ensuring the verification of
signatures passwords need not be stored
in a plain text format which makes them
accessible to hackers and other
malicious actors when using digest the
database security also gets a boost
since the size of all hash values will
be the same in the event of a hack or a
breach the malicious actor will only
receive the hash values with no way to
regenerate the plane text in this case
the plain text would be user credentials
since the hash functions are
irreversible by design it has become a
compulsion when storing passwords on the
servers the SSL handshake is a crucial
segment of the web browsing sessions and
it's done using sha functions it
consists of your web browsers and the
web servers agreeing on encryption keys
and hashing authentication to prepare a
secure connection it relies on a
combination of symmetric and asymmetric
algorithms which ensure the
confidentiality of the data transmitted
between a web server and a web client
like the
browsers you can monitor file corruption
by comparing hash values before and
after Transit once the hash is match
file Integrity checks are valid and data
corruption is avoided hash functions
will always give the same output for the
same input irrespective of the iteration
parameters it also helps in ensuring
that the data hasn't been tampered with
on route to the receiver of the message
passwords are by far the most common
type of user authentication they are
popular because their Theory makes
perfect sense to individuals and is
reasonably simple to implement for
developers on the other hand poorly
constructed passwords can pose security
flaws a well-designed password-based
authentication process does not save the
users's actual password this would make
it far too simple for a hacker or a
malevolent Insider to access all of the
systems user accounts in this video you
will learn how to crack passwords and
simultaneously try to make your
passwords as br root Force resistant as
possible let's take a look at the topics
to be covered
today we start by learning about what is
password cracking in
general next we take a look at the
different techniques of password
cracking that hackers use in order to
generate user credentials for
hacking moving on we take a look at the
multiple tools that hackers can use to
generate these hashes and the
passwords finally we take a look at the
steps and the guidelines that you users
can follow to prevent their passwords
from being
cracked let's start by giving a basic
idea about password
cracking password cracking is the
process of identifying an unknown
password to a computer or a network
resource using a program code it can
also assist a threat actor in gaining
illegal access to resources malicious
actors can engage in various criminal
activities with the information obtained
through password tracking the procedure
might entail comparing a set of of words
to guess credentials or using an
algorithm to guess the password
repeatedly password cracking can be done
for several reasons but the most
malicious reason is in order to gain
unauthorized access to a computer
without the owner's awareness this
results in cyber crime such as stealing
passwords for the purpose of accessing
banking information other non-malicious
reasons for password cracking occur when
someone has misplaced or forgotten a
password another example of nonm
malicious password cracking may take
place if a system administrator is
conducting test on password strength as
a form of security test this enables so
that the hacker cannot easily access
protected systems the best way that
users can protect their passwords from
cracking is to ensure that they choose
strong
passwords typically passwords must
contain a combination of mixed case
random letters digits and
symbols strong password should never be
actual words in addition strong
passwords are at least 8 characters long
in many password protected applications
users are notified of the strength of
the password they've chosen upon
entering it the user can then modify it
and strengthen the password based on the
indications of its
strength now that we understand the
basics of password cracking let's go to
the basic techniques hackers use to
retrieve passwords from General
victims asking the customer for the
password is simple approach to hacking a
fishing email directs the unwar reader
to a counterfeit login page linked with
whatever service the hacker wants to
access generally by demanding the use of
f some critical security flaw or Aid in
a database reset that page then captures
their password which the hacker can
subsequently exploit for their own
purpose social engineering influences
the victim to get personal information
such as bank account numbers or
passwords the strategy is popular among
hackers because they realize that humans
are the gateway to vital credentials and
information through social engineering
the employee tried and true tactics to
exploit and and influence age-old human
Tendencies rather than devising novel
means to breach secure and Advanced
Technologies it has been demonstrated
that many firms either lack adequate
security or are overly friendly and
trustworthy when they should not be they
allow granting access to critical
facilities based on a uniform or a so
story a hacker searches a password
dictionary for the correct password in
the case of a dictionary attack password
dictionaries cover many themes and a
mixture of topics such as politics
movies and music groups users failure to
create a strong password is why this
approach efficiently cracks passwords
still today simply said this assault
employs the same terms that many
individuals use as passwords a hacker
can compare the password hash obtained
to hashes of the password dictionaries
to find the correct plain text
password now that the passwords have
been hashed the hackers attempt to
achieve authentication by breaking the
password hash they accomplish this by
employing a rainbow table which is a set
of pre-computed hashes of portable
password
combinations hackers can use the rainbow
table to crack the hash resulting in
guessing your password as a result it
retrieves the password hash from the
system and eliminates any need to break
it furthermore it does not necessitate
the discovery of the password itself the
breach is accomplished if the hash
matches in a br Force assault the
attacker attempts multiple password
combinations until the correct one is
identified
the attacker uses software to automate
this process and run exhaustive password
combination in a substantially shorter
length of time with the growth of
hardware and technology in recent years
such programs have been invigorated it
won't be quick if your password is more
than a few characters lengthy but it
will eventually reveal your password
boot Force assaults can be sped up by
throwing more processing resources at
them with so many different techniques
coming together to correct passwords
none of them are useful without the
write tools there are a prora of scripts
and Snippets of code that can retrieve
passwords from either encrypted storage
or from the hash digest let's go through
some of these
tools cane and able is a password
recovery tool for Microsoft operating
systems it allows easy recovery of
various kinds of passwords by sniffing
the network cracking encrypted passwords
using dictionary brute force and crypt
analysis attacks recording Vibe
conversations recording scrambled
passwords recovering Wireless Network
Keys Etc are some of the other features
of G enable the latest version is faster
and contains a lot of new features like
ARP poison routing which enables
sniffing on Switched L and man inth
middle attacks the sniffer in this
version can also analyze encrypted
protocols such as ssh1 and https while
containing filters to capture
credentials from a wide range of
authentication
mechanisms it also ships routing
protocol authentication monitors and
Route extractors
dictionary and boot Force crackers are
also present along with common hashing
algorithms and several specific
authentications password hash
calculators and other
features joh the Ripper is a password
cracking application that was first
released in 1996 for unix-based
computers it was created to evaluate
password strength bruteforce encrypted
hash passwords and break passwords using
dictionary attacks it can use dictionary
attacks rainbow tables and other attacks
depending on the target
type Rainbow Crack is a password
tracking application that uses time
memory trade-off algorithm to crack
password hashes with rainbow tables
rainbow tables make password cracking
more easier and faster than traditional
Brute Force attacks it is like a
dictionary containing nearly every
possible password and the pre-calculated
hashes creating this kind of dictionary
takes much more time than cracking a
single hash but after that you can use
the same dictionary over and and over
again this procedure might take a long
time however once the table is ready it
can break passwords far quicker than
Brute Force
methods with so many tools ready to enab
our passwords there are certain set of
rules users can follow to protect the
credentials from being compromised let's
cover some of these
guidelines longer passwords are required
making the Brute Force mechanism tougher
to implement longer passwords and pass
phrases have been demonstrated to boost
secur security significantly however it
is still critical to avoid lenier
passwords that have previously been
hacked or that feature of an Inc
cracking
dictionaries this password policy
encourages users to establish passwords
that do not contain personal
information as previously said most
users create passwords utilizing
personal information such as Hobbies
nicknames pet or family member names Etc
if a hacker has access to personal
information about a specific user for
example via social media they will test
password combinations based on that
knowledge password regulations should
compel users to distinguish between
security and convenience users should be
prohibited from using the same password
for all services password sharing
between users including those who work
in the same department or use the same
equipment should be avoided a single
breached password doesn't affect your
other accounts with this
policy some password regulations
necessitate the creation of a past
phrase rather than a past word while
past phrases serve the same objective
the length make them more difficult to
break in addition to letters a good pass
should include numbers and symbols
passwords may be easier for users to
remember than pass phases however the
latter is much more breach
resistant two Factor authentication or
2fa can help secure an online account or
even a smartphone toofa does this by
asking the user to provide two forms of
information a password or a personal
identification PIN and a code texted to
the user smartphone or a fingerprint
before accessing whatever is secured
this helps discourage unauthorized
entries to an account without the
original owner's permission at this
point you may wonder why you need a
strong password in the first place even
if most websites are safe there is still
a danger that someone will try to access
or exploit your information a strong
password is among the most effective
ways to protect your account and
personal information from hackers you
should follow certain rules and
guidelines while creating a strong
password password managers are also
recommended to help remember the created
passwords for convenience of
usage with that being said let's take a
look at the topics we are covering
today we start by learning about the
state of password cracking in today's
world and why creating strong passwords
is an absolute must for every account
next we will look at some guidelines and
rules that help strengthen passwords and
make password cracking a daunting task
for hackers moving on we understand why
past faes have grown in popularity and
are being recommended for credential
protection over traditional passwords
and finally we take a look at how
password managers help alleviate the
problem of creating and remembering
complex passwords along with other
critical personal
information let's start by learning
about why strong passwords have become
an absolute
necessity one of one of the most common
ways that hackers break into computers
is by guessing passwords simple and
commonly used passwords enable Intruders
to easily gain access and control a
Computing device conversely a password
that is difficult to guess makes it
prohibitively difficult for common
hackers to break into a machine and will
force them to look for another Target
the more difficult the password the
lower the likelihood that one's computer
will fall victim to an unwanted
intrusion many individuals opt to tie
their websites to something they can
read recall to generally easy memorable
combos however this does not make the
password unique in fact it's the reverse
passwords are handled by 53% of
individuals using their Recollections
and memory with modern computational
standards simple passwords take seconds
and a couple of minutes at worst to be
completely brute forced according to
Global surveys more than 60% of people
use the same passwords for their
personal and job applications while this
may allow the user never to forget the
password it makes a single point of
failure the only pin to drop if one of
the accounts gets breached all
subsequent accounts are as good as
hacked to further elaborate on how you
can create strong passwords let's go
through some of the
guidelines let's go through some dos and
Don to understand how to create new
passwords for our accounts it is
recommended to keep the password length
at least 12 characters to ensure brute
forcing to be difficult
a combination of upper and lowercase
alphabets is an absolute necessity when
creating strong
passwords it is also recommended to use
numerics along with those alphabets to
create a complicated
password finally special characters help
in making a password much more Brute
Force resistant than any number of
alphabets or letters can make moving
over to the d
section it's absolutely not not
recommended to keep Simple dictionary
terms such as computer or even the word
password as your credential because
those are very easy to be brute forc and
are usually present in majority of the
dictionary attack word list similarly
changing a single alphabet or a single
character in a dictionary word does not
make it Brute Force Zant considering
there are already algorithms present
that can counter this
tactic using the same character multiple
times in a password also reduces the
strength and makes it easier to crack
for
hackers apart from using single
characters multiple times following
patterns that are present on the
traditional English keyboard such as e w
t y or the line below the main alphabet
such as the ZX cvbn M Etc make it easier
to guess since these are once again
common combinations that are present in
word list
already finally the most important part
being not not using personal information
such as birthdays addresses and other
important information in the passwords
more often than not if a hacker is
trying to break into your account there
has been some amount of research done be
via social media or any other medium if
they have already this information
present with them breaking into your
account becomes all the more
easier now that you understand how to
create strong password look at how P
phrases have become prevalent as a
replacement for plain text
passwords a passphrase is a
sentence-like string of words used for
authentication that is longer than a
traditional password easy to remember
and difficult to crack typical passwords
range on an average from 8 to 16
characters while passphrases can reach
up to 100 characters or more using a
long passphrase instead of a short
password to create a digital signature
is one of the many ways that users can
strengthen the security of their data
devices and accounts
the longer a p phrase is the more likely
a user is to incorporate bits of entropy
of factors that make it less predictable
to potential attackers as more websites
applications and services increase the
user security requirements a p phas is a
fast and easy way to meet these
criterias let's take a look at some of
the advantages that pass faes have over
common
passwords pass phases are simpler to
remember than just a r random assortment
of symbols and characters it's easier to
comprehend a line from your favorite
song or a quotation than a short but
difficult password passwords are
reasonably easy for humans and robots to
guess or crack online thieves have also
Advanced and created Cutting Edge
hacking tools to crack even the most
complex
passwords passphrases are nearly hard to
crack since most efficient password
cracking programs fail at approximately
10 characters as a result even the most
sophisticated cracking tool will be
unable to guess brute force or
pre-compute these passwords complies
with password setting rules with ease
our passphrases the usage of punctuation
and upper and lowercase password satisfy
the password complexity criteria most
operating systems and apps support past
phrases phases of up to 127 characters
are permitted on all major operating
systems including Windows Linux and Mac
as a result for optimal protection you
can use lengthier pass
phrases but when creating a strong
password the major problem people come
across is remembering these passwords or
the pass freees this is where you can
find a use for a password
manager when you establish accounts or
change passwords password managers
generate new strong passwords and they
keep all of them in one place protected
by a single strong master password if
you maintain your master password the
manager will retain everything else
including your username and pass phrases
and fill them in for you whenever you
sign on to a website or app on your
computer or phone there is no good
memory needed for this this implies that
everyone may use the most recent
suggestions for strong passwords such as
extended phrases symbols grammar and
capitalization password managers enable
consumers to write a single master
password and automatically F each
website with their own unique set of
credentials
and not just passwords credit card
information may be stored securely with
several password managers some others
make multiactor authentication or use a
second test such as answering a question
once the correct password is input which
is a simple and effective solution to
verify legitimate login
inputs among the global players in
password managers services like bit
Warden keas and Ashlin have been running
for years now and are very worthy
recommendations if you want to get
started with password management now
that we understand what is hacking let's
take a look at some points to know
whether our system is already hacked or
not the first point regarding how to
check whether a system is hacked or not
can be cases where the system security
is Switched Off by unknown means and it
is not visible to the user this is one
of the most primary checkpoint to know
if our system is hacked or not
next point to check whether a system is
hacked or not would be frequent
antivirus software failures which are
due to the interference from hacking
attempts performed by a professional
hacker or a cyber
criminal then we also face problems
regarding systems reaction speed which
is affected due to the execution of
unknown applications in the background
of the
system which also affects the hardware
resources in the
device next we also face problems
regarding passwords which are no longer
working or are changed without the
user's Intervention which might indicate
that there was some unknown hacking
activity that took place in our
account let's take a look at some more
points regarding the
topic there are often cases when the
system cursor move on its own and
perform task indicating that the system
is being used by someone else using an
illegal hacking method there are also
cases when we often see files and
folders being created in the storage dis
on the system which is unknown to us to
better understand the points regarding
how to identify whether our system is
hacked or not let's take a look then
let's start with the first
point if we want to check whether our
system is hacked or not the first point
would be to choose the settings
option and using privacy and security
and moving on to the Windows security
this option that is available on our
system allows us to see various
protection applications that are
available on the
system if we see any problem regarding
any one of them for example apps and
browser control in my system it says
there's a problem with it which might be
due to hacking attempts that was done on
my
system now let's take a look at the
other option how we can check whether
our system is hacked or not that would
be checking the antivirus software that
is installed in a
system if you face problems regarding
that this might be the issue
according to my antivirus software it
says my computer is at risk this might
be due to the interference from cyber
criminal or a hacker while using
different illegal softwares during its
hacking
attempt then there are also
cases where we see there are unknown
programs being executed in the
background of our system which we can
take a look using the task manager
software using the task CL manager we
can take a look at each and every
application that is being executed in
the system and see the
origin if we find any unknown program or
application we can assume that it might
be due to a hacking
attempt moving on if we want to check
further whether our system is hacked or
not we can check for files or folders
that are being created unknown to us for
example this unknown folder
which contains some security details
that are unknown to
me this might be also due to a hacking
attempt by a hacker or a cyber
criminal then there are also cases when
the systems cursor move on its own and
perform tasks that are not initiated by
us and performs copying of different
folders or data from one file to other
this is due to a hacking attempt that
was done on assist system and the hacker
has taken control of a
system then there are also cases
regarding login issues or password
problem for
example if I want to access into my
account and there's a problem with the
password it might be due
to the attempt of hacking into my
account by a professional hacker
seems like there's a problem with the
username which means there was a hacking
attempt by a professional
hacker we can further check hacking
attempts by accessing a web browser and
checking whether there's some extra
add-ons or unknown add-ons that wasn't
installed by us this might also indicate
a hacking attempt on the system now that
we are clear about how to check whether
our system is hacked or not let's take a
look at some of the counter measure
against hacking let's
begin the first point regarding how to
avoid hacking is do regular manual
Security checks and keep the system
security updated using certified
antivirus softwares is a basic counter
measure against hacking
attempts and if possible visit only
secure websites for surfing on the
Internet or use VPN or other Internet
Security applications to mask your
systems Network to avoid any hacking
attempts for the
device then we have avoid clicking on
random web popups and ads to avoid
Hackers from getting into a system and
accessing a device
data and lastly use strong passwords or
complex passwords for your login
details applying the these counter
measures we can avoid hacking to a
certain extent the concept of instant
messaging crossed into the mainstream in
the 1990s allowing friends acquaintances
colleagues and like-minded thinkers from
all over the world to connect in real
time since then instant messaging has R
evolutionized how we communicate and
today over a billion people are signed
up for at least one messaging app the
present instant messaging experience is
seamless and it intuitively integrates
features like video photos voice
e-commerce and gaming with plain old
messaging among these apps WhatsApp has
comfortably found its place among the
most popular messaging platforms like
everyone associated with the internet a
matter of security is never far away
considering the huge user base of this
messaging app hackers are always on the
lookout for compromised accounts to grab
today we are going to cover some of the
ways we can protect our WhatsApp account
from falling into malicious
hands we start by learning about the
importance of security when it comes to
WhatsApp and instant messaging apps in
general next we cover some of the most
important steps that should be followed
in order to protect our WhatsApp
accounts from
hackers finally we learn what we should
do when a WhatsApp account gets
compromised let's start by learning why
we need to focus on the safety of
WhatsApp in the year of 2020 the big
news was about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and
his phone being haed by Saudi Arabia a
report coming from the guardian
suggested that bezos's phone was hacked
via a video file sent on WhatsApp the
report said that BOS mobile phone was
hacked by Saudi Arabian prints in the
year 2018 and gigabytes worth of data
was stolen from the device while there
are some issues being raised about the
report which states with the medium to
high confidence that Jeff bezos's phone
was hacked it does raise a security fear
for regular users after all if the phone
of one of the world's most powerful men
can be hacked the same can happen to to
any one of us as
well when it comes to regular users we
exchange messages with our loved ones
regarding a paradigm of topics the
information which may seem trivial
initially can later function as
ammunition for a campaign regarding
identity theft basic information like
preferred Banks occasional dining places
can go a long way in Social Engineering
attacks further increasing the need for
secure messaging
habits WhatsApp uses endtoend encryption
to protect all communication on its
platform these encryption keys not only
make it impossible to decrypt messages
but they also prevent third parties and
even WhatsApp from accessing messages or
calls but not entirely although endtoend
encryption makes WhatsApp more secure
than other communication apps no app is
100% safe to use like any application or
digital device WhatsApp is often
targeted by Bad actors it also has
access to your contacts and tracks where
and how long you use it putting your
privacy and personal information at
risk we all have access to our cell
phones so it's no surprise that sms2
factor authentication is one of the most
widespread types of MFA available you
don't need any apps or digital keys and
it's not typed a specific ecosystem
unfortunately it's also not a secure
multiactor authentication method the
nature of SMS itself opens up your
organization to a host of rist hackers
may have many ways to leverage SMS to
find a way into your accounts and
Network be it via spoofed SIM cards or
message hijacking WhatsApp tofa using
SMS isn't a full-proof
solution now that we understand the
variety of reasons why WhatsApp needs
extra security let's go through some of
the ways we can achieve
this it is more than probable that one
fine day you might receive a WhatsApp
message or even an SMS that reads that
your order is delayed please check its
data here or your account is locked and
please unlock it here or even some
tempting messages like win free 3G and
movie tickets here some of them may
sound intimidating and some of them may
be lucrative but they all have one
purpose to trick you into clicking that
link and once you do that it's already
over it will install malware on your
phone and you won't have a clue about it
only when you start noticing that your
phone bills are abnormally high or your
bank account has been used without your
permission the realization will Dawn
upon you that something is wrong with
your phone but by then it may be too
late
WhatsApp in itself provides various
privacy options to users the messaging
platform provides users with option to
choose who they want to share their
profile photo status and other details
with it's a good idea to change the
settings to contacts only this means
only phone numbers that are saved on
your smartphone will be able to see your
profile photo status phone number and
autod delete status as well
make sure you enable the option to log
the screen every time WhatsApp is closed
this will ensure no one else but you can
open your WhatsApp account just head to
the settings menu privacy and select the
screen lock option you will then need to
register your fingerprint after the
process is completed you will have to
scan your fingerprint every time you
open the WhatsApp app this adds an extra
layer of
security the two-step verification works
as an extra layer of security and helps
WhatsApp users to protect their otps and
documents shared through WhatsApp it's
very easy to set up a PIN to activate a
twostep verification users have to
entered periodically once it is
activated WhatsApp will sometimes keep
asking users to enter the six-digit
passcode users cannot disable this
without disabling the two-step
verification feature
altogether in case users do not provide
WhatsApp with an email ID and want to
disable twostep verification then the
number will be permitted to reverifying
however the users will lose all pending
messages upon reverifying
we often have the tendency to log into
WhatsApp web at the office and then
leave the account open on the desktop
The Habit can actually create problems
for you someone else sitting on the same
PC can access all your chats without you
even realizing it it's a good practice
to log out from WhatsApp web before
leaving the office it just takes a few
seconds to log in again by just scanning
the code and you're done
all WhatsApp users should ensure that
the chats are end to end encrypted to
verify that a chat is end to endend
encrypted open the chat tap on the name
of the contact to open the contact info
screen and then tap encryption to view
the QR code and a 60 digigit number
WhatsApp end to end encryption ensures
that only you and your contact can read
the messages that are being exchanged
and nobody in between not even
WhatsApp with the necessary guidelines
out of the way let us go to the
recommended course of action should our
WhatsApp accounts be
compromised the first and most important
thing that you need to do is report the
issue to the WhatsApp support team for
assistance make sure that you reach out
to the support team through its help
desk and Report the hacking attempt
WhatsApp help center will take the
shortest time to resolve your issue via
email or within the app itself this will
help you to take prompt legal action
against the hackers if you can't access
your email call the support team in some
cas cases the support will deactivate
your WhatsApp account and request you to
reactivate within 30 days if you don't
want it to be deleted
completely when someone compromises your
WhatsApp account they can now send
messages to your contact stating that
the company sent your verification code
and gain access to the account that's
why one of the first things you'll want
to do is send a message to your friends
and family letting them know that you've
lost access to your account this action
prevents further exploitation of your
account and
others another reason you'll want to let
your contacts know you have no access to
your WhatsApp account is that they may
fish for personal information from your
banking number to your email address
hackers will cleverly attempt to gain as
much access to your personal information
as
possible WhatsApp web is an extension of
WhatsApp messenger over the web that
facilitates easy synchronization of our
smartphone and personal computer this is
the biggest security threat that hackers
can easily exploit to get into your
personal data over WhatsApp therefore it
is highly recommended that you use this
WhatsApp feature carefully once you
notice that your WhatApp messenger has
been hacked go to your WhatsApp web and
tap on click on the log out from all
computers option this will deactivate
all the web extensions of your
account under the unfortunate
circumstances where the account recovery
doesn't seem likely you can always ask
WhatsApp support to delete your account
permanently while far from the ideal
solution it can act as a fail safe
option if you want to protect your
personal data at any cost possible you
can always open a new account later with
the security issues mitigated and before
we begin if you are someone who is
interested in building a career in cyber
security or to become an ethical hacker
by graduating from the best universities
or a professional who elicits to switch
career with cyber security or ethical
hacker by learning from the experts and
try giving a short to Simply Lars
postgraduate program in cyber security
with modules from MIT schmith College of
computing the course link is mentioned
in the description box below that will
navigate you to the course page where
you can find a complete overview of the
program being offered it's no secret
that the majority of our internet usage
is at the risk of being hacked be it via
unsafe messaging applications or
misconfigured operating systems to
counteract this void of digital security
penetration testing has become the norm
when it comes to vulnerability
assessment K Linux is an operating
system that has become a well-known
weapon in this fight against hackers a
Linux distribution that is made
specifically for penetration testers K
Linux has layers of features that we
will be covering in today's lesson let's
take a look at the topics to be covered
in this
video we start by learning about G Linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of K Linux
from the story of its origin to its
current day
exploits next we learn a few distinct
features of Khali that make it an
attractive choice for penetration
testers worldwide
finally we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install K Linux to start our
journey in the world of penetration
testing let's start by learning about K
Linux in
general Ki Linux which is formerly known
as backtrack Linux is an open-source
Linux distribution aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing it contains several 100 tools
that are targeted towards various
information security tasks such as
penetration testing security research
computer forensics and reverse
engineering color Linux is a multiple
platform solution accessible and freely
available to Information Security
Professionals and
hobbyists among all the Linux
distributions K Linux takes its roots
from the Debian operating system Debian
has been a highly dependable and stable
distribution for many years providing a
similarly strong Foundation to the Kali
desktop while the operating system is
capable of of practically modifying
every single part of our installation
the networking components of Kali become
disabled by default this is done to
prevent any external factors from
affecting the installation procedure
which may pose a risk in critical
environments apart from boosting
security it allows a deeper element of
control to the most enthusiastic of
users we did not get K Linux since the
first day how did it come into existence
let's take a look at some of its history
K Linux is based on years of knowledge
and experience in building penetration
testing and operating systems during all
these project lifelines there have been
only a few different developers as the
team has always been small the first
project was called wopex which stands
for white hat nopex as can be inferred
from the name it was based on the nopex
operating system as its underlying OS
opix had releases ranging from version
2.0 to
2.7 this made way for the next project
which was known as wax or the long hand
being white hat slacks the name changed
was because the base OS was changed from
noix to slacks wax started at version 3
as a ND it carrying on from WPIX there
was a similar OS being produced at the
same time auditor security collection
often being shorted to just auditor
which was once again using
npix its efforts were combined with wax
to produce backtrack backtrack was based
on Slack from version 1 to version 3 but
switched to Ubuntu later on with version
4 to version 5 using the experience
gained from all of this Ki Linux came
after backtrack in 2013 Ki started off
using Debian stable as the engine under
the hood before moving to Debian testing
when Kali Linux became a rolling
operating
system now that we understand the
history and the purpose of K Linux let
us learn a little more about its
distinct features
the latest version of Khali comes with
more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed after reviewing every tool
that was included in backtrack
developers have eliminated a great
number of tools that either simply did
not work or which duplicated other tools
that provided the same or similar
functionality the Kali Linux team is
made up of a small group of individuals
who are the only ones trusted to commit
packages and interact with the
depositories all of which is done using
multiple secure protocols restricting
access of critical code bases to
external asset greatly reduces the risk
of source contamination which can cause
K Linux users worldwide a great deal of
damage as a direct victim of cyber
crime although penetration tools tend to
be written in English the developers
have ensured that Khali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a
stronghold over the configuration and
the device in
general since Arm based single board
systems like the Raspberry Pi are
becoming more and more prevalent and
inexpensive the development team knew
that Khali's armm support would need to
be as robust as they could manage with
fully working
installations K Linux is available on a
wide range of arm devices and has armm
reposit it is integrated with the
mainline distributions so the tools for
armm are updated in conjunction with the
rest of the
distribution all this information is
necessary for users to determine if K
Linux is the correct choice for them if
it is what are the ways that they can go
forward with this installation and start
the penetration testing
Journey the first way to use scal Linux
is by launching the distribution in the
live USB mode this can be achieved by
downloading the installer image file or
the ISO file from the K Linux website
and flashing it to a USB drive with a
capacity of at least 8 GB some people
don't need to save their data
permanently and a live USB is the
perfect solution for such cases after
the iso image is flashed the thumb drive
can be used to boot a fully working
installation of the operating system
with the cavar that any changes made to
the OS in this mode are not written
permanently some cases allow persistent
usage in live USBS but those require
further configuration than normal
situations but what if the user wants to
store data permanently in the installed
OS the best and the most reliable way to
ensure this is the full-fledged hard
disk installation this will ensure the
complete usage of the system's Hardware
capabilities and will take into account
the updates and the configurations being
made to the OS this method is supposed
to override any pre-existing operating
system installed on the computer be it
windows or any other variant of
Linux the next altern ative route for
installing K Linux would be to use
virtualization software such as VMware
or virtual box the software will be
installed as a separate application on
an already existing OS and K Linux can
be run as an operating system in the
same computer as a window the hardware
requirements will be completely
customizable starting with the allotted
Ram to the virtual hard disk
capacity the usage of both a host and
guest operating system like K Linux
allows users a safe environment to learn
while not putting the systems at risk if
you want to learn more about how one can
go forward with this method we have a
dedicated video where Ki Linux is being
installed on VMware while running on a
Windows 10 operating system you can find
the link in the description box to get
started with your very own virtual
machine the final way to install Kali
Linux is by using a dual boot system to
put it in simple words the K Linux OS
will not be overwriting any
pre-installed operating system on a
machine but will be installed alongside
it when a computer boots up the user
will get a choice to boot into either of
these operating systems many people
prefer to keep both the windows and Kali
Linux installed so the distribution of
work and recreational activities is also
allotted effectively it gives users a
safety valve should their custom Linux
installation run into any bugs that
cannot be fixed from within the
operating system now for the convenience
of explanation we're going to install K
Linux today on a virtual machine
software known as VMware VMware is able
to run multiple operating systems on a
single host machine which in our case is
a Windows 10
system to get started with K Linux
installation we have to go to the
website to download an image
file you go to get Kali and as you can
see there are multiple platforms on
which this operating system can be
inverted as per our requirement we're
going to go with the virtual machine
section as you can see it is already
recommended by the
developers this is the download button
which will download a 64bit ISO file we
can download 32-bit but that is more
necessary for hard metal machines or if
you're going to use it for older devices
which do not support 64-bit operating
systems
yet after clicking on the download
button we can see we have a window
archive which will have the ISO
files for now we we have downloaded the
ISO file and it is already present with
me so we can start working on the VMS
side of things once the ISO file is
downloaded we open up VMware
Workstation go to file and we create a
new virtual
machine in these two options it is
highly recommended to go with the
typical setup rather than the custom one
the custom is much more advanced and
requires much more information from the
user which is beneficial for developers
and people who are well versed with
virtualization software but from 90% of
the cases typical setup will be
enough here we can select the third
option which will be I will install the
operating system later in some operating
systems we can use the ISO file here
directly and VMR will install it for us
but right now in the case of K Linux the
third option is always the
safest K Linux is a Linux distrib
distribution so we can select Linux over
here and the version as you can see here
it have multiple versions such as the
multiple
kernels every distribution has a a
parent distribution for example K Linux
has Debian and there are other
distributions which are based or forked
from some parent distribution kinus is
based of Debian so we can go with the
highest version of Debian which is the
Debian 10. X
64bit go on next we can write any any
such name we can write K Linux so that
it'll be easier to recognize the virtual
machine among this list of virtual
machine instances the location can be
any location you decide to put by
default this should be the documents
folder but anywhere you put it will hold
up all the information of the operating
system all the files you download all
the configurations you store everything
will be stored in this particular
location that you
provide when we go next we are asked
about the disc capacity this dis
capacity will be all the storage that
will be provided to your virtual machine
of K Linux think of your Windows device
if you have a 1 tbte of hard drive you
have the entirety of the hard disk to
store data on how much data you give
here you can only store up to that
amount of data not to mention some
amount of capacity will be taken up by
the operating system itself to store its
programs and applications for now we can
give around let's say 15 GB of
information or if a recommended size
foran is 20 you can just go ahead at 20
it depends all on the user case if
you're going to use it extensively you
can even go as high as 50 or 60 GB if
you have plans to download many more
applications and perform multiple
different tests another option we get
over here is storing virtual dis as a
single file or storing them into
multiple
files as we already know this virtual
machine run entirely on
VMware sometimes when transferring these
virtual machine instances let's say from
a personal computer to a work computer
we're going to need to copy up the
entire folder that we had mentioned
before over
here instead all virtual machines have a
portability feature now this portability
feature is possible for all scenarios
except it is much easier if the split
the virtual dis into multiple files now
even if this makes
porting virtual machines easier from
either system to system or software to
software let's say if you want to switch
from vmw to Virtual box or vice versa
the performance takes a small hit it's
not huge but it's recommended to go with
storing the virtual L as a single file
if you have no purposes of ever moving
the virtual machine even if you do it's
not a complete stop that it cannot be
ported it's just easier when using
multiple files but in order to get the
best performance out with the virtual
machine we can store it as a single file
over
here this is a summary of all the
changes that we made and all the
configurations that have been settled
until now now at this point of time we
have not provided the ISO file yet which
is the installation file for the K Linux
that we downloaded from this
website as of right now we have only
configured the settings of the virtual
machine so we can press on finish
and we have K Linux in the list now to
make the changes further we press on
edit virtual machine
settings the memory is supposed to give
the ram of the virtual machine so
devices with ram of 8 GB or below that
giving high amount of ram will cause
performance issues and the host system
if the memory has some amount of free
storage left let's say on idle storage
my Windows machine takes about 2 GB so I
have 6 GB of memory to provide although
if you provide all of the 6gb it will be
much more difficult for the host system
to run everything properly so for this
instance we can keep it as 2 GB of
memory for the virtual machine instance
similarly we can use the number of
processors and we can customize it
according to our liking let's say if we
want to use One processor but we want to
use two different course we can select
them as
well hard disk is preset up as the SCSI
hard disk and it does not need to be
changed for the installation of this
operating system at
all CD ID DVD this is where the
installation file comes you can think of
the ISO file that we downloaded as a pen
drive or a USB thumb drive which is
necessary to install an operating system
to provide this you're going to select
use ISO image file we're going to click
on
browse go and go to downloads and select
the IM am so file over
here select
open and we can see it is already loaded
up next in the network adapter it is
recommended to use natat this helps the
virtual machine to draw the internet
from the host machine settings if your
host machine is connected to the
internet then the virtual machine is
connected as well there are some other
options such as host only or custom
segments or land segments but those are
not necessary for installation
rest of them are pretty standard which
do not need any extra configuration and
can be left as it
is press okay and now we can power on
this virtual
machine in this screen we can choose how
we want to proceed with the
installation we have a start installer
option over here so we're going to press
enter on that
we going to wait for the things to load
from the ISO
file um the first step in the
installation is choosing the language of
the operating system for this we can go
with English as
standard this is a location this will be
used for setting up the time and some of
the internal settings which depend
entirely on the location of the user so
for this we're going to go with India
configuring the keyboard it's always
recommended to go with the American
English first many people make a mistake
of going with the Indian keyboard if it
is possible and it provides a lot of
issues later on so it's always preferred
to go with the American English and if
later we see some necessity of another
keyboard dialect that is NE required we
can install it later but for now we
should always stick with American
English as a
basic at this point it's going to load
the installation components from the ISO
file it is a big file of 3.6 GB so it
has a lot of components that need to be
put into the virtual machine which can
also be used to detect
Hardware once the hardware and the
network configuration is done by the ISO
file we have want to write a host name
for the system this host name can be
anything which is used to recognize this
device on a local network or a land
cable let's say if we use the name
Kali domain name we can skip it for now
it's not necessary as such for the
installation this is the full name for
the
user let's say we can provide the name
as simply learn as a full
name next we going to set up a username
this username is going to be necessary
to identify the user from its root
accounts and the subsequent below
accounts for now we can give it as
something as simply one to
three now we have to choose a password
for the user now remember since this is
the first user that is being added onto
this newly installed operating system it
needs to be a password for the
administrator we can use whichever
password we like over here
and use the same password below and
press on
continue at this point it's going to
detect on the components on which the
operating system can be
installed like here there are multiple
options like the use entire disk use
entire dis and set up lvm use entire dis
and set up encrypted lvm for newcomers
it is recommended to just use the first
one since lvm encryption is something
that you can learn afterwards when
you're much more handson with the Linux
operating system for now we're going to
use the use entire dis guided
installation and press on
continue when we set up the virtual
machine on VMware we had set up a dis
capacity that we gave a prose 20gb that
is the hard disk which is being
discovered here even though it is a
virtual dis on VMR it acts as a normal
hard disk on which an operating system
can be installed so we select this one
and press on continue
here there is a multiple partition
system all the operating systems that
are installed have different components
one is used for the a keeping of the
applications one for the files other for
the RAM management and other things for
newcomers it is always recommended to
keep it in one
partition and we going to select that
and press on
continue this is just an overview of the
partition it's going to make as you can
see it has a primary partition of 20.4
GB and a logical partition of 1 GB used
for swap memory now these kind of naming
can be confusing for people who are not
well versed with Linux operating systems
or in general virtualization but for now
you can go ahead and press on continue
as this will be fine we can press on
finish partitioning and write changes to
disk and
continue it's just a confirmation page
as you can see it's WR that scsi3 is our
virtual hard disk of 20gp disc capacity
we write the changes to the disk we
press yes and click on
continue at this point the installation
has started now this installation will
take a while depending on the amount of
ram provided the processors provided and
how quickly the performance of the
system is being hampered by the host
machine on quicker systems this will be
rather quick while on the smaller ones
this will take a
while since this is going to take some
time to install as it is being run on a
virtual machine with only 2 GB of RAM
we're going to speed up this part of the
video so we don't have to waste any more
time just watching the progress
PA now that our core installation is
completed it's asking us to configure a
package manager the work of a package
manager on Linux operating system is
similar to the Google Play Store on
Android mobile devices and on the app
store for the Apple
devices it's an interface to install
external applications which are not
installed by default let's say for
Google Chrome or any other browser which
can be used to browse the
internet at this point of time it's ask
us to select a network mirror we're
going to select as yes and move forward
with this next
it's going to ask us for HTTP proxy
which we can leave it as blank and press
it as continue
forward at this point of time it's
looking for updates to the Kali Linux
installation this will fetch the new
builds from the Kali server so the
installation is always updated to the
latest
version now that the package manager is
configured we have the grub bootloader
the grub is used for selecting the
operating system while boot up its core
functionality is to allow the operating
system to be loaded correctly without
any faults so at this point of time if
it ask install the grab boot loader to
your primary dive we can select this as
yes and press
continue remember the installation was
conducted on dev
SDA so we're going to select
installation of the gr loader on the
same hard disk that we have
configured we press this one and press
continue
so now the grub bootloader is being
installed the grub is highly essential
because it it shows the motherboard
where to start the operating system from
even if the operating system is
installed correctly and all the files
are in correct order the absence of a
boot loader will not be able to launch
the OS
properly as you can see the installation
is finally complete so now we can press
on continue
and it's going to finalize the
changes now you can see K Linux being
booted up straight away it doesn't check
for the ISO file anymore since the
operating system is now installed onto
the virtual hard disk storage that we
had configured
before here we're going to enter our
username and password that we had set up
before and we have the colu system
booted
up and this is your homepage we can see
the installed applications over here
which are being used for penetration
testing by multiple security analysts
roll
right all of these come pre-installed
with K Linux and others can be installed
using the AP package manager that we had
configured you can see a full name over
here and with this our installation of
the K Linux is complete hi everyone I'm
abar and today we are going to explore a
world with the biggest dramas don't
happen in movies they happen in the
digital networks that are shops
companies and governments rely on every
day let's start with a true story from
2017 in Atlanta a busting City just like
many others one morning Atlanta was hit
by a ransomware attack a type of cyber
threat where hackers lock up important
data and demand money to release it this
attack froze the city's most essential
Services people couldn't pay their bills
code documents were inaccessible and the
city struggled to operate normally it
was chaos this real life event shows us
just how powerful and damaging cyber
pcts can be they don't just affect
computers they disrupt lives and can
bring entire cities to a standstill
today we are going to dive deeper into
this Hidden World of digital dangers and
learn about the top 10 cyber attacks
that have shaken communities and Nations
so let's uncover these epic Tales of
cyber intrusions learn about their
massive impacts and see how they have
revolutionized cyber security practices
worldwide and before commencing guys
just a quick info for you starting with
number 10 on the list hland payment
systems and it acted in 2008 so in 2008
hurtland Payment Systems fell victim to
one of the largest fishing scams at that
time fishing a technique where cyber
criminals disguised their malicious
intent with seemingly legitimate
requests deceived unsuspecting victims
into believing they were interacting
with a trusted entity the attackers
managed to Infiltrate The System and
steal sensitive information leading to
the unauthorized excess of 100 million
credit and debit card numbers the
aftermath was severe with hurtland
shouldering $140 million in Damages and
facing a long road to rebuild trust and
enhance the security measures moving to
number nine China's Google attacks a
covert operation in 2009 targeted
Chinese humanitarian activist
compromising their Google accounts to
monitor their Communications the breach
extended Beyond activist affecting
individuals in multiple countries
highlighting the global reach of cyber
Espionage investigators link the breach
to a mix of fishing and malware which
allowed hackers to gather information
this incident underscores the critical
need for vigilance in digital
Communications and the importance of
reporting anomalies promptly to prevent
widespread data compromise and number
eight on the list is PlayStation Network
in 2011 the PlayStation Network suffered
a massive breach when hackers assessed
77 million user accounts exposing
sensitive information including credit
card details the attack persisted for
nearly a month leading to an estimated
$2 million in Damages and significant
downtime for users this breach not only
disrupted Sony's services but also had a
detrimental impact on the product
launches serving as a stockk reminder of
the enduring consequences of cyber
vulnerabilities and number seven on the
list is City Group despite being one of
the largest banks globally City group
experienced a significant security laps
in 2011 when over 200,000 customer
accounts were compromised hackers
exploited simple vulnerabilities in the
bank's website to impersonate legitimate
users and navigate through its security
measures undetected by the time the
breach was discovered sensitive data
including card numbers and personal
information had already been sold the
delay in notifying affected customers
only versen the Public's trust and City
Group this incident highlights the
importance of robust cyber security
measures and the need for Swift action
and transparency in the face of security
breaches now coming to number six that
is Target company in 2013 target became
the victim of a massive Cyber attack
when malware was injected into their
point of sale that is p systems this
type of software is specifically
designed by hackers to disrupt and gain
unauthorized access to computer systems
during the bustling holiday season
Ukrainian hackers managed to extract
customer information and sell it on the
digital Black Market Market leading to
significant financial threats to
millions of Americans This breach
vividly demonstrated that even robust
internal systems could have hidden
weaknesses rip for exploitation now
coming to number five the company is
Yahoo yaho once a giant in email and web
services faced a severe reputation hit
between 2013 and 2014 due to multiple
security breaches these incidents
compromise the personal details of 500
million users initially with a later
Revelation that up to 3 billion accounts
were affected in total sensitive
information such as email addresses
passwords and security questions were
stolen Yahoo's delayed disclosure of
these breaches until 2016 resulted in a
$35 million fine and over 40 class
action lawsuits ultimately costing the
company $350 million in Damages now
coming to number four Home Depot
following in the unfortunate footsteps
of Target Home Depot experienced a
similar reach in 2014 hackers gained the
access to the company's PS systems by
masquerading as legitimate vendors this
breach compromised the data of 50
million card holders the attackers used
Mal entering through a vendor
credentials to infiltrate Home Depot's
Network although Home Depot denied
liability the incident prompted them to
overhaul the data security measures
significantly now coming to number three
Experian Experian a major credit
reporting agency found itself in a cyber
crisis in 2015 this situation began
unraveling after the acquisition of
Court ventures in 2012 which already had
a contract with us search info allowing
broad access to personal data this lapse
in oversight led to the sale of
sensitive data to an identity theft rank
affecting 50 million users the breach
highlighted the critical importance of
stringent data usage policies and
contract reviews in mergers and
Acquisitions now coming to number second
that is Snapchat Snapchat known for its
epimeral messaging service faced a stark
violation of user privacy in 2015 when
hackers assessed 4.6 million accounts
they extracted phone numbers locations
and usernames the hackers had previously
War Snapchat about the security flow
demanding it to be fixed when the
concerns were ignored they published the
data publicly as a form of retaliation
this incident underscores the importance
of addressing security vulnerab ities
promptly to protect user privacy now
coming to the number one sport that is
Facebook Facebook the social media giant
faced significant scrutiny in 2018 that
marked a pivotal point in public
perception about privacy and data
management that year Federal
investigations uncovered how Facebook
allowed third-party apps broad access to
user data without stringent oversight
this laps led to multiple breaches
affecting between 50 to 80 million users
the most most infamous of these was the
Cambridge analytica scandal with data
from millions of Facebook users was
improperly accessed to influence voter
behavior these Revelations fueled Global
debates about privacy and the ethical
responsibilities of tech Giants leading
to calls for stricter data protection
regulation worldwide Facebook's handling
of user data not only eroded trust among
its user base but also invited tighter
scrutiny from Regulators reshaping how
social media platforms manage and
protect user information as we have seen
through these incidents the digital
world is a Battleground where
information is both the weapon and the
price staying informed and Vigilant is
our best defense against these evolving
threats thank you for joining us as you

making it a major challenge for
organizations and if we talk about some
of the breaches so in 2020 over 36
billion records were exposed due to data
breaches and the infamous Equifax breach
of 2017 where 147 million people's
information was compromised highlights
the importance of regular security

below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back and just a quick info for you guys
if you are an aspiring cybercity
professional looking for online training
and certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security from M University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
your right choice for more details you
can use the link in the description box
and mid comment so let's get started so
guys this is Chad GPT and and this is
the paid version of Chad GPD 40 and what
I was telling you is this is the explore
GPD section so here you can find all the
gpts that are created by Chad GPT open
AI or the individuals or you can find
the companies who have created gpts so
you can found these are the recently
used and this is the most used hacker
GPT you can find other gpts also that is
hacker GPT and you could see that and
they have been used by 5,000 plus users
and this have been used by 10,000 plus
users so you can just search for ethical
hacker gbt here and it has been rated
4.5 Stars 10,000 plus conversations and
these are the conversation status if you
need any assistance and the capabilities
you can see here and the ratings given
by users and more by the Creator who has
created this so we'll start with this
we'll start the chat here and I want to
tell you guys that chat G doesn't answer
non ethical questions so if you try to
extract that information from chat jpt
that won't be possible but we can do a
bit like we can cross a bit line with
ethical hacker GPT but that should be
used for ethical purposes only so I will
show you guys how you can utilize this
GPT and one more thing guys if you want
to create your own GPT you can also
create that also you can go to explore
gbt section and here's the create option
click on Create and here you can start
creating your gbt if you click on
configure you can write the name of your
GPT description instructions and the
conversation starters as you just saw
with the hacker gbt ethical hacker gbt
and the capabilities what you want to be
enabled you could do that and here in
the create section you could write the
prompts here and it will take that
information and use it for more purposes
and here you could attach more files
that could help create your gbd okay
guys so here you could see the
configuration and the preview of your
GPT and you can finalize that so moving
back we'll get back to ethical hacker
GPT and start with our conversation with
him so starting with the first thing we
can do is we can ask him like how can I
perform a basic security assessment on a
web application so if I tell you guys
performing a basic security assessment
on a web application is crucial for
identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring
the application is secure and this
process involves using various tools and
techniques to test the application for
common security issues so you could ask
him that how can I
perform a basic
security assessment on a web
application and just
wait for a few seconds and you could
have the response from ethical hacker
gvd so you could see that performing a
basic security assessment on a web
application involves several key steps
and these are the key steps number one
is preparation and information gathering
and how you can do that these are the
steps identify the scope gather
information then is the Second Step that
is reconnaissance and you can use the
tools BB suit ncto and others similarly
you could see all the steps here so I
won't be guiding or I won't be reading
what responses are generated by ethical
he gbt I have used that and he provides
very accurate like I would say around 95
to 96% accurate results here I want to
show you guys how you can utilize it so
I will show you prompts and what things
you can ask him so this was all about
repeat so this was about the general
security thing now we'll move to ethical
hacking and we can ask him how we can
perform a SE equal injection attack
ethically on a test environment so these
are the prompts that you can write that
would be how do I perform a SQL
injection attack and that to ethically
if you write this that would be good on
a test
environment and if I tell you guys so
SQL injection is one of the most common
web application vulnerabilities and
understanding how to perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment can help you identify and
mitigate this risk in your own
applications and you could see he has
responded and he has provided you the
steps that you can set up a control test
environment first thing then preparation
and you could use these tools then you
have the manual SQL injection testing so
these are the methods that you could use
that is or or 1 equal to 1 for the
database and automated SQL injection
testing so this is the command for that
and you could verify vulnerability
documentation reporting so you could see
that this GPD is capable of answering
the basic questions as we have discussed
the basics question till now now we'll
move to scripting and automation so here
you could see how he respond to this so
we'll ask him can you provide a python
script to scan open ports on a
network so let's see what
he
provides provide a python
script and that to to scan
ports on a
network so scanning open ports on
network is a fundamental step in
identifying potential vulnerabilities
and a python script that can automate
this process making it easier to
regularly check for open ports and
secure them so this is the python script
you can use any ID and Run net
and you could see that he's explaining
the code also yeah you can ask him like
can you explain the code line by line
and this hacker gbt will do that for you
and how to run the script that also he
has provided you and similarly we can
also ask him that how we can write a
bash script to Monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and if you
want I can also run this prompt how do I
write
uh bash
script and that do to
Monitor and log unauthorized
access unauthorized login
attempts so we can monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and that
would be essential for maintaining the
security of your system so as you can
see he has written a Bash script and
that can help you automate this process
and this will provide real time alerts
and logs for further analysis and you
could see that he's providing the
explanation and how you can run the
script and he's writing the note also
like you can write more prompts if you
have any doubts in any of the script or
any of the responses that hacker GPT has
responded and he will definitely provide
you with good responses so now moving on
now we'll ask this ethical hacker GPD
about some specific security tools and
we could ask him about BB suit and so
let's write a prompt can you
explain how to
configure and use bub
suit or we can write for web application
testing
so if I sum you up so BB suit is a
powerful tool for web application
security testing and understanding how
to configure and use it effectively can
help you identify and address a wide
range of security vulnerabilities in
your applications so you could see he
has provided the initial steps that
would be downloading and installing BB
suit configuring your browser to use BB
suit as a proy and then intercept and
inspect traffic and then you can use it
for testing purpose logging and
Reporting and tips for Effective testing
so this is the response for the security
tools and if we talk about incent
response we can ask him to write a
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so collecting system
logs is a critical part of incident
response and forensic analysis and this
script can automate processes that can
ensure that you have all the necessary
data to investigate security incidents
effectively so if I write here
we can ask this hacker GPT and I'm sure
he will provide the response for that
and write the script
so can you provide a
script to collect system
logs for forensic
analysis so as I told you this is the
critical part of incident response and
we have covered about the tools that is
BB suit we have asked him about the
automation process General cyber
security question ethical hacking that
would be SQL injection attack and the
python script tools can open ports on a
network so he can write scripts also
automation task and he could response
with the general cyber security
questions also and if you see here for
the incident response he has writed the
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so I won't be
explaining this code
as we just looking for the prompts that
we can give to ethical he gbt if you
want you could just ask him also that
explain this code line by line and here
he has mentioned also the explanation
that is directories and files to collect
and after that he is collecting the logs
and that would be copied in the
directory that is he has mentioned it a
variable that is output directory
archiving logs clean up and how to run
the script so this was about the
incident response Now we move to some
Advanced topics and in advanced topics
what we can ask him is he how to perform
a man in the- Middle attack in a
controlled environment and remember this
that you have to mention some of the
keywords that would be in a controlled
environment and for that thing only he
will response or provide the response to
you so I will start here that how do I
perform um m and in
the middle
attack in a controlled
environment so if you understand man in
the middle attack that works in a
controlled environment this can help you
develop better defenses against such
attacks and it's important to learn and
practice these techniques ethically so
you can see here that he's providing the
prerequisites and the stepbystep guide
how you can conduct a man in the middle
attack so first is set up the control
environment then install necessary tools
enable IP forwarding perform ARP
spoofing and then capture and analyze
traffic clean up and restore the network
and conclusion so you could just follow
up with more prompts that I want more
information about setting up the control
environment just write this prompt and
this ethical hacker GPT will provide
more responses to you so he will provide
you how you can set up the control
environment so now moving on we will ask
some more prompts and that would be
about the reverse engineering so we
could ask him that can you explain the
processes of reverse engineering a
malware sample or we can also ask about
honey port to detect malicious activity
that could be how can I Implement a
honey port to detect malicious activity
or what are the techniques for securing
a Docker container so we'll ask him one
prompt here let's see what he responds
to that so how can
I Implement
a honey port to detect malicious
activity so you could see that he has
started responding to that and and if I
tell you the sum so a honey Port is a
security mechanism set to detect deflect
or in mechanism to some Manner and it
counteract attempts at unauthorized use
of Information Systems implementing a
honey Port can help you Monitor and
understand attack patterns and this is
the step-by-step guide to implement a
honey Port you can choose the type of
Honey Port prepare your environment
install and configure the hyport
software and these are all the commands
how you can configure it then you can
monitor and analyze the Honeypot and
regular maintenance and updates and this
is the simple hyport using honey you
could install that and run these
commands so with that guys and in the
last we'll also cover cyber security
policies and compliance so he could also
answer to those prompts also that you
can ask him that what should be included
in a company cyber security policy and
you could mention which type of company
you are running
so I will ask him that so you could ask
him that what should be
included in know uh at tech
companies cyber security
policy so let's
see so you could see here that creating
comprehensive security policy for an
atte company invols adding various
aspects and that would be introduction
first is the purpose for cber security
policy scope roles and responsibilities
data protection and privacy Network
Security application security user
security awareness and training incident
response and management compliance and
legal requirements physical security
device and endpoint security so
similarly you could ask him that draft
me the company's cyber security policy
and start with the introduction so he
will provide you all the introduction
points and then you can ask him that
draft roles and responsibilities he will
draft that also so you could like break
it into parts and ask the ethical hacker
gbt and he will respond to you as it has
some limitations of some words and some
of the responses so you could ask him in
the breaking parts and he will respond
to you today we will see the starting
journey in cyber security that is super
exciting but can can be a bit daunting
so to help you out we are going to talk
about some common mistakes that
beginners often make and how you can
avoid them if you're just getting
started or looking to improve your
skills this guide will set you on the
right path so let's dive in and make
sure your cyber security career gets off
to a strong start so let's get started
and we'll see the worst beginner cyber
security mistakes everyone makes and
we'll start with the number one point
that is ignoring Basics so many
beginners rush into advanced topics
without mastering the basics which can
lead to confusion and frustration later
on it's essential to build a strong
Foundation before diving into complex
subjects if we talk about number one is
understanding networking networking is
the backbone of cyber security learn how
data travels across networks different
types of networks like Lan and Van and
basic networking protocols knowing how
Network protocol functions help you
understand how attacks occur and how to
defend against them then comes mastering
operating systems so operating systems
are another critical area whether it's
Windows Linux or Mac OS you need to know
how different OS work and learn about
file systems user management and basic
command line skills so this knowledge is
crucial for tasks like malual analysis
and system hardening then comes the
basic coding skills so coding is an
invaluable skill in cyber security you
can start with a simple language like
Python and learn how to write scripts to
automate task analyze data and
understand the logic behind software
vulnerabilities so basic coding skills
will help you comprehend how attacks are
carried out and how to develop counter
measures so taking the time to master
these Basics will make advanced topics
much easier to understand and will set a
solid foundation for your career in
cyber security so remember it's a
journey and starting with the basics
will ensure you build strong lasting
knowledge now we'll come to number
second point that is skipping hands on
practice so this is also one of the
cyber security mistakes that beginners
make cyber security isn't just about
Theory practical experience is crucial
and many beginners Focus too much on
reading and studying without applying
what they have learned this creates a
gap between knowledge and Real World
skills so the number one point here is
setting up a home lab so create a home
lab with an old computer or virtual
machine to practice what you learn
install different operating systems
systems set up networks and simulate
attacks in a controlled environment then
comes real world scenarios so use your
home lab to practice real world
scenarios like configuring fireballs and
detecting intrusions platforms like hack
the box and try hack me offer cyber
security challenges that mimic real life
networks and systems then comes building
confidence so Hands-On practice builds
confidence so solving real problems and
seeing the results of your actions make
you more comfortable with cyber security
tools and techniques and this confidence
is crucial when making quick informed
decision in this field so gaining
practical experience Bridges the gap
between theory and practice making you a
more effective and confident cyber
security professional so now we'll see
the third mistake that cyber security
beginners make that is lack of
documentation so documenting your work
is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect
of cyber security many beginners Focus
solely on learning new skills and
solving problems without keeping track
of their progress however good
documentation practices can
significantly enhance your learning
experience and by keeping detailed notes
on what you learn the tools you use and
the methods you apply you create a
valuable resource for future reference
and this habit helps you review and
reinforce your knowledge making it
easier to remember complex Concepts
additionally well-documented work allows
you to share your insights and solutions
with others whether through through
blogs presentations or team
collaborations it also helps in
troubleshooting as you can quickly
revisit your steps to identify where
something might have gone wrong so in
the professional World documentation is
essential for maintaining clear and
efficient communication within a team
and by starting this practice early you
will develop a habit that will benefit
you throughout your career and now we'll
move to the fourth cyber security
mistake for beginners that is waiting
too long to start applying for jobs so
mistake many beginners make is waiting
until they feel perfectly qualified
before applying for cyber security jobs
this approach can be counterproductive
the truth is you might never feel
completely ready and waiting too long
can cause you to miss out on an valuable
opportunity so start applying for jobs
early in your Learning Journey the
process of applying and interviewing is
a learning experience in itself it helps
you understand what employers are
looking for and it can highlight areas
where you need to improve so early job
applications also provide you with real
world feedback and networking
opportunities remember many entry-level
positions are designed for people who
are still learning and growing in this
field so employers often value
enthusiasm willingness to learn and
problem solving skills as much as they
do technical knowledge so by starting
early you can gain experience and build
confidence even if you are not yet
perfectly qualified and then comes the
next mistake that is trying to qualify
for all jobs so in the vast field of
cyber security trying to qualify for
every job out there is a common but
misguided approach cyber security
encompasses a wide range of specialities
from network security and ethical
hacking to incident response and
security analysis instead of spreading
yourself thin trying to learn everything
focus on a key few areas and become
proficient in them specializing in
special Fields make you more valuable to
potential employers it's better to be an
exper expert in one or two areas than to
have superficial knowledge in many so by
focusing on specific skills you can
develop a better understanding and
expertise that sets you apart from
others so this focused approach also
makes it easier to stay updated with the
latest trends and advancements in your
choosen areas remember depth of
knowledge often outweighs bread when it
comes to career advancement and job
satisfaction so this was all about
trying to qualify for all jobs now see
the biggest mistake that is it
Foundation fallacy so many aspiring
service Security Professionals believe
they need a deep it background to start
their career this is same as the number
one point but this is a misconception
while having a solid foundation in it
can be beneficial it's not a
prerequisite for success in cyber
security what you need other specific
skills and practical experience focus on
learning about networks operating system
and security tools engag in Hands-On
practice through labs and simulation to
build Real World skills cyber security
is a field where practical knowledge and
the ability to apply Concepts matter
more than theoretical it knowledge and
many successful cyber Security
Professionals come from diverse
backgrounds including those with minimal
it experience so they succeed by
continuing learning and adapting to New
Challenges so don't let the lack of deep
it Foundation hold you back concentrate
on gaining the skills and experience
that are directly relevant to the cyber
security roles you are interested in now
moving to number seven that is not
attending cyber security events so
attending cyber security events is one
of the best ways to stay updated and
connected in the field these events
including conferences webinars and
meetups offer a wealth of information on
the latest trends tools and threats in
cyber security they provide a platform
to learn from experts gain insights into
industry developments and discover new
technologies additionally these events
are excellent networking opportunities
meeting other professionals that can
lead to job opportunities collaborations
and mentorship building a network within
the cyber security Community can provide
support and guidance throughout your
career and many events also offer
Hands-On workshops and training sessions
that can enhance your practical skills
so by actively participating in these
events you can demonstrate your
commitment to continuous learning and
professional development make it a habit
to attend cyber security events
regularly to stay engaged and informed
so this was all about number seventh
point that is not not attending cyber
security events now moving to number
eight that is obsessing or which
specialization to choose so when
starting a career in cyber security many
beginners obsess over which
specialization to choose this can be
overwhelming and counterproductive
instead of stressing about making the
perfect choice allow yourself the
freedom to explore different areas of
cyber security the field is diverse with
specializations like penetration testing
incident Response Security analysis and
more take the time to EXP experiment
with various topics and see what
interest you the most this exploration
phase is valuable for gaining a broad
understanding of this field so over time
you will naturally gravitate toward
areas that align with your strengths and
interest so remember your specialization
can evolve as you gain more experience
and insights early in your career focus
on building a solid foundation and
gaining exposure to different aspects of
cyber security this approach allows you
to make an informed decision about your
specialization when the time comes
