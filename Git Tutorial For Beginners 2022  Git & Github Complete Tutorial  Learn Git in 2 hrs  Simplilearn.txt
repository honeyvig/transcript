hello everyone welcome to this full
course video on git and github by simply
learn in this video you will learn about
one of the most popular version control
systems in detail we have our
experienced instructors matthew anjali
jadanand ishan and anuj who will take
you through this course and help you
learn everything in under 3 hours first
matthew will help you understand the
basics of get and then anjali will help
you with installing git on windows you
will learn about github and look at the
difference between git and github
chidanand will help you learn about some
of the essential git commands then anuj
will make you understand git merge
conflict and how to resolve it finally
we have some critical interview
questions on git over to matthew now
hello this is matthew from simply learn
and today we're going to delve into git
and what it actually is and how it fits
within your devops stack so a little
scenario before using gets one of the
challenges that a lot of developers and
development teams would have had is
developers would be working on different
types of code whether it was database
code whether it was a python or whether
it's java or net and they would have a
central server that they'd be pushing
all of their source code in but there
was little or no communication that was
actually going on in between all the
developers you know the challenge you
had with that scenario is that when
people would be checking in code you
could be like you know there'll be
conflicts and you'd have to roll back
different code versions and this is
really kind of the challenge that git
addresses git is a tool that allows all
of the developers no matter what stack
they're working in to have access to all
of the code and it makes it much more
effective at being able to have
development teams work on small medium
or even massive applications and some of
the biggest applications out there are
managed through a get distributed server
environment
so let's jump into what we'll be
covering so you have a clear
understanding of the value that you're
going to get out of watching this
presentation so we're going to go
through devops and the tools have
available for devops we'll talk about
what version control means within the
devops environment and cover the two
different types of version control
centralized and distributed and then
we're going to zero in on git which is a
really fantastic distributed version
control system and we're going to go
through understand the features workflow
branches and commands in git we can give
you a demo and then summarize all the
activities at the end of the the
presentation so what is devops well this
is one of my favorite questions i love
the idea of what devops is so devops
really is a culture of being able to
deliver solutions faster where your
development teams and your operation
teams work effectively together the idea
is to be able to continuously build out
solutions and have testing codes that's
built into your solutions so that no
matter where they are in the stage of
the integration and deployment life
cycle they're always being tested and
you can always have code being ready to
be released out the idea is that instead
of having big releases that you would
have maybe once every two weeks or once
a month that you would actually have a
continuous stream of releases because
you always have code that is being
tested you have your network that's been
tested you have your environment being
tested and you'll be able to provide
feedback directly to the appropriate
person whether they're in devs or
whether they're in ops to be able to be
successful at being able to deliver
solutions faster the bottom line your
dev team things like operations and your
operations team begin to feel like think
like developers it's really a fantastic
way of being able to speed up delivery
and have your team just think and feel
and act in a different cultural
environment so let's have a look at some
of the tools that are available to you
in devops environments if we look at
devops it's really kind of split into
two areas the dev side you have building
code planning and testing and then on
your upside you have release deployment
operating and monitoring but the tools
really all interact with each other and
what's really great is that the tools
are either open source or very very low
in cost in fact most of the tools you're
seeing in front of you right now are
open source tools which means there's no
licensing to you and you can actually
effectively manage them and implement
them within your team right now so let's
have a look at some of the dev tools
that you have for doing code versioning
and so some of the tools that you may
have used in the past include subversion
team foundation service um and git these
are all different types of version
control software you have out there one
of the oldest ones is subversion it's a
centralized version control system it's
one of the tools i used years ago it
really is good at doing what it's
supposed to do which is just a very
simple version controlled solution it's
open source so it's free and there's no
licensing there are challenges with
working with it because it is a
centralized tool rather than a
distributed tool we'll get into that in
a little bit but for a very basic
virtual control system you know it does
what you wanted to do team foundation
service solutions something that many of
you in microsoft world may be using for
a long time and the thing that's great
about tfs is it's built right into the
microsoft environment it's the server
side the services side of building out
your solutions with microsoft um just
recently in the last couple of weeks at
the beginning of september 2018
microsoft actually just rebranded tfs as
azure devops and so you have azure
pipelines and there are five now azure
tools as you replace tfs but these are
all tools that are very similar in
concept the old tfs tools are very
similar to the centralized svn tools
whereas the new tools that are part of
azure are actually much more aligned
with git so what you're seeing is
microsoft moving from the centralized
server to a distributed server with
their new azure devops tools which is
fantastic news for every developer
listening to this and then we have get
and git is a distributed version control
system it is again open source which
means that you can start using it right
now without fear of having to have any
costs or any penalties and the thing
that's really good about it is that it's
really you can use it for almost any
kind of digital project and what it's
good at is being able to create that
historical record and versioning of your
source code whether you're doing a web
application a mobile application or
you're actually building a python script
for a machine learning solution so let's
dig into what version control systems
are and how they can be of value to you
so the role of version control system is
to allow developers to be able to check
in their files into a repository and
here you can actually see how we can
check in three files into a repository
and that repository then becomes a
snapshot or a historical record of the
files that we're working on and you want
to be able to have it so that the
repository is flexible enough so that as
you want to be able to scale and add in
new files or new versions of a file that
you can actually do that easily within
your vcs environment and the goal is to
be able to constantly have each of these
versions available so that anybody wants
to be able to check out the file can
actually have the latest version or see
a history of how that file became what
it is today let's look at centralized
version control systems and then we'll
compare it against distributed version
control systems so a centralized version
control system has a central server
where all the files are stored and
everybody has to check in and check out
from that centralized server
and all of the versions are managed
within that server environment
the problem is is that if that central
server crashes which doesn't happen but
very often but it can happen you end up
losing all of your files and i was
actually on a project where that
actually happened to us and we lost six
months of history of how the application
was created fortunately for us we
actually had a backup but it didn't have
all the historical data so we were able
to at least continue working but we just
lost a lot of files and it took a while
to get back into place so let's now look
at and compare this to a distributed
version control system with a
distributed version control system you
still have a centralized server that
manages the files but the difference is
is that as a developer you check out all
of the files for a project so you can
actually manage the whole project
locally on your develop machine and make
your changes and then you can just check
in and out the changes that you've made
to the centralized server the
opportunity you have here is that the
server itself if it goes down you're not
going to be in a situation where you
lose all the history because everybody
that's working on the actual application
has all of the versions of the code
locally on their machine
now one of the more popular distributed
version control systems that out there
is git i mean it really is probably the
most popular buyer margin compared to a
system out there so you know let's dig
into you know what actually is git so
git is a version control system for
managing files and as a developer you
have a git client on your machine and
you're able to make changes and create
local repositories of a program on your
computer and then you can sync up with a
remote service such as github or git lab
or the new azure
labs environment where you can actually
store files remotely and then allow
remote teams to have access to
those changes in the actual application
you made so you can track your changes
easily you have it's the the tool is
inherently distributed so it makes it
very easy to manage the code for large
teams and you can bring people in very
quickly and you can have people come in
as specialists and spin them up quickly
and have them work on a piece of the
code and then drop them out of the
project if you want to have a check on
how this works go and start contributing
to um any of the the many thousands of
open source projects at github where you
can go in with your get tools and just
contribute to those projects and then
finally one of the things that i really
like with git is that it's not a linear
development approach it's not starting
from a and going to z it's a non-linear
approach which allows you to have
branches that people are working on in
parallel to your master branch where
people are actually doing the delivery
of the production code so let's step
through some of these features
so git as you can imagine the first
thing it does is track history that's
probably the most important part of
having a version control system it's a
free open source you can actually go and
use it right now there are no costs of
actually using it it is a non-linear
environment that allows people to be
able to build out new features in
parallel to the master branch so that
you can be constantly having the master
code out there without and adding in new
features without breaking the code and
you can automatically create backups by
because each developer has a version of
the code remotely it's incredibly
scalable some of the biggest projects
out there now are being managed through
git and because of this scale the
collaboration becomes a byproduct of
teams working together and branching
just is so much easier within git so as
you can see this whole thing leads to a
very effective distributed environment
so let's step through some of the the
workflow that we have available for git
so the way that git works is that you as
an operator as a developer you have the
get client on your local develop machine
whether it's a linux machine a mac or a
pc and you connect to a remote server
and you pull down the latest working
copy and then you're able to make all of
your changes locally and you can modify
the codes you can review changes and you
can commit those codes to your git
repository that you have locally and
then you can push those changes back up
to the remote server and as soon as you
push them into the remote server those
changes then become available to
everybody else working on the project so
they can be constantly keeping everybody
updated on all the work that is
happening so you know typically the way
that it would work is you know you would
start off with having the working file
working directory that you have locally
then you would stage those files into a
staging area and then you get those
files ready to be committed to your git
repository and these are all actions
that you would do locally and then
connect to a remote server and then
later when you go back into work on your
project the first thing you should
always do is check out that code so you
always have the latest version of the
code and everybody is kept in sync so
let's talk about branching in git so the
way that branches work is that if you
imagine you're working on a project and
projects always have a tendency of
getting bigger than you imagine and what
you want to be able to do is keep that
main product working and keeping it
working effectively but if you want to
be able to add a feature to that product
you may have two or three different
groups that are working on multiple
features
simultaneously and what you want to be
able to do is give them the freedom to
work on those individual features and
the way you do it in git is that you can
create branches off the master and while
you're off the the main branch which is
called the master and so each person can
be working on their own separate branch
and then when they want to they can then
later merge those branches back into the
main master and all this time the main
master still works and still able to
produce the right code for the customer
but at the same time it allows the
developers the freedom to be able to
write in their new features and so we
can look at this in a little bit more
visually with the master branch and we
can put in small features of large
features and we can then merge them back
as we need to so this kind of covers
some of the commands that we have in git
so the first command you'd want to use
is called git init and that's allow you
to go into a folder on your local pc and
or your local mac and convert that file
that folder into a local git repository
and that creates that repository then
you want to be able to make changes to
that repository and the commands you'd
be using in this instance would be add
commit or status and you want to be able
to sync your repositories with the
remote server so be able to put the code
that you have on your computer on the
remote server you just push you know get
the code from the remote server you use
pull and then add origin and then if you
want to do parallel development from the
master branch the main branch you would
use branch merge or rebase as ways to be
able to do parallel development
a very warm welcome to all our viewers
i'm anjali from simply learn and today
i'll be showing you the installation for
git on windows so we'll start by
downloading and installing git on our
system we'll then have a look at the git
bash interface we'll type in some basic
git commands next we'll create a local
repository that is we'll create a
repository on a local machine we'll then
connect to a remote repository and
finally we'll push the file onto github
first things first we need to download
and install git so download git for
windows and i'll select the second link
so 2.19 2.19.1 which is the most latest
version of kit that's the one we want
for windows system choose your version
so mine is a 64-bit system and it's
downloading so this will take a while so
git is finally downloaded now we need to
install this on our system
click here
run
so go to next we don't have to change
this path
uh just so just click on in quick launch
and on desktop
next
next again next nothing to change here
either
and install
so now git is getting installed on our
system
so we don't need to view the release
notes we just want to launch the git
bash
so let's just tick that and then click
on finish
and your git bash interface appears here
so we are on the master branch the first
thing we do is we'll check the version
for our git so the command is git dash
dash version
and as you can see version 2.19.1
on our windows system which is exactly
what we just downloaded we'll now
explore the help command so let's just
type git help config so config is
another command and as i hit enter the
manual page for the second command
opened up which is config so what help
command does is that it provides the
manual or the help page for the command
just following it
so in case you have any doubts regarding
how a command is used what a command is
used for or the various syntax of the
command you can always use the help
command now there's another syntax for
using the help command itself which is
git config dash dash help enter this
does the exact same thing as you can see
now that we looked at the help command
let's begin by creating a local
directory so mkdir
test
now test is my new directory i'll move
into this directory so cd test
great so now that we are inside our test
directory let's initialize this
directory so git
init is the command for initializing the
directory and as you can see as you can
see the path here this is the local path
where a directory is created so i'll
just show you the directory test and
it's completely empty
what we do now is we'll create a text
file within this new directory that we
created so new text document and i'll
just name this demo i'll open this and
just put in some dummy content so hello
simply done
save this file and go back to your bash
interface
let's just check the status now so git
status and as you can see our file has
appeared it's visible but nothing is
committed yet so this means that we have
not made any change to a file through
the get tool itself so the next thing
that we are going to do is we'll be
adding demo to our current directory the
next command that we'll be applying is
the commit command and when you add
certain files to the current directory
the comment command is applied on all
the above directories so git commit
minus m and a message that will appear
once the file is committed
so as you can see one file is changed
and one insertion
i'll just clear the screen next thing we
need to do is we need to link our git to
our github account so the command for
doing that is git config
global
user dot username
and this will be followed by our
username so let me just show you my
github account so this is my github
profile and my username is
simplylearn.github so guys before you
begin this procedure just make a github
account type in my username here simply
learn github and enter and there you go
a git is successfully linked with github
next thing we do is we'll just open our
github
and we'll create a new repository give a
repository name so i'll name it test
underscore demo and create repository
great so our repository is created this
is our remote repository what we do next
is just copy the link and then go back
to your bash interface
we need to link our remote and our local
repository
so get remote origin and then paste
the http link and now that our local
repository and our remote repository are
linked we can push our local file onto
our remote repository so the command for
doing that is git
push origin master as we are on the
master branch
and that's done so now let's move back
to github i'll just click on test demo
and as you can see here our local file
has been pushed to our remote repository
with that we have successfully completed
our demo if you have any queries
regarding this please post them in the
comment section below and we'll get back
to you as soon as possible and now we're
going to go through and do a demo on git
so we're going to do a demo on git so
you can feel comfortable running the
commands in the interface and you're
able to get get running correctly in
your environment so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to set
up which version of git that you have
and then we're going to see if we can
establish some global configurations
within your git environment and we're
going to do sandeep.dash as the name the
email address is sandeep.simplyline and
then we're going to do a list of the
different configuration settings we have
so to check the version of git that we
have we do
get dash dash version in our terminal or
command line window you can also use
powershell that'll actually get you
running in the same environment as well
all of these tools are going to be
command line tools and then the next
thing we're going to do is we're going
to assign some global usernames and a
global email address and so that we can
actually access the get account itself
locally on the device and so we're going
to dash and we're going to put in config
dash dash global user dot name sandeep
and then a git config
global globaluser.email
and
sandeep.d at simplylearn.net
and now we're going to check the list of
usernames and email ids in our
configuration environment with dash list
and you'll see that we have everything
in there correctly here is our username
right here and our name and our email id
so if you need any help when you're
actually doing any of your work in get
all you have to do is to get help config
or git config dash help and this will
allow you to actually get access to the
help screens so let's just go and type
that in get help config return and this
takes us to the help page that's running
locally on your device and here we have
a breakdown of all the different
commands and what those commands
actually do within a git configuration
and we can go ahead and we can do git
config dash dash help and that will
actually take us to the same page so two
ways of doing the same thing so we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
create a test repository on our local
system and we're going to do that with
make directory called test and then
we're going to move our cursor within
command window terminal window to the
test folder and then we're going to
initialize that folder to become a get
repository so let's go ahead and do that
so we're going to make a new directory
and we're going to call it test and
we're going to move the cursor so it's
actually in the test folder we do cd
change directory to test and you can see
now we're actually in the test folder
and now what you have to do is
initialize this folder as a git
repository and so we're going to do this
as git init and it's now a new git
instance that we can actually now use
for managing our git environment so
we're going to create a new file and
we're going to call it info.txt and
we're going to put some content in it
and we're actually going to put it in
the folder that we've just created so
you can actually see what it's like to
test out the get environment with a file
that hasn't been checked into it yet so
let's go ahead and do that so we open up
our folder directory and here you can
see we have the test folder and we're
just going to go ahead and create a
default test file so right click text
new document info.txt open that and
we'll just you can put really whatever
you want in here we're just going to put
in this information right now name
equals sam registration number uh one
two
four seven nine and save that file close
it out now if we actually go ahead and
run a get status command you'll see that
the info.txt file is in red that's
because that file has not actually been
checked into the project it's a new file
that we've added but hasn't been
committed yet into the git repository so
let's go ahead and see what it takes to
actually add the file to the git
repository that we just created so we're
going to do that by doing get add
info.txt and then we're going to commit
that into the history of that git
repository so we can do so it now has a
version control and we can start doing
uh forking and other kind of similar
activities when we connect later to our
github git environment so we do get add
info.txt and remember we're actually
still in the test folder so it's going
to look for that file in that folder and
just add it in and now if we go ahead
and do git status we'll actually be able
to see that the info.txt file is in
an active color first of all we have to
commit it so we go get commit dash m and
then we're going to commit and we add in
some quick text you can write whatever
you want committing the text file it's
now actually committed into the git
repository and it's all running locally
on your pc so we're gonna go make some
changes to the file and we're gonna save
it and we want to be able to see how we
can use git to compare the differences
between the two files so let's go over
and we're gonna make some changes to the
info.txt file here we are here's
info.txt which is going to add in a new
line we're going to add in the line
address and we're going to save that
file and now when we go over to get
we're going to be able to review the
difference so we're going to do git def
and here you actually see that we've
added in a new address file so now you
can actually see this is the difference
and the difference between the two
documents now as you can imagine when
you have code this would become more
elaborate where you will show you code
that's been pulled out if you've reduced
any of eliminating code or if you added
a new code really useful so we're going
to go ahead and add our get username to
a remote location so we can actually
start testing out the
file that we've created into a remote
repository in this case we're going to
use github and you'll be able to see how
we can actually then save that file into
a git repository that somebody else
could then access and be able to make
edits to so let's just go ahead and make
those changes so get config dash global
user dot username and we'll do simply
learn and that will associate it with
this
git repository that we've just created
locally so simply on github so simply
learn github is the username that we use
on github so we're going to go over to
github here we are in github and then
correct new repository
and then as you can see with simp so
we're in simplylearn.github and we're
going to call the new proprietary test
we're going to make it public so anybody
can access it and you'll see that it
automatically adds a readme file and we
have our test environment set up
correctly so we'll go ahead and copy the
url link which is github.com simply
learn dash github forward slash test.get
copy that and we'll go back over to our
command line window and so now we're
going to add the username to the github
configuration so what we're doing is
we're connecting the local repository to
the remote repository so we type get
remote add origin and then we'll paste
in the address and this then allows us
to connect the local repository that we
created in the test folder with the
remote repository and now we're
connected so now that we've connected we
can actually push the file that you have
in the local repository on your pc or
mac to the remote repository in the
github server environment so let's go
ahead and do that so we do get push and
push is the command to push the
documents from the origin which is the
local file to master and master the
remote file hey and there we are success
so what we have now is the file that we
just created in our local get repository
is actually now in the remote repository
as well so anybody can access it so
let's go have a look at that so we're
going to refresh the github page and hey
there we are there's info.txt
has been uploaded and we're ready to go
that's great that's uh that's what you
should be seeing so refreshing your web
page on the remote github folder and it
could be any get service but just happen
to be using github because it's free to
use you'll be able to see that the local
file has been installed and is now part
of the get repository in the remote
server so what we're going to do now is
we're going to create three more files
and we're just going to call them
info.txt info 2 and info 3. and then
we're going to push them out to the
remote server and we're going to merge
everything together into a single
environment so let's go ahead and create
those three files and we're just going
to add those into the folder so let's go
ahead create new text document info 1
and then we're going to create info 2
and then info
three look at my typing right here okay
here we go there we are
okay i'm opening info three and i'm just
gonna enter some text in here and what
we're gonna do is illustrate how we can
do branching and each of these files i'm
gonna save and then close out and now i
can go over and so let's create a new
branch and we're going to call this one
first underscore branch there we go git
branch first underscore branch and this
will be a new branch of the code
environment that we're creating and so
hit return and that allows us to create
a new branch and so what we do is we're
going to move to the new branch so we're
going to do git checkout first
underscore branch and that allows us to
move into that branch and you see that
info.txt is already there which is good
that's what we want to see now what we
need to do is
add in the new documents so here we have
the different steps we've taken we
created a branch we moved to the new
branch and now we're going to go ahead
and add the info 3 txt to that branch so
you can actually see everything coming
together and we're going to go at get
add info three dot txt so we're just
adding a file like we were previously
with our initialization our first
initial git folder and that file has now
been added to the first branch so we're
going to go ahead and commit the file to
the first branch and then we're going to
merge the documents into the master
branch so we have everything together so
let's go ahead and do those steps we're
going to do the commit first and then
we're going to merge everything together
all right so we do get commit dash m and
we just put in we're just going to say
uh made changes to
first branch and that's just uh
documentation so that we know what we've
done and there we are we've uh committed
the file so we had
that file info 3 txt committed and now
we're going to go ahead and merge the
files into the
main master and so we can actually have
everything together as one consistent
environment and we do that by typing in
so this lists out what we have in our
master file so we just do ls and that
shows everything in the folder and we
have info.txt
info 1 txt info 2 txt and info 3 txt are
now all in the first branch so let's go
ahead and we're going to merge okay so
actually before we merge we have to
check out the master branch so we do get
checkout master so it gets us into the
master branch and you'll see that we
have just one file there info.txt so
we're going to list out the files in the
master branch and so so what you'll see
is info.txt info one text and info two
texts are there but info dot info three
text isn't there because that was
created in a separate bunch so let's go
ahead and merge the first branch into
the master branch so we do get merge and
we do first underscore branch and there
we are we've merged it in and
excellent that looks good so let's go
ahead and list out the files that we
have in the master branch and we do ls
and then you'll see that we have four
files including the info three dot text
that we had in a separate branch now all
in the master branch in this session we
will have a look at the basics of github
before diving deep into the subject
let's first have a look at a use case
the used case we will consider today is
that the world's largest sporting goods
retail brand decathlon
decathlon has 1600 stores spread in 52
countries with around 100 000 employees
the iit team of github consists of 1000
members that helps decathlon to bring
its shoppers journey to their devices
so here we will first see the problems
that they faced and then we shall see
how did they sort out that problem
in the beginning decathlon worked on the
data center with the help of a vpn
and using a vpn was a huge challenge in
terms of workflow visibility and
avoiding redundancies
so the first problem is
how to maintain workflow visibility and
avoid redundancies
then since there are so many stores
located at so many different places
hiring of developers seemed to be a
difficult task as a physical workplace
was always needed so the second problem
is how would they hire developers
now let's see how did decathlon solve
these two problems one after the other
in the first case the entire decathlon
shifted from any other remote repository
to github
github turned out to be an amazing open
source community as the code became more
visible across the organization and now
anybody could contribute to it
then
let's talk about the second case for
hiring the developers
as we know github is an open source
community so it helped in collaboration
with any developer all over the world
the potential developers could now
contribute to benefit the global
community
now the question arises what made this
contribution possible
so the major contribution role was
played by the version control system
this was just a single case amongst many
others
there are many organizations that have
benefited from github
now when we have realized how github has
revolutionized the market let's start
learning more and more about github it
is time for us to jump on the topic what
is github
github is a service hosted on the web
where all the projects are stored
every project on github has its own
repository and its unique url
git provides a graphical interface to
store the files and helps team members
to coordinate on the project from
anywhere
github provides several access control
and collaboration features like wikis
and basic task management tools for
every project
let's now have a look at the features of
github
the first feature we will see is easy
project management
github help project managers and
developers to coordinate better on the
project
the work can be easily tracked and
updated which makes sure that the
project is on schedule and as entitled
second feature is increased safety with
packages
the packages on github can be published
as desired
they can be published privately or
within a community or can also be
published publicly
the packages can be easily downloaded
from the github to use and reuse them
next feature is the effective team
management
now as all the team members can stay
updated with all that's happening on the
project
so this helps them in staying organized
and well coordinated the pull request
and other modification tools make sure
that the team focuses on the code
moving on the next feature is improved
code writing
with the help of github the quality of
code has significantly increased
now with the help of gitpull command one
can review improve and propose new codes
along with that suggestions or
modifications may be discussed before
changing the original code
the next feature is increased code
safety
github uses codeql which is the
industry's leading semantic code
analysis engine
this tends to find risks in the code
which other tools tend to miss
the last feature we shall see
is easy code hosting
as the name suggests the codes and
documentations are hosted in one place
we also know that there are thousands of
repositories on github so each
repository has their own set of tools to
release and host the code
finally let's have a look at the
competitors of github there are several
competitors in the market
here we have just put the most common
ones first is atlassian bitbucket
then comes first bugs
followed by surround scm and gitlab
then we have buddy and finally followed
by beanstalk let's see the differences
between git and github
git is a software that can be installed
directly onto our systems whereas
github as we saw in the demo is hosted
on the cloud then
git can be used offline we don't
typically need an internet connection
unless we need to access the github
whereas github can only be operated when
we have an internet connection next
difference is git is something
independent and can be used without
github whereas github has nothing to do
unless we make repositories in git which
means it cannot be used without git then
git is a version control system that
helps in source code management
whereas github provides centralized
hosting of the code on the cloud next
difference is git does not work
according to a graphical user interface
while github is a simple graphical
interface
next difference is git is a command line
so it operates on several commands like
commit merge push pull etc whereas
github is a web-based service so it has
nothing to do with command line then
git is released under the gnu general
public license which is an open source
license it ensures that the software is
free for all its users whereas in the
case of github there are two tyres a
free tire and a paid tie
in the end let's have a look at the
competitors of the two as a competition
git has mercurial supervision ibm
relational team concert and clearcase
while for github the competition is
bitbucket and gitlab hello and welcome
to git commands my name is chidanand and
i am with the simply learn team today i
am going to cover few essential git
commands and walk you through a
demonstration for most of it i begin by
installing a git bash on the git client
and configuring it for its first time
usage once i'm done with configuring the
git client i'm going to spin up few
repositories locally and work on these
repositories using git commands once i'm
happy with my local changes i'm going to
commit few of them and then push these
changes to a git server of my choice for
today's demonstration i plan to use
github.com which is a cloud hosted free
service and it provides free account
registrations for anyone eventually i
will cover few topics regarding git
branching and merging because these two
in my opinion are the killer features of
the git distributed version control tool
kit is one of the most popular
distributed version control tools of
recent times and like any other
distributed version control tool it
allows us to perform various version
control tasks without really needing a
network connection before i jump into my
demonstration let me spend some time
explaining to you the git client server
working model what does it take for a
couple of users to collaborate and start
working with git the bare minimal thing
that any user would need in order to
start working with kit is something
called as git bash or the git client
this comes as an installer for all
popular operating systems like windows
all flavors of windows linux mac os and
other operating systems so once you
install git bash you get a command line
utility using which you can fire up your
git commands and ensure that you can
bring up repositories you can work with
these repositories by adding files to it
committing changes to it and all those
git commands would work perfectly well
so you can bring up a small repository
and you can work with your repository
using this git bash but what does it
take for you to share this repository
with another user who has also got git
bash installed on his system this is
where you would need something called as
a git server
so for user one or one user to share his
repository with another user he would
need to collaborate using something
called as a git server so in the present
market there are a bunch of git servers
which are popularly available some of
them are free some of them come with
cost because they are licensed a bunch
of these servers that i can think of are
github which is one of the most popular
kit servers that is around in the market
for a long time now it comes with two
variants one is the cloud hosted one
which is the github.com and then the
other one is an enterprise server which
comes as a black box that can be
installed into your data centers so
typically organizations who don't want
their source code to be put up on the
cloud but go for this github enterprise
servers wherein they buy these servers
and these servers are hosted on their
data centers other popular variant of
the git server is bitbucket this is from
the famous atlassian products and it
integrates very well with all other
atlassian products like jira in recent
times there's one other variant of the
git server called gitlab which is
getting very very popular these days
because gitlab not just provides a git
server it also provides something called
as a runner
this is a part of the continuous
integration strategy where as soon as
you have a source code check-in that is
going in you have this runner that kicks
up and builds your particular project so
all these are bundled together in a git
lab and gitlab also provides you with a
community edition which is almost free
of cost having said that there are a
bunch of these tools available for my
demonstration what i'm going to do is
i've already registered myself on the
github.com by providing my username and
my password and i'm going to use a free
account so whatever repositories that
i'm going to put up on this server is
all public by default so i want to
register myself by using my username or
my email id and my password so this set
of authentication is also referred to as
https authentication
so in order for me to share my
repository with say user2 the first
thing that i got to do was have an
access to a git server where both user 1
and user 2 are set up so once i have
that i can push my repository onto this
server and provide right kind of access
so that user 2 or the other developer
over wishes to collaborate with me on
this repository can use his credentials
as long as he's registered properly on
the git server he can use his
credentials and pull down this
repository and work with this repository
so this is the https way of
authenticating and sharing repositories
another popular way of sharing
repositories or working with each other
is called as ssh authentication as many
of you would know ssh means nothing but
creation of a private and a public key a
bunch of keys public and private are
created on the client machine while i
create a keys i will be asked for a
passphrase i need to type in a
passphrase and remember my passphrase
and then i take this public key and kind
of post it onto my account within my git
server so that whenever i'm going to
connect next time using my command
prompt or any of the tools it's going to
challenge me for my passphrase as long
as i remember my phrase correctly i can
authenticate myself and get into the
server so both https and ssh are popular
ways of communicating with the git
server having said this let me just get
started by installing the git bash on my
local system and then fire up some of
these git commands and build up some
repositories make some changes in my
repository commit these changes and
later use my github credential to
connect to my github server and push my
repositories out there
let me now go ahead and find my git bash
for my windows so that i can go ahead
and install it so i just type in get
client for windows open up a browser and
type in for this the first one that i
find as a gui tool i don't need this gui
client i need this one
so this is the git client or the git
bash that i was referring to it's about
40 megs and let me just download this
pause this video for some time so that
the download happens and come back to
you once i have the download the
download seems to be complete when i'm
recording this video the version that i
have the latest version that is there is
2.19.0 and this is a 64-bit version for
windows so i've got that downloaded let
me go ahead and find it and install this
exe
all right i go ahead choosing all the
default options i want it to be
installed in c colon program files under
the git folder
everything looks good for me i'm not
going to make any changes here
get bash from windows yes i may want to
use git from windows command prompt that
sounds good for me open ssh that's fine
looks good looks good
no i don't want any of these new
features
so what i'm doing is installing the git
bash or the git client so that i can
start using my git commands
the version that i'm using is 2.19.0
which as i record this video this
happens to be the latest version
all right so looks good i don't want to
see the release notes i'll say launch
git bash
so what i get is this window so this is
the git command prompt so let me check
if everything is looking good say get
version it sounds good say get
help all right a lot of git help
commands
everything looks good so
i ended up installing the git bash i can
go ahead with all other commands
now that i have git bash installed on my
system let me open up a git bash prompt
and start using it but before i do
anything i just need to configure it for
the first time stating what would be the
username and the email id with which i
want the git bash to be configured with
the command to do that is get config
hyphen iphone global which means that
this setting that i'm going to set would
be a global setting user dot name
and this the name of the user would need
to be specified within a double quote in
my case i am using the simply learn
account which is the official account
and this is the particular user name of
this account the other setting is
nothing but git config hyphen f1 global
this is also global setting
and this would be the email id
the email id need not contain a double
quote
so in my case this is the email id that
i would be setting up git to work with
all right let me check if the
configurations were set correctly or not
all right if you see this the username
and the email id has been picked up the
way i wanted it to be picked up looks
good so far all right so what do we do
next by default whenever you open up the
git prompt you are placed into your home
directory let me create a folder here
which would be a repository folder from
where i'm going to create all my
multiple git repositories so i will
create a folder called let's say git
underscore demo
all right
there's already a folder called git demo
so let me just delete that in the first
place and let me create this git demo
again
all right let me navigate to this
particular folder
so this is the folder let me open up
that folder using a command prompt
this is my git demo
so this would be a folder so i would use
this folder as a base folder for
creating all other repositories as a
part of this demo so let me create my
first repository a repository is nothing
but a folder so let me create my first
folder called first
repo
and let me
get into this repo all right as of now
this is just an empty folder
if at all i navigate to this if you see
that this folder is empty there's
nothing much in this folder at all at
this moment
okay so let me create a repository out
of this how do i create a repository of
this it's pretty simple i just run and
get init command
when i say git init it means it's going
to initialize a repository as of now
the folder contained nothing on it was
an empty repository so it initialized an
empty repository in this particular
folder if at all i look at my content
you would see that there's a hidden
folder this would be a hidden folder
since i've configured my explorer to
view all hidden folders i see it
otherwise you wouldn't see it so a
folder by name dot get is created within
this first repo and this was created
because we ran the command git init
if i get into this folder i see a bunch
of directories and other configurations
if you see there's something called as a
hooks directory a couple of
configuration files that are here in
this directory all these relate to one
or the other type of a client hook that
can be enabled and there's info this
objects
this references a bunch of stuff that is
there
so what is this folder this is a magical
git folder and this is created whenever
a repository is initialized so by
default if at all you get into any git
folder or any git repository you would
see this dot get folder a word of
caution do not get into this folder and
try to modify anything because if you
fiddle around with this and corrupt this
particular folder your whole repository
will go for a toss so let me come out of
this
and let me show you another thing
now if you notice here
when i was in the folder the repository
did not have anything after this now
when i say git in it there is something
called as a master that shows up so
typically what happens is whenever a git
repository is created for the first time
it creates a default branch the name of
the branch is called master and that is
why you would see master within braces
this doesn't mean anything else other
than we have a repository out in this
particular folder and by default there
is a
branch called master and we are
currently on that branch if at all i
create multiple branches in this folder
whenever i navigate to different
branches the branch name within these
brackets would change
all right so far so good so we created a
folder we made it a git repository by
initializing that with the git init and
then i'm not put anything yet in the
repository so let me try to do that let
me create a few files within this
particular repository so i use a touch
command
touch is a linux command it kind of
creates this particular folder if you're
not comfortable with the file
creation by this way you can always use
a file explorer and create some files in
this so i create a file called
touchmaster.txt i'll open up in the
notepad
okay so this is my first file that's
what i'm going to write inside this
i save this and i come out of this all
right now let me do a git status command
so what does this
tell you there's no commit set you're on
the master branch there is an untracked
file and this shows up in red it also
gives you all the commands that is
supposed to be run so if at all you want
to add this file you would say git add
and the name of the file and then you're
going to commit it
so what happened is that when the
repository was initialized it was an
empty repository
now that a git notices that there is a
new file in this repository called
master.txt if at all you want you want
us to let git know that you want to
track this file we need to add this to
the repository so the command to add
that is called git add i can specify
either the name of the file or i can
give a while character saying git add
dot now if i run the git status command
again
it says there's no commits yet
added a file and the file which was
earlier in red now shows up in green and
it says it's a new file master dot text
all right it also gives you something
called git remove command if at all you
want to unstage or undo your changes so
what has happened is the file which was
earlier untracked has been added into
the git index or it is ready for staging
or it's in the staged state now i can go
ahead and commit this file if at all
that's what i want to do so let me do
that i'll do a git commit minus m and i
give a message that i want i would say
this is my
first get commit
all right i run the git status command
again
and see it says on the branch master
nothing to commit it's all nice and
clean so typically what happened was i
created the empty directory made it into
a git folder by doing a git init i put a
file into it i made some changes to the
file i added that file into the
repository and i committed to the
repository if it error i run the git log
command
it says this was the commit id or the
commit
number or the commit hashtag and this is
the author if you notice this is the
email id and the username that we set
earlier this was done on this date and
this is the
commit message that is there all of it
looks so good let me do one more commit
into this repository so i will touch
master one dot text i'll put in another
file
i'll open up this particular file
write something into this
all right i save this change
let me also open up the older
file make some more change into this
all right so what i did i modified the
older file that existed i also added a
new file to my repository now if i run
the git status command
it says modified this file which is
showing in red and it says you have one
more file which is an untracked file
all right now let me add both these
files because these are the changes that
i want to
incorporate i would say git add dot i
run the git status command again
and it says now this is a modified file
this is a new file looks good to me let
me go ahead and commit this so git
commit with the message that says this
is my second commit
all right
if i do a git log now it shows both the
commits the first command is the one
that that shows up at the bottom and the
topmost one is the latest commit that is
there so far so good if at all you
notice
i'm doing all these git commands without
really connecting it to any git server i
don't need any network connection for
doing any of these things i can keep on
doing more and more git commands and run
git commands the way i want to
without really having any connections to
the git server
now that i have my changes the way i
wanted and i've checked in all the code
changes into my local repository i may
want to share my repository with
somebody else
and work in a collaborative way so the
way to do that is as i mentioned earlier
to host this repository or to push this
repository onto a kit server
i already have a github account wherein
i've registered myself using my username
and password so i log into my github
account using my username and
credentials and let me go ahead and
create a new repository
my repository is already there on the
local system so what i essentially need
is just a placeholder for my repository
so that i can link them together and
push the content from my local
repository to the server
if you notice the name of my repository
is this first repo
so let me copy this i will create a
folder structure or a repository
structure on the server with the same
name
so that
when i pushed my repository from my
local box it will go ahead and get
created in the server
so the repository name should be the
same as what i created on my local box
description i would say this is my first
git
hub
repository
on the server
this is just an optional description
that will show up
and if you notice
i can't have any private repositories so
whatever repositories that i'm going to
create here would be a public repository
so i choose public and i don't want to
initialize this with a readme file or
anything of that because i already have
a repository with some content with some
code checked in all that i need is a
placeholder for my repository on the
server
so with this option with just the name
and with an optional description and the
repository being public i go and click
on the create repository button
so if you notice it gives me a bunch of
commands that i would need to run in
order to create a repository and pushed
onto the server
and also important point it shows me two
urls one is the https url and the other
one is the ssh url as of now we do not
have any ssh keys that is set up so let
me use this https url to connect my
local repository with the repository on
the server
so i've done all these things i already
have the repository set up all that i
need is a placeholder for me to connect
my local repository with the server url
so this would be the command that i need
to copy
which essentially links or adds an
origin with the url of the git server i
just copy this command
and run it here
get remote add the name of the remote is
called origin and it points to an https
url which is nothing but the placeholder
that i've created on the server
all right so let me check if it's added
correctly
okay the url looks good i'm all set i've
got two comments in my repository i'm
done with all the changes so let me try
to push my repository onto the server
the command for doing it for the first
time is git push hyphen u this is for
linking the upstream
origin
master
so git push hyphen u upstream linking
origin master link the master
branch of my local repository with the
master branch on the server repository
and where is it going to push it is
going to push by default to an origin
and the origin points to this url
all right let me try doing this
so it essentially opens up an url asking
me the credentials with which i need to
log into my github server so let me just
copy and paste
the username
and the password with which i have
registered
i would say login
okay success
so i'm able to create a repository on
the server and the content seems to be
pushed and it created a new branch
called master it has linked the master
branch from the local repository with
the master branch on the server so let
me go back to my server and refresh this
page
and see if all my commits have come in
master
master1.txt if at all i see the commits
there seem to be two comments this is my
first comment this is my second comment
and if at all you notice each of this
commit comes with a hash key or a hash
id which contains the details of my
commits in this commit the files were
added this was a line that was added if
you look at the second commit
i added these lines
i made this you know one line chain that
was there i also added this new file
which was not existing these are the two
commits that existed
and if you see
the timestamp of the commit this is the
commit which was committed for 15
minutes ago so what does this mean is
that the commit is the timestamp when we
actually commented the code in the
client the pushing is just after we
committed the chain we pushed it so
there's no timestamp of the push that
happened
this completes the first part of the
tutorial wherein i create a repository
on the client and then i pushed it to
the server after creating a repository
skeleton on the server
now let me demonstrate to you the ssh
configuration that is required for
creating a pair of ssh keys and ensuring
that i connect to the github server
using the ssh mechanism so for doing
that i need to first create a pair of
private and public key the command to do
that is ssh keygen
hyphen t i will use the rsa mechanism
for creating my keys capital c and i
need to specify the email id using which
i'm going to connect to or i need to
create the keys for
all right so generating a private and
public key pair it says let me know what
folder should i create the keys in so by
default the keys are created in the user
home directory under a dot ssh folder so
this is pretty good for me so let me go
ahead and say that that's fine enter a
passphrase
so let me enter some passphrase
keep in mind that i would need to
remember my passphrase because when i'm
going to authenticate myself using ssh
mechanism it will challenge me for this
particular passphrase i need to enter
the right passphrase so that i get
authenticated
so the key is generated and by default
it is created in this particular folder
so let me go over to that particular
folder
and this is the folder where the keys is
generated you would see a public key and
a private key that is created let me
open up the public key with
a notepad
and then copy the contents of the whole
file
and now i would need to stick it in
on the server so that i can get myself
authenticated using ssh keys
so i have logged in to github using my
credentials and go to my settings
and you will see an ssh and gpg keys let
me click on that as of now there are no
ssh key or gpg keys so i will click on
new ssh key and let me paste my
public key that i've copied
and i would say add ssh key
it prompts me for my password just to
make sure that
i've got the right kind of
authentication to be adding a new key so
this one looks good that means the keys
were added successfully let me check if
my ssh keys are working well
so i do ssh hyphen capital t
i would say get
at
github.com
this is just to double check if my ssh
keys
are authenticated correctly are you sure
you want the connection yes you want to
continue yes
all right now
a check for my passphrase let me enter
my passphrase
i hope i remember it correctly
all right
pretty good i have been successfully
authenticated so that means now my ssh
keys are good and just by using my
passphrase i can connect to my github
server using ssh all right so for the
second use case what i would do is
create a repository on the server with
some content in it and then clone that
repository cloning is nothing but making
a copy of that repository
linking the origin so that i create an
exact replica of the repository which is
there on the server on my local drive so
let me first create a repository on the
server i will create a new repository
let me give a name for my repository and
let me kind of initialize that with the
readme file i would call this my second
repo
give some description
this is my
second repo
that is created
straight
on the git server on the github server
to be precise
it's a public repository this time i'm
going to choose this option
the reason being that i don't want to
create just a skeleton as of now i want
to create a repository with some readme
file in it a random readme file with no
content in it but then i want a
repository to be created on the server
all right i say create a repository
so
a random readme file with some content
in it gets created and i can see there
are two urls to this repository https
and ssh so this time let me copy the ssh
url so that i will use this url to clone
this repository on the server
rather from the server to my local box
all right so let me navigate to my root
folder the folder that i created for
making all my repositories git
repositories if you see my first deposit
is already here so let me clone my
repository the second repo that i
created on the server the command to do
that is get clone the url of the
repository that i want to clone
oops
looks like i didn't copy the url
correctly let me copy that again
copy this url
all right so if you notice there is no
https to it i'm just cloning the url
that is ssh url of the repository
it asks for my passphrase again
okay
so i just had first repository earlier
now i have something called a second
repo this is an exact replica of
whatever was the repository content that
was created on the server so if i get
into
the repository there's just a simple
readme file that is there let me try to
add a new file out here i would say
notepad
second.txt some text file i'm going to
put in here yes definitely you will not
find that file there
this is my second
file that
i will push onto the server
i'm going to put in some content out
there
i'm going to save this
and if i do get status
it says this this is a new untracked
file do you want to add this file
onto the repository you want to track
this file yes i definitely want to track
this file let me also commit my change
to the file
with the message
this is my first
commit for the second repo
i'm giving some particular message
and this time around since i cloned my
repository from a server the origin is
already set for me i don't really need
to
add the origin and all that stuff
because what happened in the first case
was that i was creating a repository
from my local box and then pushing
another server which is why i had to set
up the upstream branches and stuff like
that in this case i have cloned an
existing repository from the server so
when i clone i get the replica along
with all references to my repository so
i don't need to do anything more other
than push the content i'll just say git
push to be on the safer side i would say
origin and master
ask me for the passphrase
okay it pushed the content onto the
server let me see if the contents have
come in here
okay wonderful i had only one comment
now i see my second comment so what was
added as a part of the second comment it
says a new file was added all this line
that never existed got added this is the
second file the content exactly what i
pushed onto the server
now this completes the tutorial when i
create a repository on the server cloned
it made some changes to the repository
and pushed it to the server using ssh
a quick recap of all the git commands
that we ran till now
git init is used to initialize the
repository so if at all you are creating
a local repository you can get into any
of the folder which is not a git
repository and run this command whenever
you run this command a magical folder by
name dot kit gets created in the folder
and from that time onwards git will
start tracking any changes that happen
to that particular folder it also
creates a new repository and a branch by
default the branch that is created is
called the master branch
git add dot is a wildcard character for
adding any number of new files into your
git repository if you have a bunch of
files one file two file ten files a
folder containing multiple files in it
all of them could be added into the
repository using this command so once
you add any number of files into the
repository you can keep on adding more
and more files into the repository once
you're done with that you want to commit
the changes that has happened in the
repository you use the git commit
command git commit hyphen m with a
meaningful message
this will commit all the work items that
you have done in terms of the files that
got changed the files that got added all
this with one particular message git
status will give you the status of all
the files and folders any file that got
added any file that got created any file
that was deleted all status of the files
will be obtained using the git status
command git log will show you all the
commit history with the latest history
or the latest commit showing up on top
git add remote origin this command is
used whenever you want to link any local
repository to a server and this is when
you want to really push a repository
from the local to the server for the
first time git push hyphen u origin and
master this is the command that you
would use whenever you want to push
contents from the local repository to
the server git clone and the url of the
server this is the command that you will
run whenever you have an existing
repository on the server and you want to
make a fresh clone or a fresh copy of
that particular repository onto your
local box
more than often many developers or gate
users find themselves in situations
where they would want to go back in
history and modify
or change some of the files that they
recently committed or checked into the
repository now from a perspective of get
this is a very very simple activity
however from a perspective version
control tool you will have to be really
cautious about the chain that you're
going to do in case the changes are
pretty local none of the developers or
none of the other users who are
collaborating with you would be affected
by this change you're good to go ahead
and make this change however if your
repository has been pushed to the server
and you're trying to modify something
from history this would have a very bad
or adverse effect on all the other users
who will be using it you need to be
really cautious while running these
commands in case your repository
contents are local you have not pushed
your changes to your repository and if
at all you made some changes to the
repository maybe to fix a defect or to
include a new feature and you missed few
things you can go ahead and modify this
with some of these commands
let's say i have this simple repository
called undo undo repo and if at all i
look at the logs of these i have the
commit histories which are like this
i have about five commits that is there
in my repository and in c1 i've added a
file in c2 i've added another file in c3
i've also added some file in c4 i made
some changes to m1 and m3 and in c5 i've
added another file called m4 now this is
my commit history now let's say i made
these two comments but possibly i want
to club them together along with some
other changes because whatever changes i
did did not really fix things the way i
expected it to fix so there is a git
command called git reset this would
allow me to go back in history to go
back to any of the snapshot get rid of
all this commit history on the commit
messages but retain the changes that
were made as a part of these comments so
if at all i need to go back in history
and go back to this particular commit
and however i just want to get rid of
these commits that are there in terms of
the commit messages but i want the
changes that were there as a part of
these commits to still exist i would do
command called get reset
hyphen iphone soft
now this would go back or unwind my
changes back to this particular snapshot
getting rid of all the commit messages
that were there as a part of these two
commits but a soft would ensure that the
file changes that were done as a part of
these two commits would still exist a
full remain so the command for that is
git reset hyphen fn soft which is the
snapshot that i want to get back to if
this is the commit that i want to get
back to i just copy this
and i paste this
all right it doesn't give me any message
but if at all i do a git log pretty one
line what it says is c1 c2 now the head
which is nothing but the current pointer
which is earlier pointing to c5 it's
gone back to c3 now what happened to the
changes that were there as a part of c4
and c5
if at all you do a git status if you see
the changes that were part of c4 were
some changes to m1 and m2 and c5 a new
file got m4 got added if what i do a git
status
you would see those changes still exist
however from the git history or the git
commit history c3 is the topmost commit
that exists as of now c4 and c5 have
been gotten rid of but the changes that
were there still exist
all right now i can make some more
changes that i want if as a part of my
commit and possibly go ahead and commit
this whole thing as a new commit
altogether maybe i'll open up a notepad
and possibly create a new file called
m6.txt
and say
one
new file
that was missed out
i make this change
i go to a get status
all these files are still there i would
say git add dot
also get
commit hyphen m
c4
rewriting history
and i do a get
log
pretty
there you go
so c1 c2 c3 still existed and whatever
was a part of c4 and c5 the older ones
i've gotten rid of this along with those
old changes i also added a new file i
made some changes and it was able to
commit it now if you look at my gate
history it's all nice and clean however
do this activity only when you don't
push your git repository to the server
one other most powerful and useful
command while undoing or resetting the
history is something called as revert
this is a safe way of undoing some
things remember what i talked about when
exactly you can do a reset it's only
when your changes are local and is not
being pushed to the repository take this
scenario wherein let's say i have a git
server
and i have the changes
which are c1
c2
c3
and possibly c4
all right so this is a bunch of comments
that has happened this was the oldest
comment and this is the newest comment
and if at all developer 1 is the one
who's responsible for pushing these
contents
in the first place so he has got c1 to
c4 on his history
i'm going to jump all this c2 and c3 and
get into c4 and he's pushed all these
contents out here
and there are a bunch of people from the
server who has pulled this repository
and all of them are at the same level
now imagine a use case where developer 1
then figures out that by mistake he put
in the c3 which was the wrong thing to
do and possibly you know he could have
done a better job of fixing this in a
different way so he wants to get rid of
the c3 or c4 or any one of these
comments
if he's going to do that and push to the
server first of all the git server would
not allow him to go back in history but
assuming that he forcibly pushed
something
what would happen to all these people
who are looking to work ahead from c4
all of them would be affected in adverse
way so
in short never go back in history if at
all you need to undo something go ahead
and put in a new commit to undo
something
let's take this example maybe if at all
a developer 1 wants to get rid of c3
better way to do that is by adding a new
commit which is ahead
say let's say c5 and what does this
commit do
this commit possibly gets rid of c3
instead of going back in history it
actually is taking your git history
ahead but as a part of this commit
you're undoing some part of the work
that was done as a part of c3
in short you're removing a commit but to
remove a commit you're adding a new
commit and this is why you're doing it
because there are a bunch of other
people who are
you're using this repository
collaboratively and were planning to get
ahead in terms of history they cannot
afford to go back in history and modify
something in history all right the
command to do this is called the git
revert command
so let me take up this repository which
has got a bunch of commits in it and if
at all i do a git log
pretty one line
i have these bunch of comments
and c1 i've added a file in c2 hour
another file in c3 i've added one more
file
and in c4 i made some changes and this
is the latest commit and this is the
oldest comment so if at all i see the
contents of the git
folder it contains m1 m2 m3 and m4
and
let's say looking at the previous use
case that i mentioned i may want to get
rid of this particular commit
i want to get rid of the c3 which is
nothing but i've added a file called
m3.txt but i added it by mistake
i need a better way of fixing it
possibly i look at it later on but for
now i don't want this particular commit
and the changes that were made as a part
of that commit to exist so the better
way to do that is using the git revert
command so git revert
and the commit id whatever i want to
revert so if i want to revert this
i copy this particular commit id and
bear in mind that considering reset
revert works on one commit at a time so
i can do
one commit revert at a time i can club a
bunch of them together and do one commit
but otherwise the revert always works on
one commit at a time so get revert
paste this
essentially what i'm trying to do i'm
trying to undo this particular commit
while i'm undoing this commit what does
git do it safely adds a new commit and a
part of this new commit it unders
whatever changes that were done as a
part of this command so if i say git
revert this
all right i forgot to mention the
message which is why this window is
showing up but that message is good for
me i say write and quit
all right and if i do a git log
all right if you see this c1 still is
there in history and our history is
going ahead from c5 i see another commit
but what was it as a part of this commit
actually is getting rid of this commit
c3 so if at all i see my files here
there's only m1 m2 and m4
m3 was added as a part of c3 now i've
gotten rid of m3
by getting rid of the revert command for
c3 so this is a better way of undoing
things
now that we have acquainted ourselves
with few of those basic git commands let
me get into a very very interesting
topic regarding git which is about
branching the topic is interesting
because kit deals with branches in a
completely different way compared to any
other version control tool
in most of the version control tools
whenever you create a new branch a
complete copy or a subset of the whole
repository is created which in my
opinion is very very cost inefficient
because it is a very very expensive
operation both in times of time and the
disk space
however in git you just create a very
very lightweight mobile pointer whenever
you create a branch there is no folder
or no copy of the repository that is
created in short the branches are very
very inexpensive and great so go ahead
and create any number of branches that
you need however once you create your
branches do all the work relating to
that branch in that specific branch and
once you've completed your task go ahead
and merge your branches back into your
base branch and then delete the branch
let me go ahead and create a repository
with some branches in this and give you
a demonstration of that
so let me go back to my base directory
which is git demo and then i'm going to
create a new folder here
i'll create a folder called arc details
all right this is my folder here
all right i navigate into this folder
and let me create a repository here
i initialize a repository and dot git
folder is created without any files in
it so let me create a few files in it
say notepad name.txt
organization name
i create a name.text within this maybe
i'll create one more file in this
notepad
employees.txt
simply learn
has
over
3k employees
i just put in some content in this save
this content
all right
so if i try to look at status i just
see two files in it so let me go ahead
and
add these two files and let me commit my
changes so okay
commit iphone am or iphone m
first command
so if i do a git log
i see only one commit and there are two
files and you can see those two files
that is here all right so at this stage
let me go ahead and create a new branch
and the command for creating new branch
is get
branch name of the branch
so let me name my branch as bangalore
branch blr branch
and this created a branch
but i don't see any changes in the
folder structure or in the file that
exists here i've just created this
branch so if at all i do a git
branch i see these two branches
and whatever star means i'm currently in
this master branch so let me go ahead
and get into the blr branch at this
moment the number of files that exist in
this repository is same there's
absolutely no change in any of the
branches both master and blr branch
point to the same snapshot
so let me get into
the other branch and the command to do
that is gate checkout
plr branch
i've actually switched into bangalore
branch if you see the content of the
files there's exactly two files the way
it was earlier because i've created a
branch from my base branch which is a
master branch and when i created a
branch there were two files existing
here if you see the content of these
files they would all be the same
all right so let me create a
file that is specific to panel branch
so i would just say notepad
maybe i want to put down the address of
this organization specific to bangalore
in this address dot text so i say
notepad address.txt
also simply learn
angular office
say located in
some address
i would say bangalore
that is the content of this file
and i'm creating all this new file in
this blr branch so i would say git add
dot
and i would say git commit hyphen m
bangalore
branch
commit
all right if you see this now i have an
address.text which is there only in the
bangalore branch that i'm presently on
now let me switch back to my master
branch the command to do that is gate
check out
master branch
if you remember when i forged out or
when i created a new branch from the
master branch i didn't have this address
or text in it so let me go back to git
git check out master branch
and keep noticing this
particular what happened to the
address.txt
it kind of disappeared now how did that
happen it's all because of this magical
git folder so what happened is now git
knows that when you are in the master
branch the file that was there in the
bangalore branch which was called the
address dot text didn't exist
so
git is playing around with the file
system snapshot so if i come back let's
say i come back to get check out
bangalore branch
if you see this the address.txt file
appears
so this particular file is only present
in the branch and git is playing around
with the file system snapshot by moving
the pointers across and ensuring that
whenever i'm switching to bangalore
branch i see this address dot text when
i go back to my master branch i don't
see this bangalore branch
contents which is the address dot text
all right now that i created this branch
maybe i may need to push this onto the
server so let me go ahead and create a
particular repository structure on the
server similar to whatever we did in our
previous exercise
so
the name of the folder needs to be
exactly this one so let me copy this
and let me create a repository very
quickly
go here and say new repository
all right this
is the name of the repository
get
branch demo this is what i'm going to
put in as a description i would say
public i don't want any readme files in
it because i already have a repository i
will just say create a repository
all right
let me use
the ssh url yeah this is the ssh url
this is good for me so let me copy this
url
let me add it here
i'm linking my local repository with the
server
and i would let me come back to my
master branch
let me first push my master branch so i
would say git
push iphone u origin
master
it asks for my passphrase
all right
i pushed my master branch looks good it
says new branch master is created so if
i go back to my server and i do a
refresh
if you see it says only one branch
and it says what is the name of the
branch master
if you see the contents there is
employees.txt and name.txt
now
let's try to push the other branch that
is there the command to do that is a
little different compared to
the way we created it on the client
because on the client we created the
branch with a git branch command now
this branch doesn't exist on the server
and i need to push this new branch onto
the server so the command would be
gate
push hyphen u
origin
and the name of the branch that i want
to specifically push
all right now it created a branch out
here
let me do a refresh of this
all right it says two branches
if i get into this bankrupt branch i
would see the address dot text if at all
i go back into master branch i would not
see this address.txt
wonderful
now let me do one thing let me try to
get the changes from the branch that i
created back into the master branch that
is what i would mean by merging i would
want the changes that is there as a part
of the bangalore branch to come back
into my master branch so if i go to
click checkout
bankroll branch i see this attached to
this is there only as a part of
bangalore branch now assuming that i'm
done with the changes from the banner
branch i want to get those changes back
into my master so let me come back
to my master branch
and the way to merge in the changes is
get merge
so what is that you want to merge i want
to merge the bangalore branch changes
and where will it merge it'll merge it
into the current branch that i'm on
presently i'm in the master branch so
this command would merge the changes
from the bangalore branch into your
master branch so with this if you'll
keep looking here the content that was
there that was added as a part of
bangalore branch which was nothing but
the dot text this file should appear as
soon as we do a merge
all right so it happened quickly and you
would see this address dot text that is
here so if you see let's check the
contents in terms of the git log
all right so there was only one branch
that we had earlier which had only one
commit right now we are at this
bangalore branch commit which was there
as a part of the bangalore branch commit
so with this change let me push this
change onto the server as well
gate push
origin
master
okay those changes were pushed to the
server and now
if at all i do a refresh out here
okay i mean two branches
the francis master even if i'm in master
brands i should see this address dot
text that is there even if i'm in the
bangalore branch the content is all same
because we have merged these two
branches now that i've merged this
branch i don't need this branch anymore
so i would go ahead and delete this
locally as well as push it onto the
server so that it gets deleted from the
server as well so delete branch locally
the command is get
branch
hyphen d and the name of the branch
only thing you need to ensure is that
you should not be currently on that
branch which you're trying to delete so
i would say get branch
and i'm presently in the master branch
so i can go ahead and delete the other
branch so get branch hyphen d bandwidth
branch
all right this got rid of our bandwidth
branch locally
if at all i don't get branch hyphen wii
it shows there's only one branch as of
now however this branch would still
exist on the server because server
doesn't know anything about the changes
that we have done
we need to specifically push our changes
onto the server
okay there are two branches still here
so let me go ahead and push these
changes so that the branch gets deleted
from the server as well the command to
do that is get
push
origin
hyphen iphone delete and the name of the
branch
all right
so this went ahead and deleted the
branch from the server let's check that
okay if you see now there's only one
branch
these are the basic steps that you would
need to know before you work with any of
the branches within git and as i said
before the branches are very very
inexpensive and good go ahead and create
any number of branches that you want but
just ensure that once you create your
branch finish off your task and once you
finish off your task go ahead and delete
the branch and before you delete the
brands please ensure that you merge in
the branches so that you get in or take
in the work that was done as a part of
that particular branch
to summarize the gate branching commands
are as follows to create a new branch
you issue a command git branch the name
of the branch and this would
automatically spin off or create a new
branch from the existing branch from
where you issue this command
if you are on the master branch and if
you execute this command git branch new
underscored branch it creates a new
underscore branch from the master branch
once you create a new branch in order to
get into this branch you would type in
git check out the name of the branch
this would automatically switch the file
system snapshot between different
branches now the branches that are
created are by default created on the
local repository in case you want to
push any specific branch onto the server
you would have to issue a command get
push hyphen u origin and the name of the
branch so this will ensure that the
contents of the new branch are pushed
onto the server at any time if you want
to list out all existing branches on
your local repositories the command
would be get branch hyphen av assuming
that you did all your work in a new
branch and you're happy with the changes
you would want to bring back those
changes into the master branch the
command to merge the contents of any new
branch into a master branch would be git
merge and the name of the branch this
would automatically merge the branch
contents that you specified into the
branch on which you currently reside if
at all you're on the master branch and
if you issue a command git merge new
underscore branch this would merge the
contents of the new branch onto the
master branch so once you merge the
contents of any branch you would
possibly want to go ahead and delete
this branch so the command to delete
those branch locally is get branch
hyphen capital d and the name of the
branch this again would delete the
branch locally in order to make this
change on the server which is in order
to remove this branch from the server
the command to do that is get push
origin hyphen iphone delete and the name
of the branch this would also delete the
branch that you created on the server
welcome everyone to this lesson by
simply over here in which we are going
to talk about the git merge conflict of
this one now we all have worked on gate
and we know that git is a very good
version control system which we have all
together
but how to resolve a problem which is
known as git merge because during the
developers check-in or do any kind of
merge activity this is uncommon problem
which they face on daily basis now this
isn't something which we are going to
talk about in this so that we can give
and kind of an insight to all those
developers and to other particular
different people who are using the git
version control system here now what
exactly we are going to talk about here
we are going to talk about what exactly
is git version control system we are
also going to talk about what exactly is
the
basic git commands used in git
and then we are going to talk about that
what exactly is a merge conflict all
about
and then the different type of merge
conflicts which we encounter while doing
any kind of merging or any kind of
modifications
and then how to resolve these merge
conflicts
faced by a particular individual or a
particular developer
and then the last one is that the
various git commands which is involved
in resolving these conflicts
and then we will be going on with a
small demo to better understand that how
these conflicts can be resolved all
together
right so let's first of all talk about
that what exactly is a git version
control system
now git is a kind of a version control
system which we basically used for
storing a kind of source code there
which
can be
used for storing a source code of
java.net
android node.js different kind of
programming languages can be stored all
together in this version control system
so in an organization you will be having
a full-fledged version control system
known as git now you may be having
different projects different
repositories multiple developers
multiple collaborators working on
different different projects so it's a
very extensive tool which is used by
different developers and
in fact it is not only limited to
developers a lot of other people also
exactly use this specific tool now the
main task of using this tool is to
perform a better coordination of the
work here among the different people
among the different developers and also
to have a proper track of the particular
progress of the specific project so
using the repository you can see that
over the period of time you can do the
tracking that how the different commits
are happening here how the different
source code modifications are being done
so the complete status and the complete
stats you will be able to get from this
a kind of a version control system here
now it's mainly used for source code
management here in any particular
software uh development process or a
particular team here so it's a very
important and in fact a key tool for any
kind of development project so the
development cannot survive without
having a get version control system
now
git favors both programmers and
non-technical users now if you are a
programmer definitely you will be using
it for
storing the source code and having those
particular files having some
dotnet source code java or some
particular source code present there but
in fact if you're not a particular
developer if you're not a programmer you
are working as a non-technical job so in
that case also you can store it for
keeping your project files
best example a particular devops
engineer can also use these repositories
to store their version control systems
uh to have these scripts python scripts
shell scripts configuration management
tool scripts any kind of automation
scripts they can store they want to have
it they can keep use of these particular
version control system here so it's not
a dedicated tool for a particular
developers anyone who wants to utilize
the features of version control system
can make use of this specific tool
in fact it allows a multiple users also
to work together so different people and
different programmers can collaborate
with each other with the help of this
particular specific tool here
and it can also handle large projects if
you feel that you are working on a
particular big project which is having
multiple repositories
multiple
projects are there so in that situation
git version control system will survive
and will provide you a better
performance in different different
aspects so it's a very good tool for you
to handle which big projects where you
are involved with multiple changes
multiple programmers multiple
collaborators and different kind of
source codes
now what are the different basic
commands which we use in git to manage a
git repository now first of all the a
very basic command of a gate over here
is git config
whenever we work with any kind of git
repository locally when we do a git
clone and we
manage or we do the modification to the
git repository locally there so in that
situation we often have to provide some
details like the username email id so
that whenever we provide whenever we do
some kind of commits the author details
should be submitted
according to that so in that situation
we have the particular command called
git config which will definitely help us
to do some configurations so that we
will be able to have some configurations
configured and we will be able to have
some author details or some additional
parameters so all those things we can
configure using this git config command
here
now
if you want to initialize a
local repository now you're not working
on a remote repository
and you want to initialize a local
repository in that case you can use the
git init command in a specific folder so
that you can convert that a simple
folder in a full-fledged git version
control repository so init command is
used to initialize a local empty bare
git repository
next command is git add now git add
command is used whenever we do any kind
of modifications or into my local
repository so that file will be present
into the working area into the working
copy over there now the moment you run
the git add command on couple of files
or on an individual file so what will
really happen that all those files will
be added to the staging area now why
these files are adding to the staging
area so that at any moment of time when
you run the git commit command these
files will be picked up from the staging
area and will be preserved permanently
into the git repository so when you do
get add command it moves the files from
your working copy to the staging area
and it will remain there itself unless
and until you don't do any kind of git
commit command further so that these
files from staging area will be
permanently written off into the local
repository so it's a very important part
that you run git add command before
running any kind of git commit command
now git commit command will only pick up
those files which is present in the
staging area so if you have done
modifications to 200 files or 20 30
those kind of files there if you do the
git add command only for five six files
so only those five six files will be
taken care in case of a particular
commit so you need to make sure that you
select the desired amount of files
before doing any kind of git commit
activity
right now next command which we have
here is git diff command now git div
command is a kind of base tool which we
have here which really helps us to
understand that how we can check the
difference between two files and in fact
this git diff command can also be used
to see the difference between two
different branches also
so if you feel that if you have done
some changes to the file to a specific
content here now if you want to see the
difference between your particular
head revision number and whatever the
modifications do you have done right now
so in that situation you can run get
tiff command it will let you know that
what the different kind of changes and
modifications you have done so if at any
moment of time before doing any kind of
comments you want to do some kind of
review you want to see that what
different changes you have done so in
that case you can go for the git diff
command so get div command use to see
the content the difference or the
modifications which you have done
recently to the specific file
right and the last one we have already
discussed the git commit command which
commits the changes to the head revision
number and this comments are something
which is stored locally and you will not
be doing the direct comments to the
remote repository so commit is something
which is done into your local repository
only but yes this is the last stage of
doing a modifications here once the
comment is done it will directly modify
your history your git repository history
there and the changes will be
permanently preserved into the
repository so git command is primarily
used for permanently preserving the
changes into your local
repository right so these were some of
the commands there now there are some
further commands also let's discuss
about them now next command is git reset
command at any moment of time you want
to do some undo activity for some local
changes done to your local repository
into your git repository in that case we
can use the git reset command
then next command is git status now git
status command will show you the state
of the working directory and the staging
area so both these area will be shown
when you run the git status command if
you have done any kind of modifications
to the working area that will also be
visible to you and if you add some files
to the staging area that also will be
displayed using the git status command
so git status command is very important
because ultimately it let us know that
how the different things and then how
the different files are modified over
here
right the next thing is get merge here
now git merge is a very specific command
which is used to move the changes from
one branch to another now
at any moment of time if you feel that
you are working on some other branch
like develop branch or some other
feature branch and you want to move the
changes from this feature branch to the
master branch so in that case
you don't have to do the commits all
together again in the master branch all
you can do is that you can go to the
master branch and trigger the merge
activity so this merge activity will
check what is the difference between the
two branches and whatever commits is
missed out it will also be synced back
into the master branch so git merge
actively helps us to move the changes
from one branch to another one
next one is the git push command here
now git push command will eventually
help you to move the changes from your
local uh to move the different comments
from your local repository to the remote
repository now in this case what happens
that if you are working in offline mode
if you have done some couple of commits
now get push will help you to sync those
comments back to the share to the remote
repository now these remote repository
can be github bitbucket or gitlab that
is a different story but yes all your
changes will be synced or will be moved
from your local repository to the remote
repository right and the last one is the
git pull get pull is an opposite
activity of push here now you might have
seen that some other developers are also
doing some check-ins or some push
activity to the remote repository now if
you still work on an old version of your
source code it may cause a lot of
problem for you so at
frequent intervals you may have to
pull the changes or you may have to
download some changes from the
particular network or from the remote
repository now once that is done you
will be able to see that those
particular changes will be pulled down
and you will be pretty much able to do
the uh you will be able to fetch and
download the changes from the remote
repository to your local repository here
so this is an activity which really
helps us to understand that how we can
pull some changes from the remote
repository to your local repository so
that you can have the latest source code
which might be uh pushed by some other
developers or by some other
collaborators so that you can always
work on the latest source code into your
local system so this is again a
mechanism in which we are trying to see
that what are the different git commands
we can explore and we can utilize here
to interact with the git repository so
this was some of the basic commands
which we can use for managing the gate
repositories here now let's talk about
that what exactly is a merge conflicts
now merge conflict is something which
gets originated the moment we do some
kind of merging activity now merging is
an process in which we move some source
code from one branch to another now all
the developers cannot work on the same
piece of branch there so what really
happens that in that situation all the
developers mainly work on some couple of
branches and then they all collaborate
to some other branch or different
developers try to push their changes
from the local repository to the remote
repository so in all these situations
the source code gets moved from one
location to another now what happens in
as for this diagram we have a remote
repository over here now all we are
trying to do is that we are trying to
push some source code over here from a
particular developer here now he is
doing the pull and push activity and uh
this another developer is there who is
also doing the pull activity here so
merge conflicts uh basically happens
then for example this uh particular
developer a is trying to do some push
right so that push is almost done here
and when the particular developer v is
trying to
push the particular results or try to
push its own content to the remote
repository he got a merge conflict which
means that his particular developer b
merge activity is cancelled is deferred
here now it could be a possibility
because of the changes on the difference
on the two piece of source code there so
let's talk about that
now in order to prevent such kind of
conflicts developers usually provide it
with the isolated branches so that they
can work on their branches and once the
development is done they can do a single
merge and they can sync their changes
into a single branch so the git merge
command combines separate branches and
resolves any conflicting edits over
there so once the developers are done
with the specific changes with the
modifications to the source code later
on they can combine those things they
can work on these components and they
can resolve all these conflicting
modifications
right so a merge conflict is an event
that takes place when git is unable to
resolve the differences in the source
code between the two commits
automatically
normally the git is having the
capability to understand that okay these
are the two different piece of source
code which is getting pushed to a remote
repository but in any case it does not
happens automatically there is any kind
of conflict which arises over there and
git is not able to take any kind of
decisions so in that situation we will
be able to get a merge conflict now it
could be a possibility that one merge
can happen successfully then the next
merge will be
cancelled and will be deferred due to
this merge conflicts so git can
automatically merge the changes only if
the commits are on different lines or
the branches here so if at any moment of
time you are diverting from the process
you are having some different lines of
source code so that is where the merge
completes comes into the picture
now what are the different kind of merge
conflicts which we normally face
uh the main types of words conflict is
first of all uh there are two points
where we can say that a merge can uh
happen or can come into a conflicted
state the very first one is the started
the merge process now if at any moment
of time there are changes in the working
area or working directory and we are
moving or these changes are getting
moved to the
particular working area of the stage
area of the current project so during
the merge activity itself the particular
merge will fail because there are some
changes or there are some kind of
modifications which is right now present
over here in the working area so in this
case conflicts happen due to pending
changes
now for instance you have done some
modification to the changes now you were
planning to do the commit but before
that you felt that i want to do some
kind of merge now since there are some
pending changes which is available there
into your working area so what will
happen that your merge will definitely
will there itself so before even
starting before even initializing the
merge
as in particular pre-check your merge
activity will fail there itself so in
that situation you have to either remove
those pending changes or you have to
resolve those pending changes before
even going for the merge activity
second
during the merge process definitely if
you are getting some conflict so the
merge conflicts gets originated so the
failure during the merge process uh
indicates that there is an conflict
between your local branch and the branch
being merged right so you're trying to
move the changes from one branch to
another so it means that there are some
particular conflicts which is coming up
in the
particular branch in which you are
trying to do the merge so in this case
get results as much as possible so if
there is any kind of difference in the
source code in the comments and the
different line of source code there so
git automatically try to resolve it as
much as possible but at any moment of
time it's not able to do it's not able
to manage in that case a particular
human interruption is required so that
we can merge or we can
resolve this particular conflicts
manually there so these are the two
types of situations in which a
particular merge can enter a particular
conflicted area
now how to resolve these merge conflicts
now what happens that in order to
resolve this merge conflicts the simple
way to do this is that we open the file
which is in conflicted uh
status now once that is done you do the
required changes
whatever source code you feel you want
to proceed
you will select that source code you
will use that source code and once the
edition or editing of the file is done
so what you can do is that you can run
the pretty much straightforward command
called git add to add that file to the
staging area and then what you can do is
that you can do the git commit activity
so that the particular merge completes
can be resolved and you will be able to
see a merge here now this is a something
which is known as one of the best
approach for resolving the merge
conflicts because even if it comes up if
git is not able to handle it
automatically and it requires for you to
manage it manually here so definitely in
that situation we have to open the
source we have to select that which
portion of a source code we want to keep
do the modifications manually and then
follow the traditional approach to
perform a custom commit so git add and
get commit command you will be doing
there in that situation to have a
particular final merge executed all
together so this is the steps which we
can follow to perform a custom uh to
resolve a particular custom merge
conflicts over here
right now the various git commands which
we can use to resolve the conflicts here
now get log hyphen event merges and
command which helps us to list down all
the commits that are causing the
particular conflict here if at any
moment of time your mergers fail down
and you want to see that what are the
different commits which is causing the
issue here probably you might be you
know ignoring some comments which is not
that much important or you can manually
overwrite the content so that those
conflicts data can also be added and
whatever the changes you are trying to
add that also should be modified
second command get diff command you can
always use the uh to check the
difference between the particular files
between the repository
git checkout is something which you can
use to particularly check out a file so
that if you want to check out the latest
content of a specific file or a folder
so in that case you can make use of this
git checkout command here so git
checkout command will definitely help
you to understand that how we can go for
or how we can do the checkout of this
particular repository or a particular
file here
right so then we have a command called
git reset hyphen f and mixed so git
reset hyphen fn makes is then command to
undo the changes of to the working
directory and whatever the particular
changes you have so that will be undo
there and it will be
able to do the undo changes to the
working area and the staging area here
now then we have git merge iphone iphone
award which will be used in order to
exit the merge process and return back
to the state before the merchant began
if you're not able to resolve the merge
conflicts manually also so in that
situation we will be aborting the merge
situation or a git merge over here
and the last one is get reset so get
reset command is used at in time to of
merge conflicts to reset the conflicted
file so that what we can happen that we
can go back to the previous situation
before even starting or the state before
the merge activity was started there so
git reset will eventually help me to
reset all the files which is in
conflicted area and all latest files
will be checked out and will be replaced
so these are some couple of commands
which we can actually use in order to
resolve the merge conflicts into a git
repository now that was something which
we were trying to understand that what
exactly the git merge was there and how
the git merge originated and how they
get particular merge conflicts gets
created and how we can resolve it now
let's go for a proper demo on this one
so that we can understand it properly
that how exactly get merge conflicts
really work and how we can resolve it
now this is the git bash which we have
installed to run some git commands now
in this one first of all i'm going to
create uh two repositories so i'm going
to run the command call git init
a
that will initialize a repository
get init b that will initialize a b
repository here so to repository i have
got a and b now in uh basis a what i'm
going to do is that i'm going to add the
little mode so get remote
add origin so i'm just trying to add the
origin over here so the origin over here
in this one is the maven build so this
is a repository which i have got into my
github account the moment you do this
what next you can do over here is that
you can run the particular
next git pull command to fetch the
latest updates here
right so next move to the particular
next command here
now when you do this what will happen
that all the changes which is present in
the remote repository or central
repository will be available here also
right so you will be able to see some
couple of files all together here now
the same activity you have to do in the
particular
b directory also or in the particular b
repository also so you have to add the
url the remote url here
and in this case also we are trying to
fetch the particular values here now
what will happen that uh we will be
doing some modification in the
particular a repository and then we will
be pushing that uh change to the remote
repository and then through the b when
we try to push the changes so in that
situation we will try to see that what
really happens do we really get the
merge conflicts because both of them
although is trying to do the changes to
the central repository but these two
repository represents two different uh
local repositories probably in two
different developers
machines over here so that's what we are
trying to replicate here so i'm going
back to the a directory here so that i
would be able to do some changes all
together so i'm just opening readme.md
file here so pretty much i'm just trying
to add some vertical changes over here
to this uh particular file so this is
what we are trying to do here
now let me add some particular
additional and a particular new line
over here in the file and then save the
content now once this is done i will be
able to see that yes there is an
particular change which is done all
together here so you will be running git
add command
and then get commit command to save the
commits all together
so we are giving a particular commit
here so that we will be able to identify
that this is something which we have
committed from repo a now once this is
done i will be doing the push activity
so that i can push these changes to the
particular remote or the central
repository here so exactly what we did
over here so far we have a particular
downloaded remote repository in a
repository a and then we are doing some
changes some modifications and once
those modifications are done we are
pretty much changing or putting up that
new commit all together to the github
repository so this is what we are trying
to do so far over here in this one so
this git push activity will uh take the
particular access
right so when i do the particular push
activity here so if the credentials are
saved then that's fine otherwise it will
ask for the particular username and
password all together here so that will
be asked by the particular activity here
so it will ask for the password so all
you have to do is that you have to just
share that password and your git push
activity should be passed on or should
be you know
done there and as you can see that
changes really got moved to the github
repository now sometimes the credentials
get expired so you may get some
particular message saying that you have
to put some password there a particular
interactive window will be open there
and you have to prompt or you have to
provide that password and according to
that it will proceed further
right so this will eventually help you
to move the changes into the github
repository altogether so all of your
changes will be pushed to the github
central repository
right after some time it really pushes
my comments to the remote repository it
will take some time depending on the
network connectivity and the kind of
changes you are trying to upload so now
since uh my particular repository is
done so what i can do is that i can
further go back to the uh particular
directory here now what we can do is
that we can go back to the beat
repository over here and in this case
also i'm just trying to do some
modifications so for instance that uh
i'm just trying to
do the changes here to the readme file
again of kind of for changes in this one
now in this case i'm trying to delete
this line the last line i'm trying to
delete here or a couple of modifications
i want to do over here like
added data
from
repo
and then for the most i want to have let
me do some arrangement like let me have
this
data added all together over here
or i can add it
yes so data is added and this data is
removed so the idea is that we can do
different kind of reshuffling of the
data up and down so that we can
understand that how it really works so i
have shuffled the data i have removed a
couple of lines and let's see that how
it works right so i have even added some
couple of lines of volte here in this
new line i have added one line i have
removed from the last and this
particular line i have shifted 5 6 line
up over here now let's me save this file
and then run the git add command
after this we are going to run the
particular comment here saying
commit
from
repo b
once commit is done same activity
pushing it to the remote repository now
let's see what really happens now when
we are trying to push uh this particular
change to the remote repository after
the change was pushed from repo a it
will throw an error saying that uh the
particular due to the conflicts the
updates are simply rejected here right
so in this case what really happens that
because
we are having a different stream of
source code in a remote repository and
from local repository you are trying to
push some different line of source code
so what next you need to do is that
first of all you need to do the activity
called get pull
hyphen hyphen release or agent master so
you're going to pull the changes from
the remote repository so that you should
be able to get some particular content
all together in this particular ripple b
over here now the moment you run this
let's wait for this activity
now once that is done you will be able
to see that you are seeing a message
saying that conflicts are there so first
of all you have to resolve this
conflicts and then it will be proceed
further you have some couple of options
like you have to resolve the conflicts
manually and uh because git is not able
to handle it otherwise once the gate
conflicts is resolved you can run git
reverse or iphone iphone continue if you
want to escape this commit so you can
say get rebase hyphen iphone skip and if
you want to abort the particular this
rebase here so in that case you can run
git rebase hyphen iphone abort
now uh since we want to manage or we
want to resolve this conflict manually
over here so what we need to do is that
we need to open the merge tool on this
one so once you open the merge tool from
there you will be able to resolve those
changes manually and then continue with
the array base so let's go with the get
merge tool here so we are going to use
the command called git merge tool now
when you run this so what will happen
that uh it will process it will open the
normal vi command line over here and all
the files will be processed all together
now uh this is the modifications right
which is uh you know which is done over
here uh so we are just trying to see
that which particular file or what
resultant file we want to configure here
right now in this case
since you are able to see that this is
the final file which is present and uh
here exactly the merge conflict comes up
because you can see that three different
files are given to you in this site so
you have some files in which you added
new two lines and here you added this
line there this artifact will be there
now here you also added this particular
new line instead of having this line
default here
so what exactly happens when you scroll
down you will be able to see that where
exactly is the particular issue or
whatever the different modifications you
stand there so in this one if you scroll
up and down you will be able to see that
what exactly it happens so the main area
of conflict is first of all this area
so this should not be there as per git
as per the normal file but yes if it is
there so we have to see whether we want
to continue or we want to proceed uh
with this particular specific file or
not so yes so i will say that okay uh
let's remove
this line let's not uh
just copy this line
let's delete this line here
and
add the line over here in this one
and uh
please this line also from here so this
is what i'm just trying to make use of
case now here i just want to have
the particular
line
pasted okay delete it
so this line i will
okay so i have added this line in the
final i'm just trying to resolve this
conflicts manually i'm just editing this
file here
trying to remove this one this one this
one
and uh this one so this is how my
particular
final file looks like and i'm good to go
to this one now you have resolved the
conflicts manually by uh doing the
modification to the file now just press
colon wq save the file okay and then
close the other files also
right
so this is how i have done the
modifications and i should be
able to continue further now so what i'm
going to do is like i'm going to run
command git previous i will even
continue now once that is done so
the particular commit which
or the modifications which you have got
over here so that is something which is
totally done and yes the reverse is
finalized over here now again this is
the manual modifications which you have
done so you should be good to go to push
to remote repository so again in this
case what you're going to do is they're
going to run like git push
before that if you want to check the
particular git log so you can check the
particular git log over here so the last
commit which we will try to doing like
commit from repo b is also available
over here right so a and b both changes
are present now so we should be able to
push the changes to remote repository
so it will take some time to do the push
and as you can see it's trying to uh put
some content so we'll still wait for the
final confirmation so that we can assure
that yes all the conflicts is resolved
and yes that's correct all the
particular conflicts are resolved and we
should be able to see both commit a and
commit b into the repository so let's go
back to the github portal and see that
if we really got those particular
comments in that
so let's when we access our particular
repository on github so we should be
able to see that uh we have got an
activity that uh the commit is checked
in there so if you go to the comments
part you should be able to see that you
have got these commits gun process all
together if you click on any one of the
commit you will be further able to see
also that what different changes you
actually moved so this is the way that
how you can resolve the conflicts and
you can take care of the changes from
two different developers or for two
different push activity so that's it for
this particular demo i hope you liked it
thanks everyone
so we are done with the demo and we have
understood that how we can resolve the
merge conflicts with the help of some
couple of commands now in this we really
have got an understanding that how the
different ways of merge conflicts really
gets originated and how we can
help or we can make use of some git
commands to resolve those things now get
into the next section which is source
code management and we're going to focus
specifically on git the reason being is
that get is really the most popular
source code management solution right
now there are other technologies out
there but for the types of distributed
environments that we have uh source code
management with git is probably the most
effective so the first question you'll
be asked when it comes to git is to talk
about the difference between centralized
and distributed version control and if
we look at the way that the two are set
up older technologies such as older
versions of team foundation server
though the current version does actually
have git in it but older versions
required a centralized server for you to
check in and check out of code the
developer in the centralized system does
not have all the files uh for the
application and if the centralized
server crashes then you actually lose
all of the history of your code now in
contrast a distributed model actually we
do check in our code to a server however
for you to be effective and building out
your solution you actually check out all
of the code for the solution directly
onto your local development machine so
you can actually have a copy of the
entire solution running on your local
machine this allows you to be able to
work effectively offline it really
allows
for scalability when it comes to
building out your team so if you have a
team that may be in europe you can
actually then scale that team with
people from asia from north america or
south america very easily and not have
to worry about whether or not they have
the right code or the wrong code and in
addition to that if the actual main
server where you're checking in your
code does crash it's not a big deal
because you actually have each person
has a copy of the code so as soon as the
server comes back up be able to check
back in and everybody's running back as
if there was nothing that happened at
all so one of the questions you'll be
asked is to give the answer to some of
the commands you use for working with
git so if you were to be asked the
question is what is the git command that
downloads any repository from github to
your computer on the screen we have four
options we have git push git fork get
clone and get commit the answer in this
instance would be git clone now if you
want to be able to push code from your
local system to a github repository
using git then first of all you want to
be able to do is connect the local
repository to a remote repository and in
the example you may want to talk about
using the command get remote add origin
and then the actual path to a github
repository you could if you wanted to
actually at this point also talk about
other repositories such as get lab that
you can also work with or a private git
repository that would be used just for
the development team once you've
actually then added the local repository
into your local computer then the second
action you want to use is a push which
is to actually push your local files out
to the master environment so you use the
command git push origin master so one
question you may be asked is what is the
difference between a bare repository and
a standard way of initializing a git
repository so let's look through what is
the standard way so the standard way
using git init allows you to create a
working directory using the command git
in it and then the folder that creates
is the folder that creates all the
revision history related to the work
that you're doing in contrast using the
bear way you have a different commands
for setting that up so it would be git
init dash dash bear and it does not
contain any working or checked out
source files locally on your machine in
addition the revision history is
actually stored in the root folder
versus a subfolder that you'd have with
the normal git init initialization so
which of the following cli commands
would you be used to rename a file so we
have git rm git mv get rm-r or none of
the above well in this instance it would
be get mv a question that you'll be
asked around commit is going to be what
is the process to revert a commit that
has already been pushed and made public
and there are two ways you can address
this the first is to actually
address the bad file in the new commit
and you can use the command git commit
dash m and then put in a comment for why
that file is being removed the second is
to actually create a new commit that
actually undoes all the changes that
were made with the bad commit and then
to do that you would use git revert and
then the commit id and the commit id and
it could be something such as 560e
0938f but you'd have to find that from
the the commit that you had made but
that would allow you to revert any bad
files that you had submitted so there
are two ways of being able to get files
from a get repository and you're going
to be asked to explain the difference
between git fetch and get paul so get
fetch allows you to fetch and download
only new data from a new repository it
does not integrate any of the new data
into your working files and it can be
undone at any time if you want to
break out the remote tracking branches
in contrast get pull updates the current
head branch with the latest changes from
the remote server so you get all of the
files and downloaded it downloads new
data and integrates it with the current
working files you have on your system
and it tries to merge remote changes
with your local ones so one of the
questions you'll get asked about git is
what is a good stash so as a developer
you will be working on the current
branch within a solution but what
happens if you come up with an idea
where it's something that will take a
different amount of time for you to be
able to complete but you don't want to
interrupt the mainline branch so what
you can actually do is you can actually
create a branch that allows you to start
working on your own work outside of the
main line branch and this is called get
stash allows you to be able to modify
your files without interrupting the
mainline branch so you once you start
talking about branching and git be
prepared to answer and explain the
concept of branching so essentially what
it allows you to do is
have a mainline master branch that has
all the code that the team is checking
in and checking out against but allows
you to have an indefinite number of
branches that allows for new features to
be built in parallel to the mainline
branch and then at some point be
reintroduced to the mainline branch to
allow the team to add in new features
and so if we look through the merge and
get rebase these are the two features
that you'd be using continuously to be
able to talk about how you take a branch
and merge it back into the mainline
branch so on the left hand side we have
git merge which allows you to take the
code that you're creating and merge it
back into the master on the right hand
side what you have is a slightly
different approach this is for projects
where you reach a point in a project
where you go okay we're going to
effectively restart the project at this
point in time and we want to ignore the
complete history that's happened before
that and that's called git rebase and
that would allow you to rewrite the
project history by creating a brand new
mainline branch that ignores all other
previous branches that have happened
before it you can if you want to very
quickly and easily find out all the
files that have been used to make a
particular commit so when somebody asks
you the question how do you find a list
of files has been changed in a
particular commit you can actually say
that all you have to go is find the
command get diff dash tree dash r and
then the hash that you would use for the
commit and that would actually then give
you a breakdown of all the files that
have been made with that particular
commit a question you'll be asked when
you're talking about merging files is
what is a merge conflict in git and how
can it be resolved so essentially a
merge conflict is when you have uh two
or more branches that are competing with
commits in git and you have to be able
to determine which is the appropriate
files that need to be submitted and this
is where you would go in and to actually
help resolve this issue you'd actually
go in and manually edit the conflicted
files to select the changes you want to
keep in the final merge so let me go
through the steps that you would take to
be able to illustrate this when you're
talking about this particular question
in your interview now there are
essentially four stages the first would
be under the repository name you want to
select a pull request and you want to be
able to show how that pull request would
be demonstrated inside of github so
within the pull request there's going to
be a highlight of conflict markers and
you'll be able to select which conflicts
you want to keep on which you want to
merge and which ones you want to change
so it's a step through how you would
actually resolve a merge conflict and
the first step would be under github you
want to be able to pull the repository
name and then the pull request around
that repository in the pull request list
click the pull request with a merge
conflict and that you'd like to be able
to resolve they'll pull up a file that
will list out all of the conflicts for
you near the bottom of that file will be
a list of the requests that need to be
resolved and then if you need to make a
decision on which branches you want to
keep or which ones you want to change
that will have to be something you have
to put in instructions inside of the
file you'll actually see that there are
conflict markers within the instructions
which are going to ask you which files
you want to change which ones you want
to keep if you have more than one merge
conflict in your file scroll down to the
next set of conflict markers and repeat
steps four and five until you resolve
all of the conflicts you will want to
mark your file as resolved in github so
that the repository knows that you are
having everything resolved if you have
more than one file with a conflict then
you want to go then onto the next file
and start working on those files and
just keep repeating the steps we've done
up to this point until you have all the
conflicts resolved and then once you
have all of the resolutions created then
you want to select the button which is
commit merge and then merge all your
files back into github and this will
take care and manage the resolution of
the merge conflict within github so you
can also do this through command line
and with the command line you want to
use get bash and so you want to as a
first step open up get bash and then
navigate to the local git repository in
command line by using the cd change
directory and then list out the the
actual folder where you actually are
putting all of your code and then uh you
want to be able to generate a list of
the files that are affected with the
merge conflict and in this instance here
you can actually see the file style
filestyleguy.md has a merge conflict in
it and as before with working with
github you actually go through and use a
text address and use any text editor but
as you go through and edit out what you
want to keep and what you want to
manage in your conflict so you actually
have a resolution that's been created so
that you'll be able to then once you
you're using the conflict markers you
can actually merge your files together
so that the solution itself will allow
you to incorporate your commits
effectively into the resolution once
you've gone through and applied your
changes you're able to then merge the
conflicted commits into a single commit
and able to push that up to your remote
repository and with that we have come to
