learn about conditional formatting in
excel but before we begin make sure that
you have subscribed to our youtube

simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is conditional formatting in excel so
conditional formatting is a method to
visualize your worksheet we already have
the charts in excel to visualize our
excel sheets in graphical form but what
if you had to see or visualize the data
in your worksheet as it is so that is
where the condition formatting comes
handy now let's get back to the
microsoft excel and try to implement
some conditional formatting
now we are on the excel worksheet this
particular data set is based on a store
now we have various columns in this
particular data set we have row id order
id customer name etc and finally we have
quantity discount and profits
now let's go to profits
let us imagine that we have provided
this particular store with a target of
minimum 15 percent profits now let us
find out the stocks that have hit the 15
target and the ones which did not so for
that let us select the entire column
now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home toolbar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
styles has the condition formatting
option click on that
and you have various options over here
highlighting the cells top bottom rules
data bars data scales and icons so data
bars are actually the bar graphs which
highlight themselves on each and every
cell if you implement them and these are
the color scales if you want to
implement some colors you can go through
that and if you want to represent
yourself with icons you can also do that
for now let's highlight the cells
so select that and inside this select
the greater than option and here you can
provide the percentage
that is 15 percent
and
the cells or the stores which hit the
target should be highlighted with the
green color
and select ok and there you go you have
your stores that hit the 15 percent
target and the ones which did not hit
the 15 percent target now if we want to
highlight the ones which did not hit the
15 target you can highlight them with
the color
red
so
conditional formatting highlight the
cells
less than 15 percent
with color red and text dark
and there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
id survived passenger class name etc
now we have a train accident incident
over here now one is indicated that they
are alive and zero is indicated that
they are not alive
now let us use this column and
conditional formatting highlight the
cells
containing the text as one
with color green
ok
and
highlight the cells
that contain text 0 as the red that
indicates they are not alive
and let us select the icons
now we have the icons over here the x
indicates that they are not alive and
the green tick mark indicates that they
are alive
now that is how you use conditional
formatting in excel with that we have
come to an end of this tutorial on
conditional formatting in excel if you
