box now let's get started so guys let's
start with an introduction to animation
and figma guys do you know that
animation and figma empowers designers
to breathe life into their designs
elevating user experiences and enhancing
visual storytelling with intuitive tools
and seamless interface figma enables
designers to create captivating
animations directly with their design
projects from subtile transition to
complex interactions figma's animation
features offer a wide range of
possibilities for bringing designs to
life now if you talk about key frame
then key frame animations serve as a
foundation for creating Dynamic movement
within figma designers can set key
frames to define the starting and ending
states of an animation and figma
automatically generates the in between
frames to achieve smooth motion easing
options further refine the animation
allowing designers to control the
acceleration and deceleration for a more
natural fi if I talk about transitions
transitions enable designers to animate
changes between different states or
screen within designs adding fluidity
context to user interaction interactive
components in figma allow designers to
prototype complex interactions and user
flows now this was some of the basic
idea regarding animation in figma which
we are going to study later on so
whether it's animating UI elements for a
mobile application or crafting engaging
micro interaction for a website
animations and figma empowers designers
to unleash their creativity and deliver
immersive
experiences now let's move on forward
and try to set up our figma so setting a
figma for animation involves few key
steps that you have the necessary tool
set the first thing that you have to do
is so guys go to your Google Chrome and
there is
figma just click on this so you're going
to see this first site this is the
official site of figma just click on
this and in this you're going to get so
before that since I've already logged in
so it's going to ask you the
authentication for your Gmail so you can
set up your Gmail account all over here
now what's the next thing that you can
do guys you can start with a new project
now guys what you can do all over here
just click on design
file now here
is okay just click on all over here so
here you can see here you have set up
your basic stuff and here you can create
a new project now as far as there are
two proposal for it the first one is the
free version so if you are a student or
someone who is trying to learn you can
try using the free version but I will
always recommend you if you are aspiring
uiu designer then you should definitely
take up the paid version of this because
it offers lot of features which can
really enhance your UI development
process now in this way we have set up
our project and just uh say suppose let
us choose a frame okay all over here and
uh so I've have selected this Frame and
let us draw a
normal say a button stuff so you can see
in this way you have set up your figma
now let's try to understand the basics
animation princip Le so guys
understanding animation basics is very
crucial for creating engaging and
effective animations in figma the first
one is key frames guys key frames marks
the beginning and end points of an
animation sequence in figma you can set
key frames to Define the initial and
final states of an object or an element
figma automatically generates the in
between frames known as twings to create
smooth motion between the key frames the
next one that we have all over here is
easing guys easing controls the
acceleration and deceleration of an
animation it determines how an object
moves between the key frames affecting
the speed and timing of the animation
figma offers various easing options such
as ease and ease out ease and out and
linear each producing different motion
effect easing is essential for creating
natural and Visually pleasing
animations next one is trans transtions
transitions are animations that occur
when transitioning between different
states or screen within the design for
example transitioning between pages in a
mobile app or changing states of a
button when hoard over figma transition
feature allows you to specify duration
easing and properties to animate
enabling smooth and seamless transition
between Design Elements now if I talk
about some of the basic principles the
first one that comes up to my mind is
time
guys timing refers to the duration and
rhythm of an animation it's essential to
consider the timing of each animation
element to ensure it aligns with the
overall flow of the design and user
interaction next one is spacing spacing
refers to the distribution of key frames
and distance between animation elements
proper spacing helps to create a sense
of movement and flow ensuring that
animations feels natural and cohesive
the third one we have is overlap and
follow through overlapping actions and
follow through add realism to animations
by simulating the behavior of Real World
objects objects don't always move in
perfect sync some parts may move faster
or slower than others creating sense of
depth and functionality and also
exaggeration exaggeration involves
amplifying the movement or behavior of
animated elements to make them more
visually appealing and
engaging so guys by understanding these
animation basics you'll be better
equipped to create compelling animations
in figma that enhances user experiences
and bring your designs to life now we
are going to move on the Hands-On part
where we are going to create a simple
animation so guys let us create a simple
animation so as you can see I have
selected a frame all over here and for
our prototype we are going to take
iPhone 8 you can choose any one of them
as you can see it has a lot of various
options now I have selected this Frame
now what we going to do let us select a
shape and for our case we are going to
take rectangle so here you can see I
have made one rectangle of 280 cross 63
siid you can take it something like this
or you can minimize it based on your
choice now let us go to the design as
you can see and here let's add the
corner radius so for the left one I'll
put 50 right one 50 then and right
bottom 5050 and left bottom I'm going to
take
50 so this is uh makes a kind of an
equidistant stuff so now we'll move on
and try to change the
color so for this we are going to take a
normal red
color and let us try to draw one
Circle so here is a ellipse all over
here of 41 cross 41 size
now what we are going to do we are going
to change its color so for changing its
color let us choose black as its
color now click on the text and uh say
you can also add certain things like uh
off okay so which denotes is ADD uh as
an on or an off but for red is there so
we are going to choose that it is an on
so as you can see here uh let us change
the size from 20 to 12 okay this looks
pretty diminished okay let us try to
change again from okay now it's clear
so now let's copy this Frame okay
and yeah so this is our second
frame so as you can see all over here
now we are going to change change the
name of the text from on to off and I'm
going to put it on the right end of
it so write off all over
here pretty good now let us move on and
let us try to add connection from this
on you can see the ellipse all over here
from here to this next frame which is
frame two
so let us make a
connector so right click on the box go
to prototype and
uh click on the plus
button and here you can see the arrow
will be pointed out to the next frame
which is frame
two now you can choose an animation all
over here so basically I have selected
smart animate so so I'll also show you
lot of various other animation options
so just click on Smart animate and you
can see there is dissolve move in move
out slide in slide out there are various
type of Animation which you can apply to
your prototype design now since I have
chos uh smart animation and uh in under
which I have chosen ease in and EAS out
and the time frame would be 600
milliseconds now let's move on and uh
let us make another connector from off
off to frame
one so this is been connected and let us
see now after doing all this what you
have to do guys as you can see all over
here there's a present button so just
click on
this now let us try to see how our
animation is working so if you're trying
to click on on button so as you can see
it's going on but there's something
wrong about
so as you can see when it's going off
then the color is not changing so we
might change its color so let us remove
the red
color okay to a normal little bit light
color which shows us that our device is
kind of in an off position so now click
again and you can see if this thing is
happening you can see a very beautiful
animation is coming out so this depicts
that it is in on position and when you
click on this it goes on the off
position so this is one form of a simple
basic animation guys which we have
learned today and in that way you can
make a lot of Animation using this tool
so guys that was all for today's video I
