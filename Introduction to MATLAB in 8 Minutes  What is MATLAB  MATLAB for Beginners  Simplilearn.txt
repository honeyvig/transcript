foreign
of Technologies such as control system
machine learning signal processing deep
learning and Robotics and many other
high demand fields that deals with the
huge varieties of data analyzing this
massive amount of data is difficult but
Matlab makes it simple there are
multiple tools available in the market
but still Matlab is the most popular
tool used in all these domains for data
analytics algorithm development and app
development so a solid understanding of
this software can open up a more
opportunities for you in I demand fields
to help you understand Matlab simply
known as created this amazing video on
what is Matlab before we get into topic
I have a question for you do you guys
know which software is used for
numerical competition
if you know the answer please mention it
in the comment section the agenda for
today's session is as follows first
we'll understand what is Matlab then the
features of Matlab advantages and
disadvantages of Matlab usage of Matlab
and at last we'll see career
opportunities in Matlab before proceding
into the video just a gentle reminder to
click on the Subscribe button and hit
the Bell icon to make sure you get all
the updates from the simpler now let's
see what is Matlab Matlab is a software
used for high performance visualization
mathematical computation and programming
Matlab stands for Matrix laboratory that
was originally known as mattress
programming language many technical
Fields rely on Matlab for data analysis
problem solving and algorithm
development after getting a brief
understanding of Matlab now let's see
the features of Matlab in the field of
data science Matlab is extremely
powerful Scholars engineer and
scientists who already use Matlab find
it very easy to learn and apply due to
its functionalities and this feature has
a potential to attract new students now
let's see some of the excellent features
of Matlab twin in the eye level language
Matlab is high level language with the
structure object oriented programming
and a rapid creation of application
programs next is an interactive
environment natlab provides an
interactive environment that allows you
to design and solve problems next is
handling Graphics it offers a built-in
Graphics useful for data visualization
and the tools for generating custom
plots next is a mathematical function
Library it offers a huge mathematical
function library that requires for
computing statistics linear algebra
numerical integration and many more and
the last feature is toolbox a toolbox is
a set of functions created for a
specific purpose and it includes Matlab
code apps data examples and
documentation currently these features
are widely applied in the industry's
medical appliances Industrial Automation
and Aerospace for various purpose and
companies like double slash AMD and
addest as use Matlab for their tech
stocks after learning about the features
of Matlab now it's time to see the
advantages and disadvantages of Matlab
there are several advantages of Matlab
programming language the First Advantage
is easy to use tools such as integrated
editor online documentation workspace
browser and much more help us to make
Matlab a user friendly the second one is
platform Independence Matlab support of
various computer system allowing a
considerable platform Independence where
application return on one platform will
be run on another and the third one is a
predefined function Matlab has a huge
library of predefined functions that
provides tested solutions for primary
technical tasks and the fourth one is
device independent plotting Matlab has a
many primary plotting and imaging
commands plots and the pictures can be
shown on any graphical output device the
computer uses on which Matlab runs and
the last Advantage is graphical user
interface Matlab includes a tool that
allows a programmer to interactively
design a graphical user interface for
its program when it comes for
disadvantages there are only two major
disadvantages of Matlab firstly Matlab
is an interpreted language as Matlab is
an interpreted language it may execute
more slowly than the compiled length
this problem can be checked by properly
structuring the Matlab program secondly
the cost a complete copy of a Matlab is
5 to 10 times more expensive than a
traditional C compile this comparatively
high cost is more expensive for an
engineer or a scientist who built or
King program so Matlab is a cost
effective for a business it's time to
understand the different fields that
Matlab is used Matlab is a powerful tool
that can be used for a wide range of
applications like first one math and
computation the symbolic function
represents the math function in math for
example you can find the value of a
function by passing a value for a
variables in a given equation first
create a function f and X and Y using a
symbolic function then assign an
equation at last pass a value for the
variables and the Second Use is
algorithm development an algorithm can
be written in any understandable
language for example consider it
equation create a vector and compute the
sum of its elements in Matlab we can
write this as first create a vector a
and then pass a value from 1 to 10 then
find the sum using the sum function of
Matlab and the third one is modeling
simulation and prototyping modeling is a
way of creating a virtual representation
of real world system like block diagram
and state diagram the stimulation helps
to predict the system's Behavior and the
prototyping is a way of modifying the
Edo file information data analysis and
visualization Matlab provides a wide
range of built-in data analysis and
visualization functions for example fill
missing function sort Pro functions land
plots scatter charts Etc the fifth one
is application development including a
graphical user interface building Matlab
automatically generates a code for
Designing the GUI the generated code
contains a commands that that can make
it easy for the programmer to understand
what the code enables
now let's see the career opportunities
in Matlab when you hear about a popular
programming language I am sure you will
be worried about its future job
opportunities
and the popular job opportunities in
Matlab are the first one is a data
scientist
data science the field that grows at a
lightning speed and often uses Matlab in
their work so having a hands-on
experience in Matlab is a plus point for
you the average salary for this position
is 10 lakhs in India and 1 lakh 45 358
dollars in U.S next is a machine
learning expert another New Field which
highly rely on Matlab is AI and machine
learning Matlab uses often for feature
extraction and Signal processing in
machine learning the average salary of a
machine learning expert is 8 lakhs in
India and 1 lakh 36 396 dollars in U.S
and the next one is control system
engineer control system engineer designs
and implements a dynamic system most of
the work of a control system engineer
involves a building a complex
mathematical model and Matlab is one of
the best tool for this purpose the
average salary for this position is 6.2
lakhs in India and 90 the seven thousand
nine fifty five dollars in U.S the next
is a computational finance specialist
computational Finance uses a
computer-based tools and techniques to
solve the Practical problems related to
finance Matlab allows to build a complex
model in just a few lines and code that
manages a huge financial portfolios the
average salary of this position is 7.06
lakhs in India and 82 000 for 88 dollars
in U.S with this we have reached the end
of this session today we have learned
the basic understanding of Matlab its
features its advantages and usage please
