YouTube channel today's session will be
a guide for you to create your own
preppy Bird game but before we begin if
you love watching Tech videos subscribe
to our Channel like the tutorial and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
and before starting let us have a simple
quiz question to pressure upon our
knowledge and your question is which Pi
game function is used to set the size of
the window
and your options are first option is
pygame dot display dot set underscore
mode function and your second option is
pygame.display.set underscore size
function and your third option is by
game dot display dot set underscore
screen function and a fourth option is
none of this
please answer in the comment section
below and we'll update the correct
answer in the pin comment you can pause
the video give it a thought and answer
in the comment section
and I have an insightful for you guys
if you are focused on building strong
Foundation skills for career growth in
that case you can check out a free
course to Learn Python Basics with the
completion certification from scale up
by simply alone you can check the scores
with the link in the description box
below
now moving to our project
first we will create a folder
and you guys have already played the
Flappy Bird game
I will show you the demo but we'll
create first
and here we have
created the folder Flappy Bird
and inside we'll open the command prompt
okay
input an error
yeah
we'll just open the command prompt
and now to open our ideally that is
Visual Studio code we will write the
command code space period and press
enter
it will open the visual studio code for
us
now here we will create the file
and name it as bird Dot py
and here we will start with the code
and to code we need some images and
sounds and this is our
project that we're going to make that is
a fairy Bird game so we'll just
run it for you guys and show you how it
works
so this is our Flappy Bird window
and when we just press space as we have
set the functioning
for it
which space yeah I just got five points
so this is the demo what we're gonna
make
so let's start with it we'll close this
and start with our project
and for starting
first we need is installing and
importing the packages and what you need
to
install and import this first is the
random Library
and for that
I will write import random and if you
want to
install it you could just write the
Command Web install random or you can
search on the browser
random Library
installation python you will get the
command though that would be the PIP
command and after that we will import
the sys Library
system library and for that the command
is PIP install OS hyphen SOS or you can
just search for that you could run these
commands in your command prompt or in
your terminal of your ideally
after that we will import
Pi game
and
after that we will import
buy a game dot locals
and import all the files from there
okay
and it's showing us error just see
import buy game dot locals
port
okay oh sorry
from pie game
yeah
and the SOS Library
will use this just to exit the game
window that would be system.exist SOS
dot exit
okay
and now moving on we will start with the
global variables for a game
and we'll start with FPS what should be
the FPS over game and we'll set it as
32.
and the screen width that would be the
global variable screen width and we'll
set it as 289 after that we have screen
height
and we will set it as 5 1 1. after that
we will call the screen
that is first we'll create the variable
screen and inside
will go buy game dot display
Dot
set underscore mode and if you guys
remember the quiz question
you would get the idea from here
and inside will pass screen width and
Screen height
screen
width and
screen height
now moving on
we will create a variable ground y
that is
for the reference of the ground in
y-axis and that would be
screen height
multiplied by
0.8 these calculations I have done with
probability I have
like inserted 1.6 and then I have
inserted 1.2 and then I've set it at 0.8
with the accordance of our screen width
and height I have set this round y equal
to screen height into 0.8
and now
game sprites now I will show you
what pictures or what Sprites we gonna
use in this game
for that we'll just
create
and for game sounds
we'll also create that and now moving on
to
Flappy Bird this is a Flappy Bird and we
have the gallery here these are Sprites
that we'll use we'll use these numbers 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 to calculate the score
and it would be displayed on the
background this is the background image
that we'll use this is the base image
and this would be our bird that with the
Flappy Bird but I have used Angry Bird
image here and this would be a welcome
screen this is a base pipes that we
gonna avoid while flapping
and I have downloaded some audios
that would be the swoosh sound hit sound
and the point sound to calculate the
points and these are the free sounds
that I have downloaded from the YouTube
dashboard these are free music
so anyone can use that
so to use them
I will paste this folder Gallery folder
in the same folder of Flappy Bird
so that we don't have to write the whole
path to use them okay
now we'll create a variable
for our Angry Bird Player okay
and we will import the image that is in
the gallery folder
and then we have Sprites and the name is
bird dot PNG
now for the background
we will create the global variable that
would background and inside we will call
the image
and that is stored in gallery
slash
and inside the Sprites
and inside
that is
background dot PNG
okay
now
we'll create one more variable that
would be pipe and that would be using in
the whole game so we'll create its
Global variable
and here
we will write its path that is Gallery
Splash Sprites
splash the name of the image that is
pipe.png
you could write the whole path if you
have your images stored in another
folder okay
so we know that we will use the assist
module to exit the game and the command
would be tested exit and after importing
we have declared all the global
variables and set the frames
and now moving on
we have set the ground y
now we will create the main function and
the program will be executed but we'll
write in this main function control will
start from here
so to execute this function over to
Define this function
will create if name equal to equal to
and inside we have Main
and this will be the main point from
where our game will start and will
initialize the pi game here that is pi
game Dot
initialize init and after that
we will
control the FPS lock
FPS clock
we will create the variable FPS oh sorry
FPS clock
and inside
we will use Pi game function that is Spy
game dot time Dot
clock
okay
now we'll set the captions for the
display the window it should be
displaying the Flappy Bird on the top of
that for that we'll write the command Pi
game dot display
dot set underscore
caption
and inside we'll write
Lappy bird
and now we'll set the game sprites
numbers
but before that
uh not before that first will do here
only
so
game spreads
we will
take its variable and inside
you will write the numbers
that is the counting numbers we will use
for
counting our points and
to get them initialized we will
use the pi game Dot image.load and for
that
what we'll do
we'll write and use the function Pi game
dot image Dot load and inside this we
will import the image that is stored in
gallery Splash Sprites
slash
0 Dot PNG
okay
and now we'll convert
use the convert Alpha function
okay and connection to server we will
just update it
as it's showing our connection go
disposed
we will just
open the command prompt again
that is CMD and first we'll save this
I don't know why
but
it stopped
uh CMD
and inside all right
code space period
you know I think the connection is
initialized now
terminal
so you have this connection is good too
now moving on
what we were using convert underscore
Alpha
and it is used to set the FPS of the
image
we have initialized the pi game module
and then set the FPS glow now we have
set the caption and now we are creating
a game spreads Tuple and total convert
Alpha will optimize the image for game
that is pixels and the FPS and will pass
all the images now we'll create
phone message and pipes but first we'll
create all for the numbers
okay so we'll just do that that is 0.
PNG and we are using convert underscore
Alpha
function
okay and then comma as we are
doing for all the numbers
so we'll just copy paste them
we have done four zero dot PNG
and we have used the convert dot Alpha
we'll copy this
paste this
and use one dot PNG
and then 2. PNG
a DOT PNG
oh
five
six
seven
eight
and then nine
four five
we should write the code as fast as we
can
so we can use these the cut copy paste
wherever required
okay now we are set with these images
that is the counting images and we have
started with convert underscore Alpha
function okay now moving on now we'll
come to
pipes
and base
so we'll create a message for them
okay now starting with them
we will
use the convert function for them
and for message
we'll create the Tuple again that would
be
game
underscore
Sprites
and
inside will pass
message this time
and that would be equal to
Pi game and we'll use the image.load
to load
in the images
and then we will set the path of the
images that is
gallery
slash
rights
splash
message dot PNG I'll show you
what is the message.png
that is the welcome window so we are
setting for it okay
and for that also we'll use convert
Alpha function okay
that is dot convert underscore
Alpha
okay
now
moving on now we'll set the base and for
that we'll write game underscore Sprites
and now
we will do for the base image
I will show you the base image this is
the base image that would be the base
for the game
now with the base image
will load the base image and for that
we'll write pygame dot image
dot load
and after that we will pass the
will copy the hole and just paste it
now we'll pass the location
and the name of the image is paste.png
okay and use the convert underscore
Alpha
function
for its FPS
and now
we'll use the same for pipe
so we'll just copy this
and use it
for pipe now here we'll pass the pipe
and that is spygame dot load and the
image name is
pipe
okay
but in have a catcher what we have to do
is to rotate the pipes
so we don't have to use only the
image.load we have to use the rotate
function also that is present in the pi
game so we have set the Tuple that is
game spreads
pipe
okay
yeah
okay we are going good
and now to rotate that we'll use the pi
game function and for that
we'll start with the
round brackets and inside we'll call
pygame Dot
transform
Dot
rotate
and here
will store Pi game dot image dot load
but image we want to rotate
and inside
we'll just pass the image
as we have created a global variable for
that and we have stored the
path of the image there
so we don't have to write the path here
just a second
we'll just write the name of the global
variable that was pipe
so here
we will just
pass pipe
okay
and here
we have this okay
and here we are using dot convert Alpha
and give the rotation as 180 degree
and we'll close that
okay on the brexit loss now we'll
provide a comma to that and now
will load the pipe and convert Alpha use
the convert Alpha
that is pi game
dot image
dot load
and inside will pass
pipe
and use
Dot
convert underscore
Alpha function
okay and here we'll close the bracket
that is we have started one bracket here
okay
and close it here
not Alpha we have
and we have a comma here and here
just a second
okay okay we don't
close it
okay we went 110 degree
[Music]
okay now yeah it's good to go
now for the game sounds what we need to
do
we will
we have created a global variable there
we will use that that is game sounds
and inside will
make a tuple and use the die sound first
that is when the Flappy Bird dies
foreign
we'll just use the mixer class
and
make it sound in a game
so for that we'll use Pi game
Dot
mixer
dot sound
and inside will pass
gallery
slash
and in the audio folder we have die Dot
wav okay
now we'll just copy it and use it for
other sounds
now we'll use it for
head sound
and for that we have head dot wav
if
gets hit with a pipe and after that hit
some we have the point Zone the points
when the points increase
the point sound should be played
and
then we have the smooth sound
that is when the bird is flapping
and the bird flapping but yeah so sound
I will show you where it will be used
then we have the wing sound
and
that sound is stored in bing dot wav
now we are done with the game sounds
now we are left with background image
player image
and how
should we
use them or load them
so for that we'll use the game
underscores rights
and
inside
the Tuple
we will
pass background
and that would be
Pi game Dot
image dot load okay to load the image
image we'll use spygame dot image dot
load and inside we will pass the
background
that would be the variable that we have
created above that is the global
variable and in which we have stored the
path of the image and now we'll just use
the convert note convert underscore
Alpha we'll just use the convert here
for background because it would be
fixed for whole game
it will just monitor its FPS
no
we will
use games Sprites
variable
and in the Tuple here we'll pass
the player
and for player
will use
Pi game dot image dot load
and inside
will pass the
name of the global variable which has
the
make path for the image and here we will
use the convert underscore Alpha
function
okay
now
and we'll write
Main
game and we will create this function
and we will also create the welcome
screen function
so for that
we have a while loop in the pi game I
will tell you about that
holds the game again and again we will
create the welcome screen function
and the main game function
okay
so welcome screen function with show
welcome screen to the user until he
presses a button and Main game this is
the main game function
okay and we have
created the pipe and put one pipe
downwards we have make the rotation as
180 degree now
we have added the game sounds and we
have downloaded it free from the YouTube
dashboard and we've used the pi game dot
mixer dot sound object and we will use
all the sounds
now we'll use background and player
blading
how they will blade like for when we'll
play the game they would be blitting at
any particular FPS
so for that we have used
the convert and convert underscore Alpha
function
no
now we will make welcome screen function
and the main game function we will
define those
but
now we have just declared them
there is a welcome free screen and it
will show the welcome screen to the user
until user presses the button and Main
game function that will return When the
game will get over and it will call
welcome screen and the game will start
again
now we will
start with the
welcome screen function
okay and inside
so this function would use to show the
welcome images on the screen and we'll
start with
getting a variable and naming it player
X
and
we will create this coordinate as
integer
and we'll set it as
screen
width
divided by
5.
I will
explain you how I have
arrived with this calculation and with
this coordinates and I am
setting the player y coordinate that is
the bird coordinate
where it should be present on the
welcome screen
and its height should be
screen height
minus
game sprites
that would be the
itself right that would be the player
side
minus player
and
do it
get height divided by 2 means it should
be in the middle and its height should
be
deducted from that
okay
now note get height
function
that is get height
and
we will divide it by 2.
okay
we'll divide the
right by 2 then
that is the screen height minus game
sprites player that is we have created
the variable game sprites
and the player height the
height of the image of the player
okay and we use the tot get height
function to get its height and we'll
minus that from the screen height and
then we will divide it by 2 okay
I will show you
what I want to
tell you when but I am setting here
so this is the welcome screen and this
is the x coordinate
that is what we have set screen width
divided by 5.
we have set the screen width in the
starting that is the close variable
divided by 5 this is the x coordinate
and for the y coordinate we have minus
that is screen height minus the player
height divided by 2.
okay
now
moving on
now we will set the height of the
message
okay for the x coordinate
we will write int and inside
all right
screen width
and we'll minus the game sprites message
height or the message wait sorry okay
minus
game sprites
message okay and to get its width we
will use the function dot get underscore
with
and then we will divide the whole width
by 2. okay
now
we will declare a variable message y
and set its height in the y direction
first we'll create it for integer and
then use the global variable that is
screen height
and we will multiply it by
0.13
I have taken all the assumptions and all
the probability with these numbers
that's why I've came to this decision of
taking it at 0.13 with this screen width
and Screen height so it suits best for
me if you change the screen width and
screen right then you should probably
change with the multiple of 0.13 or you
could just
apply the probability
just change the numbers and see what
would be best suiting it okay
into 0.13 and the base
if you see the base image
I will take back
to our Sprites so this is our base image
so for that we'll set base X and that
would be at zero
and now
we will run the while loop while true
and we run the while loop for events so
for event in pi game
okay
we'll use the event Dot
get function
okay and inside this function
I will show you what we're going to use
like if user clicks on the cross button
then we'll just close the game for that
we'll use the if statement that is if
event Dot
type
that is
equal to equal to
quit
or
or we'll also set some other keys to
quit the game if the player that is
playing the user
click these events so the game just
shuts down or quit okay that would be
even though type
equal to equal to key down
that is and we'll also use the key up to
start the game okay key down
and we will also write another that
would be K underscore Escape okay
and event dot key
equal to equal to
K underscore
Escape
ok
and for this event
what should we do
now we will set the command that would
be Pi game Dot
quit
okay
and after that system dot exit
so the game would be closed
now if the user presses space or up key
then we'll start the game for them
for that
we'll just write the alif statement
and inside this alif statement we will
set the events
that is alif event Dot
type
that is
would be the space or key up
now
in window type that is equal to equal to
first we'll set key up and after that
we will also set
event
Dot key
that is equal to equal to K
underscore space key
okay if the user presses the space key
then also
the event would start
or event
key
that is equal to equal to
K underscore
up okay we have set the up key here
so what we will do we'll set the key
down here
that is these events should be true and
if we just press the key down then the
game should restart okay we should
return to the main game
foreign
for that we'll write the command here
we have set the alif statement and we'll
just write return
okay
and now we will return to the main game
and the main game starts now
we will write the else condition
and that would be for the blading that
would be screen would be bleeding
for the background and where we should
set it
okay
now
put that
I will use the
screen variable and use the plate
function
and inside
and use background
that would be
we have stored in game sprites we have
loaded the background image
okay and where it should be bleeding we
will set it here that would be comma
and in the brackets we will
make the code in its zero comma zero
okay
now here we will BLT it again
note again but the player will bleed the
player on the welcome window
for that we'll use screen dot blade
and we have game underscore
Sprites and inside
values
player
and
here we would pass the coordinates for
the player that we have signed
that is player X comma
player y okay
now we will let the message
screen
oh sorry
we'll just copy it
and paste it here
now for the message
um
we'll use message pass the message
and use the x and y coordinate of
message
that is message X
and message y
okay
now
moving on
we will set the updating of the base
and the welcome screen
now for base
so base has the basics and we have set
the ground y the global variable for
that
if you remember
or just go at the top or when I will
share the code with you uh with a GitHub
profile you can just download it there
download it from there and see
where I have
set the ground by global variable I will
show you
so here is a ground wire that is screen
height into 0.8 and I have calculated
this with the probability that what
suits my screen width and Screen height
okay
now moving on we have set the plating of
the base
now
we'll use the display dot update
function to update these bleedings
that would be
buy game
dot display
Dot
update
function
and now
we'll use the FPS
cloak that we have set in the main
function
and Dot tick function and pass the FPS
that we have set it at 32. so we update
all the images on the welcome scheme and
now we have to run this update function
to show the images and we'll control our
FPS with the FPS clock.tick
now the welcome screen is done
and moving on
now we will Define the
main game function okay
so starting with main game we will
define it
main game
and inside first we'll set a variable
and set its score equal to zero
now we have set the score equal to zero
now we'll set the x coordinate of the
player X
that is
layer X
first we have set the player X and pair
Y for the welcome screen now we are
setting it for the game from where it
should start
so that would be the same only when the
game starts
and the player would be at that position
and from there only it should start that
is screen width divided by 5. and the
player y position
we will set it as
Queen height
divided by
2.
and we'll set the base X and that should
be set and that is equal to zero we'll
plate the base now we will create
another function that would be the
random pipes to show the pipes okay
now
well
create a function get random pipe
so we get the random pipe with random
height
okay so this will generate the positions
of two pipes that is one bottom State
and the one top rotated for bleeding on
the screen so first we'll create a
variable that would be the pipe height
foreign
for that we will call the
Global variable game sprites and create
Tuple
or pipe
and
sets the zeroth position
to get its height
okay
now we will set the offset
and that should be equal to
screen height divided by 3.
and Y2
that should be equal to
offset
Plus
random
Dot it would
take any random range number and it
would add to the offset okay
rent range
and inside the range we will pass
0 to that is
what height will pass that would be the
Green height
minus the base height
it could
set any height
minus
game underscore
just Sprites
the piece
and we should get the height of that for
that we'll use the get underscore
height function
okay
now
what we need to do is minus 1.2
into
offset
and here we close it so this is the Y2
and moving on so these are the numbers
that I have seen and drawn with the
probability and how it fixes my screen
width and skin height it suits my screen
with transcending now the pipe X version
that would be the screen width
plus 10 it should be
10 size here that is
right side
okay now
we will see the y1 height
that is
pipe height but we will get
okay and minus by 2
plus offset
and now
intake pipe that's
inside
we will create
and for x
huh
set the pipex
and
y
s minus y1
okay
no
this bracket would be closed and this is
for the upper pipe
okay
now we'll set for the lower pipe
and for the lower pipe the coordinates
would be
that is
pipe X
and the Y
coordinates
they would be Y2
okay
and now we will
return the pipe
so we get the
height of the pipes
now we'll create two pipes for blitting
on the screen and that will create in
the main game
now in the main game we'll create two
pipes that would be new
pipe
one and that would be
get random Pi function
yeah and then we'll create
new pipe to
and that
is
get random
pipe
okay now my list of upper pipes
I will
create for them
that would be first
I will
create a tuple for that upper pipes
that is equal to
inside
will set its X
and that is screen width
plus 200
plus screen width divided by 2.
okay
that is
screen width
divided by 2.
and 4 by
what we'll set as new
pipe
to
and
the coordinates
that is 0 comma
y
okay
that is set here
and comma Now
four lower pipes will set
so for lower pipe
okay so we have note return
the whole coordinates so upper pipe
okay so we'll write that would be screen
height plus 200
and set it
double pipe coordinates
so that is
the X would be screen width Plus 200.
okay and the Y
y would be equal to
is
new pipe
one
and
sign that is the zeroth and the Y we
have declared
okay
comma
and
just close this
Oma
and
for this
will set
screen width plus 200 plus screen width
divided by 2 and Y would be new pipe two
zero and Y okay now we'll set the list
of lower pipes
okay moving on
and create some space and from here
now what we'll do we'll start for
lower pipes
and for lower pipes first we'll create
that double
and inside this
will start with x
and the x coordinate it would be
screen weight sorry
uh yeah for the lower pipes will set the
screen width plus 200 only that would be
on the same the open and the lower
screen width
Plus
200 and now we'll set the Y
as
new pipe
I ate then
never mind
new Piper and
for this
we will set
that is the first one
and the Y
now
moving on
we'll set the second coordinates
it is starting with x
and that would be screen width plus 200
move forward to right n above
okay yeah
screen width Plus
200
Plus
screen width
divided by 2.
and now
we'll set y
that is new pipe two
inside your pass one and the Y
okay
now
we will close this
now we'll set the velocity of the pipe
so pipe velocity would be in the
opposite direction it would be coming
from right to left
so we'll set the pipe velocity
that is
we will create a variable pipelocity X
that is equal to minus 4.
and the player velocity
for that we have created the variable
player
in length Y and that would be equal to
minus 9 it would be going that side
and the player max velocity y that is
in the y direction in height like if you
do not flap then it would go
with the speed of 9.
and if we flap then we'll set the
player max velocity okay
so for that we have created the variable
player max velocity and that would in
the y direction
okay
and create these
variables speak now
and we'll set it as 10. so if it comes
minus 9 and if we flap then it would go
up like one
point up
and the minimum velocity for player
that should be minus 8.
in y direction
player
minimum
below setting in y direction that would
be equal to minus eight
and now player acceleration
so if player accelerates so how much it
accelerates that is the final velocity
minus initial velocity
okay and that is equal to 1
now
players flap acceleration will also
set
flap
acceleration and we will set it as minus
eight so we'll set the velocity while
flapping
that is done and now we'll set player
flapped equal to false that it is true
only when the bird is flapping so when
the bird is flapping it would be change
it to true
clear
left
and we'll set it as
poles okay
now we'll run a loop
while loop
and inside will set the events that is
poor event in
Pi game
Dot
event
dot get
and inside this event what will set if
now if
event Dot type
that is equal to equal to wait
or
event
DOT type
that is
equal to equal to
key down
and
event
dot key
equal to equal to K underscore Escape
so for this
we will quit the game
and
write the command as system.exit
first we'll do buy game dot bit will
quit the pi game
that we have initialized
and after that
we'll exit the system
just close the
so takes it now
if
even DOT type
foreign
key down
and
event Dot
type
here we will
write about the key if we press the key
that is equal to space k underscore
space
or
event dot key
that is equal to equal to K
underscore up
then
the velocity of player
like if condition if pair of velocity
in y direction
is greater than zero
then we'll set the
player below City in y direction
that is equal to player flap
acceleration
player clap acceleration okay and we'll
set the player flap equal to True here
this is
small
so
uh what will it set as now
yeah player flipped
that is equal to
true
okay now here we will play The Sounds
also
so for that
came underscore
sounds and inside will pass wing
dot play
and now
we have set the events and set the while
loop here
now
we want
a function for collide we'll set its
functionality that is
if the bud collides with the pipe
so what would be the functionality for
that
so for that
we will declare a function
and name it as s collide
and
inside
we will pass
player X
player y
the positions
but where is the position of the player
at particular time and the upper pipes
position
and the lower pipes position
now if
player y
that is speed
uh sorry the position of the player Y is
greater than ground y minus 25
let us show you
ground way
minus
25
or
player y velocity
sorry player y coordinate
is less than 0.
then we'll play the sound
that would be the hit sound
it has hit the ground
yes game underscore sounds
and inside will pass hit sound
and we'll play it
and here we will return
true
okay
no
we're going to run a for Loop there will
be four pipe
in Upper pipe
that is
set the pipe height
and that is
inside the game sprites
pipe
and the zeroth coordinate
and we'll get its height with the
function
get height
and now
if
clear away
is less than
pipe height
Plus
pipe
y
and
absolute of
player x minus pipe x coordinate
that is
player X
minus
pipe
X
okay
and if it's
less than the
game sprites
and inside will pass pipe
and the zeroth coordinate
and will get the width of it
and if it's less than this
then we'll play the hit sound
that is game underscore sounds
and
and then
hit
dot play
and after that we will return
true
okay
now
four pipe in
lower
pipes
if
y
Plus
game sprites
and
that is of player
that is we'll get its height
and if its height is greater than
the pipe y coordinate
and
the absolute of
that is
player X
minus
pipe X
and it is
less than
game sprites
that is
pipe
and first 0 to connect and node get
width
then what would play would play the hit
song
that is
game underscore
sounds
and inside
we will play hit
dot play
and we'll return true
and
if these conditions do not happen
then we will return poles
now
coming back to our
new main function
main game function sorry
and we have
run a while loop here
now
we have created the Escalade function
now what we will do is
crash test
will create a variable
that is
crash test
equal to we'll call the Escalade
function
and inside will pass the positions that
is clear X comma
player y comma
upper pipes
comma
lower pipes
and this function will return true if
the player is crashed we have declared
this function
and
if the player is
crashed
inside this
right if
crash
test
then
return
and now
we'll check for the scores
but that will create
a
variable
and see the player mid position
that is equal to
player X
Plus
height of
player divided by two
that is indicated by
came underscore Sprites
said pass
player
don't get to it
divided by 2.
no
we'll run a for Loop that is
for
pipe in Upper pipes
so for piping upper pipes well find the
pipe mid position
and that is equal to
pipe
X
Plus
game underscore
price
and inside pass
pipe
and the zeroth
vote and we'll get the width
of this
let's get to it slash two
and now
inside this
if
pipe mid position
and that is pipe mid
position is less than equal to
player mid position
and
that is
less than
less than
pipe mid position
Plus 4.
okay
now after that the score
will be
plus equal to 1 if it passes and we will
print also
will print and use the
F string that is
your score
is
and inside
will pass
score
and it will print that score
and we will play the game sound
the point sound
the game variable
Dot
play
now
if
player velocity y
that is player
velocity in y direction
is less than player max velocity in y
direction
velocity in y direction
and
his node flapping
and note
player
left
then
player below City Y
that would be equal to
player acceleration y
and
if I'm sorry
player
left
then
layer
left
equal to
poles
then
player height
that is equal to
game underscore Sprites
and
pass player
dot get underscore
right
now
player y position
that is equal to
player y
Plus
minimum of
clear velocity y
comma
ground y
minus
player y
minus player height
now
we'll move the pipes to the left
so for that we'll run a for Loop
now
4
upper pipe command lower pipe
that is we are taking
two variables
it is upper pipe command lower pipe and
using the zip function
and inside we are passing upper pipes
and the lower pipes
um
for my lower pipes
and inside
pass upper pipe
X position
plus equal to
pipe velocity X
and then we have
lower pipe
x velocity
that is plus equal to
5 velocity X
now we'll add a new pipe when the first
is about to close the leftmost part of
the screen
so for that
we will
know if statement
that is if
0 is less than upper pipes
is zero
and
X
less than five
then
new pipe
is equal to get random pipe you'll get
the new random pipe
and upper pipes dot append
that is
root
append
and that would be
new pipe
and a zero
and after that we have lower
pipes
Dot append
that is
new pipe
one
now
if the pipe is out of the screen we will
remove it
and for that also we will
run a if statement that is the
conditional statement that is if
upper pipes
0 and the X
is less than
minus
game
Sprites
inside the pipe
and zero
that is we will get the width of that
now
then we'll pop the upper pipes
so for that we'll write upper pipes dot
Pope
and that is the sea root
and then we will pop the load pipes
stood Pope
and zeroth now we will BLT our Sprites
now
now for blitting
we'll use
the global variable screen
and use the plate function
and inside will pass game sprites
and that is the background we want to
play it here
and
inside
we will pass the position that is 0 0
and now
now
we will run a for Loop
that is
4
upper pipe
comma
lower
pipe
in zip
and inside will pass
upper pipes
comma
lower
pipes
and
p is capital for both of them
so for them
will Blade the screen
that is
screen node blade
and inside we will pass game sprites
that is pipe
and this will come here
you know setting for the
pipes so it would come under the for
Loop
game sprites
and for pipe
and
see your position
now
we'll take
upward
pipe
X
and
oh per pipe
away
close both of them
now well
it
the lower pipe
in node plate and inside will pass game
underscore
rights
and inside will pass the pipe
and the position for the lower pipe that
is one
and
lower
pipe
it has X
and
lower
pipe
y
and we'll close this
okay
for lower pipe we have started one and
we have
close that
okay
and for the game sprites we have started
okay
this
done
now we will let the base
and that would not be in the for Loop
for that
for the plating of the base we'll write
screen dot blade
and inside will pass
game sprites
and inside
will pass the base
and the position of the base that is
base X
coma
ground way
and now
we will
blit
screen load plate
and inside we'll pass
games Sprites
and this would be for players
comma
player X
comma
player y
now
now to set for the score
will create a variable
and name it as my digits
and inside
we will do
in text
or
X in
list
of
string
that is score
so we'll set
width equal to
zero
and
4 we will run another for Loop that is
four digit
in my digits
that is what we have stored in that
that is
width
for the points or the digits that would
be equal to
game underscore
Sprites
and we'll pass the numbers that
we have loaded in the main function
it's the numbers
and
digit
and get its width
now
we'll set the X offset
that is
equal to screen width minus width
divided by 2.
and now
now we'll run another for Loop four
digit
that is four digit in my digits
inside
will use
screen dot blade
and inside will pass game underscore
Sprites
and inside
pass
numbers
and
digit
and now
we'll pass the X offset
and
screen height
into 0.12
and now
insert the
X offset
that is
plus equal to
game underscore
writes
inside pass
numbers
and digit
note
get with
and after that
we'll do pygame Dot
display dot update
now
will set
FPS clock
dot Tech
and pass the FPS in that
and with that
we are done with our code and now
we will run our code
and run the code
oh we are waiting if there is some error
note
on it again okay first I'll stop the
term okay
the file had appeared there
and you guys can see
the game is ready Flappy Bird get ready
press spacebar to start and you can use
these images that we have used that is
message
and put PNG and that is here in Sprites
uh this image I have created
using the PowerPoint you can create in
the PowerPoint or you can use Photoshop
and this I have downloaded the
background image the base image and the
bird image and the pipe image I have
created and these zero one two three
five six seven eight nine you can
download from the browser like you can
use
uh you can type background images for
games
and free background images for games so
you would see all the images you can
download
anyone
and you can use the base also you can
download it
and use it so
we are done with the game so before
ending we'll play it once again
we can hear the sounds
and you can see the score is being
printed in the terminal
So currently we are at
9 11 12 13
and that's it
we lost at 15 and we have closed the
window that is we use the
system module and use the system.exit
function
now
with that
we have come to the end of this session
and I have an insightful for you guys
