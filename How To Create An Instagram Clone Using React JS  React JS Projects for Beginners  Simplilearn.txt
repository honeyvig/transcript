okay let's hope it's working fine yeah
we have created one box and this is what
our Instagram logo
move it up
let's open our
terminal
so
it's fine
you don't need this one
one for the main
or one for the script container
and I'm going to add one
two
[Music]
three
you have created one div here
yeah it's fine
now it's looking
up
like here earlier it was looking down
now let's remove this
till now I'm sure you have
gotten the idea
for why we have taken this
okay let's make it like
systematic
yeah let's save it now
as you can see
in our app
and in Instagram
there is this one
margin on the top
so let's open our CSS
that I'm going to write margin
25 pixels let's save it
yeah
our app is also looking like the
Instagram login page
right
and then it started looking cool
right okay
let's make it as here as it is showing
inside there
yeah you have to give bad thing to this
Instagram
you have to create this also
so let's
give it some space here
let's
let's give it marching top to everything
so it should align C
uh inside the mean also
I'm going to give margin
25 pixels okay
now in this right
I'm going to give it a border which is
fine margin is fine
margin is what from Top we need
so
let's save it
this text line is
Center so our Instagram will
be inside this container which is Center
isn't it looking very similar to The
Original Part
now let's move forward
with the next step inside this container
I am going to create
these phone number and all okay
let's work on this container open your
login.jss
JS file
after this
let's create
a div
inside this let's create another div
so
yeah
there are two divs
there's some space in between these in
this
so
it's fine
I'm going
to
open this
let's write
class of login
page
i g i n
written the wrong spelling
now let's write input text
inside the you have to use the play cell
you have to use that placeholder
like you also have to write these things
now
okay
let's write
similar input for password also
type
okay
it's not
type
which is
I'm asking
let's type
and the type of this is password
let's move forward
see
yeah
it's for username password we can just
make it
looks similar to the original one
with the help of
what CSS right
let's create a button
let's write sign
okay
let's just save it
you'll see one sign button yeah like
this
coming back to the code
let's write
let's
okay here we are
let's make it with CSS you have to OK a
class name
last name we are going to give
let's name it simple only login page
text
type this let's copy it from here
and let's paste it here
for button I'm
going to add another class
as login
button
let's just save it and see the magic
it's not showing let's see what's the
issue woman
oh there we are
added the CSS and why we are expecting
so many other things okay
first we are going to add the
for login text
and I'm going to write this tree
open page width
let's write 258
what is the exact same
height
which is 36 pixel same again
I've inspected these things so I'm
pretty sure of that
login
button
inside this let's give it a width
off
70 only
press the button should be
small
now let's see
yeah
okay we need to do some
changes here also well it's coming
outside of this container let's see
is we have added here inside the
container
and I have done few changes in the dev
now
as you can see
it's coming inside the container now
we're gonna give some space
so for that
let's give them some margin within your
piece.css
and here
I'm going to give it a margin
of 5 pixels
okay
also I'm going to give it a border
because color is very dark there
I'm gonna change that solid
and
DB DB DPS
and this is looking good
and we have to create one more
which is
login
page
sign in
yeah
inside this let's give it a margin from
Top as
25 pixels let's save it
and see the changes yeah
so
now the color of this is looking exactly
like the
this one now coming back to the button
part
let's just
add
yeah
we'll be creative field added here
huh
as you can see here
it's not coming inside this because we
have
open this one in the
let's close this
let's first add the placeholder or let's
work on the button bar okay let's
first add the placeholder which is phone
number user name or email
so inside this text now
we have to add this
placeholder
after this I am going to add one
placeholder
which is going to tell us what's
comes inside this
number email
or
usually
okay
and inside here let's create another
placeholder
select this let's write password
save it
okay it's called
the email is coming
username
or
save it yeah
it's looking amazing
right
now coming back to the CSS file
let's give it a background
after the Border we are going to give it
a background color which is a little mix
of white
so I'm gonna write hash
f a f a f a let's save it
now it's a little bit
dark white okay
same as
this original one
yeah
moving forward
let's now
yeah
coming back to the code
let's
cut this one
let's write this
okay
we're going to give
padding left too
10 pixel
yeah this is coming fine
let's just
add one more which is
border radius here
which is 5 pixels is fine yeah
no
okay let's go
this button some height
after the height you're going to give it
border radius for five pixels
after that font weight
let's give the font weight bold
and then we will order for this
which is one pixel solid
and the color would be
okay let's see the color here
in the original one sky blue okay
the sky blue color is zero three nine
five F six let's just save it
okay
it's coming
great
but let's just
because we need background color of this
as blue so
3956 yeah it's a little dark
okay
and the color of the button should be
White
so
you can just
let's see yeah it's coming beautifully
right
whenever we hide the ID password Here
yeah
okay
forward
let's
work on itself let's give
to minimize this
let's
add here body
we need to fetch this we need to add the
DOT
background
color
and the background color of this would
be
a little
you just see the original one
okay it's it's fine
okay
it's right only so we write FFA
yeah this one is great
okay
coming back to the right one
the center we're going to give it
back around
color which is white save it
now let's give this button a margin
margin from Top
because we need to add some space here
so we are going to give with the margin
of 5 pixels yeah this is the line now
now
let's see whether it is looking fine or
not
so
it's looking completely fine
so now we are going to split the screen
as power and all
so coming back to app.js
now we'll work on this part
this or
log in with Facebook in this everything
coming back to code
here
I am going to create one div
minimize this we can see the output
okay
let's create one Dev
inside the step I'm going to create one
div
modif
inside here we're going to write r
okay
looking cool I guess
save it okay with all is coming but we
need to add some CSS here
so we can just
make some space here so let's
write this class name as
login
space
divider
let's save it
okay
let's give this one also class name
as login
or
here also we need to get some
class name as
login

till this FP
from the image folder
let's just save it and see
this is how it is looking we need to
shrink the size of this image
let's see the original one first okay
it's coming very small but in our case
it's coming very big so what we can do
is you can go to our CSS file and reduce
the size of this
login Facebook
so I have added here
margin top is let's add 10.
and see changes
nothing is here
so let's wait
okay let's not
d
here we can also
add the margin
right
so why can't we give the width here
it's right width
15 pixels
and let's see
yeah it's coming beautifully
right
now
coming to this password
you can make this as a hyperlink also
okay
but let's just give some styling to this
lock and see let's
a little less
okay let's just do it now
give it margin right
let's save it
all the image got lost
okay we just have to give
the exact
number which is
5 pixel now
what it is saying it's saying this okay
okay
this can't be fixed from here
and it's again
okay we have Kevin
now it will be fine
yeah
yes it's looking good
now
will work on this
sign in and sign up button
let's just
go to our
project
there we are going to add
because we need to come out of that main
container
okay
so here I'm going to create one another
container
let's give it a class name of
login
page
okay
sign
up
options
okay
inside this let's create another div
class name
login
page
sign in
let's close this now here we are going
to write
don't have any account sign up
it's copied
and here we're going to paste that
right
now
we are going to create another div
let's give it a class name as
login
page
sign up
it is
the trade
on
sign
let's just save this one and see
our page
yeah it's coming
up
what we can do is
let's see what's the mistake here
it's coming inside the container but
it's not fetching inside this
okay
this one is fine
okay the sign up for 10 sign and it's
fine
this one is looking good
add it here yeah
now it's working fine
yeah
now what we can do is
you have to give this a little padding
so it comes under this
so coming back to
line up
the top base
you don't have an account sign up
you don't have any account sign up
and then oh we need to add
get app
let's first
from this now
get the app
let's minimize this this one also
refresh and it's coming perfectly fine
as I'm not going to add these data we
can do that
but I'm not going to do that
so
let's add some images like this one
here
for that
let's write here open your
clone get the app after that
I'm going to
create one another div
at this I'm going to add these images
okay
images source
door
let's close this one
to that again
image
source
Play Store
let's save it
okay
we have to
add the images imported
second
okay let's import this app store and
Play Store images
let's copy this one
copy
paste
that I'm going to write
App Store
and here I'm going to write Play Store
and the image name is
app
and this one is play
let's just save it
and see
okay
it's going very big we need to give it
the width also
let's
open our code
errone here we are going to give it some
width
let's give this one
136
pixels
yeah and let's copy this
yeah let's paste it and
yeah you can see the output
we have to make some padding and all
okay let's coming back to our code
let's give this one
sign up page oh let's
let's give it another
option
okay
so let this one only
let's fix this
let's skip this images
class name
as login page
this one
engines
yeah
now let's copy this
and
to this image
I'm going to paste this one
let's rename this option as
and here also
you are going to let's say we can see
it's still changes
get them
it's coming really
get the app yes
with this only so let's do something for
that
and here as
load
section
okay
let's
this one inside this div
this one
let's see it's still in the background
okay
let's just do one thing here
now it's looking fine yeah
so we need to give some padding here
let's give it some adding
Here Also let's just copy this property
only
paste it
save
now it's coming beautifully
there is some Gap here so let's
add this
watching motion
okay
edit this dwing part
okay this is a mistake
I thought it's not fetching the right
margin
it's not fetching the right margin
let's just
open the CSS
right here
top save it
watching is fine
okay we need to give some margin in
between the
container and get the app okay
so let's just see
in download section
say the download section we took gif
maximum betting
from here we have given some padding
buds
and things which fine so let's right
here
40
the login page option is also 40.
but it's not getting the space I want
so let's open this one again
it's a login option
login

Martin

go back
so one is home one is
Siege
other one was
that trying button

let's see
now let's check
okay
it's coming beautifully
so
yeah
it had to get Instagram icons we can
also write these names but it will take
much space so
as you have noticed there is one
file
portion also
which is round and inside that
is a picture
what we can do
that let's go to a code
let's see
okay
yeah
let's give
class name
does
bar
search

save it
it's
into this
everything which looks fine to me
let's create this screen
no
this is the time we can
add the
logo the
page like this one okay
come back to the code
what we can do is we can import
Avatar
UI core let's say this is
which is this one
head
yeah now
you have to declare this inside this
so what we can do is
star source of the image
DB

with the probing problem was without
CC can do
not found
the function

let's see
let's see what it's
so whenever we find any error just copy
that and paste that inside the
Chrome
on stack Overflow you'll find plenty of
answers of that

maybe it's not installed or what
words
