let's get started so hi guys today we'll
see the difference and what is git and
GitHub and we'll use some of the basic
commands so starting with GitHub so it's
a web based platform that leverages git
so G is a tool I will move to the
website so here it's the git it's a tool
and that's the Version Control System
and it provides a space where developers
can collaborate on projects while G it's
a command line tool so git is a command
line tool and GitHub provides a
graphical interface along with
additional features that help manage the
projects hosted on the platform so now
we'll see what is get and
GitHub so a
little understanding of both the
softwares and the tools would be good
before starting it so think of get as a
tool that helps you keep track of
changes made to your files it's like
having a detailed history book that
captures every change to your documents
allowing you to revisit any version at
any time that if you commit any changes
or do any change to your project you
could move on to that change at any time
so this is especially useful for coding
projects where you want to see old
versions of your code or work on
different features simultaneously
without interfering with the main
project
so git operates primarily through the
command line and allows for local
Version Control that is storing all
version history of files locally on your
computer and then it has branching and
merging creating branches to work on
different versions of a project
simultaneously then combining them back
together and then we have the
collaboration coordinating work among
multiple people and then we have the
GitHub so GitHub is where you take
projects online using git tool tool so
it acts like a cloud-based service for
git repositories in addition to all the
Version Control capabilities of git
GitHub lets you share your repositories
with others collaborate on projects and
even track issues it's a hub where
millions of developers and companies
build ship and maintain their software
so what does gup provides it provides
project management tools it track issues
add project notes and manage P requests
to improve your project manage
management process then it has the
collaboration features it discuss
changes request reviews and manage
contributions from other developers
easily and it is open source networking
so you can explore projects that other
people have made public contribute to
others projects and learn from the
global Community now we will discuss how
they work together so while get help to
manage your projects history locally
GitHub takes this a step further by
hosting your get repositories in a
centralized location this means you can
access your projects from anywhere
collaborate with others and benefit from
the robust ecosystem of integration and
tools that GitHub offers so using git
with GitHub enhances visibility
collaboration and project tracking in
ways that are not possible with get
alone so now we will introduce G and
GitHub in the way that helps clarify the
distinct between complimentary roles
that each plays in the software
development
landscape so moving to the
website you could
see so this is the website for the
GitHub and here if you are new you just
have to sign up for
this so he's asking an email address
here so enter your email address
if you have the student ID you can get
some of the more features of the GitHub
but I will recommend don't use your
student ID as it will get deactivated in
the upcoming years so use your personal
ID
only so here we will log in from a new
ID for you guys to let the process know
how to log
in and here we have to create a password
and new
username I
would so it's
saying this one is
available7 we will continue with that
only then and email preference receive
occasion and product updates no we don't
want and here you could see that the
GitHub is verifying our
account uh so he's asking us to solve
the puzzle but I have my dark background
on so I'm not able to see the puzzle
here option
one option two
option
three so you could see he's asking what
is what option is the sounds of C so
it's the second
option and it has got us the right
answer and now he's asking for the code
on my mail
address so we'll get back and check our
code so I go a code here
so here you could answer these questions
that how many team members will be
working with you you could say just me
or if you want to collaborate on a
project you could tell them that would
be 2 to 5 5 to 10 and are you a student
or teacher so you could select
accordingly so we will go for the
teacher one and what specific features
are you interested in using that would
be collaborative coding automated and
cicd security Client app project
management team Administration or
Community for currently we will take on
collaborative coding Automation and
cicd and you could choose others
also now you could see that there are
free options and the paid options also
in the paid option you will get the
additional teacher benefits that would
be GI up team draft P request required
reviews what else I will select student
for you guys okay so we'll select
student as you guys will be creating
your account so we will go with that
option only and here you could see both
the options and here we will continue
for free only so this is the dashboard
of GitHub uh it's a bit confusing but
you don't have to dig in that you could
just reach out on the top right section
and here your profile select all account
add account and your repositories you'll
go to your
repositories and here is what we will
create our
repositories So currently we don't have
any public
repository now what we'll do is we will
get back and install git
tool now uh we are on our git website
and here we have to download it for
Windows because it's a tool and we have
to get it downloaded so we'll click here
to download the latest version and that
is 64bit version for G for Windows so
you could select like if you are using
Mac OS or doing the Windows setup so you
can choose accordingly so we have the
other G for Windows download and that
would be 64bit for Windows setup so you
could see that the download has started
and it has started twice so pause one oh
sorry it has started twice or more than
twice I think so getting back here so
after downloading you can install the
git and it will ask you some
straightforward questions uh you don't
have to check box any check box
accordingly just the information it
provides just move on with that and
install the G on your system so now we
are coming back to a GitHub
and we have log into a GitHub and we are
at the repository section so now to make
a new repository we just have to click
on the new button here and you would see
here this is the repository name what
you will provide here so what we'll
write is first
project let's see if it's available it's
available and Below there is so
repository names are unique to your
account only and can include letters
numbers hyph and underscores because
there's an owner here so you are the
owner here and then there's a repository
name and then comes the description that
is optional and this provides a short
description of your repository this is
not mandatory but helps others
understand the purpose of your project
and after description you could choose
out the visibility option that is choose
whether the repository will be public
that will be visible to anyone or
private only visible to you and those
you invite and then there's the read me
file and initialize this repository with
optionally you can add a read me file
and a g ignore file and choose a license
so if you add a read me file what this
does is it's a text file that introduces
and explains your project and it often
includes information on how to use the
repository or what the reposit is four
and the git ignore this file tells git
which files or folders to ignore in a
project you can choose a template that
suits the language or framework you are
working and then it's the license adding
a license determines how others can use
modify or distribute your code so if you
want to create a readme file you can
create it so this is how you create a
repository and if you want a description
you can add your description
also and we're making it public
and getting here we will create the
repository and after filling out all the
options you could create the
repository and you can clone or setup in
desktop also so after creating a
repository you can either clone it to
your local machine using git or set it
up in GitHub desktop for easy access and
management so we'll see how we can copy
it so what we'll do is we will use an ID
for all the things
else you can use get bash also so
there's an option with the name get bash
and after installing it it will most
probably appear on your desktop if you
will choose the option
else we have the option that is get bash
so this is get bash and you could see
there that it is you would see here that
it's available at the root directory uh
this bavy symbol
it appears that we are in the root
directory if you want to move to another
directory you could move or if you want
to create or clone the repository you
could do that for that you just have to
use the command get clone and after that
you have to paste the GitHub link that
is this link so you you can use https
you could use SSH also and the GitHub
CLI also but what we recommend is in
starting you should use https just copy
this and coming here paste
it and you could see that the link has
been based it so you could clone the
repository on your system using G but we
won't be copying it in the root
directory we will move in another folder
and you can do all these commands in the
visual studio code also so let's let's
see I will show you guys how to download
vs
code we will start with all the commands
and the vs code only so you could
download for Windows from here that is
the visual studio.com
and you could download it and what
version you want and for what OS you
want go for it and after downloading
we'll open our Vis Studio
code so here what we'll create is we
will create a new one that is you could
see welcome here we create a new file we
will just open the terminal here so this
is our
terminal So currently we are in DEA
folder we
will get back from here and we are here
in C users
abja and here we will create another
folder and name it as first project
one that is first project
and you would see that it has created
the directory and now we'll move to this
directory only that is first
project and now our location is C user
service first project so inside this we
will create a new file over here only we
will copy the Clone so moving back to
our
GitHub so you could see here that
there's an initial commit that when we
have created we have created the file
readme.md
and there's only one commit and this is
the main file from here you could see
that this is the main file here and it
has only one
branch so this is the first project
and if you want you could add or use the
edit option here and edit your read me
file so I'll will show you guys how we
could edit this so this is a read me
file and what we have written here is
only first
project so we could write we will be
creating our first project today
okay and after this you could commit the
changes and here you could see that he's
asking for commit
messages that you could name it when we
are committing anything we can add a
description to it so this is where we
could add a commit message so it's okay
that it has written update read me. MD
file similarly you could write for your
commit so you could see that it has
updated
it and here we could see the history
also who has edited a repository so
before you could see that there was
initial commit so initial commit is the
first change and we can add it read me.
MD file what we have done and we can add
and then click on the commit changes and
we have also named the commit also and
we can use the HTML here in the read me
file if you get back here and write BR
tag so BR is the for the next line tag
if we write BR
tag and then commit the
changes you could see that the line has
shifted to the next line so the HTML is
very basic only you could use HTML also
here or you could just use the simple
English
here okay so as we have discussed so
GitHub is a web portal and get is on the
system so we have downloaded the git
also we have set up the git and the vs
code also so to verify we can
check here open the G
bash so first thing we will do here is
we will
verify what version we have so get minus
minus
version so you could see that the get
version installed is 2.
44.0 Windows
do1 and after installing the Git You
Could See the icon on the desktop or you
could search on your windows search part
about the G bash so this is the G bash
only and if you want to know all the
files here just click on LS and you will
get all the files that are in the RO
directory and if you click on PWD you
could see what is your working
directory okay now moving on we will
configure the G here and so for that we
will we can either move to visual studio
code or we can do in the get bash only
so what we'll do we will choose Vis
Studio
code and start here so we'll open on the
folder that we have created it was on
the users
only and what we have created was first
project so this is the folder we'll open
this and now we'll get a
terminal okay so now what we have to do
is we have to configure our G here
so what we'll
write
get
configure config minus minus and we'll
write Global here so it will be done
globally and here we'll write our
username user do
name and that will be my name here
that
Isis and after that we will configure
our email
ID for that we'll
write get config minus-
Global user.
email and here we will configure our
email
ID and after configuring we will get a
list out here for that we'll write the
command get
config minus minus list so you could get
all the list so these are the commands
that you can
use and if you want to clear your
terminal you could do that also like I
have the option here to kill the
terminal or you could use the clear
command also so now what we'll do is we
will kill the terminal and here we will
clone a
repository so we'll use the command G
clone and getting back to a get
repository we will clone it and for that
you could see here
that he has provided us the full chart
of the calendar and he will keep the
track of our activities here and you
could see there
are one repository created and there
were three
commits now moving back in the
repository section we'll open a
repository and from here we will copy
the link and getting back to a vs code
we'll clone a repository in a local
system so this is the command get clone
and then the link of the repository as
we have done it you could see that the
Clone has been updated and inside the
Clone there is only readme.md file so
you could see that we are in the uh
directory of first project Now we move
to the repository so for that we'll
write CD first
project so now we are in the directly
only so to clear it if we want to clear
the terminal we could just write the
command clear and our whole terminal
would be cleared and you would see we
are in the repository first we are in
the
directory that is first project and
after that a repository but we have
cloned it in the
system and if you want to get all the
files in your reposit you could just
choose the command LS and what we we
have is currently only me. MD file else
we don't have any file here and if you
want to know all the hidden files also
for that you could use the command LS
minus a okay it didn't
work so if we create another file here
that would be the new file if we create
index. HTML file so this is a new
file and we are in the repository now
we'll ask ask him LS and let's see what
it respond to us so when we create a new
file it is untracked by the GitHub so we
get back to GitHub it won't update it
here there will be only read me file so
you could see that we updated the file
here and you could see the U symbol that
is untracked and when we get back to our
GitHub you could see there is no index.
HTML file and when we add or change new
file then we have have to add it and
then it gets staged that is we have to
use the command get add and then it gets
stag and then we have to use the commit
command then it will get changed in the
GitHub also or we could write anything
that would be
HTML and inside we could write a heading
so after changing the file you could see
that there's a modification here that is
the m sign now we will add it or if the
file is that is modified then we have to
use the commands so guys as you can
see repeat so guys as you can see that
we will do some changes
here and after that we will add and
commit and push the same in the
repository so what we'll do here is we
will create it or we will create a
paragraph here and write how are
you and after this what we'll do is we
will add these
changes that would be a snapshot to a
stage
so we will use the command get Space add
or you could use the file name which you
want to Stage it or you could just press
period and press
enter that would
be get add
period or it's showing an
error we will
use get add and the name of the file
that is index
dot okay uh the thing is we are not in
the current folder I don't know how
but we are out
of the directory now we are in the
directory and you would see that in
index.html there's a modification here
so what we'll write here
is get Space add or in the inverted Comm
you would write index. HTML that would
be the file
name and you would
see that it has done and we can also use
another command that is get add space
period so we could use both the commands
and that modification sign has turned
into orange now now after the add
command what we should do is we should
commit
so for commit we'll write the command
get commit minus M and after that what
message you want to store as a
commit so we have we'll write a message
update index.
HTML
okay and now the commit is done after
commit we can check the G status
whether there are any pending files that
are there to be committed or
added so he's saying that there are your
branches ahead of origin that is by
three commits so we are done here that
is we here we have done three commits
and now we can use the G push to commit
it to our repository so for that we'll
use the
command get push
origin
main so you could see that it has pushed
the command here and the guys who are
using this the first time so it will ask
you to authorize it and it will ask you
to sign in with your password so do sign
in and after that this command will
execute now move back to our
GitHub and this is our first project
you could see the index. HTML file here
that is 1 minute ago
only and here you could see that we have
done the changes to the repository and
if you want you could also check the
status here now what we have done is we
have created a repository and then we
have cloned it and make the changes in
the local repository and then we have
executed the push command
so for instance if you want
to create something on the local
repository and after that you want to
push it to the GitHub so how you can do
it uh for that what you can do is first
we'll create a folder okay let's go
out
CD space period period and we are in the
first project will so get out from here
and here we will create
a new folder and we will name it
as and we will name it
as and we'll name it as new
project okay now we'll move into the new
project folder new project directory
and inside this what we can do
is first we'll open that folder in the
visual studio code also open folder and
what we have created is new project so
this is the
folder and for this we'll open the
terminal here is our
terminal and we are in the new project
folder only so here we will create a get
repo so first we'll check all the files
if you want you could check the files
here so there's only new project or else
we could add the files here also so
let's start with the index. HTML file
but before that what we'll do is we will
use the command git in it to initialize
it initialize this folder from git
and that we have done here and now if
you write
LS so this is our file now we have
created a repository on the local
system now we can add a file and index.
HTML file we have added now if you want
to add more files you can add them that
could be CSS files or any file you want
to add and similarly you have to create
a new repository in the GitHub also
so for that we will go to our GitHub
click on profile section and here are
our
repositories click on
new and here we will name the repository
we will name it same only that is new
project
now so we'll name it same only new
project and we will not add a readme
file here as we have not created on the
local system also so we'll create it and
this is our repository
link so what we can do here is so what
we can do here is and before doing it
like before adding the link in the local
repository we will create some content
here that would
be let's say first we
create and then in the body
only we will have some par
and we'll write new
changes okay now we have created the
files and now we want to upload it to
GitHub and we have made a new repo in
the GitHub now what we'll do is we will
us a command get remote add origin and
add this link so we'll copy this link
moving
back here in our
terminal will write a
command get
remote add
origin and now you can paste the link
here so it has pasted the link now you
if you want to verify what you can do is
write the
command get remote minus v as you could
see that it has integrated our local
repository to the remote rep
osit now get now you could also check in
which branch you are so you could just
write the command get branch and you
could see that you are in the main
branch only so what we have done here is
we have created a local repository and
then we have inserted some files here
and then we have created a repository in
our remote that is on GitHub and after
that we have used the command
that is get remote add origin and then
the link of the repository so it has
connected with it now we have some
modified files or the new files that we
can push them so for that we
will first use the command get add space
period it will push all the files and
after that what we can do is get space
commit minus M and we can write the
message that is initial
files as you could see that one file
changed five
insertions and you could see here that
the sign has changed now what we can do
is we can push the files so for that we
could use the command get push
and if you want to just use the command
get push in the upcoming sessions so you
could use minus U also if you use minus
U what it will do it will allow you to
use kit push command every time if you
are working on the same directory so one
time you have to use get origin minus U
Get push minus U origin mean so there's
an error here resource resp mean does
not match
any so let's see first in which branch
we
are that is we are in master
Branch so you could see that uh we are
in the master branch and we want to make
it a main branch so what we will do is
we'll rename it get
Branch minus m main we will rename it as
Main and now we'll check in which branch
we are get Branch we are in the main
branch now we can push the code or the
files what we have created get push
minus
U origin main okay now it has pushed all
the files inside it now what we will do
is we will get back to GitHub
and here we can
see our new
project so these are the initial files
that is the commit that has been created
and moving back here we are so we have
now we will create a readme MD file
here readme.md file and we can write
anything here that this is our
second
project and after that we can just push
it that is you could use get add space
period get
commit minus M and you could write read
me 5
and here we go to error okay we wrote
code
commit so get commit minus M read me
file and now what we can write this get
push and it will push the file
to our remote
repository now as you can see here this
is our second project and it has been
pushed here so this is how we use the
init commands to create a local
repository and then move it to the
remote repository and now you have seen
that you could see in which branch you
are with the command git branch and if
you want to rename it you could use the
command git branch minus M
meain okay and if you want to create a
new branch that is if some of the guys
are working with you and you want to
create a new Branch you could create a
new Branch also I will tell you how you
can create a new Branch or if you alone
are working on a repo and you want to
create a feature for that also you could
use a
branch for the feature branch and let's
see how you could create it get
check
out minus
B and after that just name the new
Branch uh we will name it as feature one
so we have created a new branch and
let's
see we write the command get Branch you
could see that there are two branches
feature one and Main and the green one
is in which we are currently in feature
one similarly you could make other
branches also with the same command that
is get checkout minus B feature one
you'll create another branch that is
feature 2 now if you want to see how
many branches are there you could just
type get branch and here are the three
branches feature one feature two and
Main so we are currently in feature two
that is the green
branch and if you want to delete some
Branch or if you want to navigate first
we'll see how you can navigate so you
could just write get
checkout and then the branch name that
is currently we are in feature 2 that is
green so we'll move to feature one and
okay I pressed space
also check out feature one now we have
switched to Branch feature one for that
you can check also with the command get
Branch So currently we are in feature
one branch and if you want to delete any
branch you could do that get
Branch minus D and the branch name that
could be feature 2 and the branch has
been deleted to check out you could just
write get Branch So currently we are in
feature one and then there's the main
branch and now we'll see some other
commands that is get add or if you just
write get add Dot and press enter it
will help you that is get add space
period and it will help you to get all
the files staged so as we have already
staged the file we won't be able to do
it again now what we'll do is we will
create a new project or new directory on
the system and then get it to the GitHub
so for that we will start with the
origins command now what we'll do is is
we will work in the local repository and
we will create a new file with the new
repository and get it to or get it
uploaded to the GitHub for that we'll
use the command get in it so this
command g in it is used to create an
empty git repository and after the git
init command it's used there will be a
do git folder that will be created in
the directory with some of the subd
directories so once the repository is
initialized the process of creating
other files begin so for that I
will take you
guys first what we'll do is we will
initialize or configure the files again
that will be the username and the mail
address so for that we'll write the
commands that is
get
config minus
minus global user.name
and our username
was abar
ahuja7 we have done it and we will
configure globally that is our email
address minus minus
Global user.
email we7 at theate gmail
and it has been configured now moving
back to our Visual Studio code here we
will get back from this
directory and inside the abis only we
will create a new directory and use the
get init command to initialize
it so for that what will do we will
create a folder first
and name it as
project and now we'll move inside the
project now we are in the folder or the
directory of the project now we'll use
the command get in
it so it has added or created an empty G
repository so to check it we'll use the
ls command first we'll move to the
repository that would be CD
and the name of the repository that is
project um but we have we don't have
created
it so what we'll do we'll open the
folder here that is
C
users
abja and then we have the project folder
you could see that we have created that
a dogit is created when we have
initialized git in it it has created the
dogit folder in
[Music]
it and getting our terminal back
here and in this project we will create
a file and name it as index. HTML
and in this
file if we use the command get add so
similarly the git add command is used to
like after checking the status of the
files to add those files to the staging
area and before running the git command
git add is used to add any new or
modified file so as we have created a
new file that is
index.html and we could write anything
here that would be HTML
and inside we could create a
heading and name as project only so we
could use the get add command to add it
to the staging area so nothing specified
or it's saying nothing added as you
could see V are so similarly we will use
or check other
commands that is first there is get add
command so what it does
is it will move changes from the working
directly to the staging area and this
gives you the opportunity to prepare a
snapshot before committing it to the
official history and then we have
other that is K Branch so this command
is your Journal purpose Branch
Administration tool it lets you create
isolated development environments within
a single repository only and then we
have other command that is get check out
so in addition to checking out all
commits and old file revisions get
checkout is also the means to navigate
existing branches that is combined with
the basic git command it's a way to work
on a particular line of development and
then we have get clean
command so it removes untracked files
from the working directory this is The
Logical counterpart to get reset which
typically only operates on track files
so this is about the get clean file or
the get clean command and you have
already seen the git clone command that
is it creates a copy of an existing git
repository that is after it we will
paste the link of the git repository and
it will create a copy of an existing git
repository and cloning is the most
common way for developers to obtain a
working copy of a central repository and
there's an get commit
command so it takes a stage snapshot
that is after we have used the get add
command we can use the get commit
command as it will take the stage
snapshot and commit it to the project
history and it will not reflect in the
GitHub but it will come into the project
history and combined with Git add this
defines the basic workflow for all G
users and there's one more command that
is g commit minus
minus
amend and what this does is passing the
minus minus amend flag to get commit it
lets you amend the most recent commit
and this is very useful when you forget
to Stage a file or omit important
information from the commit message and
then comes the command get
config so what does this so it's a
convenient way to set configuration
options for your G installation you will
typically only need to use this
immediately after installing it on a new
development machine and there's a g
fetch command
that fetch downloads of a branch from
another repository along with all of its
Associated commits and files but it
doesn't change or doesn't try to
integrate anything into your local
repository and this gives you a chance
to inspect changes before merging them
with your project as we have already
discussed about the G init command that
it
initializes a g repository that will be
a new G repository and if you want to to
place a project under revision control
this is the first command you need to
learn and then comes the Get Low
command so it lets to explore the
previous revisions of a project it
provides several formatting options for
displaying committed
snapshots and then we have get merge
command so it's a powerful way to
integrate changes from Divergent
branches after folking the project
history with Git Branch G lets you put
it back together
again so I
will have you a little understanding
that would be merging and rebasing so
the G rebase command has a reputation
for get magical G hocus fcus that
beginners should stay away from but it
can actually make life much easier for
development team when used with care so
get rebase is the and get merge command
and identify all of the potential
opportunities to incorporate B basing
into the typical git
workflow and then there's a git pull
command so pulling is the automated
version of get fetch it downloads a
branch from a report repository then
immediately merges it into the current
Branch so this is the g equivalent of SN
update and then we have get push command
so pushing is the opposite of fetching
that is with a few Cates it lets you
move a local branch to another
depository which serves as a convenient
way to publish contributions this is
like SVN commit but it sends a series of
commits instead of a single chain sheet
and then we have the G
rebase so rebasing lets you move
branches around which helps you avoid
unnecessary merge commits the resulting
linear history is often much easier to
understand and explore and then we have
the G rebase minus I
command so the minus I flag is used to
begin an interactive rebasing session
this provides all the benefits of a
normal rebase but gives you the
opportunity to add edit or delete
commits along the way and with that guys
we have come to the end of this session
