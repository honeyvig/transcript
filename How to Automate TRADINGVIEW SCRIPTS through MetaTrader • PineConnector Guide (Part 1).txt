hi Traders and welcome to my Pine
connector beginner
guide first things first what is Pine
connector Pine connector is an expert
advisor script which was recently
developed for the metatrader platform
and it allows you to execute trades
automatically based on trading view
alerts this allows you to fully automate
trading view scripts and strategies
written in pinescript as you know by now
if you've watched any of my pinescript
lessons pinescript is an incredibly easy
and simple language to learn at least
compared to python or mql or other
higher level languages that are commonly
used to automate trading scripts and if
you're a subscriber to my channel which
you should be if you want to enhance
your Edge over the markets through
scripting then you know that I recently
finished an entire series demonstrating
how to use the auto view plug-in for the
Chrome browser which does exactly the
the same thing as Pine connector the
main differences with pine connector is
that it's cheaper than auto view nearly
half the price it runs in the popular
Advanced metatrader trading platform
which most Brokers offer support for
it's more powerful than auto view at
least for Forex Traders and the reason
is more powerful is because metatrader
scripts can read your account balance
and various other account details and
open position information where auto
view does not for example if you want to
open open a trade with a position size
and risk equating to just 1% of your
account balance achieving this in auto
view is far more difficult as you need
to manually calculate your position size
in your Pine scripts Pine connector on
the other hand can achieve this with a
single alert parameter that specifies
how many percentage points to risk of
your account balance you just add the
parameter to your alert message and pine
connector calculates your position size
for crypto and stock Traders this may
not be applicable to your Trading style
but for Forex Traders this is an
industry standard way of operating in
the markets by using pine connector you
can always be sure that your Forex
position size is appropriate when
executing automated strategies and as
any experienced Trader knows having a
consistent position size is Paramount to
maintaining consistent results and plays
a massive role in your Edge over the
markets there's always a trade off when
automating pinescript code the benefit
of automating pinescript code is that
PIN code is extremely easy to write and
it's an easy language to learn the
limitations of pinescript on the other
hand when it comes to automating
strategies is too long to list but Pine
connector bridges that Gap significantly
and as far as I can tell in all the
research I've done when it comes to
automating Pine script strategies on the
Forex markets Pine connector is the best
solution out there and in this video
series I'm going to introduce you to
Pine connector and show you how to get
started today's video focuses on getting
the platform set up starting your 7day
free trial and executing your first test
trade on a demo account you can find a
link in the video description to the
Pine connector website to sign up and
create your account and in future videos
I'll cover the pine connector alert
commands and syntax in great detail as
well as how to automate your trading
view scripts and send the relevant
alerts within your Pine code and finally
I'll show you how to set up metatrader
on a virtual private server so that you
can have your automated scripts running
24/7 with as little downtime as possible
welcome to the most comprehensive guide
to Pine connector on the internet let's
get
started so here we are on the pine
connector homepage the very first thing
you need to do obviously is create your
account so to do that come up here and
click on
login and then click on create account
you need to fill out these details and
then log to your account once you've
signed into your account this is the
page you'll be taken to so this number
here is your license ID and you will
need this in order to initiate your
trial your 7-Day free trial and you'll
also need it if you purchase access to
this expert advisor in order to validate
your account on metatrader so once
you've logged in you have two options
you can either download the metatrader 4
expert advisor or the metat trader five
expert advisor both of these expert
advisor scripts behave pretty much
identically so it doesn't matter which
one you pick as long as you pick the one
that's compatible with your version of
metatrader so for me personally my main
broker is oanda and they only support
metatrader 4 as of recording this video
so today's video is going to show you
how to set up the metatrader 4 version
but the steps should be pretty similar
for the metatrader 5 version and if you
get stuck on any of the steps that I
show you today make sure to come to this
web page and click on the setup guide
relevant to whichever version you're
trying to set up so if I open this in a
new tab you can see that the pine
connector team have written out a list
of instructions step by step on what you
need to do in order to get this expert
advisor set up and running in today's
video I'm going to take you through each
of these steps for metatrader 4 and then
we're going to test a command to make
sure everything works and in the next
video I'll show you the various alert
command and syntax that we have to work
with so let me go back to my main
account page and I'm going to click on
download mt4 EA now it doesn't matter
where you download this just so long as
you remember where you put it so that we
can copy it into the metatrader
directory later so I'm going to click
save here and just save it to my
downloads folder so on this computer I
do not have metatrader set up currently
so I need to go and download the
metatrader platform now this EA should
work with any version of metatrader 4
whether it be the vanilla version or
whichever version your broker gives you
to download I'm going to go to the oanda
website log into my account and then
download their version of metatrader 4
if you're familiar with metatrader and
you've used it before you might want to
skip ahead in this video to where I
install the pine connector expert
advisor but for those of you who are new
to metatrader or haven't used it before
the next few minutes will show you how
to download metatrader create an account
and log in to your broker there will be
time stamps in the video description to
help you skip ahead if you need to so
here I am on the oanda account homepage
to download the oanda version of
metatrader 4 I just need to click on
this link here so I'm going to click on
that and I'm going to save it into my
downloads folder now that I have the
installation file I just need to click
on this little drop down box and click
open and I'm going to install metatrader
just into the default directory now I'm
going to click finish and we can close
this page we don't need to make a
metatrader account so the next thing we
need to do if you haven't already is is
create a metatrader for compatible sub
account at least that's what I need to
do through my broker oanda so to do that
I have switched to My Demo account cuz I
want to practice these commands on my
demo account before I move to my Live
account and to create a compatible
account I need to click on this add sub
account link here now just ignore this
primary account with 89 quadrillion
million dollar in it that was an account
I created for my girlfriend's uh little
nephew to play around with and he did
quite well to be honest he made a few
hundred million trading corn which is uh
pretty impressive for a 7-year-old
anyway I've already got a metatrader
account set up and if I want to log into
metatrader this is the information I
need to pay attention to or at least my
metatrader login and server if you don't
have this account and you're using oanda
then to create a metatrader 4 account
all you need to do is click on add new
sub account and then select metatrader 4
here and then once you've done that you
should have this information here when
you click on your relevant account and
now this is the info I need to log in to
metatrader so let me open up metatrader
here it is click on that now if I go
back to my oanda account my server is
oanda demo 1 and I need to copy this
account login number so oanda demo 1
will be this server here this practice
server if I click next and then I click
existing trade account paste in my login
number and then type in my password
Here my account is now logged in and
just to verify that I'm going to come up
and click on New Order and just see if I
have the option to and I do so I am now
so I am now logged in to my account
you'll have to ignore all these silly
sounds that metat trator makes it's
quite annoying I'm sure you can turn it
off in the settings but I'll leave it as
it is for now and we'll just move on to
the next step in setting up a pine
connector which is opening up your data
folder so the quickest way to do this is
just click file and then click on open
data folder and here it is now we need
to open up the mql4 folder just double
click on that and then we need to open
up our experts folder at the top here
any of you who have used expert advisors
before knows how this works but for
those of you who don't we need to copy
in the pine connector expert advisor
file or script into this folder so for
me I downloaded my file to my downloads
folder so I'm going to click on that I
need to copy this file or cut this file
right click cut and click back and I'm
going to paste that file into this
folder here and now the expert advisor
script is installed all we have to do
now is close this folder close
metatrader and then reopen metatrader so
that it can load the script that we just
added so I'm going to relaunch
metatrader and we're back in if I click
on this plus symbol under expert
advisors we should see the pine
connector script installed so the next
step is to adjust some of the metatrader
default settings to enable um the
permissions that the script needs in
order to do that we need to go up to
tools here and click on options or hit
crol O next we need to click on the
expert advisor Tab and then enable or
allow dll Imports it says potentially
dangerous enable only for trusted
applications Pine connector is a trusted
application it's a legitimate script and
we're on a demo account anyway so it's
perfectly safe to click allow on this
option while we're here we should also
click allow automated trading which will
allow Pine connector to trade on our
behalf when the time comes and I'm going
to untick these two options here now we
can click okay and the next step is to
attach Pine connector to a chart it can
be any chart it doesn't need to be the
chart or the market that you want to
trade
as long as this script is attached to
any chart in the platform then when we
send our alerts to Pine connector to the
Pine connector web hook our script will
receive that alert and will trade any
Market that we tell it to the only
requirement is that we leave metatrader
running on our computer now that could
be a problem for some of you but don't
worry at the end of this series I'll
show you how to set up a free virtual
private server to run this 24/7 on a
virtual server I've already created a
lesson on how to do that for auto view
the link will be in the video
description and should be popping up on
the top right hand corner of your screen
right now the steps are extremely
similar to that video if you want to set
up a virtual private server to run
metatrader but we'll come back to that
later first of all let's just get this
script working so the next step is to
attach Pine connector to a chart if this
window is not open for you press crln to
open it up now I'm just going to close
three of these charts s and maximize
this middle one and I'm going to right
click this and click attach to a chart
the next step is to come to the common
tab make sure allow dll Imports is
selected and make sure that allow live
trading is enabled the next step is to
click on inputs and now we need to paste
our license ID into this value column so
to get your license ID go back to the
Pine connector account web page which is
this page here we need to copy this
number here so you can click on that or
just copy the text go back to metat
trator and then paste that number in
here now we just click okay and that
should add the script to the Chart now
if the script was successfully added to
your chart and you were successfully
authorized to use the script then you
should see in your top left corner your
free trial expiry date if you see this
text up here then you have success
successfully installed and added the
script to your metatrader platform and
that's pretty much it all we have left
to do is test the command make sure that
the script is working and then we'll
wrap up this video and I'll come back in
the next video and we'll go over all of
the command syntax that we have to work
with when using this script all right so
before we set a test alert on the
trading view platform we need to adjust
a few settings in the pine connector
expert advisor so to do that I'm going
to right click on my chart come down to
expert advisors and click
properties now here is our Pine
connector input settings I want to
adjust a couple of these I want my take
profit and stop- loss to be based on
price so I'm going to double click on
this setting here click on the drop-
down box and change this to TP and SL
based on price if you leave this on Pips
and you send your alert with a whole
number for your takeprofit or stop loss
then the script will treat that number
as Pips but if you want to set it based
on price you need to change your setting
here in the pine connector interface the
next setting is our volume type I'm
going to leave mine on a percentage of
my account balance but you could change
this to a specified volume or lot size
if you wanted to depending on your
strategy you might need to change this
but it's generally considered best
practice in trading to base your
position size as a percentage of your
account balance rather than some
arbitrary uh lot size unless of course
you're using a complex money management
technique but for but today I'm going to
leave mine on percentage of balance I
don't need to worry about pyramiding
this just means if it's set to true then
the pine connector script can open more
than one trade in a given Direction and
hedging means that you can open multiple
trades in multiple directions I'm going
to leave that with the default setting
of false and I'm going to leave
pyramiding on for now so now I need to
click okay so now let's jump over to the
trading view charting platform and we
can set up a test alert uh I'm just
going to scroll to a blank chart here we
go um and actually let's open up euro
dollar since that is the market we're
going to send a test command to so now
to send a test alert all we need to do
is right click on our chart and click
ADD alert now we want this alert to be
guaranteed to trigger since it's a test
command so to do that we're going to
click on the condition here and change
this to greater than and then just set
the value to zero so that will guarantee
that this alert fires as soon as it's
created next up we don't need to be
notified about this alert unless you
want to be and I don't want it playing
any sounds when it fires so the first
thing we need to do to make sure that
this alert will fire is input the web
hook URL to Pine connector so to do that
enable the web hook URL text box and you
can see I've already got mine saved here
but I'll show you where to go and get
this URL if you need to in the future if
you go to your Pine connector account
and click on configure alerts to our
server alerts guide here and you scroll
down to number two here step number two
you can see the web hook URL right here
so just copy this web hook URL and paste
that into this web hook URL text box in
your alert interface and now whenever
this alert triggers whatever we put in
our message will be sent to this web
hook URL and then Pine connector will
relay this information to metatrader so
if you want more information on how to
set up your alerts through pinec
connector make sure to go through this
uh alerts setup guide but in today's
video I'm going to walk you through this
first section here so the first thing we
need to do is get the right symbol
ticker ID from metatrader If the symbol
you want to trade isn't listed in this
list here press contrl U and then click
on these groups to locate the instrument
you'd like to trade these groups will
look different depending on your broker
or wer have kindly named these groups in
a manner that's extremely easy to
understand and that's sarcasm obviously
but if the symbol you want to trade is
in Gray uh for example let's say I
wanted to trade the Aussie 200 asx2 200
I need to double click on this
instrument to turn it yellow and then
this is the ticket ID that I would need
to send to Pine connector in my alert
message to trade it so make sure to come
into your symbols list and activate the
symbols you want to trade make sure that
the symbols are yellow the ones that you
want to trade through Pine connector
it's going to be different based on
whatever platform you're using or what
whatever broker you're using it's not as
simple as just sending the market you
want to trade if I open up my metatrader
account here and make sure to pull out
this window a little bit further so that
you can read the entire ticker ID you
can see here that all of my markets end
with a dash2 so if I want to send a
command to open a trade on euro dollar I
need to add-2 to the end of my ticker ID
it's a little bit annoying I know
especially when it comes to sending
these commands based on your PIN script
code but when we get to the lesson where
I show you how to send commands to Pine
connector through your Pine script code
I'll show you a solution to this issue
but for now just remember that when
we're sending our test command I need to
write out my ticker ID is
euro-2 so before we write out our
Command let's go to the alert setup and
just read the example message here so
you can see that the parameters of our
Command or our alert syntax is separated
by commas and the first parameter we
need to send to Pine connector is our
license ID so if I come up to my account
here scroll to the top that's this
number here again so if I right click
this and click copy and we go back to
trading view I can paste that ID in here
hit comma and now now the next parameter
is which direction I want to trade in so
you can see here we have our license ID
buy or sell if you write sell in here
then that will sell this Market short uh
but today I want to buy this
Market next up we need our ticker ID and
then we can specify our stop- loss take
profit and risk Etc so to specify the
market I want to trade remember that we
need to put in our ticker ID remember
that the ticker ID ended with a -2 so I
need to write it out like this this will
send a Buy command to the euro dollar
market on metatrader next up we need to
specify our risk remember that we set
our risk to a percentage of our account
balance in the pine connector settings
so I can use any number here one would
be
1% um 2 would be 2% so let's go with 2%
for today's example next up I'm also
going to specify a stop-loss price and a
takeprofit price now if you had set up
your Pine connector settings to be based
on Pips then you could use a whole
number here in order to uh specify your
stop- loss and Pips so 25 for example
would set up a 25 pip stop- loss below
our entry in the case of a buy order but
for today we're dealing with price so
I'm going to write in here let's just go
with
1.84 to keep it simple so when this
command gets executed we will have a
stop loss placed right here and and for
our takeprofit let's set that to
1.94 just to keep today's example as
simple as possible so now this should be
all we need in order to execute a test
trade on euro dollar so when I click
create this alert should fire
instantaneously and open a buy order at
Market on euro dollar with our 2% risk
based on our stop-loss price so let's
click create and then jump over to
metatrader and see what happens there we
go it just fired off and here here we
have our Euro doll trade opened so you
can see that our trade was opened at 1.1
1909 our stop loss is at 1.84 and our
take profit is at
1.94 and our position size is
0.21 of a lot or around 21,000 units so
there we have it we've successfully set
up Pine connector and fired our first
test trade so if you want to see your
orders in real time just right click on
the symbol we're trading and click start
window and you can see where our buy
order was executed and our take profit
and stop loss so that will do it for
today's introduction video in the next
video I will go over the various
commands we have to work with with pine
connector and in the video after that
we'll get our hands dirty with some Pine
script code and start sending these
commands to metatrader from within our
scripts the same way we did with auto
view in my auto view series if you've
watched any of those lessons now the
concepts here between auto view and pine
connector are very similar the main
difference is obviously we're working
with metatrader here and the coolest
difference in my opinion is that we can
set our risk as a percentage of our
account balance through metatrader which
takes into account our actual account
balance as opposed to auto view where we
need to artificially calculate our
position size in pinescript since auto
view doesn't allow you to set your
position size based on on a percentage
of your account balance the other cool
thing is that Pine connector is quite a
bit cheaper than auto view nearly half
the price so not only is Pine connector
more powerful than auto view at least
when it comes to Forex Trading it is
also significantly cheaper and now if
