will be learning how to include a column
or how to include multiple columns in
excel now before that let me tell you
guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add columns or how
to add multiple columns in excel now
without further ado let's get started
with the practical mode now we have
started our excel worksheet and here you
can see we have employee details on our
worksheet
now all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you're a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so b is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns b and c so remember that excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if i if you
wanted to add a column next to v then
you want to select the column c and
right click and select the insert option
so that it can be added in between b and
c which is adjacent to b so let's look
at it right so you have added the
next uh column or a new column right
next to the column b and it's in between
the designation and employee name now
you can add your in a second name so
that's how you create a new column in
excel
now in case if you wanted to you know
create multiple columns all together so
here we have or here we needed a second
name also
here you have a designation and you
wanted to add another column which you
know assigns manages to the employees
right so let's delete it uh delete the
second column and let me explain you how
what i want to do so here you wanted to
add the second name of the employee and
also the manager of these employees
right so here you wanted to add two
columns all together right and now you
might be wondering could i add two
columns together uh or will it work only
for the one column thing right no it
works for two columns and also more than
two columns altogether so you wanted to
add two columns here right so select the
two columns you can you can select or
you can click on the column c and hold
that left key and drag it along the
right side okay so here i have selected
two columns and here it's three right so
you can see here uh it's one zero four
eight five six seven six r cross three c
that means you have selected three
columns if i navigate out of the four
you can see we have selected four
columns right
now
right click and select on insert and
you'll have
four columns in between employee name
and designation now you might have to
add your second name manager's name
manages employee id you know and the
department everything or you can add
anything or any number of columns in
between the existing columns so that's
how you add columns in excel and with
that we have come to an end of this

add multiple columns in excel and if you
