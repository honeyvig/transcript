yeah happiness uh
like once the notification was out my
like phone was
uh filled with lots of messages and
calls
so this is a very new terminology to me
that i
and i see it something
institute of national importance
combined entrance test
okay i'm not much worried about this
what i always says
[Music]
from years to years is keep calm
do your job that's that's the simple job
that you have to do is
you have to study hard so
as most of the people they have some
they don't have a clarity about this so
with my knowledge i want to discuss
few eye-opening facts
and of course there are few important
key points that you have to make a note
from this notification
okay first of all uh most of you
should focus only on
our point of view so our point of view
in this list is
mds and this video is not for the
medical people so don't want any medical
student to continue this video you can
pause and go ahead
so the the focus for
us is mds so in this session i am going
to talk like how far
this notification is important or it
will be useful
for an mds student
right so we'll go ahead into the
notification
so this is a new terminology okay or a
new committee
uh where most of the
examinations because regularly we have
neet
so apart from neet for mds for the
central government or government based
institutes and colleges there are few
things that
they conduct their individual entrance
section
apart from that the first individual
entrance exam is ames
roughly you will have 15 seats
now they have i mean like if delhi will
have
10 odd seats okay and followed by the
rest all aims will have five seats total
15
will be the intake and this intake
you have two intakes per year okay
intake one will be
the jan intake
okay and intake two will be the
admissions will be in the july
okay there will be drift in the
admission pattern because of this
pandemic that is a different story
okay so this is what about ames and one
coming to the second university that
we are focused is the chipmunk
pondicherry and recently jupiter
pondicherry
i think they they have done with two
rounds of counselling until now recently
pondicherry has added mds in it
and the number of seats are only two
okay
the number of seats are only two seats
are there okay two seats are there
and the intake will be in july we don't
have any intakes in january
okay we don't have any intakes in
january the number of intakes are
just two okay the third thing that
you have to focus on is
your pga chandigarh nimham's
bangalore is nowhere related to us we
don't have any mds scores over there
so you have the next one is uh
chandigarh right so pga chandigarh pgh
indigo is intake is nine okay
nine and the intake is only in the month
in july session
okay so the only intake for mds
is in the january session is aims
i i have i have kept the references also
which are taken from pgh indigo slide as
well as
uh the chipmunk pondicherry okay pj
chandigarh has their exam in the
giant session but the exam is for the
house job
okay that is for the junior residential
it is not
purely for mds okay
so i mean like out of this notification
we are nowhere related to this so you
can strike it off
and this notification is for the jan
okay
so in jan session uh pj has house job
okay that may be useful for few of you
but
it doesn't has any pg in it
july session will have pc similarly
pondicherry is doesn't have
any uh mds course as of now
we don't know the things may be modified
the things may be modified but we need
to wait
uh for this state okay
okay everything will be very clear very
transparent
once the eligibility criteria is out
okay and once the seed position
is out okay so you need to wait for this
date for
clarity meanwhile uh most of
you i mean most of the conker family
is completely in a panic situation what
is this what
is that so i want to give some some sort
of explanation for
the questions which you are just
bringing me
so this is what okay that you have to
make you know
so coming to the basic registration
people i i'm not talking about the
interns intense you are first candidates
people who has previously given aims
okay
that may be last year or last year you
have done your registration
that is sufficient that is sufficient
you don't need to do the basic
registration basic registration is
something like
uh one time okay you can do one time but
you can give n number of
exams you can give aims all the sessions
with one basic registration
but if you're not done any basic
registration previously
then you have to do the basic
registration which is going to start
this date and and set this date
okay so intense you're going to be the
first candidates so you can proceed with
the basic registration
okay and the next dilemma for most of
the interns and most of the odd batch
interns specifically is whether they're
eligible for this exam or not
okay that's the biggest question no one
can answer as of now but
i feel like the coveted 19
situation will be considered as a
national
natural disaster naturally occur
pandemic
they may consider your internship
they may consider this pandemic as an
internship
but for this official notification
we have to wait for the dca updates or
the concern college people or the
university updates
or at least we need to wait for the
eligibility criteria
which is going to be given by the aims
or the upcoming neet notification
so intense don't worry about this
particularly the odd batch interns are
more worried about this i'm getting so
many calls from you
okay don't worry about this first focus
on preparation
this is common thing for everyone okay
we are not special to this
or our bet odd batch interns are
suffering so it's better to leave it and
focus on the preparation
interns who are halfway with the halfway
half away through their internship
few few colleges college people are
calling back
to continue their internship wait the
dca is going to give the notification
okay don't worry stay positive hopefully
we'll get a positive sign
which is going to help our preparation
if not it is same for all okay so don't
waste
much of your time on this stay positive
that's what
my suggestion to most of you
so as i said i have dropped some
references okay the first reference is
taken from the pga sorry
taken from the pga chandigarh website
okay so it has only
july intake okay it has only
the july intake right the july intake
and
it has only the three branches in it
okay
clear so that's that's one it we don't
have any january intake
we don't have any channel variant
similarly this is 2
2020 entrance examination
uh schedule for uh
for the chipmunk so here you can see
we have sorry here we can see we have
july mds right you have joule mds
but you don't have any mdss in the
january session
so these are the rough assumptions
but the clarity will be given in the
prospectives
which is going to be out on 6th
of october so wait for that once the
prospectives are out
and i'm going to post one more video uh
to focus only on the key things okay for
any for everything like
even if you prepare something reading
some topic there are few key things
where your questions will come from so
your focus should be only on the key
things so
i hope you have learned few things few
key things
in this particular notification okay
and i mean of course the the most
important thing that you have to make a
note is
the date of examination so your
countdown has started
you have to focus more on that and the
second important thing that most of you
are missing
is the exam time
okay so exam time is not
in the afternoon most of you are being
prepared or giving examinations in the
afternoon taking your need into
consideration
your need into consideration but i don't
know why there is
some drift of time now they have kept
exam in the morning session
but again for this confirmation few
times
it may or may may go error i have seen
situations where aims people
went i mean there's some modifications
okay they may come out with a different
time
in the prospectus but you have to focus
the most important thing that you have
to focus
is the exam time exam time is in the
morning so from now
okay so try to be active both in the
morning time as well as in the afternoon
time because your need will be mostly
your need will be
in the afternoon your amc is in the
morning so you have to be
active at this phase your adrenal levels
should be active at this place i want
everyone to practice
your exams or give your mock exams at
this particular time
which is going to make you active or
your brain active in solving an mcq in
the examination hall
okay so these are the two things that
you have to make a note that is the date
of examination
slight modifications in your schedule
slight modifications in your approach
and make sure you drop the countdown
dates of aims
in the in your study room so that's
going to give you a buzz to run
hard and to move ahead in your
preparation phase and make a note your
examination is in the after
is in the morning session i'm stressing
it again and again this is going to play
a very very vital role
okay and the most important thing is
focus on books not on social media
i'm seeing so many people uh focusing on
social media
and deviating your preparation it's not
right
so i of course the pandemic situation is
in such a way that
people were focusing more on social
media
i mean like previously we used to have
the same issue
but the drift is more now towards the
social media you have multiple
groups you have multiple websites you
have multiple youtube channels you have
so many things now every even
undergraduate is opening in
youtube channel even even undergraduate
opening teaching and everything
everything is happening
but but you once you like if you're
planning to follow something
do some background work and follow
because when you are approaching towards
the examination
the most important thing that you have
to make you notice
what to read and what not to read when
your material is increasing in size
your confidence levels will decrease in
size
okay so that most thing is required for
examination is the confidence level so
you try to transparent that content
and give importance to the content which
is really required
so my suggestion for most of you is
follow a single mentor follow a single
path
because when you are following a single
path your destination
will be easy to reach and there is high
chances that you will reach your
destination safe
when you follow different people or
different mentors
i think like things may get overlapped
so this is the most common
uh reason i have seen uh
in the people who really work hard but
not
up to their mark in the examination
so please this is this is my personal
suggestion
i myself is a victim when i was
preparing for the entrance
following multiple mentors or following
multiple things
and i don't want you to be the same okay
so
love learning with team mds conquer
thank you take care all the best
