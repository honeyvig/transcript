happiness
yes this is dr srikanth from team mds
conquer
now i'm going to discuss the topic endo
period lesions
so first of all when you're talking
about an
infection infection may start at one
place
okay and may enter at different places
this is what regularly seen in the human
body so the entry of
the infection from the entry
point that is the focus of infection
okay
it spreads to different areas or
different systems
similarly when you're talking about a
dental heart tissue
which contains enamel
you have your tent in you have your
pulp over here and this yellow area
inside the gingiva which attaches is
called as cementum
and all this area is called as
very periodontal tissue okay
so particularly this area is called as
periapical periodontal tissue
so this is water the structures that are
present
in the dental heart tissue that is the
truth
so now we are talking about the
relationship of
pulp and periapical okay here you have
pulp and you have your
periapical tissue or periodontium
okay so first of all we need to talk
about what are the communications that
are
present so whenever you have a
communication okay
then only the infection from one area
that is the pulp will spread to
periapical or periodontium or
periodontium will spread to the pulp
so that is the relationship between the
pulp and
periodontal tissue we are going to talk
about okay
so when you are talking about this
particular content
the main important aspect that you have
to make a note
is what are the communications the
communication number one
is apical foramen so apical foramin is
one communication where the pulp is
going to communicate with the paradox
and the second communication you can see
here this is the
whenever whenever there is a gingival
recession
you will lose cementum over that
particular area the local cementum is
lost
and your dental tubules will be exposed
so the first route is
apical foramen the second route is
dentinal tubules and sometimes apart
from the apical foramen you will have
your accessory canals
you will have your lateral canals you
will have your fertile canals
so all the extra canals okay
so the one communication between the
pulp and periapical
is apical foramin the second
communication is the
dentinal tubules and third communication
are the canals
so these are the communications by which
the infections from one area
will spread to other area means pulpal
infection can be spreaded to the
periodontium periodontal infection can
be spreaded to the pulp
because they have communication so these
communications are
prime reasons for the spread of
infection
so according to kohen okay the
classification according to kohen says
the classification of endoperial lesions
can be categorized into
primary endodontic lesion means which
has
only endodontic origin primary
endodontic
secondary periodontal means it started
as an endo
but with all the communications with any
of these communications three
communications we have learned
it has spread it to the periodontia but
initially it has started in end of
then primary periodontium only
periodontal and
primary periodontal secondary means
initially it started in the period
aspect
but spread it to the endodontic creation
and the last one this is very very
important a case which you cannot judge
whether it is primary endo or primary
perio
but has endocrine relations means two
separate lesions
you are not in a position to conclude it
as whether it is primary endo or primary
period such lesions will be
comes under the true combined lesions
that is
endo plus period so this classification
is very very important
because in recent aims and recent need
we have seen
a decent number of questions by just
giving the clinical scenario
and asking you to identify which type of
lesion it is like the diagnosis of
endopedia
the first important aspect that you have
to make a note is primary
endodontic lesion i'm clearly stressing
it
primary endodontic lesion okay so
primary endodontic lesion
means that can be a deep caries
okay so that can be you can see in this
radiograph you will have you have a
kerys
which is approaching to the pulp and
there is pulpitis okay
so there is pulpit is the pulp is
inflamed then from the pulpal
with all the chances what are the
chances one communication is by the
dentinal root
dentinal sheals the second communication
is can be by the
fertile canals the third communication
can be by the apical foramen
it spreads to the periodontium it
damages the predomination
it can damage the peritoneum also right
so
so such cases are called as primary
endodontic
origin so if this case has periodontal
pathology also then it is going to
then we can call it as primary endo and
secondary period if it has only
endodontic origin
then it is called as primary endodontic
relation
the second one is primary periodontal
okay
so there is a deep pocket here you can
see there is a deep pocket you have a
bone loss here
you can clearly appreciate on the
radiograph you have a bone loss here
so by which you have a pocket and the
infection starts from the periodontia
okay if this infection start from the
periodontium
and if in future if it is going to hit
the pulp also
pulp also means you don't have a dental
caries you don't have any signs of
or any ethiology for the pulpal
infection on the radiograph or on the
clinical scenario
but the pulp is damaged because it has a
deep pocket
which indirectly gives means it is
started as a primary
it has started as a primary periodontal
periodontal lesion
but further it has caused endodontic
problems also means some purple disease
so it is called as
primary perio and secondary
endo then i have discussed a combined
lesion
okay means it has the problem from both
the sides
it has a pulpal problem and it has a
periodontal problem
which does not have a communication
which they are not coordinated to each
other
in the clinical scenario because you can
see a deep pocket over here
okay and you can see a pulpal infection
over here but it's not communicated
right
so it's a palpably it is different and
periodontally it is different
you cannot come to your conclusion that
whether it is primary perio or primary
under
such lesions are called as combined
lesions
so as already discussed what are the
communications between the
pulp and the periapical the pulp and
periapical communications are either by
the dentinal tubules
okay or either by the lateral and
axillary canals or either by the apical
foramen so these are the three
communications
which causes the pulpal infection to
spread to the periapical and the
periapical infection to spread the
pulpal areas so now we learn some
integrated
way of handling this so there are some
ethological factors for the causation of
the primary
i mean endocrine lesions and similarly
you have some contributing factors
so what are the contributing factors if
you have a poor endodontic treatment
your endodontic treatment is not great
okay so it may lead to primary endo
it may lead to end of variation in the
future okay it contributes to
and coronal leakage coronal leakage is
the most common cause for the failure of
endodontic treatment because uh as we
know that
we give a temporary registration once
the bmp is done before the obturation
and the minimum thickness of the
registration that is required is 3.5
millimeters okay the cabinet whatever we
give
okay so cabot or imr we give that's
right
so that that that that holds the coronal
registration right that's the coronal
registration
and the minimum thickness that is
required is 3.5 millimeters
and it is the same reason why uh your
when whenever you whenever you are
planning for post endodontic treatment
make sure your cutter patches should be
sealed up to the
up to the uh canal orifice levels okay
so by which you can provide a proper
coronal seal so coronal seal is
mandatory because if there is any damage
of the coronal sill
there are high chances that your
endodontic treatment is going to fail
okay so similarly the other contributing
factors are the trauma
you have your root resorptions you have
your perforations
developmental anomalies particularly
like grooves
palette or ginger grooves grooves which
are extended onto the root surface
because whenever a groove that is
extending onto the root surface
is going to provide a pathway for the
bacteria to move easily
okay so whenever the things are going on
the root what is root area called us
that is
per periodontium right so there are high
chances that the endopaerial lesion can
form similarly a crack tooth syndrome
all these are contributing factors
but coming to the ecological factors the
major ecological factor
of the organisms that is bacteria
bacteria is the most common cause for
the pulpit is and similarly
bacteria is the most common cause of
endopaeria lesion here
we have some important things that you
have to make or not
so among the list of the bacteria the
anaerobic bacteria
causes 90 percentage of
of infections okay and similarly you can
make a note that
spirochetes are associated with both
endo and periolicions okay your
spirochetes are associated with both
endo and uh perio lesions and uh
when when you compare with the number of
spirochetes the spirochetes will be more
in the case of your
sub gingival
plaque when compared with the endodontic
origin
okay and make a note that l
forms okay l forms of bacteria will
learn about what are these
different forms of bacteria so all forms
of bacteria are present
more in endo when compared with the
perio okay you have your fungal
infections
okay that is candy asses you have your
viral infections that is
hepa simplex cytomegaly epstein-barr
virus type 1 are associated with both
indo-imperial lesions
and similarly there are few other
non-living organisms non-living
pathogens that can cause this okay
that can be a foreign body or your
dentin or cementum chip or
your improperly removed amalgam
registration
or your root canal filling material so
all these are
the materials okay extrinsic materials
and similarly you have some
intrinsic agents like these are the
different uh
crystals different types of bodies and
which can be seen in the histological
sessions we'll
i'll show that i'll show you the
diagrams which are very very important
as a diagram based question
so as already discussed you have some
live pathogens you have some non-living
pathogens
so it's already discussed bacteria is a
live pathogen
you make a note about your fungus candy
assist is the most common
your bacteria you'll talk more about
spirochetes
when you want to differentiate
endoletion from periolation
because uh your imperial agents your
spirochetes will be more
that is about your treponomia denticola
okay which is a spirochete which is most
commonly seen in the periodontal lesions
when compared with the endodontic region
so whenever you have a communication
between endoperio
so these bacteria which are present in
the periodontism
will go through the passages okay and
will reach the pulpal so by which you
can
you can you can diagnosis by using some
microbiological tests you can diagnosis
roughly as endopedial lesions similarly
you have your viruses
okay the viruses can be herpes simplex
virus or cytomegaly virus
or epsingbar virus so all these viruses
can be seen in the case of your
endopedia lesions so as already
discussed okay these are the non-living
pathogens
which are going to cause the endoperial
lesion
okay so these are the foreign bodies
okay it's already discussed like uh
i mean the leftover gingival retraction
cord will cause inflammation will leads
to
the bone loss and will will cause the
bone loss leading to the periodontal
problems
okay so you can make a note okay
this is a well-known histological slide
uh epithelial rests of malice
okay so please do please do identify
this i
i think like uh arrow based questions
i think they're very rare to ask like
marking
by pointing a particular area and asking
you to identify this
regularly they are going to give
astrological slide that is given the
recent neet
2020 which has given on general
astrology but of course
your oral histology is nowhere an
exception so
i just want you to make a note about
these diagrams and please try to
identify them
okay these are the cholesterol crystals
okay which can be seen in the periapical
uh radicular cyst okay radicular
periapical cyst
uh these are russell's bodies okay so
please do try to identify this
this unique russell body and these are
rust and highland bodies
okay so you can you can identify them so
please do that
i mean these are the questions which are
commonly seen in your
oral pathology but please do make a note
about the histological
slide too because there are high chances
that they can throw a histological slide
and ask you to identify it
okay so these are
lead and crystals okay and i have
discussed about all the contributing
factors your poor endodontic therapy
poor restoration that is due to the
coronal leakage your trauma
resorption which can be internal or
external development and anomalies
particularly
we need to talk about pallet or gingival
or any sort of grooves which are
extending onto the root surface
perforations and the root factors so all
these are going to be the contributing
factors means
most of these contributing factors they
provide a gateway for the bacteria to
move from one place to other place
regularly you have uh you have a gateway
which moves from
pulp to periapical you have three
gateways which we have learned so these
are these are the contributing factors
which are going to provide
other gateways or which are going to
provide an easy access for the infection
from one area to move to other
other areas okay so you can see a poorly
poor endodontic treatment so here
you don't have your proper observation
the observation is not good so you have
so much of space for the bacteria which
is in the
peridontium to enter into this
particular area or for the bacteria
which is present here
to enter into this particular area so
the communications has
increased well similarly similarly the
condition here okay
your restoration your poor endodontic
treatment okay these are the reasons
and coming here this is a poor
registration i was talking about like
sealing of your
gut apache is very very important once
you seal the gatta patch if you take
like your
system so this is this is where you're
going to obturate right so you're going
to keep gutta pacha here
until this area so these are the
orifices make sure
you keep gutta pacha but the new concept
says that
the world concept says that your orifice
should be filled with gada bache
entirely
what new concept says that your rfi
should be filled
two millimeters below the gutta patch
and this two millimeters you have to
seal with a good sealant
okay most probably how to use gic so you
will get a seal here
so once you get a seal here however that
you are going to do your post and
advantage treatment okay
so in most of these cases here you can
see your gatapatch is not sealed well
okay your post enantic restoration was
not proper
okay so this is a coronal leakage
you can see a resorption here okay you
can see an internal resolution over here
you can see this internal resorption
mostly these internal resolutions are
due to
trauma okay and you can see some
external resorption over this particular
area maybe
this external resolutions can be maybe
maybe one of the one of the ethology for
this external resumptions
can be your orthodontic treat
treatments okay
so this is an external resorption case
and this is an internal resorption case
so you can see a perforation okay
improperly paste i was talking like
whenever you treat uh your mora molars
lucky
make sure that your post length should
not be more than this particular area
but this is the long axis how you have
to keep the post right so but the post
was
kept in a different direction okay which
leads to perforation it's almost
the case is almost the similar okay so
whenever you're keeping a perforation
you're giving a chance for the bacteria
to move from one area to other area so
that's these are again
contributing factors your fractures in
the similar way
you're giving your bacteria to chance to
move okay so development elements i was
talking about the palatal gingival group
you can see this the palette of gingival
groups
extending means normally you don't have
any communication for the bacteria but
when you have
a deep pocket and a paratha ginger okay
then the bacteria has the easy passes
okay so all these are going to be
contributing factors
and make sure you have a decent coverage
or the diagram based questions
so whenever a radiograph or a clinical
photograph is given like
by seeing the options you need to get
some findings get some analysis get some
ideology or the diagnosis and the
treatment plans like for example in this
palette or ginger will grow
okay so what you have to do is uh apart
from like you have to see whether
whether it is going to cause the pulpal
disease or periapical disease if it's
not causing anything
make sure you provide access for this
and you seal it seal it with gic
so the passes can be overcome okay so
such a case like you have to
find a way to overcome this contributing
factor
so what are the different things that
are used
for for this particular diagnosis okay
so diagnosis is very very important one
is visual examination that is clinical
photographs
clinical photographs and the second one
is palpation
okay it is tender on vertical or tender
on horizontal okay you have to see both
okay so your palpation will
will give some idea about the
inflammation areas
your percussion vertical percussion is
going to give
is going to like it's going to help in
checking the
periapical inflammation
okay so your mobility will helps in
testing the
periodontium your radiographs may give
some clue about the
extent of dental caries approaching the
pulp whether it is a pulpitis or
it can give you an idea about the bone
loss your pulp vitality is going to give
the
viability of the pulp okay
and your probing is going to give the
viability of pedentium
your crack tooth test your tooth slot
all these
all these things are useful in finding
out
is there any chance of fracture the
fistula tracing is generally done by
the cut apache mostly you you use a and
like whenever you see a fistula or
whenever you see a
sinus tract opening make sure you insert
some gutta pacha in it
okay preferably uh 25 number gatapacha
is inserted in it
and you have to take a multiple series
of radiographs from different angles by
which you can conclude that
this infection is from this particular
tip okay
so there is one more classification
which is based upon the treatment
okay so the classification says requires
only endodontic treatment
means it is only endodontic lesion
requires periodontal treatment
only a periodontal relation requires
both
treatments so it's going to be
endoperiolation
so like whenever you have to go
you know the cases where you have to go
for only endodontic treatment for
example i
am going to give an example you have a
teeth okay
and it has a sinus opening
into the gingival sulcus so what you
have to do you have a you have your
two one with
sinus opening
in the sulcus
so what you have to do uh you you have
to trace the sinus opening so
take the take a cut apache keep in the
sinus opening and you can trace it like
if it is going towards the periapical
area then you have to check the vitality
of the teeth
so white mostly the vitality will be
non-vital
right so it's an endodontic lesion okay
it's an endodontic condition
so what is the treatment of this case
you have to do root canal treatment
so do root do root canal treatment in
most of the cases the treatment
the root canal treatment is going to be
the permanent treatment for this case
and what about the sinus tag
when the root canal treatment is done
when the infection is removed
so sinus tract will heal by its own the
healing of
sinus tract will be done by its own okay
so
this is the case where only endodontic
treatment is required
right and the second one is periodontal
treatment like
when whenever whenever you diagnose a
periodontium
periodontitis or some periodontal pocket
on a particular teeth
then you do only period treatment okay
so and you have to check the vitality in
most of the cases in this particular
case
the vitality will be positive okay the
pulp is normal but you have the
periodontal problem so so treat the
periodontium it's the only predomination
and the next one is uh a combination of
both
okay it's already discussed like you
have your primary
endo and secondary period
or primary perio and
secondary indus all these cases you have
to do a
combined treatment you have to do a
treatment which is of combination and
preferably
what most of the studies say that when
you have an endoperiolation make sure
you complete
the endotreatment first
because the prognosis for the
endotreatment will be fast
so root canal can be done in single
appointment or
in one or two appointments but when you
have a bone loss
uh your periodontism to regenerate or
or reversal the bone loss it's going to
take lots of time right so
so endodontic treatment has to be done
first followed by the periodontal
treatment in
most of the cases
so this is a basic difference uh i mean
you're well versed with this i'm just
going to make a note
so so the theology for endodontic lesion
is the necrosis of pulp
and the ethiology of periodontal
adhesion is the infection in the
inflammation of the pulp
when you're talking about the nature of
the pain it is acute
and spontaneous most of your periodontal
pains are dull and
chronic and coming to the swelling the
swelling
uh regularly occurs in the periapical
abscess which is
diffused which is diffused and this
is a curse in the attached gingiva which
is a localized one
so when i'm talking about percussion the
percussion will be like it will be
positive in vertical direction it will
be
mild in lateral direction
okay so and the probing depth is is
going to be
normal is going to be more than the
normal here
okay so how do you diagnose the sinus
opening the sinus opening
the gut apache pointing leading to the
effects of the teeth that is involved
it it may move towards the sulcus of the
teeth that is involved
okay so the mobility is localized in
nature and it's going to be very very
rare in the endodontic lesions
but it is more generalized in the nature
your junction epithelium is normal your
gingiva is normal the treatment is root
canal
your junctional epithelium will shows
apical migration your gingiva will be
inflamed in recession and here it's a
paragraph relation
sometimes because of the communications
it can be primary under to secondary
period
and and say primary period to secondary
end
so as already discussed the primary
thing that you have to do is
endodontic therapy treat endo first
followed by you're going to do
all the periodontal things so sometimes
there are a few other extraordinary
things that you have to do that is the
hemi session
radiation bicuspidization all these
things i'm just going to post the
you can just check the photographs okay
so this is an endodontic surgery
okay uh which is done here you can see a
big periapical lesion with lots of bone
loss
okay the endodontic lesion was the
endodontic surgery periapical surgery
was done
so of course whenever you have only
periodontal problems
you have to do your periapical surgery
that is the deep screening scaling or
the root planning
and these are the extraordinary cases
where you can clearly see
here you have a bone loss or a
particular
two okay particular root of a teeth okay
so it's very difficult to save
the entire thing so what better you can
do is you can save this half that is
called as hemi session
okay so this is a section case okay
where you can save the half you can you
can remove the half of the teeth you can
say you can see an edgeless area
and a bridge or a bridge is placed
so when you can do a hemi session okay
hemi session is
uh i mean the indications of
humiliations are very simple
uh so whenever you have uh
a bone loss okay severe bone loss
on a on a route on one road on a route
okay or
we have a fractured road
fractured road or you have a blocked
route
means where your endodontic treatment
you are not able to do an treatment
because of some calcification or
something
or you have a perforated root
okay so all these cases it's better to
remove one
root okay so save the one and remove the
other okay so these are the
things that you have to regularly do so
here it's it's a one more case that is
called as bicuspidization where one
molar okay because you have your
your fertile bone loss okay so you cut
it you got like this and make it into
two premolars
okay so one molar is broken into two
premolars
by going through the forcation the best
indication is whenever you have
a a focal perforation or whenever you
have
uh you have you have a severe bone loss
in the furcation okay
in such cases you can go for this
hemisection or
you can go for this bicuspidation or
bisection
okay so i'm done for now
