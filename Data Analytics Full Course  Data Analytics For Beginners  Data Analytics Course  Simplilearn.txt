use smartphones but have you ever
wondered how much data it generates in
the form of texts phone calls emails
photos videos searches and music
approximately 40 exabytes of data gets
generated every month by a single
smartphone user now imagine this number
multiplied by 5 billion smartphone users
that's a lot for our mind to even
process isn't it in fact this amount of
data is quite a lot for traditional
Computing systems to handle and this
massive amount of data is what we term
as Big Data let's have a look at the
data generated per minute on the
internet 2.1 million Snaps are shared on
Snapchat 3.8 million search queries are
made on Google 1 million people log on
to Facebook 4.5 million videos are
watched on YouTube 188 million emails
are sent that's a lot of data so how do
you classify any data as Big Data this
is possible with the concept of 5 V's
volume velocity variety veracity and
value let us understand this with an
example from the healthcare industry
Hospitals and Clinics across the world
generate massive volumes of data
2,34 exabytes of data are collected
annually in the form of patient records
and test results all this data is
generated at a very high speed which
attributes to the velocity of Big Data
variety refers to the very ious data
types such as structured semi-structured
and unstructured data examples include
Excel records log files and x-ray
images accuracy and trustworthiness of
the generated data is termed as veracity
analyzing all this data will benefit the
medical sector by enabling faster
disease detection better treatment and
reduced cost this is known as the value
of big data but how do we store and
process this big data to do this job we
have various framework such as Cassandra
Hadoop and Spark let us take Hadoop as
an example and see how Hadoop stores and
processes Big Data Hadoop uses a
distributed file system known as Hadoop
distributed file system to store Big
Data if you have a huge file your file
will be broken down into smaller chunks
and stored in various machines not only
that when you break the file you also
make copies of of it which goes into
different nodes this way you store your
big data in a distributed way and make
sure that even if one machine fails your
data is safe on
another map reduce technique is used to
process Big Data a lengthy task a is
broken into smaller tasks b c and d now
instead of one machine three machines
take up each task and complete it in a
parallel fashion and assemble the
results at the end thanks to this the
processing becomes easy and fast this is
known as parallel
processing now that we have stored and
processed our big data we can analyze
this data for numerous applications in
games like Halo 3 and Call of Duty
designers analyze user data to
understand at which stage most of the
users pause restart or quit playing this
Insight can help them rework on the
storyline of the game and improve the
user experience
which in turn reduces the customer churn
rate similarly Big Data also helped with
disaster management during herane Sandy
in 2012 it was used to gain a better
understanding of the storm's effect on
the east coast of the US and necessary
measures were taken it could predict the
Hurricane's landfall 5 days in advance
which wasn't possible earlier these are
some of the clear indications of how
valuable big data can be once it is
accurately processed and analyzed
companies around the world are
generating vast volumes of data every
hour this data could be in the form of
log files web server and transactional
data as well as various customer related
data also data is being generated at a
rapid rate from social media websites
and applications such as Facebook
Instagram Twitter and
WhatsApp companies want to use this data
to derive value out of it and make
business
decisions that's where data analytics
comes into
use data analytics is the process of
exploring and analyzing large data sets
to find hidden patterns unseen Trends
discover correlations and valuable
insights to make business
predictions data analytics improves the
speed and efficiency of your
business a few years ago a business
would have gathered information manually
performed statistical and complex
analytics and Unearthed information that
could be used for future
decisions but today
that business can identify insights on
the Fly for immediate
decisions most organizations have big
data and many understand the need to
harness that data and extract value out
of it so they use a lot of modern tools
and Technologies to perform data
analytics some of the tools I will

practical experience with data the
seventh point is prepare for interviews
be ready to discuss your projects how
you approach problems and what you have
learned you should also be prepared for
technical interview that may test your
knowledge of stat programming and data
analysis technique you can refer to
Simply video on data analysis interview
question and answer on YouTube so to sum
it up master the basics build a
portfolio get certified get experience
through internship and freelancing
Network like crazy and never stop
learning let's discuss the various steps
involved in the data analytics
process as you can see on the screen
there are five process steps now let me
make you understand each of this one by
one so the first step is to understand
the
problem before starting with the
analysis you need to understand the
business problem and Define your goals
asking questions at the outlet is vital
because this would address issues such
as how can we reduce production costs
without sacrificing quality what are
some of the ways to increase sales
opportunities with our current
resources do customers view our brand in
a favorable way answers to these
questions will help you build a clear
road map with lucrative Solutions also
try to find out the key performance
indicators and consider the Matrix to
track along the
way the second step in the process is
data
collection after you have finalized your
goals it's time to start looking for
your data data collection is the process
of gathering information on targeted
variables identified as data
requirements the emphasis is on ensuring
accurate and right data is collected
data collection starts with primary
sources which are also known as internal
sources this is typically structured
data gathered from CRM software Erp
systems marketing autom inform tools and
others these sources contain information
about customers finances gaps in sales
Etc under external sources you have both
structured and unstructured data so if
you're looking to perform a sentiment
analysis towards your brand you would
gather data from various review websites
or social media
apps the next step is to clean the
data the data which is collected from
various sources is highly likely to
contain incomplete duplicate and missing
values so you need to clean these
unwanted redundant data to make it ready
for analysis so to generate accurate
results analytics professionals must
identify duplicate and anomalous data
and other inconsistencies that could
skew the analysis according to a report
60% of data scientists say most of the
time is spent cleaning the data while
57% of data scientists say it's their
least enjoyable task
now the fourth step in the process is
data exploration and
Analysis once data is cleaned and ready
you can go ahead and explore the data
using data visualization and business
intelligence tools you can also use
various Data Mining and predictive
modeling techniques to analyze the data
and build
models you can use different supervised
and unsupervised algorithm such as
linear regression logistic regression
decision tree KNN K means clustering and
lots more to build prediction models for
making business
decisions and the final step is to
interpret the
results this part is important because
it's how a business will gain actual
value from the previous four
steps interpreting the results will help
you find unseen Trends and patterns in
the data and gain insights you can have
a validation check if the results are
answering your questions these results
can be soon to your clients and
stakeholders for better understanding
and business
collaboration now that we have looked at
the various steps involved in data
analytics let's now see the different
tools that can be used to perform the
ABB steps today I've got a question for
you what's the difference between a data
analyst and a data scientist well in
this video we will give you the answers
from Healthcare to ride healing apps and
online shopping to streaming services
big data has transformed applications
and how we interact with them two key
Fields underpinning this transformation
are data science and data analytics now
I know these Concepts can be a bit
tricky to grasp at first so let's use a
fun analogy to make it more clearer
imagine for a moment that a business is
like a human body in this scenario a
data scientist would be a general
practitioner while a data analyst would
be more like a specialist consultant
both play crucial roles in keeping the
body or in in our case the business
healthy and functioning well think of
the data scientist as the GP who looks
at the entire body they need to
understand how all the different parts
work together and how external factors
affect overall health this big picture
views allows them to ask important
questions about the body's well-being
that others might miss on the other hand
the data analyst is like a specialist
focusing on a specific part of the body
let's say the heart or the brain they
dive deep into the area of expertise
answering specific questions and solving
particular problems for example if
there's an issue with the heart the data
analyst or heart specialist would be the
goto expert but remember while the
specialist focuses on their area the GP
will still keep an eye on the overall
health they work together each bringing
the unique skills and keeping the body
or the business in top shape so in a
nutshell data scientist and data analyst
both play Vital roles in keeping a
business healthy the data scientist
looks at the bigger picture while the
data analyst Dives deep into specific
areas throughout this video we will
explore these roles in a more detail
looking at the specific task skills they
need and how they contribute to the data
driven world we live in so let's discuss
the differences between data analytics
and data science imagine a thriving
social media app with millions of users
sharing photos videos and messages every
day at this company we have two data
Heroes Alex the data analyst and Chris
the data scientist they both work with
data but their roles are quite different
Alex is like the apps detective their
job is to figure out on how many people
are using the app right now Alex looks
at two things firstly which features are
most popular when do most people log in
and how long do users spend on this app
Alex digs through user activity logs
engagement metrics and customer feedback
to answer specific questions this helps
the team make the app better today
that's what data analysts do they solve
current puzzles using existing
information now Chris they're more like
the apps fortune teller and inventor
rolled into one Chris takes all the data
Alex collects put a whole lot and more
and tries to predict the future they ask
big questions like what new Futures will
users want next year how can we use AI
to make the app more fun what if we
could predict trending topics before
they explored Chris uses complex
mathematics machine learning and
computer programming to sport Trends and
create new ideas that's what data
scientists do they use data to predict
the future and innovate both Alex and
Chris are crucial for the app success
Alex helps the app run smoothly and
keeps user happy day-to-day Chris helps
the company plan for the future and stay
ahead in the competitive Tech world
let's look at the the key definitions of
how they differ from each other
comparing data science versus data
analytics data science and data
analytics while related serve distinct
purposes data science is a broad
multidisciplinary field encompassing
areas like machine learning artificial
intelligence and computer science it
involves researching vast amounts of
unstructured data to ask and answer
strategic long-term questions data
scientists often build complex models
and algorithm focusing on Innovation and
strategic decision making and they
usually hold senior roles in contrast
data analytics is a specialized
discipline with data science that
focuses on analyzing existing structur
data to answer specific and immediate
questions data analysts interpret data
identify Trends and provide actionable
insights using tools like SQL and Excel
they often work in specific departments
like like marketing and sales while
their skill set is narrower than the
data scientist they have a deep
understanding of the particular
businesses area essentially data
scientists create a big picture
framework while data analysts zoom in
specific elements within that framework
to optimize current
operation let's talk about the skill set
comparison skills for data analyst
Proficiency in business intelligence
tools strong statistical analytical
skills intermediate programming skills
in SQL and python expertise in data
visualization tools like Tab and powerbi
next let's discuss the skills for data
scientist to be a data scientist you
must know Advanced knowledge of machine
learning and AI you must have experience
with big data platforms such as Hadoop
and Apache spark strong programming
skills in Python and R proficience in
predictive modeling and data mining
techniques let's discuss the workflow
comparison now let's compare the
workflows of data analyst and data
scientist the workflow of data analyst
typically begins with data collection
where they gather data from various
sources to ensure they have all the
necessary information next comes data
cleaning a crucial step where they
remove any errors and renes from the
data set to ensure accuracy following
this they perform data analyst using
statistical methods to interpret the
data and uncovered patterns and Trends
to present their findings effectively
data analyst then engage in data
visualization creating charts and graph
that make complex data more
understandable finally they provide
actionable insights offering
recommendations that can be implemented
immediately to improve business
operations in contrast the workflow of a
data scientist starts with identifying
the problem where they Define a
strategic question or opportunity that
needs to be addressed then they proceed
with data mining extracting relevant
data from large data sets to gather the
information needed for the analysis
similar to data analyst data scientists
also perform data cleaning to prepare
the data for analysis however they take
it a step further with data exploration
conducting exploratory analysis to
understand the depth of data next we
have feature engineering where they
create new features from raw data to
enhance the models and then they build
predictive models to forecast future
outcomes based on the data once the
models are ready they deploy the model
into production and start generating
insights in real time the final step is
their workflow to Monitor and iterate
continuously improving the model based
on the new data and ensure it remains
accurate and effective let's discuss the
tools and techniques let's explore the
tools and techniques used by data
analyst and data scientist data analyst
like Alex uses a variety of tools to
handle and analyze data efficiently they
often use Excel for data organization
and basic analysis due to their
accessibility and functionality for
quering databases SQL is the goto
language enabling them to extract and
manipulate data effectively to visualize
data and create insightful dashboards
table is commonly employed using robust
data visualization capabilities
additionally python is used for more
advanced data manipulation and Analysis
making it a versatile tool in data
analyst toolkit on the other hand data
scientists like Chris rely on slightly
different set of tools to handle their
more complex task python is a staple for
data manipulation machine learning and
artificial intelligence thanks to the
extensive libraries and Frameworks R is
also a key tool for particularly for
statistical analysis and visualization
providing powerful statistical
techniques for processing large data
sets Hadoop is indispensable enabling
scalable and distributed computing a
Pache spark is used for large scale data
processing offering speed and ease of
use for big data analytics lastly we
have the tensor flow which is important
for building and deploying machine
learning models making it essential for
AI related task let's discuss the
application comparison let's see how the
work of data analyst and data scientists
realizes real world scenarios data
analyst like Alex plays a vital role in
understanding user behavior for example
they analyze which app features are most
popular among users providing insights
that can enhance user experience and
apps functionality in the realm of sales
they identifi Trends and optimize
marketing strategies ensuring that the
company targets its audience effectively
and maximizes revenue moreover by
analyzing customer feedback data
analysts help improve product features
ensuring the company meets customer
needs and expectations conversely data
scientists like Chris engage in more
productive and Innovative application
they use predictive analysis to forecast
future Trends and behaviors allowing
companies to make informed strategic
decisions for instance they build
recommendation systems that such as
products or contents to users based on
their past Behavior enhancing user
engagement and satisfaction additionally
they develop AI Innovations to improve
user experience such as chart boards or
personalized user interfaces leveraging
Advanced machine learning models to stay
ahead in the competitive Tech landscape
at last we will talk about the career
path comparison finally let's discuss
the career paths and opportunities and
salaries for data analyst and data
scientists in both the United States and
India a career in data analyst often
begins with marketing or Finance over
time they can trans transition into
senior analyst role to specialize
further in business intelligence there
also opportunities to move into

started a store that sells automobile
parts like brakes exhausts tires
lubricants and car Interiors he made a
good start with his business and
achieved profits however as days passed
by along with his growing business he
faced some business challenges here he
received orders from a variety of
customers with different needs and
requirements for example the northern
states had higher demand for performance
parts than others and the eastern states
demanded farm truck parts and lubricants
more and apart from this a few products
weren't performing well in the market
and remained unsold with the unbalanced
requirements and economy variations Ben
had a tough time helping his customers
with products on demand he slowly
realized he needed something new that
can help him tackle the store's problem
s what if Ben had a tool that could keep
track of his store's inventory in sales
a geographical map that can recognize
the demand for various types of products
from different regions a forecast
feature that could predict the economic
fluctuations in the market and help Ben
visualize every single detail visually
on one single dashboard this software
could practically solve many business
problems and also could identify new
opportunities to improvise and grow the
business such types of software tools
are called business intelligence tools
and one such tool powerbi capable of
learning the store's business patterns
and running queries against the data to
help visualize the flaws and resolve
them quickly now let us understand how
Ben used powerbi and solve the issues
related to his business Ben collected a
stores entire sales data from the
previous quarter and ingested it into
powerbi Now using Ben was able to
categorize the data based on monthly
sales it took the daily Sal and
considered it as the x-axis and then
powerbi computed the sales in the store
now Ben clearly understood the products
that outperform the sales charts and the
products that did not have much demand
let us elaborate a little Ben found that
the performance parts like sports
exhaust turbochargers and engine
management systems were selling well
with the powerbi powerview forecast
feature Ben identified the demand for
Performance Products in the next quarter
so raised the prices on a few products
that had the peak demand and earned
higher profits in the second forecast
report Ben found no significant
elevation nor a drop in the demand for
the tractor parts and lubricants apart
from this Ben saw the sales graphs of
electronics encountered a drop in the
current quarter compared to the previous
quarter in the sales of electronics like
the music and infotainment systems were
low to improvise and stabilize the
fluctuating sales of electronics Ben
came up with some exciting clearance
sale offers on electronic products using
power bi's map visual feature Ben
understood the product demand at a
regional level he found the northern
regions were interested in performance
kits for their imported sports cars the
Eastern regions had good demand for
truck parts and lubricants using powerbi
Ben could generate various
visualizations based on his data and
come up with business oriented decisions
last but not least Ben could also
monitor his decisions and was is able to
make some necessary modifications to his
business model on the go Ben is now
delighted as working with powerbi is a
smooth and efficient process today
powerbi being recognized as one of the
best-in-class business intelligence
tools because of its powerful and
dependable features powerbi can support
and connect to a wide variety of data
sources like the cloud dbms Excel sheets
and even get connected to realtime data
from websites and B keeps his customers
happy using powerbi to solve his
business problems hey there I wondered
what those people with fancy charts on
their computers are doing they are
probably business analyst so what's a
business analyst think of them as the
shadlock homes of the business World
they look at lots of information and
figure out how to make companies run
better and guess what it's a pretty cool
job right now lots of companies are
trying to H these folks want to know how
much they make on average about $85,000
per year some of them even make over
$120,000 not bad right but here's the
thing to be really good at this job you
need to know some special words it's
like learning the secret code of
business and in today's video we are
going to look at the 10 important words
every business analyst should know and
by the time we are done you'll be
talking like a pro so let's start with a
little story meet Joan Joan works at a
company and is always overwhelmed by all
the data terms MMS his colleagues use
during meetings so words like kpis data
warehouse and analytics were thrown
around and Joan often felt lost he knew
understanding these terms was crucial
for his career growth so he decided to
dive into learning about business
intelligence Janes started by learning
what business intelligence actually
means he discovered that bi involves
strategies and technologies that help
companies analyze and manage their data
for example if he worked at at Spotify
bi could tell him which songs are
getting the most pleas when people
listen the most and even predict the
next big hit this realization made Jan
see how powerful bi could be for making
informed business decisions all right so
let's dive in and let's understand what
business intelligence actually is
imagine you're running a popular ice
cream shop and business intelligence is
like having a super smart helper that
tells you everything about your business
tool right so what exactly is business
intelligence it's all the tricks and
tools companies use to understand the
data better it helps them make smart
choices based on facts not just gues for
example let's say you use a tool like
powerbi in your ice cream shop it might
show you which flavors sell the most on
H days what time your shop is busiest
and which toppings are most popular with
kids this info helps you make smart
decisions like stocking up on popular
flavors or hiring extra staff for busy
times business intelligence is super
important because it turns boring
numbers into useful information that
helps businesses grow and succeed it's
like having xray vision for your company
NeXT let's talk about data visualization
so data visualization is the graphical
representation of information and data
by using visual elements like charts
graphs and Maps data visualization tools
provide an excess ible way to see and
understand Trends outliers and patterns
in data for example a bar chart showing
the most popular pza toppings in a
delivery app this is crucial for
presenting data in an easy to understand
format moving on we have analytics so
analytics involves the systematic
computational analysis of data for
example using analytics to understand
which times of day are busiest for a
Piza delivery app this term is important
because it helps in making sense of
large amounts of data and AIDS in
decision making next up is kpi that is
key performance indicator so kpi is a
measurable value that demonstrates how
effectively a company is achieving key
business objectives for example tracking
the number of visas sold each month as a
kpi to measure business performance kpis
are essential for measuring performance
and progress towards strategic goals now
let's discuss data warehouse so data
warehouse is a centralized repository
for storing large volumes of structured
data from multiple sources for example
storing customer data from different gym
branches in one place for analysis it is
used for reporting and data analysis and
is a core component of business
intelligence data warehouses are
important for consolidating data from
different sources and making it
available for analysis next we have
database so database is an organized
collection of data generally stored and
accessed electronically from a computer
system for example a database storing
member records for a gym databases are
foundational for storing and managing
data efficiently and are critical for
any business intelligence processes
moving forward let's introduce data
mining so data mining is the process of
discovering patterns and knowledge from
large amounts of data for example a gym
analyzing member tendance to identify
the most popular class times data mining
is important for extracting useful
information from large data sets next
let's talk about dashboard so dashboard
is a business intelligence tool that
allows users to track key metrics and
kpis for example a dashboard for a gym
showing daily attendance most used
equipment and membership growth it
provides a visual representation of data
and helps in monitoring performance at a
glance dashboards are crucial for
real-time data monitoring and decision
making next up is reporting reporting
refers to the process of organizing data
into informational summaries to monitor
how different areas of a business are
performing for example a monthly
financial report summarizing income and
expenses for a gym reports are essential
for tracking progress identifying Trends
and making informed decisions finally
let's discuss SQL that is structured
query language so SQL is a standard
programming language for managing and
manipulating databases for example
writing an SQL query to retrieve all gym
members who joined last month it is used
to query insert update and modify data
SQL is fundamental for anyone working
with databases and business intelligence
tools remember whether you are running a
multi-million dollar Corporation or a
neighborhood laminate stand these bi
tools and Concepts can help you make
smarter decisions and grow your business
they turn row data into valuable
insights helping you understand your
customer better optimize your operations
and stay ahead of the competition so
with that guys we have come to the end
of this session I hope this video has
helped domestify some key business
intelligence terms for you if you found
this video helpful don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to our
channel for more business and Tech
insights if you have questions about bi
or want to share your opinion you can
comment down in the comment section
below today's topic which is about how
to create powerbi dashboard in a few
minutes Yes you heard me right you can
create a complete powerbi dashboard or
also known as as a report in just a few
clicks and a few minutes now in this
particular video we are minimizing the
time in creating dashboard because
sometimes data cleaning process you
already know if you're an expert or if
you are a beginner in data analytics you
already know there are steps in data
report or dashboard right first you load
the data from a source it can be Cloud
PDF Excel workbook CSV or anything and
after that you do some data cleaning
right you split the columns or you
eliminate some blank rows blank columns
and some irrelevant data which does not
fit or some um for more reference on D
Cleaning you can also refer to the video
which is linked in the description box
below and so right that's the process so
basically you import the data from The
Source clean it transform it and then
load it and then create a dashboard
right so in this particular video we
have the completely cleaned data set
which is really available for creating
report which which will be also linked
in the description box below if you want
to follow us along so um with that uh
let's get started right so that's how it
goes now let's have a look at our data
so our data has um some row ID order ID
order date ship date so basically you
can totally understand this particular
data set is about sales report right
let's say I'm working with XYZ company
which is based on data analytics and I I
get an email from my client that he or
she wants to know how exactly the sales
are performing and what exact States or
countries and uh what exact regions and
what category of products or subcategory
of products and what's the sales
quantity order profit right so let's say
you have a one uh category or
subcategory or a product which is giving
you high number of sales and profit
right you want to improve more you can
increase the price or let's say you have
some product which is not performing so
well right so you can uh offer some uh
discounts let's say like 50% off so that
you can move out the product from your
store right so some uh basically if you
analyze the data and you come up to a
decision where which product is
performing in which region or state or
country and which product is performing
in not performing in which region state
or country right you can come up with a
strategy for sales and improve your
Revenue so that's the entire process
right so with that it so this is the
data we have and let's quickly jump onto
powerbi and get going with creating a
report or dashboard within a few minutes
right so here we are on the powerbi
desktop so here absolutely you can see
you can import data from Excel you can
import data from SQL Server you can
import data from blank table or use some
sample data AP from that you can also
get data from a different sources as
well right see uh we will be trying to
do some automation right so regarding
the automation we can also uh go through
another video from Simply learn which
will help you understand how to automate
the process of data transformation
cleaning and uploading so you can just
give the file location here the folder
so I'm going going with the folder here
so it will give me a new window uh you
can go to browse and I think I have my
folder in downloads and uh Excel data
sets um Excel I think I'll be having
that named
as sales report yes just click okay and
you have the sales report
here you can have a quick preview of the
data so here you have the options
combine load transform data right you
can just directly load because I've said
you that this particular data set is
completely clean and is ready for
reports right so you can just select the
data you want and just load right um
doing it this way because let's say uh
for let's not not let's say uh we have
uh the data here in a form and in such a
form that the data is from last three to
four years right so let me select it
this
way so in this case as well it will take
the Excel file and uh even if you add
some more data to it it will U apply the
changes to it right so let's say uh we
have the data for the last four years
2020
209 2021 2 and 3 and since 2024 is not
completed yet we are not taking that
data let's say we enter into 2025 then
the new data for 2024 gets updated and
loaded onto the same data table and you
don't have to uh you know process the
data once again clean it transform it
load it no that's not going to happen
you can just load the data you can just
drop the data on the Excel spreadsheet
and your dashboard or report will
reflect the new changes automatically
just by refreshing the dashboard right
that's the automation you can do so what
exactly automation is the process where
human effort is not invol and the
computer or your any uh tool that's the
job for you is called as automation
which reduces a lot of time of yours and
you can use that valuable time to plan
on the strategies to improve your
Revenue right that's the overall Moto of
data analytics now that's the uh preview
of the data I'm just going to directly
load it I'm not going to transform it
because uh it's completely clean and
transform data and ready for reports so
here you go and uh you can close if
there are minute errors you can just
close it and uh if you want to check
your data you can go to your data here
and you can have the sample data right
here right if you check the r date not
ship date sorry uh Shi date can enter
into uh 2023 as well right so here you
have 2020 and the other dates right so
you will have okay let's go to the data
filter so you'll basically have four
years not 2024 right so uh that's the
way if you just add the 2024 data it
will automatically reflect in the
visualization now uh all that we need is
create a dashboard or report which will
help us analy some data right so uh
let's get started just double click on
the report section and here you will
have icon or visit which will ask you
what exactly you're looking for
preparing Q&A so I want
region wise sales and I want it in a
paragraph there you go you have the
region wi sales and bar graph press on
okay and you have it and you can place
it somewhere in the corner then if you
want another one double click and you
want category
wise category
sales and let's take that in pie
chart category sales pi and here you
have it press on agree and accept and
you have it over here and ear on ear
sales in align
gra sales
by date or sales
by sales by date line
graph here you have it accept that so
that you can ident I which is the peak
uh performance year or Peak Performance
date for us which gave us the highest
number of sales in a certain region
right so here we have it you can place
it can customize it right and now let's
go for subcategory double click and uh
subcategory I think we have a hph from a
space
there sales uh the time type of chart
you want you can go with the donut
one select that and it
read so you have a subcategory voice
sale and now let's go with uh region
wise I mean the country wise right so
let's go to the data again here so here
we have segment city state country okay
let's go with country now
right
country country
sales map chart so whenever you have a
region or state or a country involved go
with map charts it's the best way to
represent right so we have considered
European nations over here so for that
reason we have the European States here
and uh now we can go with let's go with
the data once again again and have a
look what else we can do and shiping
mode right so you have the shipment mode
as well so uh you can identify what type
of shipment mode customers are majorly
preferring shipment mode
barograph AG so basically I think we
have uh three types of shipment mode
let's check the column name of shipment
mode properly ship mode it's not
shipment mode it's ship mode right so
let's type again ship
mode
bar
graph okay shipment mode
sales bar there you go so agree accepted
so you have standard shipment is the
most preferred one now we have this so
let's add some kpis here so uh kpi of
sales you will adjust that agree there
you go and let's add a kpi
for
profit and you have it
agree kpi for Revenue double click
let's check if we have a column called
Revenue quantity discount profit right
so let's go with
quantity and
discount so revenue is not added so it's
okay so you can identify which uh uh
product or sub category is highly
selling in in number of quantities so
you have you'll have uh the SM profit
some of sales sum of quantity and what
else we left the last one discount and
rate singles discount profit so let's
identify if we have offered
any okay so let's add a kpi of rate as
well if we are completely focusing on a
single product a single category we must
be having uh kPa for rate as well double
click somewhere kpi on
rate there you go accept it and you have
the
completely
formatted dashboard or sales report
ready for a meeting let's close all
these so that we have a better
visualization and you can just go to the
uh SlideShare mode or fit to the page
mode where you can have
it that's good so uh this is how you
create a completely functional fully
functional sales report or sales
dashboard just within a few clicks and
just within a few minutes let's say uh I
want the sales report only for central
region click that and it's completely
interactive and let's say we don't want
that click outside and you will have
everything back to the normal right and
let's say I wanted to focus on a
particular category technology category
alone they have the sales happening and
the subcategory of sales and what are
the products over here right you'll have
that and which is the country uh
happening to ship the most of them and
what's the shipment more preferred by
them and highest performing date or year
so here you can see 2022 June was the
highest performance for sales and uh the
lowest one is somewhere here in March
2020 or something right so that's how
you can create a fully interactive
dashboard or report based on sales data
in a few minutes and in a few clicks and
that brings us to the end of this
tutorial on the topic how to create a
completely functional sales report or
sales dashboard in a few clicks and in a
few minutes moving on who is a data
analyst a data analyst collects analyzes
and interprets data a data analyst will
convert raw data into useful information
data analyst are in high demand because
every industry uses data data analysis
work of a data analyst as a data analyst
you will work closely with the raw data
and generate valuable insights to help
companies decide their future goal if
you like thinking out of the box you are
the perfect fit for this domain data
analyst help maximize output when it
comes to generating Revenue working
closely with both business and data
nevertheless this field boost handsome
salaries for all levels of expertise can
you become a data analyst without prior
experience yes anyone can become a data
analyst if they enjoy solving real world
problems have a strong background in
statistics and have a creative mind if
you feel you don't have it you can
definitely develop it so let us know the
skills in detail what are the basic
skill sets required for a data analyst
data analyst must know basic mathematics
and statistics programming skills
machine learning and also data
visualization tools so let us know what
are the basics that you need to learn
done as a data
analyst mathematics it is always better
to know basic mathematics like linear
algebra and probability fundamentals
linear algebra is used in data
pre-processing and transformation which
is the critical process of every data
analy statistics a branch of mathematics
that deals with collection analysis
presentation and
implementation probability we know that
probability is the study of How likely
something happen which is essential for
concluding both probability and
statistics are the backbones of data
analysis it is feasible to become a data
analyst with only a basic understanding
of these three areas of mathematics but
in order to remain relevant and grow as
a data analyst once's mathematical
knowledge should not be restricted
compulsorily use some of the tools as a
data analystic what are
that first is Microsoft Excel it is the
most well-known spreadsheet software in
the world it also has computation and
graphick features that are excellent for
data analyst no matter your area of
expertise or additional software you
might want Excel is a standard in the
industry it's useful built-in features
include form design tools and pivot
table it also generate a wide range of
additional features that help simplify
data
manipulation as a programming language
every data analyst should know python it
is easy to learn and has a simple syntax
python is quite adaptable and includes a
vast variety of resource libraries that
are appropriate for a wide range of
diverse data analytics activities these
libraries help in numerical and data
computation the pandas and napai
libraries for instance are excellent for
supporting standard data processing and
streamlining highly computational
operations you can also choose between
Python or r r is a well-known
open-source programming language much
like python data visualization tool as
we previously mentioned data
visualization tool is also necessary to
become a data analyst powerbi is a
userfriendly interface makes building
interactive visual reports and dashboard
simple its most vital selling point is
its superb data integration it works
flawlessly with Cloud sources like
Google and Facebook analytics as well as
text files SQL servers and Excel
is one of the best commercial data
analysis tool available it handles huge
amounts of data better than many other
bi tools and is effortless it has a
visual drag and drop interface however
because it has no scripting layer there
is a limit to what Tableau can do for
example it could be better for
pre-processing data or building more
complex
calculations you might have heard about
MySQL a lot of time it is a standard
language for interacting with databases
and it is very helpful when working with
structur data SQL creates userfriendly
dashboards that may present in various
data ways in since it is so simple to
send complex commands to databases and
change data in seconds it has commands
like add edit delete data in addition
SQL is an excellent tool for creating
data warehouses because of its
Simplicity Clarity and interactivity
overall I would suggest that to become a
data analyst you should work on
programming languages like python or R
plus MySQL to work on databases adding
to that Excel plus visualization tools
like tblo or powerbi you now know what
are the skills are and how it is used
what are you up to in an organization as
a data
analyst to create and evaluate the
report using automated tools like tblo
or powerbi
to troubleshoot the reporting database
environment and reports data analyst you
will use statistical method to analyze
data sets and spot any valuable trends
that may develop over time evaluate
company's functional and non-functional
requirement data analyst assess data
warehousing in inspecting and Reporting
needs these are all the responsibility
of a data analyst in an organization
coming to companies hiring a data
analyst IBM accentor capam mini TCS
Facebook Amazon flip cart meta these are
the top companies hiring a data analyst
but data suggest that every small and
medium-sized company needs a data
analyst therefore demand of a data
analyst is in every company so there is
no need to worry job and salary of a
data analyst this is the final part the
salary of a data analyst is high all
over the world when it comes to the USA
the average salary for a data analyst as
a beginner is going as high as 70,000
plus doll perom for experienced
professional it is going as high as
$120,000 perom in India for a fresher it
is going as high as 8 lakh perom and for
experienced professionals it is 20 lakh
plus perom such as the demand for data
analyst now that we have covered every
important skill it's time for you to
start working
so Sky a limit on what you use it for
let's take a look at types of data
analytics and this can be broken up in
so many ways uh but we're going to start
with looking at the most basic questions
that you're going to be asking in data
analytics and the first one is you want
descriptive analytics what has happened
hindsight uh how many cells per call
ratio coming out of the call center if
we have 500 tourists in a forest and you
have a certain temperature how many
fires were started how many times did
the police have to show up to certain
houses um all that's descriptive the
next one is predictive Predictive
Analytics is what will happen next we
want to predict uh this is great if you
want have a ice cream store and you want
to predict how many people to work at
the ice cream store in a certain day
based on the temperature coming up in
the time of the year and then one of the
biggest growing and most important parts
of the industry is now prescriptive
Analytics and you can think of that as
combining the first two we have
descriptive and we have predictive then
you get pre scriptive analytics how can
we make it happen foresight what can we
change to make this work
better in all the industries we looked
at before we can start asking questions
uh especially in City development
there's a good one if we want to have
our city generate more income and we
want that income to be commercial based
uh what kind of commercial buildings do
we need to build in that area that are
going to bring people over do we need
huge warehouse sales Costco sales
buildings or do we need little mom pod
joints that are going to bring in uh
people from the country to come shop
there or do you want an industrial setup
what do you need to bring that IND
industry in there is there a car
industry available in that area uh if
it's not a car industry what other
Industries are in that area all those
things are prescriptive we're guessing
we're guessing what can we do to fix it
what can we do to fix crime in area with
education what kind of education are we
going to use to help people understand
what's going on so that we lower the
rate of crime and we help our
communities grow better that's all
prescriptive it's all guessing we want
foresight into how can we make it happen
how can we make this
better and we really can't not go into
enough detail on these three because a
lot of people stumble on this when they
come in and are doing analytics whether
you're the manager shareholder or the uh
data scientists coming in you really
need to understand the descriptive
analytics where you're studying the
total units of furniture sold and the
profit that was made in the past uh here
we go into Predictive Analytics
predicting the total units that would
sell and the profit we can expect in the
future gear up for how many employees we
need how much money we're going to make
and prescriptive analytics finding ways
to improve the sales and the profit so
we can uh sell maybe a different kind of
furniture uh we're going to guess at
what the area is looking for and how
that marketing is going to change hello
everyone we welcome you all to this
video by simply learn in today's session

the top 10 data analyst skills for 2022
moving on we will look at the salary of
a data analyst and finally we will look
at the company's hiring data analyst s
so now let's understand who is a data
analyst a data analyst is a professional
who collects business data from various
sources interprets it and uses various
statistical tools and techniques to
extract insights and useful information
from it they acquire data from primary
or secondary data sources and maintain
databases they also recognize and
understand the organization's goal and
collaborate with different team members
such as programmers business analysts
and data scientists to build an
effective solution to a business
problem now with this basic
understanding of who a data analyst is
let's learn the top 10 data analyst
skills for
2022 at number one we have structured
query language or SQL SQL is a top skill
that every data analyst should have data
analysts use SQL commands and functions
to store process analyze and manipulate
structured data using relational and
nosql
databases they also build data models
and write complex SQL queries and
scripts to gather and extract
information from several databases and
data
warehouses some of the popular datab
bases a data analyst should be familiar
with are Microsoft SQL Server MySQL
postr SQL and ibmdb 2 the second
important skill for a data analyst is
Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Excel is one of the most
popular and oldest spreadsheet
applications for creating reports
performing calculations and analyzing
data data analysts need to know how to
handle tabular data in Excel so they
should be aware of features like sorting
filtering conditional formatting pivot
tables wtif analyses and functions such
as sumifs and
countifs the third crucial data andless
skill for 2022 is data cleaning and
wrangling you usually the data collected
by angist from various heterogeneous
sources is often messy and contains a
lot of missing
values so it is always crucial to clean
the data and remove noise missing or
erroneous
elements it is also important to format
data using tools and methods before
using it for analysis they're
responsible for data mining as well the
data mined from various sources are
organized in order to obtain new
information from it some some of the
tools you need to know for data cleaning
and wrangling are Excel power query and
open refine the fourth skill on our list
is mathematics and
statistics data analysts often work on
data for higher Dimensions that are
greater than three in order to interpret
such data they need to be good at linear
algebra and calculus they also build
predective models and statistical models
such as linear regression logistic
regression knife base and K means
clustering in order to understand the
working of these algorithms they must
have knowledge about statistics and
probability coming to the fifth
important skill for a data analyst in
2022 we have programming data analysts
need to master at least one programming
language preferably python or R in order
to work with complex business problems
analysts need to write scripts and
userdefined functions to automate
tedious tasks Python and art language
provide a collection of different
libraries and packages such as numai
pandas DLI matplot lip ggplot which data
anglist can use to discover Trends and
patterns from complex data
sets after this we have data
visualization as our sixth skill another
data analyst job role is to visualize
large volumes of data and prepare
summary reports and dashboards for the
leadership team and clients so that they
can make timely business
decisions to do this data analysts use
various data visualization tools such as
powerbi tblo and click View using these
tools data analyst can integrate various
data sets apply joint conditions sort
and filter data as well create different
visualizations using charts and graphs
the seventh skill for a data analyst is
industry
knowledge data analyst should have good
knowledge and understanding of the
industry or domain they are working in
for example if you're working in a
healthcare domain you need to know how
Healthcare analytics can be applied to
improve patient care you should have
knowledge about the challenges faced in
healthcare and how you can leverage data
and analytics to solve the issues only
if you have strong industry knowledge
can you try to improve the business the
eighth skill that is important for a
data analyst in 2022 is problem
solving a business deals with several
problems on a daily basis data analyst
should be ready to face those challenges
data analysts are expected to use their
problem solving skills work with the
team troubleshoot what went wrong and
provide an effective solution via data
analysis a data analyst with good
problem solving skills can help a
business identify current and potential
issues and determine a viable solution
based on the data it
collects the ninth skill on our list is
analytical thinking data analysts need
analytical thinking ability to break
down a complex problem into simple
components and resolve these components
one by one it is a must-have skill for
data and lists analytical thinking
includes deciding the parameters that
need to be considered for defining data
sets analyzing them from different
perspectives and determining variable
dependencies coming to the 10th skill
among the top 10 skills for a data
analyst in 2022 we have
communication data analyst don't just
interact with computers and programs
they also interact with team members
stakeholders and data suppliers so good
communication skills are essential data
analysts also present their findings in
front of an audience who might not be
familiar with the analytical methods and
processes so they need to clearly
translate their findings and insights
into non-technical terms so those were
the top 10 skills a data analyst needs
to possess in 2022 do you think we
missed out on on any skills then please
put your answers in the comment section
below now let's look at the salary of a
data
analyst according to glaso the average
annual salary for a data analyst in the
United States is
$69512 lakh rupees per random finally
let's look at the top companies that are
hiring data analysts in
2022 here we have the consultancy and
big four giant Del
and the pharmaceutical company cner
Corporation then we have the tech giant
IBM retail company Walmart and the
e-commerce leader
Amazon to achieve the goals of data
analysis we use a number of data
analysis tools companies rely on these
tools to gather and transform their data
into meaningful insights so which tool
should you choose to analyze your data
which tool should you learn if you want
to make a career in this field we will
answer that in this session after
extensive research we have come up with
these top 10 data analysis tools here we
will look at the features of each of
these tools and the companies using them
so let's start
off at number 10 we have Microsoft Excel
all of us would have used Microsoft
Excel at some point right it is easy to
use and one of the best tools for data
analysis developed by Microsoft Excel is
basically a spreadsheet program using
Excel you can create grids of numbers
text and formula it is one of the widely
used tools be it in a small or L
setup the interface of Microsoft Excel
looks like
this let's now move on to the features
of
excel firstly Excel works
with the windows version of excel
supports programming through Microsoft's
Visual Basic for applications VBA
programming with VBA allows spreadsheet
manipulation that is difficult with
standard spreadsheet techniques in
addition to this the user can automate
tasks such as formatting or data
organization in
VBA one of the biggest benefits of excel
is its ability to organize large amounts
of data into orderly logical
spreadsheets and charts by doing so it's
a lot easier to analyze data especially
while creating graphs and other visual
data representations the visualization
can be generated from specified group of
cells those were few of the features of
Microsoft Excel let's now have a look at
the companies using it most of the
organizations today use Excel few of
them that use it for analysis are the UK
based company Ernest and Young then we
have Urban Pro whpr and
Amazon moving on to our next data
analysis tool at number nine we have
rapid
Miner a data science software platform
rapid Miner provides an integrated
environment for data preparation
analysis machine learning and deep
learning it is used in almost every
business and Commercial sector rapid
Miner also supports all the steps of the
machine learning
process seen on your screens is the
interface of Rapid
Miner moving on to the features of Rapid
Miner
firstly it offers the ability to drag
and drop it is very convenient to just
drag drop some columns as you are
exploring a data set and working on some
analysis rapid Miner allows the usage of
any data and it also gives an
opportunity to create models which are
used as a basis for decision making and
formulation of
strategies it has data exploration
features such as graphs descriptive
statistics and visualization which

analytics reporting and integration
platform it can integrate various
components for machine learning and data
mining through its modular data
pipelining concept Nim has been used in
pharmaceutical research and other areas
like CRM customer data analysis business
intelligence text Mining and financial
data
analysis here is how the interface of n
application looks
like now coming to the nine
features nine provides an interactive
graphical user interface to create
visual workflows using the drag and drop
feature use of jdbc allows assembly of
nodes blending different data sources
including pre-processing such as ETL
that is extraction transformation
loading for modeling data analysis and
visualization with minimal
programming it supports multi-threaded
in-memory data processing nine allows

million custom addresses 20 million cell
images and 10 million molecular
structures some of the companies hir for
n are United Health Group asml fractal
analytics atos and LEGO Group let's now
move on to the next tool we have SAS at
number
six SAS facilitates analysis reporting
and predictive modeling with the help of
powerful visualizations and dashboards
in SAS data is extracted and categorized
which helps in identifying and analyzing
data patterns as you can see on your
screens this is how the interface looks
like
like moving on to the features of
SAS using SAS better analysis of data is
achieved by using automatic code
generation and SAS SQL SAS allows you to
access through Microsoft Office by
letting you create reports using it and
by Distributing them through
it SAS helps with an easy understanding
of complex data and allows you to create
interactive dashboards and reports
let's now have a look at the companies
using SAS we have companies like genpact
iqa Accenture and IBM to name a
few that was all about SAS so for all
those who joined in late let me just
quickly repeat our list at number 10 we
have Microsoft Excel then at number nine
we have rapid minor at number eight we
have talent at number seven we have n
and at number six we have SAS so far do
you all agree with with this list let us
know in the comment section below let's
now move on to the next five Tools in
our
list so at number five we have both R
and python yes we have two of them in
the fifth
position R is a programming language
which is used for analysis as well it
has traditionally been used in academics
and research python is a high level
programming language which has has a
python data analysis Library it is used
for everything starting from importing
data from Excel spreadsheets to
processing them for
analysis this is the interface of
R next up is the interface of the Python
Jupiter
notebook let's now move on to the
features of both R and
python when it comes to the availability
of R and python it is very easy both R
and python are completely free hence it
can be used without any
license R used to compute everything in
memory and hence the computations were
limited but now it has changed bothar
and python have options for parallel
computations and good data handling
capabilities as mentioned earlier as
both R and python are open in nature all
the latest features are available
without any
delay moving on to the company using R
we have Uber Google Facebook to name a
few python is used by many companies
again to name a few we have Amazon
Google and the American photo and video
sharing social networking service
Instagram that was all about our in
Python at number four we have Apache

data analysis Tools R is a statistical
program in language and environment that
integrates statistical Computing and
Graphics R is powerful and stable
software python python can also be
called as a general purpose programming
language for data analysis and
scientific Computing python can be
considered as the best player in machine
learning python is an expressive
language with many built-in function
both are open-source software and
platform independent
and they are platform neutral and also
compatible with all major operating
systems including Unix Windows and Mac
next we will be covering different
parameters we will be covering learning
preferability mathematical
fundamentals speed of both
languages visualization and
Graphics data handling
capacity
demand community and customer
support employment possibility in both
the
languages let us cover it one by one
first one is learning preferability or
ease of
learning python is Renown for its ease
of use Python's notebooks offer
excellent tools for sharing and
documentation despite the fact that
there are currently no gois for them
programmers find R as difficult line
language as a beginner this implies that
the programmers must devote a
significant amount of time to learn and
comprehending our
coding coming to mathematical
fundamentals
required coming to python understanding
descriptive analysis is very important
in layman's terms descriptive statistics
often refers to the process of
explaining using certain representative
techniques such as charts tables Excel
files
Etc python statistics is a built-in
library for descriptive
statistics if your data sets are not too
big or if you can't rely on importing
other libraries you can use
python on the other hand R requires
basic statistics from basic statist
statistics what I mean is mean mode and
median are the terms used most
frequently in basic statistics it is
referred to as measures of central
tendency probability statistics plays an
important role in handling various types
of probability distribution it includes
binomial and normal
distribution next parameter is
speed python is an interpreted language
with Dynamic typing python always
executes slowly because the code is
executed line by
line compared to Matlab and python our
is our language is significantly slower
our packages are substantially slower
than those for other
languages now that we have covered speed
coming to data visualization and data
collection in
Python When selecting data analysis
tools bit visualization are crucial and
python has some incredible visualization
tool in Python to large and varied
skater plots using regression lines we
can use gz plot 2 and GZ plot
tools compared to draw values visualized
data is easier to comprehend therefore R
has many packages that offers
sophisticated graphic features
in R we can
use in R we can use tools like M plot
lip c bond
Etc data handling capability in both
Python and
R the new releases in Python have
resolved the issue with the python
packages for data analysis R is useful
for analysis because of the abundance of
packages accessibility of the test and
benefit of employing formulas however
simple data analysis can also be done
using it the need to install many
packages crucial part of parameter that
is tools and libraries in Python and
R as a python developer one needs to be
well vered in the best libraries because
python has a lot of libraries that have
many different
uses libraries like tensorflow Cy learn
numai plays an important role in solving
many python related
problems libraries perform a wide
variety of tasking are that are very
beneficial for data science operations
example for that is deer bioconductor
Etc community and customer support
support index offered by Python and r
compared to our python has a larger
Community for assistance we can contact
www.python.org
for any queries regarding Python and
help you can support uh you I repeat you
can visit support.
realalt Community R provides assistance
through its official website
for queries and Community related issues
we can contact
www.r
pro.or next is job opportunities in
Python and
r a recent survey from indie.com
predicts that at least 55,000 python
jobs in the USA with exponential pay
rates are available big tech companies
like Google Amazon Twitter Facebook
requires python developer to handle
massive amount of data position provided
for a python developer is software
engineer data analyst data scientist and
many
more career in R is an excellent job
opportunity for you as a beginner big
tech companies like Google Twitter
Facebook are using
R position provided by companies as a
our developer is data scientist data
analyst data visualization analyst Etc
moving on let us wrap up an important
topic which language to be used between
R and python there is no right or wrong
way to study both python or R both are
in demand skills that will enable you to
complete almost any data analytics work
you come across It ultimately depends on
your background interest and career
objectives that which one is better for
you but compared to R python is easy to
learn let's compare its strength and
weaknesses it is used to handle large
amount of data python performs
non-statistical functions and it is best
suitable for programming however python
is better when it comes to
coding whereas R is used in data visual
ization
Graphics R is a widespread language in
the statistical
Community it is used to accomplish many
mathematical task so before concluding
the topic let me answer the query that I
have asked regarding R and python do you
guys remember the
question the query
was our language is superficially
related to which language
so the answer for the question is C
language means you can spin up a code
much quicker in Python the same amount
of code to do something in Python A lot
of times is one two or three or four
lines where when I did the same thing
say in Java I found myself with 10 12 13
20 lines depending on what it was it's
very scalable and flexible uh so there's
our flexibility CU you can do a lot with
it and you can easily scale it up you
can go from something on your machine to
using Pi spark into the spark
environment and spread that across
hundreds if not thousands of servers
across terabytes of data or pedabytes of
data so it's very scalable there's a
huge collection of
libraries this one's always interesting
because Java has a huge collection of
libraries C has a huge collection of
libraries net does and they're always in
competition to get those libraries out
uh Scala for your spark all those have
huge collections of libraries this is
always changing uh but because Python's
open source you almost always have easy
to access libraries that anybody can use
you don't have to go check your
licensing and have special licensing
like you do in some
packages graphics and visualization they
have a really powerful package for that
so it makes it easy to create nice
displays for people to
read and community support because
python is open source it has a huge
community that supports it you can do a
quick Google and probably find a
solution for almost anything you're
working
on python libraries let's bring it
together we have data analytics and we
have python so when we're talking data
analytics we're talking python libraries
for data analytics and the big five
players are numpy pandas matplot Library
scipi which is going to be in the
background so we're not going to talk
too much about the scientific formulas
in scipi
andsit so numpy supports in dimensional
arrays provides numerical Computing
tools useful for linear algebra and for
year
transform um and you can think of this
as just a grid of numbers um and you can
even have uh a grid inside a grd or data
it's not even numbers because you can
also put uh words and characters and
just about anything into that array but
you can think of a grid and then you can
have a grid inside a grid and you end up
with a nice three-dimensional array if
you want to talk threedimensional array
you can think of images you have your
three channels of color four if you have
an alha Al and then you have your XY
coordinates for the image we're looking
at so you can go x y and then what are
the three channels to generate that
color and numpy isn't restricted to
three dimensions you could imagine uh
watching a movie well now you have your
movie clips and they each have their X
number of frames and each of those
frames have X number of XY coordinates
for the pictures in each frame and then
you have your three dimensions for the
colors so numpy is just a great way to
work with in dimensional
arrays now closely with numpy is pandas
uh useful for handling missing data
perform mathematical operations provides
functions to manipulate data pandas is
becoming huge because it is basically a
data frame and if you're working with
big data and you're working in spark or
any of the other major packages out
there you realize that the data frame is
very Central to a lot of that and you
can look at it as a Excel spreadsheet
you have your columns you have your rows
or indexes and uh you can do all kinds
of different manipulations of the data
within uh including filling in missling
data which is a big thing when you're
dealing with large pools or lakes of
data where they might be collected
differently from different uh
locations and Matt plot Library we did
kick over the scipi which is a lot of
mathematical computations which usually
runs in the background of the of numpy
and pandas um although you do use them
they're useful for a lot of other other
things in there but the map plot Library
that's the final part that's what you
want to show people and this is your
plotting library in Python several
toolkits extend map plot Library
functionality there's like a hundred
different toolkits to extend matap plot
Library which range from uh how to
properly display star constellations
from astronomy there's a very specific
one built just for that all the way to
some uh very generic ones we'll actually
add Seaborn in when we do the labs in a
minute several toolkits extend met plot
Library functionality and it creates
interactive
visualization uh so there's all kinds of
cool things you can do as far as just
displaying graphs and there's even some
that you can create interactive graphs
we won't do the interactive graphs but
you'll see you'll get a a pretty good
grasp of some of the different things
you can do in matplot
library let's jump over to the demo
which is my favorite roll up our sleeves
get our hands in on what we're doing now
there's a lot of options when we're just
with python uh you can use py charm as a
really popular
one uh and you'll see this all over the
place um so it's one of the main ones
that's out there and there's a lot of
other ones I used to use net beans which
has kind of lost favor uh don't even
have it installed on my new
computer but the most popular one right
now for data science now py charm's
really popular for python General
development for data science we usually
go to Jupiter uh notebook or anaconda
and we're going to jump in Anaconda
because that's my favorite one to go to
cuz it has a lot of external tools for
us we're not going to dig into those but
we will pop in there so you can see what
it looks like so with Anaconda we have
our Jupiter lab we have our um notebook
these are identical Jupiter lab is an
upgrade to the notebook with multiple
tabs that's all it is and we'll be using
the notebook and you can see that pie
charm is so popular with um python that
we even have it highlighted here in
Anaconda as part of the setup uh jupyter
notebook can also be a standalone uh so
we're actually going to be running
jupyter notebook and then you have your
different environments um I have we're
going to be under main Pi 36 there's a
root one and I usually label it Pi
36 the reason is is currently as of
writing this tensor flow only works in
36 and not in 37 or 38 for doing neural
networks but you can actually have
multiple environments which is nice
they're they separate the kernels so it
helps protect your computer when you're
doing development
and this is just a great way to do a
display or a demo especially if you're
looking for that job pull up your laptop
open it up or if you're doing a meeting
get it broadcast up to the big screen so
that the CEO can see what you're looking
at and when we launch the notebook uh it
actually opens up a file browser in
whatever web browser you have this
happens to be Chrome and then you can
just go under new there's a lot of
different options depending on what you
have installed uh Python 3 and this just
creates an Untitled uh version of this
and you can see here I'm actually in a
simply learn folder for other work I've
done for simply
learn uh and that's where I save all my
stuff and I can browse through other
folders making it really easy to jump
from one project to another and under
here we'll go ahead and change the name
of this and we'll go ahead and rename
it data analytics data analytics just so
I can remember what I was
doing which is probably about 50 of the
folders in here right or files in here
right now uh so let's go ahead and jump
in there and take a look at some of
these different uh tools that we were
looking
at and as we go through the demo let's
start with the uh numpy uh the least
visually exciting and I'm going to zoom
in here so you can see what we're
doing and the first thing we want to do
is import
numpy and we'll import it as NP that is
the most common numpy terminology
and let's go and change the view so we
also have the line numbers um I don't
know why we probably won't need them but
like it for easy reference uh and then
we'll create a onedimensional array we
just call this array one and it equals
np. array and you put your array
information in here in this case we'll
spell it out uh you can actually do like
a range and other ways there's lots of
ways to generate these arrays but we'll
just do one two three so three
integers and if we print
our array
one we can go ahead and run this and you
can see right here it prints one two
three you can see why this is a really
nice interface to show other people what
you're doing uh with the Jupiter
notebook uh so this is the basic we've
created an array this is a
onedimensional array and then array is
one two three one of the nice things
about the Jupiter notebook is whatever
ran in this first setup is still running
it's still in the kernel so it still has
the nump imported is n p and it still
has our variable um arr1 for array 1
equal to NP array of 1 2 3 so we go to
the next
cell we can check the type of the array
we're just going to print we say hey
what's what what what is this um setup
in here and we want
type um and then we want what is the
type of array one let's go ahead and run
that and it says class numpy indd array
so it's its own class that's all we're
doing is checking to see what that class
is and if you're going to look at the
array class uh probably the biggest
thing you do I don't know how many times
I find myself uh doing this uh because I
forget what I'm working on and I forget
I'm working with a three-dimensional or
four dimensional array uh and I have to
reformat somehow so it works with
whatever other things I have and so we
do the array shape uh the array shape is
just three because it has three members
and it's a one-dimensional array that's
all that is
and with the numpy array we can easily
access um stick with the print statement
if you actually put a variable in
Jupiter notebook and it's the last one
in the cell it will the same as a print
statement so if I do this where array
one of two it's the same as doing
print array of two that's those are
identical statements in our jupyter
notebook we'll go and stick with the
print on this one and it's three so
there's our print space two and we have
0 1 2 2 = 3 we can easily change that so
we have array one of place
two equals
5 and then if we print our array
one uh you can see right down here when
it comes out it's one two and five and
there I leftt the print statement off
because it's the last variable in the
list um it'll always print the variable
if you just put it in like that that's a
Jupiter notebook thing don't do that in
pie charm I've forgotten before doing a
demo and we talked about multiple
Dimension so we'll do an array um
two-dimensional array and this is again
a numpy
array and in the numpy array we need um
our first Dimension we'll do one two 3
and
our second dimension uh 3 four five and
you can see right here that when we hit
the uh we'll do this we'll just do array
two and we can run that and there's our
array two 1 2 3 3 4 5 we can also do
array
two of uh
one and then we can do let's do zero
doesn't really matter which one actually
let's do uh two there we go and if I run
this it'll print out five uh because
here we are this is zero uh 0 1 two
three is on our zero Row 3 four five is
on our one row always start with zero
and then the two 012 goes to the
five and then maybe we forgot what we
are working with so we'll go do array 2.
shape and if we do array two of
shape uh we'll go and run that we'll see
we have two rows and each row has three
elements uh two dimensional array 2
three if you looked up here when we did
it before it just had three comma
nothing when you have a single entity it
always saves it as a tuple with a blank
space uh but you can see right here we
have 2 comma
3 and if you remember from up here we
just did this array two of oh let's go
what is it one comma
two we run that we get the five you can
also count backwards this is kind of of
fun and you'll see I just kind of
Switched something on you because you
can also do one comma two to get to the
same spot um now two is the last one 0
one two it's the last one in there we
can count backwards and do minus one and
if we run this we get the same answer
whether we count it as uh let's go back
up here whether we count this as
012 or we count backwards as min-1 -2 -3
and you can see that if I change this
minus one to a minus two and run
that I get four which is going backwards
- one -2 so there's a lot of different
ways to reference what we're working on
inside the numpy
array it's really a cool tool it's got a
lot of things you can do with
it and we talked about the fact that it
can also hold things that are not values
and we'll call this array ask for
Strings equals uh np.
array put our setup in there brackets
and let's
go
China
um
[Music]
India
USA uh
Mexico doesn't matter we can make
whatever we want on here and if we print
that
out we run this you can see that we get
our numpy of Ray China India USA Mexico
it even gives us our D type of a
U6 and a lot of times when you're
messing with data we'll call this array
R for range just to kind of keep it
uniform np. a range so this is a command
inside numpy to create a range of
numbers and if you're testing data Maybe
you want maybe have equal time
increments um that are spaced a certain
point apart but in this case we're just
going to do
integers and we're going to do a uh a
setup from 0 20 skipping every other one
and we'll print it out and see what that
looks
like and you can see here we have 0 2 4
6 8 10 12 14 16 18 like you expected it
skips every one and just a quick
note there's no 20 on here uh why well
this starts at zero and counts up to 20
so if you're used to another language
where explicitly says uh less than or
less than equal to 20 like for xal 0 um
x++ uh X is less than 20 that's what
this is it just assumes X is less than
20 on
here and if we want to create a very
uniform uh set you know 0 2 4 6 what
happens if I want to create numbers uh
from 0 to 10 but I need 20 increments in
there uh we can do that with line space
so we can create um an R uh we'll call
this
L equals I don't think think we'll
actually use any of this again so I
don't know why I'm creating unique um
identifiers for it uh but we'll do
NP uh Lin
space and we're going to do
0o to 10 or 0 to 9 remember it doesn't
it goes up to 10 and then we want to
let's say we have
20 different um increments in there so
we're creating a we have a data set and
we know it's over a certain time period
and we need to divide that time period
by 20 and it happens to just have 10
pieces in it um and here we go you can
see right here we have TW or has 20
pieces in it but it's over 10 years we
got to divide it in the middle and you
can see it does it goes 0.52 remember
yeah there's our 10 on the end so it
goes up to
10 uh and then we can also do random
there's np. random if you're doing
neural
networks uh usually you start it by
seating it with random numbers
and we'll just do np. random and we'll
just call this array we'll stop giving
it unique numbers we'll print that one
out and run it and you can see we have
random numbers they are 0o to one so
you'll see that all these numbers are
under one and you can easily alter that
by multiplying them out or something
like that if you want to do like 0o to
100 um you can also round them up if
it's integer 0 to 100 there's all kinds
of things you can do but generates a
random float between 0o and one and you
have a couple options you could reshape
that um or you can just generate them uh
in whatever shape you want and so we can
see here uh we did three and four and so
you can see three rows by four variables
same thing is doing a reshape of 12
variables to three and
four and if you're going to do that you
might need an empty data set um I have
had this come up many times where I need
to start off with zero and I don't know
you know cuz I'm going to be adding
stuff in there or it might be zero and
one or one is uh if you're removing the
background of an image you might want
the background is zero and then you
figure out where the image is and you
set all those boxes to one and you
create a mask so creating mask over
images is really big and doing that with
uh a numpy array of
zero and we can also
uh give it a
space and we'll just do this all in one
shot this time and we'll do the same
thing like we did
before zeros and in this case we'll do
uh 2 comma 3 and so we run
this forgot the asteris around it I knew
it was forgetting something there we go
so when we run this uh you can see here
we have our 10 zeros in a row and maybe
this is a mask for an image and so it
has uh two rows of three digits in in it
so it's a very small image um little
tiny
pixel and maybe you're looking to do
something the opposite way uh instead of
uh creating a mask of zeros and filling
in with ones uh maybe you want to create
a mask of ones and fill them in with h
zeros and we'll just do just like we did
before we'll do three comma four and
when we run this you'll see it's all
ones and we could even do this even U
we'll do it this way let's do
10 10 by 10 icon and then you have your
three colors you so creates quite a
large array there for doing pictures and
stuff like that when you add that third
dimension
in um if we take that off it's a little
bit easier to
see we'll do 10
again and you can easily see how we have
10 rows of 10
ones and you can also do something uh
like create a an
array and we'll do 0 one
2 and then in this array um we actually
print it right out we want a repeat so
you can actually do a repeat of the
array and maybe you need this array um
let's repeat it three
times so there's our repeat of an array
repeat three
times and if we run this you'll see we
have 0000 0111 22
and whenever I think of a repeat I don't
really think of repeating being the
first digit three times the second digit
I really always think of it as um 012
012 012 it catches me every time uh but
the actual code for that one is going to
be tile uh and again if we do arrange
three and we run this you can see how
you can generate 012 012 012
and if you're dealing with um an
identity Matrix um we can do that also
if you're big on you're doing your
matrixes and we'll just
identity I guess we'll go and spill it
out today
Matrix and the command we're looking for
is um I ey and we'll do three and then
we'll just go ahead and print this out
there we go there's our identity Matrix
and it comes out by a 3X3 array because
there's our Matrix uh and then it puts
the ones down the middle and for doing
your different Matrix math and we can
manipulate that a little bit too um we
talk
about uh
matrixes we might not want ones across
the middle in which case we now have uh
the diagonal so we can do do an np.
diagonal and we do a diagonal uh let's
put in the
diagonal 1 2 3 four five and when we run
this again this generates a value and by
just putting that value in there's the
same as putting print around it or
putting array equals and then print
array and you can see it generates a
diagonal 1 2 3 4 5 and there's your uh
your beginning of your Matrix array for
working with
matrixes and we can actually go in
reverse uh let's create an array equals
remember our
random random. random and we'll do a 5x5
array uh oops there we go five by
five and just so you can see what that
looks
like helps if I tpe don't mistype the
numbers which is in this case I just
need to take out the brackets and there
you go you have your your 5x5 array set
up in there and we can know cuz we're
working with matrixes we might want to
do this in reverse and extract the
diagonals which would be the 79 the 678
and so
on and we simply type in np.
diagonal we put our array in there um
and this will of course print it out
because it returns it as a variable and
you can see here here's our diagonal
going across from our
Matrix and we did talk about shape
earlier if you remember you can do um
print the shape out you can also do the
dimensions uh so in Dimensions very
similar to shape it comes out and just
has two Dimensions we can also look at
the size so if we do size on here we can
run that and you can see has a size of
25 two dimensions and of course 5x5 and
that was from the shape from earlier
that we looked at uh there's our 5x5
shape and if you remember earlier we did
random well you can also do uh random I
talked a little bit about manipulating
zero to one and how you can get
different answers you can also do
straight for the integer part and we'll
do minus uh 10 to
10
4 and so we're going to Generate random
integers between - 10 to 10 uh we're
going to generate four of those and when
we run that we have 7 - 3 - 6 - 3
they're all between minus 10 and 10 and
there's four of
them and now we jump into some of the
functionality of arrays uh which is
really great because this is where they
come
in here's your array and you can add tin
to it and if I run this um there takes
my original array from up
here with the integers and adds 10 to
all of those values so now we have oh
this is the decimal that's right this is
a random decimal I had stored in
Array um but this takes a random decim
the random numbers I had from0 to one
and adds 10 to them and we can just as
easily do uh minus
10 we could even
do times
2 and we could do divide by two and it
would it'll take that random number we
generated and cut it in half so now all
these numbers are under
0.5 uh another way you can change the
numbers to what you need on
there and as you dig deeper into numpy
we can also do exponential so as an
exponential function uh which should
generate some interesting numbers off of
the random so we're taking them to the
power I don't even remember what the
original numbers in the um array were
because we did the random numbers up
there here's our original numbers and if
you build an exponential on there uh
this is where you get e to the X on this
and just like you can do e to the X you
can also do the log so if you're doing
logarithmic function
functions that reinforce learning you
might be doing some kind of log setup on
there and you can see the logarithmic of
these different array
numbers and if you're working with uh
log base
2 you can do you can just change it in
there NP log 2 you have to look it up
because this is not log 1 2 3 4 5 um it
is Log and log two uh so just a quick
note that's not a variable going in that
is an actual command there's a number of
them in there and you'll have to go look
and see uh what the documentation is but
you can also do log 10 so here's log
value
10 uh some other really cool functions
you can do with this is your sign so we
can take a sign value of all of our
different uh values in there and if you
have sign you of course have
cosine we can run that uh so here's a
cosine of those and if you're doing
activations in your numpy array and
you're doing a tangent activation uh
there's your tangent for
that and the tangent activation is
actually uh from neural networks that's
one of the ways you can activate it
because it forms a nice curve between uh
from whether you're generating one to
negative one uh with some discrepancy in
the
middle just jumping a little bit in
there into neural
networks and then we get into let me
just put the array back out there so
that we can see it uh when we're doing
this as we're getting into this you can
also sum the values so we have NP
sum and you can do a summation of all
the values in this array and you'll see
that if you added all these together
they'd equal
12519 so on I don't know what the whole
setup is in
there uh but you can see right here the
the summation of this one of the things
you can also do is by axes so we could
do axis equals zero and if we run the
summation of the axis equal
zero and you can think of that uh in
numpy as the rows so that would be uh or
you can think of that in numpy as being
the columns we're summing these columns
going across and you can also change
this to
one and now we're summing the
rows and so that is the summation of
this row and so forth and so forth going
down and maybe you don't need to um know
the summation maybe what you're looking
for is the
minimum uh so here's our minimal you're
looking for and this comes up a lot
because you have like your errors we
want to find the minimal error inside of
this array and just like um the other
one we can do X is equals
z and you can see here
0645 is the smallest number in this
First Column is 0645 and so on
and if you have a minimum well you might
also want to know the max maybe we're
looking for the maximum profit and here
we go you can see maximum 79 is a
maximum on this first column and just
like we did before you can change this
to a one on axes you can take the axes
out of here and just find the max value
for the whole array and the max value in
here was 83 44 so on so
on and since we're talking data
analytics uh we want to go ahead and
look at the mean uh pretty much the same
as the average this is the mean across
the whole thing and just like we did
before we could also do axis equals
zero and then you'll see this is the
mean of this axis and so on and we have
mean we might want to know the
median and there's our median our most
common numbers uh if we have median we
might want to know the standard
deviation or if we have the average a
lot of times you do the means and the
standard deviation um we can run that
and there's our standard deviations
along the axis we can also do it across
the whole
array uh if we're going to do standard
deviations there's also uh
variance which is your
V and there's our variance across the
different
levels and so if we looked at that we
looked at variance we looked at standard
deviation the median and the means
there's but those are the most common
ones used with data analytics um and
then going through your data and
figuring out uh uh what you're going to
present to the
shareholders and some other things we
can do is we can actually take slices uh
you'll hear that
terminology and a slice might be um like
we have a 5x5 array but maybe we don't
want the whole array maybe we want uh
from one on we don't want the zero in
there so we got up to four and maybe on
the second part we just
want two to row three and see this
notation right here says one to the end
and if we run this you can see how that
generates a single row to the end and
then row two and three now remember it
doesn't include three that's why we only
get the one column so if you wanted two
and three you would need to go ahead and
go two to four so it goes up to four we
could also do this in Reverse just just
like we learned earlier we can go minus
one
oops and when we go to minus one it's
the same thing because we have 0 1 2 3 4
this is the same thing as two to four
goes two to the last
one also very common with arrays is
you're going to want to sort them so we
still have our array up here that we
randomly generated and we might want to
um sort it and we'll go and throw an
axis back in in there uh axis equals 1
if we run this you can see from the axis
that it sorts it uh the point 2 being
the lowest value to the highest value by
the row we can also change this of
course to axis zero if you're sorting it
by columns so maybe your values are
based on columns and then of course you
can do the whole
array and we can sort that don't usually
do that but you know I guess sometimes
you might that might come up
and so you can see right here we have a
nice sorted array uh something else
let's just go ahead and reprint our
array so we can look at it again
starting to get too many boxes up there
uh something else you can do with an
array is we can take and transpose it
this comes up more than you would think
when you transpose it you'll see that um
the rows and the column are transposed
so where
7957 064 is the column now switched it
and we have 7 9.42 as the
index you can see this really more
dramatic if we take a
slice and we'll just do a slice of the
first couple and then we'll just do all
the other um the full rows and if we run
this you can see how it comes up a
little bit different and we'll just do
the same slice up here so you can see
how those two look next to each
other there we go there's our slice run
uh and so you can see the slice comes up
and it has one two three four five
columns now we have one two three four
five rows and three columns versus three
rows and the original version when they
first started putting this um together
uh was a function so the original
version was transpose and this still
works you can still see it generates the
same value as just a capital T so many
times we flip this data because we'll
have an XY value or we'll have an image
or something like that and it's being
read one way into the next process and
the next one needs it the opposite uh so
this actually happens a lot you need to
know how to transpose the data really
quick and we can go ahead oh let's just
take um here's our transpose we'll just
stick with the transpose on here and
instead of uh doing it this way we might
need to do something called flattening
why would you flatten your data uh if
this is an array going into a neuron
Network you might want to send it in as
one set of values instead of two rows
and you can see here is all the values
as a single array it just flattens it
down into one
array so we covered our scientific uh
means transpose median um some different
variations on here some of the other
things we want to do is what happens if
we want to pinned to our array uh so
let's create a new array getting tired
of looking at the same set of random
numbers we generated earlier um so we'll
go and create a new array here something
a little simpler so it's easier to see
what we're
doing and four five six
78 uh that's good enough we'll just do
four five six
S8 and if we print this
array there it is 4 five 6
78 and we might want to pend something
to the array so we have our array we
need to extend it you got to be very
careful about a pending things to your
array and there's a number of reasons
for that uh one is runtime because of
the way the numpy array is set up a lot
of times you build your data and then
push it into the numpy array instead of
continually adding on to the array um
and then it also usually it
automatically generates a copy for
protecting your data so there's a lot of
reasons to be careful about a pending
this way uh but you can certainly do it
and we can just take our array we're
going to create a new array array one
and if we print array one and we append
eight to it you'll see four five 6 7 and
then there's our a appended on to the
end and if you want to appin something
to an array um you'd probably also want
to
whoops array one let's try that again
there we go now we have the eight
appended on to the end um so you can see
four five six seven eight and then we
pinned another eight on
there and if if you're going to append
something you might want to um go ahead
and insert instead of appending it might
be you need to keep a certain order and
we can do the same thing we do our
array um and we're going to pin or
insert at the beginning and let's go
ahead and insert uh one two three one
two 3 and we go ahead and print our
array to we run it and you can see one 2
3 is inserted at the beginning uh
inserts a lot more powerful ful and that
you can put it anywhere in the array we
can move it to the one spot and there we
go 1 two three uh we can do a minus one
just for fun and you'll see it comes up
uh one two 3 we're counting backwards by
one I imagine you can do a minus
0 and run this and it turns out that
minus 0 puts it back at the beginning
because that's why registers a zero just
takes a minus sign
off and just like we add numbers on we
might want to delete numbers
and so uh let's do an np. delete well
let let's keep it a little bit make it a
little easy here um to watch we'll go
and create an array three and we'll do
NP delete we were just working with
array uh
two and what we want to do is delete
zero space uh so if you look at this
here's our array two our array two
starts with one and when we delete the
space on
here and print that out uh we deleted
the one right out of
there and we can also do something like
this where we can do it as a slice and
we can do let's do one comma 3 and if we
run one comma 3 you'll see we've deleted
the one space and the three space out
which deleted our two and
four now keep in mind when you're
messing with um adding lines and
deleting
lines uh you have to be really careful
because there's a time element involved
um as far as where the data is coming
from and it's really easy to delete the
wrong data and corrupt what you're
working on or to insert stuff where you
don't want it um so there's always a
warning when we talk about manipulating
numpy
arrays and just like anything else we're
doing uh we'll create an array C which
equals we'll just do our um our numpy
array that we just created our nump
array three and we can do copy so you
can make a copy of it um maybe you want
to protect your original data or maybe
you're making a mask and so you copy the
array and then the new array make all
these alterations and change it values
to zero to one to mask over the first
one and of course we if we do um array C
since it equals a copy of uh array three
it's the same thing 1 3 5 6 7
8 and now we're getting into uh combine
and split arrays I end up doing a lot of
this and I don't know how many times I
end up fiddling with this and having a
mess uh so but but you do it a lot you
know you combine your arrays you split
them you might need one set of data for
one thing another set of data for the
other so let's go and create two arrays
array one array two and I want you to
note and the terminology we're going to
look for is concatenate what that means
is we're going to take um we'll call
this a ray cat I like a ray cat there we
go um our Ray aray cat or concatenated
array we're taking array one and two and
it's very important to really pay
attention to your axes and your counts I
can't merge two arrays that have like if
their axes are messed up and I'm merging
on axis zero it's going to give me an
error and I'll have to reshape them so
you got to make sure that whatever
you're concatenating together works and
what that
means as you can see here we have 1 2 3
4 1 2 3 4 and then 5 6 7 8 5 6 78 along
the zero axis these each are four values
um so it's a 2x4 value and if we go
ahead and switch this to one you can see
how that's that flips it a little bit so
now we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 s eight it's
interesting that we chose that one if I
did something like
this where this is
now there we go and we can catenate it
um run this and it gives me an answer
okay because I have two by two and I'm
using axis one but if I switch this to
axis zero where now it's got three and
five it gives me an error so you got to
be really careful on that to make sure
that your whatever axes you are putting
together that they match um so like I
said this one oops axis one axis one has
two entities and since we're going on
axis one or by row you can see that it
lets it merge it right onto the end in
there and you could imagine this if this
was a XY plot of value or the x value
going in and the predicted y value
coming out and then you have another
prediction and you want to combine them
this works really easy for that we'll go
back and let's just put this back to
where we had
it oops I forgot how many changes I made
there we go 'll just put it whoops I
messed up in my concatenation order here
there we
go okay so you can see the we went
through the different concatenation axes
is really important when you're doing
your concatenation values on here and
we'll switch this back to one just
because I like the looks of that better
there we go two
rows now there are other commands in
here um so we can do uh cap V equals NP
V
vstack this is nothing more than your
concatenation uh but instead we don't
have to put the axes in there uh because
it's v stands for vertical and so if we
print out
cat V and we run this you can see we get
the 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and that would be
the same as making this axis zero for
vertical stack and if you're going to
have a vertical stack uh you can also
have an H stack
so if we change this to from v stack to
oops here we go H stack and we'll just
change this from cat to cat and I run
this it's the same as doing axis zero
the process is identical in the
background um this is like a legacy
setup uh your vstack and your hstack
most people just use concatenate and
then put the axes in there because it's
much has a lot more clarity and is more
more commonly used
nowadays the last section in numpy we're
going to cover uh
is is kind of a data exploration um and
that'll make a little bit more sense in
just a moment sometimes they call them
set operations but let's say we have an
array 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 whatever it is uh
you we generate a nice little array here
and what I want to go ahead and do is
find the unique values in that array
uh so maybe I'm generating what they
call a one hot encoder and so these
values then all become I need to know
how long my bit array is going to be so
each word how many how many each word is
represented by a number and then I want
to know just how many of those words are
in there if we're doing word count very
popular thing to
do um and you can see here when we do
unique uh we have 1 2 3 4 five six those
are our unique
values uh some of the things we can do
do with the unique values is we can also
instead of doing just unique we can do
uniques or unique values and counts of
each unique
value and this is very similar to what
we just did up here where we uh were're
doing NP unique um but we're going to
add a little bit more into there and
it's just part of the arguments in this
and we want to do
return counts equals true so in instead
of just returning the unique value
values uh we want to know how many of
those unique values are in each one and
we'll go ahead and
print our
uniques and
print our
counts when we run that uh you can see
here we have our unique value 1 2 3 4 5
six just like we had before and then
there's two of the first of two ones two
tws two 3es two fours one five two sixes
and so on and you can go through and
actually look at that if you want to
count them
um but a quick way to find out your um
uh distribution of different values so
you might want to know how often the
word the' is used versus the word and if
each word is represented as a unique
number and along the set variables we
might want to know um let me just put a
note up here we're going to start
looking
at uh
intersection and we might want to also
know differentiation
and uh
neither so when we're whoops
neighbor neither um so what we're
looking at now is we want to know hey
where do these two arrays intersect and
we have 1 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 7 we might
want to know what is common between the
two
arrays um and so when we do that we have
um
NP intersect
and it's a ond array onedimensional
array and then we need to go ahead and
put array uh one array
two and if we run
this we can see they intersect at 3 4
five that's what they have
common uh and because we're going to go
ahead and go through these and look at a
couple different options let's change
this from intersect
1D and we'll do the same thing we'll go
and print this
so we might want to know the
intersection uh where they have
commonalities another uh unique word is
Union of 1D uh so instead of uh
intersect we want to know all the values
that are in both of them so here's our
Union of 1D when we run that you can see
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so it's all the
different values in
there and the last one of the last words
we have two more to go uh is we want to
know what the set difference is
uh and so that's where the you'll see if
you remember set we talked about that
being the what they call these things um
so the set
difference of a 1D array when we run
that you can see that one is only in one
array and two is only in one
array and if we want to know uh what's
in Array one but not in Array two we
might want to know what is in Array one
but not two and what's in two but not
one uh and this would be the set X or 1D
on here uh so we have the four different
options here where we can do an
intersection what do they both have in
common uh we can do a union what are all
the unique values in both arrays we can
see the difference what's in Array one
but not array two so set diff 1D and
then set X or what is not in one but is
in two and what is in not in two but in
one so we dug a lot in number cuz we're
talking um there's a lot of different
little mathematical things going on in
numpy a lot of this can also be done in
pandas although usually the heavy
lifting is left for numpy because that's
what it's designed for let's go ahead
and open up another Python
3 setup in here and so we want to
explore uh what happens when you want to
display this this is where it starts
getting in my opinion a little fun
because you're actually playing with it
and you have something to show people
and we'll go ahead and rename this we're
going to call this uh
pandas uh and pip plot so pandas pip
plot just so I can remember for next
time and we want to go ahead and import
the necessary libraries we're going to
import pandas as PD now remember this is
a data frame so we're talking rows and
columns and you'll see how uh pandas
work so nicely uh when you're actually
showing data to people and then we're
going to have numpy in the background
numpy works with pandas uh so a lot of
times you just import them by default
caborn sits on top of the map plot
Library uh so sometimes we use the
caborn because it kind of extends it's
one of the 100 packages that extends the
M plot Library probably the most common
used because it has a lot of built-in
functionality um almost by default I
usually just put caborn in there in case
I need it and of course we have matplot
Library as pip plot as
PLT and note we have as PD as NP as SNS
as PLT those are pretty standard so when
you're doing your Imports I would
probably keep those just so other people
can read your code and it makes sense to
them that's pretty much a standard
nowadays and then we have the strange
line here uh it says uh amber sign
matplot Library
inline that is for Jupiter notebook only
so if you're running this in a different
package you'll have a popup when it goes
to display the matplot library um you
can with the most current version of
Jupiter usually leave that out and it
will still display it right on the page
as we go and we'll see what that looks
like and then we're going to go ahead
and just uh do the um caborn the SNS
doet and we're going to set the color
codes equals true let them uh just keep
the default ones so we don't have to
think about it too
much and we of course have to run this
um the reason we run this is because
these values are all set if we don't run
this and I access one of these um
afterward it'll it'll crash the cool
thing about Jupiter uh not books is if
you forgot to import one of these you
forgot to install it because you do have
to install this under your anaconda
setup or whatever setup you're in you
can flip over to Anaconda and run your
install for these um and then just come
back and run it you don't have to close
anything
out and we'll go ahead and paste this
one in here real quick where we have car
equals pd. read CSV and then we have uh
the actual path this path of course will
vary depending on what you are working
with
uh so it's wherever you saved the file
at and you can see here I have um like
my one drive documents simply Learn
Python data analytic using python slash
car CSV it's quite a long
file when we open that up what we get is
we get a CSV file and we have the make
the model the year the engine fuel type
uh engine horsepower cylinders and so on
um and this is just a comma separated
file so each row is like a row of data
think of it as a um
spreadsheet and then each one is a
column of data on here and as you can
see right here it has the uh make model
so it has columns for a header on
here now your pandas just does an
excellent job of automatically pulling a
lot of this in so when you start seeing
the pandas on here you realize that you
are already like halfway done with
getting your data in uh I just love
pandas for that reason numpy also has it
you can load a CSV directly into numpy
um but we're working with pandas and
this is where it really gets cool is I
can come down here and I can print uh
you remember our print statement we can
actually get rid of it and we're just
going to do car head cuz it's going to
print that out the head is going to
print the top values of that data file
we just ran in and so you can see right
here it does a nice print out it's all
nice and inline because we're in Jupiter
notebook I can scroll back and forth and
look at the different data uh and just
like we expected we have our column it
brought the header right in one thing to
note is the index it automatically
created an index 0 1 2 3 4 and so on and
we're just looking at the head so we got
0 1 2 3
4 um you can change this you might want
to just look at the top two we can run
that there's our top two
BMWs um another thing we can do is
instead of head we can do
tail and look at the last three values
that are in that data file and uh you
can see right here it numbered them all
the way up to
11,914 oh my goodness they put a lot of
data in this file I didn't even look to
see how big the file was uh so you can
really easily get through and view the
different data in here when you're
talking about Big
Data you almost never just print out car
uh in fact let's see what happens when
we do if we run this and we just run the
car it's huge uh in fact it's so big
that the pandas automatically truncates
it and just does head plus tail so you
can see the two um so we really don't
want to look at the whole thing I'm go
and go back to we'll stick with the head
displaying our data there we go so
there's a head of our data it gives us a
quick look to see what's actually in
there um I can zoom out if we want so
you can actually get a better
view although we'll keep it zoomed in so
you can see the code I'm working
on and then from the uh data standpoint
we course want to look at um data types
uh what's going on with our data what
does it look like uh now this you know
you show your when you're talking to
your
shareholders they like to see these nice
easy to read charts they look like a
spreadsheet uh so it's a nice way of
displaying pieces of the chart when we
talk about the data types now we're
getting into the data science side of it
what are we working with well we have uh
make model we have an integer 64 for the
year uh engine fuel type is an object if
we go up here you can see that there
most of them are um like you know it's a
set manual rear wheel drive uh so they
might be very limited number of types in
there uh and so forth and you it's
either going to be a float 64 an integer
or an object is the way it's going to
read it on
here and the next thing you you want to
know is like your
columns and since it loaded the columns
automatically uh we have here the make
the model the year the engine the size
all the way up to the
MSRP and um just out of something you'll
see come up a lot is whenever you're in
pandas you type in values it converts it
from a panda's uh list to a numpy array
and that's true of any of these uh so
then you end up in a numpy array so
you'll see a little switch in there in
the way that the data is actually stored
and that's true of any of these uh in
this case so we went car.
columns you have a total list of your
car columns and like any good data um
scientist we want to start looking at
analytical summary of the data set
what's going on with our data so we can
start trying to um piece Mill it
together so we can do
car uh describe
and then we'll do is we'll do
include equals all uh so a nice Panda
command is to describe your data if
you're working with r this should start
looking familiar uh and we come down
here and you can see um count there's uh
make the model the year um how many of
each one how many unique values of each
one uh the top value of each one what's
most common the frequency the mean um
clearly on some of these it's an object
so it really can't tell you what the um
average is you it' just be the top one
the average I guess um the year what's
the average year on there um all this
stuff comes down here your standard
deviation your minimum value your
maximum value uh what's in the lower
quarter 50% Mark where's that line at
and what's in the upper 75% the top 25%
going into the
max now this next part is just cool uh
this is what we always wanted computers
to be back like in the 90s instead of
5,000 lines of code to do this maybe not
5,000 all right I built my own plot uh
Library back in 95 and the amount of
code for doing a simple plot was um I
don't know probably about 100 lines of
code this is being done in one line of
code we have our car which is our pandas
we generated that it's our data frame
and we have doist for histogram that is
the power of caborn now it's still going
to generate a numpy graph but Seaborn
sits on top and then we can do the
figure size this is just um so it fits
nicely on the paper on here and we do
something simple like this and you can
see here where it comes up and does say
matplot library and does subplots and
everything but we're looking at a
histogram of all the different pieces in
our database and we have our engine
cylinders um that's always a good one
cuz you can see like they have some that
are they had a null on there so they
came out as zero um maybe a couple maybe
one of them had a two cylinder engine
way back when four is a common uh six a
little less common and then you see the
8 cylinder uh 12 cylinder engines Bo
that's got to be a Speedster or
something uh but you can see right here
it just breaks it down so now you have
uh how many cars with how many whatever
it is cylinders horsepower uh and so on
and it does a nice job displaying it you
can see if you're working with your uh
um you're going into your uh demo it's
really nice just to be able to type that
in and boom there it is I can see it all
the way
across and we might want to zero in uh
and use like a box plot and this time
we'll go ahead and call the um caborn
SNS box plot and we're going to go ahead
and do um vehicle size in versus um
engine horsepower XY plot and the data
comes from the the car so if we run this
we end up with a nice box plot you see
our midsize Compact and large you can
see the variation there's our outlier
showing up there on the compact that
must be a high-end sports car uh large
car might have a couple engines and
again we have all these outliers and
then your deviation on
them very powerful and quick way to zero
in on one small piece of data and
display it for people who need to have
it reduced to something they can see and
look at and understand and that's our
Seaborn boxplot or SNS dobox
plot and then if we're going to back out
and we want a quick look at um what they
call pair plotting uh we can run that
and you can see with the caborn it just
does all the work for you uh it takes it
just a moment for it to pull the data in
and compile
it and once it does it creates a nice
grid um and this grid if you look at uh
this one space here which is you might
not be able to see the small numberb
says engine horsepower this is engine
horsepower uh to the year it was built
and it's just flipped so everything to
the right of the middle diagonal is just
uh the rotation of what's on the left
and as you expect um the engine
horsepower um gets bigger and bigger and
bigger as time goes on so the the year
it was built further up in the year the
more likely you are to have a heavy
horsepower
engine and you can quickly look at
trends
with our pair plot coming up uh and look
how fast that was that was it took it a
c you know moment to process uh but
right away I get a nice view of all
these different um information which I
can look at visually and and kind of see
how things group and
look now if I was doing a meeting I
probably wouldn't show all the data
um one of the things I've learned over
the years is um people myself included
love to show all our work you know we
were taught in school show all your work
prove what you know the CEO doesn't want
to see a huge U grid of of graphs I
guarantee it uh so we want to do is we
want to go ahead and
drop um the stuff that might not be
interested in and we're going to I'm not
really a car person guing the back is
obviously so you have your engine fuel
type we're going to drop that we're
going to drop Market category vehicle
style popularity number of doors vehicle
size um and we have the a in here if
you're remember from numpy we have to
include that axis to make it clear what
we're working on that's also true with
pandas and then we'll look at just what
what it looks like um from the head and
you can see that we dropped out those
categories and now we have the make
model year uh and so forth um and we
took out the engine fuel type Market
category
Etc uh and this should look familiar to
you now when you start working with
pandas I just love pandas for this
reason look how easy it is it just
displays it as a nice um uh spreadsheet
for you you can just look at it and view
it very easily uh it's also the same
kind of view you're going to get if
you're working in spark or P spark which
is python for spark across Big Data this
is a kind of thing that they they come
up with this is why pandas is so
powerful and we may look at this and
decide we don't like these columns and
so you can go in here and we can
actually rename the
columns simple command car equals car
rename
uh columns equals engine horsepower
equals
horsepower this is just your standard
python
dictionary um so it just Maps them out
and you know instead of having like a
lengthy here we had U engine horsepower
we just want horsepower we don't need to
know it's the engine horsepower engine
cylinders we don't need to know that
it's for the engine because there's only
one thing we're describing if we're
talking about cars and that
cylinders uh and we'll go ahead and just
run this and again here's our car head
and you can see how that changed we have
model year and horsepower versus model
year engine horsepower engine cylinders
just
cylinders again we want to keep reducing
this so it's more and more readable the
more readable you get it the better um
and of course we can also adjust the
size a little bit so that when it prints
out instead of splitting it on two lines
we get like a single line we can do that
also that's just your control mouse up
or plus sign you use in Chrome that's a
chrome command
and if you remember from numpy we had
shape well pandas works the same way uh
we can look at the shape of the data so
we now have um
11,914 rows and 10 columns uh so you see
some similarities because pandas is
built on
numpy and questions that come up just
like you did in numpy we might want to
know duplicate rows and so we can do car
and look at this switch here um we're
doing a select C this is a panda
selection with the brackets but we want
to select it based on car. duplicated so
how many duplicates on
there so it's starting to look a little
bit different as far as how we access
some of the data on here this can be a
logical statement and we get the number
of duplicate rows we have 989 rows by 10
columns
again and this is one of those
troubleshooting things that we end up
doing uh a lot more than we really feel
like we should uh we might go ahead and
do like a c count uh just to see how
many rows we're dealing with and then
right after that we might want to go
ahead and say hey um let's drop
duplicates so remember we did all the
duplicates on there so car equals car.
drop duplicates and then we can print
the head again we'll just do car head
here and you can see the data on there
um looks the same as
before uh and just note that we did car
equals car drw duplicates there are
commands in here here where you can do
where it changes the actual value and it
works on some of them and not on others
depending on what you're doing but by
default it always returns a copy so when
we do this we're reassigning it to car
and you can see it's the same header but
we want to go ahead and do count and see
how the count changes let's go ahead and
run this and you can see here instead of
11914 we have
10,925 uh so we've removed about 100
cars that were duplicated it's just
slightly under 100
there and then as we're prepping our
data we might want to know um car is
null uh so it's going to count the
values of null and then we want to sum
that up and when we do that uh we do the
car is null function. suum uh we end up
with uh HP the horsepower is 69 have
null values and 30 have cylinders have
null values now if you don't put the sum
at the end it's just going to return
turn a mask with the true false of is it
null or is it not by zero and one so
you're summing up the ones underneath
each
column and this of course uh then you
have to decide what you're going to do
with the uh null values there's a lot of
different options it might be that you
need to put in the average or means uh
maybe you want to put in the median
value um there's a lot of different ways
to fill it usually when you first start
out with the dat data a lot of them you
just drop your null values and you can
see here car. drop na which is equal to
all and then we're going to go ahead and
count it and you can see that we've
dropped almost another 100 values so
from
10925 to
10827 maybe 75 or so values uh so we
cleaned the this is really a big part of
cleaning data you need to know how to
get rid of your null values or at least
count them and what to do with them and
of course if we go back to um
uh counting our null values we should
now have uh null null values there we go
and you'll see there's zero null values
I don't know how many times I've been
running a model that doesn't take null
values and it crashes and I just sit
there and look at it trying to get why
did that crash it should have worked uh
it's because I forgot to remove the null
values so we've been jumping around a
lot we're going to go back to uh finding
outliers and let's go ahead and bring
that back into our caborn and you fre
remember we did a box plot earlier uh
this time we're going to do a box plot
just on the price and you can see here
um our price value and we have the
deviation with the two thinner bars on
each side of the main value and then as
we get up here we have all these
outliers um in fact we have one way out
here that's um probably a really
expensive high-end car is what we're
looking
at if you were doing um fraud analysis
you would be jumping on all over these
outliers why are these deviation from
the standard what are these people doing
again this is probably like I said a
really high-end expensive car out here
that's what we're looking at and we can
also look at the um box plot for the
horsepower we'll put that in down
here and run that and you can see again
here's our horsepower and it just jumps
and there's these really odd huge muscle
cars out here that are
outliers and we're going to jump into
making this a little bit more um as you
start displaying your data or your
information to your shareholders uh
we're going to look at plotting a
histogram for the number of cars per
brand and the first thing we want to go
ahead and do is we have with our car go
back over here here we go uh we have our
make value counts largest plot um and we
want to do a kind equals bar uh fig size
105 and right off the bat we jump up
here and we see Chevrolet it's going
against what was it it's um figure re
the value counts and we want the largest
value so here's our value counts and
compared to what the different cars are
Chevrolet puts out a lot of different
kinds of cars I didn't realize that they
made that many cars or different types
and then for readability uh let's go
ahead and add a title number of cars by
make number of cars and make if you had
looked at this the first time you would
have been like well what the heck am I
looking at well we're looking at the
number of cars by make and then you can
see here now we're talking about the
type of cars and the different uh ones
were put out Lotus I guess only had a
few different kinds of cars over there
very high-end
cars and then as a doing data analytics
and as a data scientist one of the
things I am most interested in is the
relationship between the
variables uh so this is always a place
to start we want to know what's going on
with our variables and how they connect
with each other uh so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to go
ahead and set a figure size CU we want
to make sure it fits our graph um we'll
just go ahead and set this one plot
Figure Set to figure size 2010 if you
never used the map plot Library which is
sitting behind Seaborn uh whatever is in
the PLT this is what's loaded it's like
a canvas you're painting on so the
second you load that uh pip plot as PLT
anything you do to that is affecting
everything on
it uh and then we want to go ahead uh
since we're using caborn
we'll go ahead and create a variable C
for uh relationships or
correspondence and car
docr that's a correlation in Seaborn on
top of pandas again one line and you get
the whole correlation on there and
because we're working with Seaborn let's
put it into a nice heat map if you're
not familiar with heat maps that means
we're just using color as part of our um
uh setup so we have a nice
visual and we can see here that the
Seaborn connected to the pandas prints
out a nice chart we'll talk a little bit
about the color here in a second it
prints out a nice chart this is the
chart I look at as a data scientist
these are the numbers I want to look at
uh and we'll just highlight one of them
um here's cylinders versus horsepower
the closer to one the higher the
correlation so 788 pretty high
correlation between the number of
cylinders and how heavy the horsepower
is
I'm betting if you looked at the year
versus uh horsepower we just look at
that one here's year and horsepower 314
not as so much but if you combine them
uh you don't actually add them but if
you combine them you'll start to see an
increase in Horsepower per year and
cylinders you could probably get a
correlation there and just like 78 is a
positive correlation uh you might notice
if we look at
cylinders and or let's look at
horsepower and mileage uh so if we go
here to horsepower to mileage you get a
nice um negative we'll do cylinders
that's a bigger number with cylinders to
the miles per gallon it's a minus. 6 so
it's a negative correlation the closer
to minus one the more the negative
correlation
is and then the chart you would actually
show people is a nice heat map this is
all our colors and it's just those
numbers put into a heat map the darker
the color the higher the correlation you
can see straight down the middle
obviously the year correlates directly
with the year horsepower with horsepower
and so on that's why it's a one the
closer to the one the higher the
correlation between the two pieces of
data now this is a good introduction uh
pandas goes Way Beyond this most the
functionality in numy since Panda sits
on it is also in pandas and then it even
has additional features in it and we use
Seaborn pretty extensively sitting on
top over our pip plot uh so keep in mind
that our pip plot has a ton of features
in it that we didn't even touch on in
here uh we couldn't even if you had a
sole course in it uh there's just so
many things hidden in there depending on
what your domain you're working on uh
but you can see here here's our Seaborn
and here's our matplot library that's
all our Graphics that we did and then
the Seaborn worked really nicely with
the pandas uh we really like that so
that wraps up our demo part for today
let's learn about data manipulation in R
and here we will learn about
deer package and when we talk about this
deer package it is much faster and much
easier to read than base R so deer
package is used to transform and
summarize tabular data with rows and
columns you might be working on a data
frame or you might be getting in a
inbuilt our data set which can then be
converted into a data frame so we can
get this package deer by just calling in
library function and this can be used
for grouping by data summarizing the
data adding new variables selecting
different set of columns filtering our
data sets sorting it selecting it
arranging it or even mutating that is
basically creating new columns using
functions on existing variables so let's
see how we work with deer now here I can
basically get the package here so I can
just say install. packages deer now we
already see the the package here which
is showing up so I will just select this
one I can do a control enter and that
will basically set up the package
package deer successfully unpacked so
that is done now you can start using
this package by just doing a library
deer and this was built it shows me my
version of R so let's also use a inbuilt
data set that is New York flights 13 so
we can do install. packages and that
will search and get that relevant data
set I can again Call It by using Library
function now once that is done we can
look at some sample data here by just
doing view flights and that shows me the
data in a neat and a tabular format
which shows me year month day departure
time schedule departure time and so on
now we can also do a head to look at
some initial data which can help us in
understanding the data better so what is
this data about how many columns we have
what are the data types or object types
here it shows me how many variables we
have so this is fine now we can start
using deer and in that we can use Save
filter function if we would want to look
in for specific value now here we have
the column as month
so I will do a filter now I'm creating a
variable F1 I'm using the filter
function on flights which we already
have and then what we can do is we can
basically look at the month where the
month value is
07 so let's look at that and this one
you can do a view on F1 which shows me
the data wherein you have filtered out
all the data based on month being seven
so this is a simple usage of filter we
can take some other example we may want
to include multiple columns so we can
say F2 filter flights and here we will
say month is equal to 7 day is three and
then look at the value of FS2 if you are
interested in seeing this and that tells
you the month is seven and day is three
you could also look into a more readable
format by using view on F2 and that
gives me my selected result so we are
just extracting in some specific value
we can keep extending this so here we
can say flights is what we would want to
work on I'm using the filter function so
I can straight away instead of creating
a variable then then doing a view I can
also do a view in this way I can just
pass in my filter within the view and
within this I'm saying filter I would
want to look at the flights month being
09 day being two and origin being
LGA and then that shows me the value
here and obviously you can scroll and
look at all the columns and if you see
the origin column it shows the selected
value so now we have filtered our our
data based on values in three different
columns now what we can also do is we
can use and or we can use or operators
so I could have done this in a a little
different way so I could have said head
which shows me initial result I will do
a flight So within my head function I'm
passing in this and what does that
contain so you are saying flights and in
this flights data set you would want to
pick up the month being the column so we
use the dollar symbol here we given a
value and I'll say and and I'll again
say flights wherein I will select the
day being two and and and remember when
you talk about and it is going to check
if all the values are met true so then
you say flight's origin LGA and you look
at the value so in this way I can filter
out specifically multiple values by
specifying columns now we could have
done it in this way we could have
created a view or we could have assigned
this to a variable and then done a view
on that where we could have selected
month being day and origin or you can be
more specific in specifying all the
columns it makes the code more readable
so let's look at the values and here you
are looking at head which shows me based
on month day and then you can look for
further columns for other variables that
is origin being LGA now what we can also
do is we can do some slicing here to
select rows by particular position so I
can say slice and I would want to look
at rows one to 5 and I can do this so
you can always assign or look at the
view of this I can just do here so when
I did a slide 1 is to 5 it shows me my
entries for 1 to five now similarly we
can do a is SLI 5 to 10 and now you are
looking at 5 to 10 values so you can
always look at the complete data and
then you can slice out particular data
now mutate is usually a function which
is used when you would want to apply
some variable on a particular data set
and then you would want to add it to
your existing data frame or you would
want to add a new column so this is
where you use mutate which is mainly
used to add new variables so let's see
how you you work on mutate so it's
pretty simple so you create a variable
over delay now I would want to do a
mutate so that it adds a new column so
I'm selecting my data which is flights I
will call the new column as overall
delay and then
basically I can look at overall delay
being Aral delay minus departure DeLay
So let's create this and let's look at
view of this which shows me or which
should show me my new column which is
overall delay which was not in my
original data set so you can anytime do
a head on this one to compare the value
so this one shows me arrival delay and
then there are many other variables what
you can also do is you can do a view and
you could have just look at flights if
you would want to compare so you can
look at the flights and this one would
not have any overall delay column so it
basically shows me 19 columns only what
we see here and if
you do a view on overall delay then that
basically shows me 20 column so we know
that the new column has been added to
this overall DeLay So if you would want
to work with 20 columns you will use
overall delay if you would want to work
with your original data set you will use
flights now you can also use a transmute
function which is used to show only the
new column so we can do a overall delay
and at this time we will say transmute
we will say flights overall delay the
computation remains same but at this
time if I look at view on overall delay
it only shows me the new column so
sometimes we may want to compute result
based on two variables or two columns
and just look at the new value and then
we can decide if we would want to add it
to our existing structure now you can
also use summarize and summarize
basically helps us in getting a
summary based on certain criteria so we
can always do a
summarize and what we can do is we can
look at our data and we can say on what
basis we would want to summarize this
particular data so we can do a summarize
function now summarize on flights I will
say average air time and I would want to
calculate an average so for that I'm
using inbuild function called mean I
will do that on airtime
column so let's look at flights once
again and here we can see there is
arrival time not air time sorry arrival
time and we would want to do some
average on this particular data we would
want to summarize this so what I'll do
is I will use the summarize function I
will say average air time and this one I
will look at mean of air time so let's
see if there is a airtime column I might
be let's look at this one arrival delay
and yes we have an air time so we were
actually looking at summarizing based on
air time not the arrival time so a time
is how much time it takes in air for
this particular fight and we will want
to use the trans summarize function not
the transmute so summarize flights
average air time and this one we will
calculate the mean of average air time
and I will also do a na removal which is
I'm saying true so let's do this and
that basically shows me the average air
time is
151 I can also do a total air time where
I'm doing a a summation of values or I
can get the standard deviation or I can
basically get multiple values such as
mean I can say total air time where I'm
doing a summation and then I can look at
other values which is if you would want
to put in standard deviation here you
could do that so let's look at the
result of this summarize and this
basically allows me to get some useful
information which is summarized based on
a particular function such as mean sum
standard
deviation or all three of them now let's
look at grouping by so sometimes we may
be interested in summarizing the data by
groups and that's where we use the group
by function so we can always use the
group by Clause now here we are taking a
different data set so we will say for
example let's look at head of empty cars
and that is basically my data set on
empty cars now that shows me the model
of the car it shows me mileage cylinder
P this and your horsepower and various
other characteristics or variables in
this particular data set so here we can
say let's do a grouping by gear so there
is a column called gear so I will Call
It by gear I will look at my data set
and then what I'm using here which you
see with these percentage and greater
symbol is called piping so that
basically feeds your previous data frame
into next one so this is sometimes
useful and you can get this by just
saying control shift and M and you can
then use this so we are going to have
piping so I'm saying empty cars now this
is my original data set where I did a
head or I could have done a view on this
one if you would want to see it in a
more readable format and that basically
shows me the data so we are using a
different data set so I want to group it
by the gear column so I'm going to call
it by gear and this one takes my data
that is empty cars I'm using the piping
and then I'm saying group the data based
on gear column that's done now let's
look at the value of by GE or you can
always do a view so remember whenever
you're doing a group by it is giving you
a internal object where your data is
grouped based on a particular column so
we can look at the values here you can
do a view that shows you your data
grouped based on a particular column now
I can again use the summarized function
where I would want to Now work on the
new one where it was grouped based on
gear so I'm doing a summarize and here
I'm going to say gear one which will be
having the value of summation on the
gear column and then I'm saying Gear 2
which is mean well you could give some
meaningful names to this and let's look
at the value of this one where we are
basically now looking at the values
which is sum and mean values based on
the
gear similarly we can use look at
different example so we can say by gear
and I'm again using
piping but earlier we had taken gear we
had grouped the data and we called it by
gear so we took our original data set Mt
cars but now within this particular data
which was grouped by gear I will take
this data set I will use the piping and
I will summarize it where I am saying
within this particular data set I would
want to get the sum or I would want to
get the mean and then you can look at
the values so what you're doing is you
are either looking at your original data
set or you're looking at the data which
was already grouped and then you can
look at the values now here what we can
do is we can Group by cylinder say might
be you are interested in looking at data
which is summarized based on the
cylinder column you can do that and then
for this by cylinder I'm doing a piping
where I'm using the summarize function
and summarizing will then be done based
on the mean values of the gear column or
the horsepower so let's do this and then
you can basically look at the value at
any point you may want to look at the
data set again so just do ahead and you
can look at what does the value contain
and by cylinder or by gear and do a head
and it gives you the value so you can
always do some summarizing or grouping
in these ways now here we are going to
use sample uncore n function and Sample
underscore fraction for creating samples
so for this let's take the flights data
set again and we would want to get 15
random values now that is done and it
shows me 15 rows with some random values
from the data what you can also do is
you can do a portion of data by using
sample underscore fraction and here I'll
say flights I'll say 0 4 which will
return 40% of the total data so this can
be useful when you are building your
machine learning where you would want to
split your data into training and test
mightbe you are interested in some
portion of the data so you can do this
which is very useful function and then
you can look look at the value of that
now what we can also do is we can use AR
range function so like we were doing a
grouping by or we were trying to pull
out a particular column so in the same
way we can use arrange which is a
convenient way of sorting than your base
are sorting so for range function let's
do a view based on arrange so we will
work on the flights data set which we
have and here what we would want to do
is we would want to arrange the flights
data set which is based on ear and
departure time and we are doing a view
out of it so that basically gives me the
data which is arranged based on your
year and departure time now I can do a
head to give me some highlighting of
that data now the piping operator what
we are using can be used in these ways
also so here I will say DF I will just
assign the data set mty cards to it
let's look at the DF which has basically
your different models you can obviously
look at the head or view of it to look
at useful information we can also go for
nesting options which can be useful so
we are creating a variable called result
here now that has the arrange function
so what does this arrange function do so
when we would want to use arrange to
sort the data so I would want to sort
the data but what data would I sort so I
will use sample n which will give me
some portion of the data or some sample
data now what is that sample data so
here we are using nesting that is
earlier when we did a sample we just
said data and how many random samples we
want but instead of giving that what we
are going to do is we are going to use
filter here now this filter will work on
DF so filtering will happen based on the
mileage which is greater than 20 I will
say size is five and I would want to
basically arrange this in a descending
order so I'm using the desk on this
particular mileage column by default it
is always ascending so let's get the
result out of this which will basically
show me the mileage details in a
descending order so this is my data
frame and now we can look at the result
what we have created so just do a view
or do a head and look at the view so
here you see mileage where the highest
value is on the
top and we were only interested in five
values in a random sample so that's why
when you did a view it shows your five
values and it shows in a descending
order based on mileage so we have not
only used an inbuilt function we have
not only arranged the data that is we
have sorted the data but we have sorted
the data based on a descending order on
a particular column we have said the
value should be greater than 20 and we
have also said we just need five random
samples now let's look at some other
examples so you can always do a multi
assignment so I can say filter wherein
I'm going to use DF which was assigned
empty cars I'm going to say mileage
should be greater than 20 then I say B
which is going to get a sample out of a
and I just want five random values so
let's look at that so we have B which is
going to get a set of five values from a
now I will create a result variable
which will arrange B which is sample
data in a descending order now let's
look at the result of this and that
basically shows me what we were seeing
earlier so you can do a multi assignment
where you can create a variable get a
sample out of it and then basically
whatever is that result you can arrange
that or sort that in a descending or by
default ascending order so same thing we
can do it using pipe operator so piping
so here I will say result I'm passing in
my DF that's the data set I'm using
piping and which basically tells what
you need to do on this particular data
set so I'm going to filter out the data
based on mileage 50 sorry mileage 20
then I'm going to push that or forward
it to get the random sample and whatever
is this random sample is going to be
pushed so you are arranging this in a
descending order so this is one more way
of doing it and then basically you can
look at the result so these are some
simple examples where you can use your
deer with multiple assignments or using
your nesting to filter out the data you
can also do a a range which is to sort
the data you can get some random samples
out of it you can summarize the data you
can also summarize the data based on one
or two or multiple columns and you can
use some inbuilt functions to summarize
the data based on some functions which
are applied on the variables or on the
columns you can transmute it where you
would be interested in only looking at
one column you can mutate it where you
want to add a new column you can slice
it and you can give the conditions where
you can say and on or to filter out the
data so what we can also do is on this
particular data set which we have say
for example DF where I have my data
let's look at this one and if I just do
a DF at this point it shows me my data
set and if you would be interested only
in particular column then your deer also
allows you to either we can do a filter
or we can simply do a select now for
selecting we can
choose uh our data so for example I'll
say DF under score I'm interested in
mileage I'm interested in Horsepower
might be I'm interested in your
cylinders in this and for this one what
I can do is when I would want to do a
select I can basically say selected DF
let's call it some name I can say
control shift M which is for piping and
then basically what you can do is you
can do a select and you can choose your
columns so I was interested in mileage I
was interested in
Horsepower I was interested in cylinder
and here what I'm doing is I'm using a
select where I can look at the new data
frame so let's do this and uh I'm sorry
here we will have to give it DF this is
where you are passing in your data yeah
now this one is done and we can look at
the value of this one by just doing a DF
or head on
DF underscore mileage horsepower
cylinder and look at the selected result
so you can be looking at selective
columns I could have done this filter
but filter will always look for a
condition say your mileage is greater
than 20 or might be your cylinders are
more than four or something else but
when you do a select you are selecting
specific columns so view always gives
you all the columns head gives you
highlight but then select can be useful
when we are interested in looking at
only specific data so this is how you
can use deer for manipulation for your
data transformation for basically
filtering out the data by selecting
particular data and then working on it

without further delay let's get started
so what exactly you mean by data
transformation in PBI
so data transformation can be a little
similar to data cleaning so before any
kind of data analytics you might be
receiving raw data from website Source a
SQL database or an Excel file or
multiple sources right once after you
receive the data whether it is batch
mode data or streaming data you are
supposed to clean it right you might
have to clean up the discrepancies like
the blank rows or the blank cells or any
irregularity in data such as wrong data
type right such discrepancies from the
data should be eliminated in the first
stage of data analytics so that's
exactly where data cleaning and data
transformation comes into the picture so
you have various tools for data cleaning
and data transformation like Excel SQL
but if you are a powerbi user then good
news for you power query in powerbi can
assist you in terms of data
Transformations so in this tutorial we
will be disc discussing the fundamental
the most important day-to-day data
Transformations which a data analyst
takes care of in the process of data
analysis is what we're going to discuss
today so let's quickly switch to powerbi
but before that let's have a overview of
what kind of data we are exactly dealing
with today so we are dealing with
Superstore data and that's an Excel
format so this is our Superstore data
set and we have four tabs here the first
one is orders tab where we have customer
ID all ID date ship date ship mode and
customer name and in the second tab we
have store St set which has the details
about the customer from where he or she
is the state City postal code and which
category or subcategory did they
purchase and Order sales discount profit
everything right and here we have some
information about any of the orders
which were returned and some people over
here so these are the four tabs that we
are dealing with today now that we have
an overview on the de data that we
dealing with let's quickly now switch to
pobi so now we on the PBI window you can
just discard
changes there you go let's quickly
import the data from our downloads this
this is the data that we want to deal
with today now it might take a little
while to connect to that particular data
set and load the data onto power PN just
a couple of minutes since the data set
is a little too heavy it's about
10,000 so let's wait shouldn't take
long there you go the data got
successfully loaded so you have the op
of loading what kind of data you want
you have four tabs as we just discussed
you can load the orders Tab and you can
load the stores Tab and in case if you
want the returns tab you can also load
that and if you want all of those just
load all of those right now I just want
the two tabs orders and stores now here
I can just directly load to get started
working on this but in case I don't want
any kind of discrepancies in case if I
have a doubt that this data might not be
cleaned I shall go with data
transformation so ideally you should go
with data transformation check your data
first before any kind of analytical
processes so let's go with that
transform
data and shortly we should be having the
power query window open on our desktop
screens
so there you go you can see the complete
data set has been successfully uped both
the stores and alers data sets now uh
let's quickly check the data from our
data set so here you can see we have
orders date right but I can see 42
682 and
4253 this is not in the form of date
correct so this is the simple uh uh step
that we discussed changing the wrong
data type so you can just click on the
lower arrow button over here and
uh we can right click and here you have
an option to change the type correct so
it is considering it as a whole number
which is wrong so you can change it
to
date rep current
so now we trying to change the order
date from a data type for number to date
data type so there is some error if you
click on error or if you just navigate
onto it powerp should be able to show
you what error was it and just in case
if it's not working okay we are unable
to pass the value provided so you can
just remove that and
try it in a different way change type
to date and time
zone
date I think this should
be
helpful or if it's not working here
let's quickly check what could be the
error time
and now let's try to refresh the
data it is taking a little
while uh we also have another
information that will deal with we have
the first row as row headers so we
should be declaring PBI that we also
have a row header over here it's taking
a little while to refresh meanwhile
let's quickly check into the stores data
and here we have customer name so let's
try to apply second di proof data
transformation which will be like let's
say split column we have uh the complete
name of U the customer let's try to
split it into first name and second name
so by the limiter and we can give
multiple options over here left mostly
limit let's say a person has three uh
parts of his name first name middle name
and second name or the last name so but
we just wanted to split into first and
second names so we would go with the
first left most limiter and split the D
set press okay and it should help us to
split the
data first name and second name and we
can also name the column separately as
first name and second name instead of
customer name it's taking a little while
than the ideal time but it's completely
all
right since considering the 10,000 rows
of stores data and 10,000 rows of all
data it is all right not a problem now
let's try to take a look at the order
status it if it has successfully changed
it no it is still showing as an error I
don't know what's wrong
here just maybe incomplete
let's quickly refresh
all in preview and check if can it can
help
us so there you go after refreshing the
first order date is change to date data
type so what we missed is when you
change the type you're supposed to add a
step so what exactly I mean by that now
we are trying to change the second one
as well so just wait for a while and it
will give us a choice if we want to add
new step or not that's when we select
the option yes please add a new Step so
what do I mean by steps so applied steps
you can see something over here right so
every alteration every change or every
modification that you're doing every
transformation you're including on your
data will be recorded as a macro so that
can be implemented if you are loading a
similar data set for the next patch
let's say this is 2022 data and if you
trying to analyze the 2023 data and
every column is similar and you can just
follow these appli steps and the same
implementation will be automated you
don't have to spend time and doing the
same process once again there you go so
this time it has recorded the step and
it automatically take has taken a new
step over here change type step one
change type step two if you don't want
the step to be added you can just select
the red x mark over here it will remove
it and similarly when you when you go
back to the stor data set here you have
the first name and second name split
successfully and uh now uh let's say you
want to have unique uh customer data
right in that scenario you can just even
remove duplicates from this particular
column just remove duplicates and you'll
just have unique data it's possible that
one customer might have come here to buy
the same uh you know buy the same
product from different dates or One
customer might have uh done a repeated
purchase so it's possible but again if
in case if you just wanted to know if
there is a way to eliminate duplicate
entes then you can do that so for now
let's not delete the customer IDs here
because one customer might have visited
the same store for multiple times and
might have purchased a different uh
product or might have made the same
order with multiple products right so
there is a possibility for that let's
not disturb the r set so I just wanted
you to know if there is a way to
eliminate the duplicates from the DAT
set yes it is now let's also check
another possibility of data
transformation so let's say you wanted
to add a new column and identify or
include some mathematical operations for
now let's say I have sales quantity
discount and profit but I don't know
what's the rate right so here the sale
is for to $61 and quantity is two but I
don't know what's the rate of one
product so I can include that you can
just select the last column or whether
you want a new column just go to the add
new column here and here you can just uh
choose the custom
column should be somewhere over here
yeah this is the custom column and now
if you click on the custom column you
can rename the custom column to rate of
product and here you can choose the
mathematical operations to be applied on
the columns so sales column
insert or double click divided by
quantity okay now it should give you the
rate of each product and Vision
product it is taking some sizable time
which don't take so long so there you go
you have the rate of product and now
let's say you want to combine multiple
data sets for example here I have stores
data set but my stor data set doesn't
have any data related to orders and
orders does not have any data related to
customers now I want to combine these
these two is there a way yes you can do
that now let's get back to stores and
here go to home option and here you have
something called merge queries so now
the stor data set has been selected in
the first data set here just select the
dropdown and select the second data type
which is orders so here you can see
stores with the current one which is in
the first place now select based on
which primary key you want to combine
both so I want to go with c customer ID
because both of my data sets do have
customer IDs so I'll go with customer ID
and both data sets will be combined at
the end at the last column powerbi will
show me a new table not a new column it
will give me a table combined with all
the columns in one column you just have
to expand the column and select which
colums from the second data set you want
to include in your overall data set so
let's do that practically so here you
can see I just have tables if I select
the expand column option over here you
can see I have a lot of columns here so
just deselect everything I do have R ID
I do have a customer ID what I need is
order ID order date Shi date shipment
mode and customer name I do have it so
that's all I need so just press on okay
and I should have them included in my
new data set Al
together it my might take a little
while so there you go we have the new
orders ID order date Shi date and Shi
mode added to our data set now just
click on close and
apply and your data set is all ready for
data analysis Supply changes it is
taking a little time so at the end you
just have to click on the apply changes
and your data will be ready for analysis
so that's exactly how you can perform
data transformation in powerbi desktop
version so there you go the set got
successfully loaded all over here and
you can just drag and drop them onto the
visualization spot and you can work on
it now this comes with the mainly four
functions so you have gather which makes
your data wide or it makes wide data
longer so that is basically used to
stack up multiple columns you have
spread function which makes long data
wider that is stacking the data together
or stack if you would want to unstack
the data to data and you are talking
about data which has same attributes and
then your spread can spread the data
across multiple columns you have
separate which is function which splits
single column into multiple columns and
to complement that you you have one more
function which is unite and that
combines multiple columns into single
columns so these are four main functions
which are used in your tid r package so
let's look how we work with this so let
me bring up my R Studio here now for
this first is let me just clean up my
screen here doing a controll l so I will
install the package it is already
installed but we can just do a control
enter and then I can say do you want to
restart R prior to reinstall to install
I'll say
okay and it is basically going to get
the
package now it says package ti ti y r
that is TDR has been successfully
unpacked let's use that package with
using our library
function and that was built under R
version 3.6 now I can basically start
using these functions so for example
here we are creating a data frame so
let's say n is
10 and then we basically would say we
will call it wi now that's the variable
name I'm using the data. frame function
I'm saying ID which will be 1 to n so
that will take the values from 1 to 10
and then these are the values which
have 10 entries so this is a vector
Phase 1 Phase 2 phase three let's create
a data frame out of of it now that's
done we can have a look at our data
frame by just doing a view wide and that
shows me the ID column and it has ph. 1
ph. 2 and ph. 3 now we can use our
function so for example we can work with
gather that is reshaping the data from
wide format to Long format and basically
you can say stacking up multiple columns
so let's see how we do that here I'll
call it long I'm working on wide I'm
using the piping functionality and then
I'm using gather so this one I will say
what will be the data which I will use
so we are using wide as a data frame
then I'm saying response time so that
will be basically one more column and
then you have your columns which you
would want to basically stack so I'm
saying from phase one to phase three so
let's do this and once this is done
let's have a look at our T long so this
one shows me that I have an ID column I
have the response time column and I have
the face column which we mentioned and
that basically has all the values
stacked in so you have pH do1 pH do2 and
ph. three so all the columns are being
stacked here so all my data so now I
have totally 30 entries in this one so
this is basically using your gather
function now sometimes we may want to
use a separate function now separate
function is basically splitting a single
column into multiple columns so which we
would want to use when multiple
variables are captured in a single
variable column okay so let's look at an
example of this one so let's say long
separate that's what we will call we
will work on this long which has all the
data stacked in as the columns we
selected then I'm saying separate I want
the face column and then I would say
when I separate the columns what are my
column names now I could also give a
separator by giving a comma and then
mentioning the separator if that is
required so let's do this now once this
is done let's have a look at our long
separate so what we see here is the
column which we used so we were doing a
face column and that was to be split and
we wanted to split it into Target and
number so that's what we see here so you
have face being split into Target and
number and then you have the response
time so this is how you use the separate
function now there is also something
called as unite function which is
basically a complimenting of separate
function so it takes multiple columns
and combines the elements to a single
column so for example here we will call
it long unite and we will take long
separate which was separating the data
we want to unite so we will take phas
Target number and we want to have a
separator between them so let's
basically do this and now let's look at
the result of this unite so you see you
have the face and Target merge together
so you have face do one the separator is
dot as we have mentioned and we have
United multiple columns so this is one
more function of your tidd which helps
you basically uh tidy up your data or
put it in a particular way now then you
have your spread function and this is
basically for unstacking so that is if
you have if you would want to convert a
stack to data or if you would want to
unstack the data which is of same
attributes spread can be used so that
you can spread the data across multiple
columns so it will take two columns say
key and value and spread it into
multiple columns so it makes long data
wider so we can look at this one we will
say long unite I'm using the piping I
will use the spread function I'll work
on the face column and response time and
let's do this and then let's do a view
on this so it tells me our data is back
in the shape as it was in the beginning
so these are four functions which are
very helpful when we work with tidd pack
package so let's learn about
visualization and here we will learn
about R which can be used for your
visualization now one thing which we
need to understand is because of our
ability to see patterns which is highly
developed we can understand the data
better if we can visualize it so the
efficient way or effective way to
understand what what is in our data or
what we have understood in our data we
should or we can use graphical displays
that is your data visualization so there
are actually two types of data
visualizations so you have exploratory
data visualization which helps us to
understand the data and then you have
explanatory visualization which helps us
to share our understanding with others
so when you talk about r r provides
various tools and packages to create
data
visualizations and which can be used for
both kind of data analysis or both kind
of visualizations so when you talk about
exploratory data visualization the key
is to keep all the potentially relevant
details together now the objective when
we talk about explor data analysis is to
help you see what is in your data and
the main question is how much much
details can we interpret now when you
talk about different functions which we
see here such as plot which is more for
a generic uh plotting you have bar plot
which is used to plot data using
rectangular bars or you can say creating
bar charts you have histogram or hist
function to create histograms where you
look at the
frequency of uh the data or basically
you used to look at the central tendency
of the data you have box plot which is
used to represent data in the form of
quiles you have ggplot which is a
package which enables the user to create
sophisticated visualizations with the
little code using the grammar of
graphics and then you have plotly or
plot ly it creates interactive webbased
graphs via the opsource JavaScript
graphing library now before we see some
examples here let's also talk about when
you talk about plotting let's also try
to understand what kind of plots you can
have and what kind of techniques you
have so let me open up my R Studio here
now for example I can pull out a
particular data set and let's look at
this one so here I can look at all the
pains and that shows me the information
now what I can do is I can
install and get the inbuilt data sets
and then I can simply do a plot wherein
I am doing a plot on chiwa data set so
let's see what does that show it's
summarizes the relationship between four
variables in chick weight data frame
which is in ours buil-in data set
package now from these plots we can see
for example weight VAR is system ically
over time you can also see that chicks
were assigned to four different diets
now when we talk about explanatory data
analysis or visualization that shows
others what we found in the data this
means we need to make some editorial
decisions what features we would want to
highlight for
emphasis what features are distracting
or confusing and you want them to be
eliminated right so there are different
ways of doing it now when you talk about
your graphics or visualizations you have
I would say three different types or you
can say four so you have the base
Graphics which is easiest to learn now
here we are having an example of Base
Graphics where I can use the base
Graphics I can get a um data set using
library then I can simply create using
plot function to a generate a simple
scatch plot of calories with sugar from
us serial data frame in the mass package
and then I can give it a title so this
is basically a simple example of Base
Graphics now you also have what we call
as grid Graphics which is powerful set
of modules for building other tools now
you also have latest Graphics which is
general purpose system based on grid
graphics and then you have your GG plot
2 which implements grammar of graphics
and is based on grid Graphics so you
have different ways now here since I
already have used library and I have the
data set I can just do a x so I can
assign the sugar related values to X and
calories related value to Y then I can
use one more which is Library function
and calling in Grid now I can basically
use functions such as push view Port if
I would want to create a plot using your
grid Graphics to create the similar kind
of plot which we created using base
Graphics but this will give you much
more power than base Graphics it will
have uh a steep learning curve but it is
usually useful so I can do this where
I'm saying push view Port then I can
basically say I would want to have a
data view Port I would say different
functions of your grid package so I'm
saying rectangle you have xaxis y y AIS
given some points here and then
basically you can add details to the
graph by giving the names to the columns
and you can basically create a simple
grid Graphics based plot here now there
are different other options which we can
use to create plots now before we go
into understanding how you create plots
let me just give you a brief on what are
the different kind of plots and how they
can be used so here we will look at
these different plots now for example we
have a bar chart which is a graph which
shows comparisons across discrete
categories so you have x axis which will
show the categories being compared and
y- AIS which represents a measured value
and height of the bars are proportional
to measured values Now to create
different kind of charts you can use
ggplot which is a package for creating
graphs in R it is basically method of
thinking about and decomposing complex
graphs into logical subunits and that is
a part of Tidy worse ecosystem so it
takes each component of graph axises you
can give scales you can give colors you
can give the objects and you can build
graphs on particular data you can modify
each of those components in a way that's
more flexible and user friendly you can
if you are not providing details for the
components then ggplot will use sensible
defaults and this basically makes it a
powerful and a flexible tool now here
are different options when you use your
GG plot such as you can use geom or what
we call as geometry objects to form the
basis of different type of graphs for
bar charts you have for line graphs you
have Scatter Plots that is underscore
point you have underscore box plot for
box plots you have quartile for
continuous X wlin for richer display of
distribution and Jitter for small data
so here is some simple example where I
would not go into too many details here
but you can just have a look at this one
where we are using Library function to
get the ggplot to package then basically
we would want to look into the mileage
data we would want to look at the
structure of it and then we can
basically
get the Tidy worse package finally we
can create a bar chart using gomore bar
and we can basically also mention what
would be in x-axis now you can also give
different colors to basically add more
meaning to your data you could also go
for stacked bar charts so here we are
actually telling GG plot to map the data
in the drive column to fill the
aesthetic so so here I am giving
aesthetic access class and I'm saying
what is the data we need to have and
then we are using gomore bar so you can
also have dodged bar in your GG plot
that is not bar charts which are stacked
but next to each other and you can
create that by using your position as
position _ Dodge okay now you can
obviously use your different packages
which are inbuilt and you can create
your bar charts and you have other kind
of graphs such as line graph which is
basically a type of graph that displays
information as a series of data points
connected by straight line segments such
as this one and for this one we are
using if you see gomore line now you can
also create a scatter plot which is a
two-dimensional data visualization that
uses points to graph the values of two
different variables one in on x axis one
on Y axis like what we saw in base
Graphics example and they are mainly
used if you would want to assess the
relationship or lack of relationship
between two variables and you also have
histogram which I mentioned is mainly to
look at the distribution of a data to
look at the central tendency of the data
basically looking at your um large
amount of data or for for a single
variable you would be interested in
saying where is more data found in terms
of frequency where is lesser data found
in the graph how close the data is
towards its uh mid point or what we call
as meain median mode so you can use
histogram where you can categorize the
data in what we call as bins so these
are some Basics on different kind of
graphs now we can look at some examples
and see how that works so what we were
seeing is some quick examples of Base
Graphics or grid Graphics now here let's
do an example of pie chart for different
products and units sold so you want to
create a graph for this first let's
create a vector and pass in the value
here now I can also create labels which
I would want to assign to these values
and then basically I can plot the chart
by saying Pi so that's the kind of chart
which I would want to create and I would
say the data would be X and labels so
let's do this and that shows me a simple
pie chart now I can also give main
details here so instead of just doing a
pi x comma labels I can say what is the
main and then what kind of coloring it
should follow so this is the way you can
create a
simple uh plot now I can also find out
what is the percentage and then
basically I would be in interested in
plotting the pie chart which takes X
which takes the labels which will be the
percentage which we are calculating here
by doing a round function and then you
can basically give details to your graph
you can say what color it follows you
can basically look at the legend where
it needs to be in your
chart what are the values and then
basically fill up the colors so let's
run this one and that shows me the
percentage which was calculated and it
gives me the details and we can always
have a look at our plot now if you would
want to go for a 3D pie chart then you
can get the package which is plot Trix
let's use that by calling in the library
function let's pass in some data to X
and let's give some values or labels
which will make more meaning to the data
and then let's plot the 3D graph so I'm
saying Pi 3D here where I'm using X and
labels then I'm basically doing an
explode which will basically control how
your graph looks like and basically give
the values so it also takes the title
when you say Main and by chart of
countries now let's create data for
graph so again we are having a variable
here we are create using the C function
creating a vector and then let's create
a history program for this one where I
would say xlab what would be your data
around x-axis what is the color what is
the border and here I'm creating a
simple histogram which as I discussed
earlier will always show your values on
the x axis and y axis is more of
frequency and then you can look at the
set of values and what is their
frequency and we can basically use this
histogram for x exploratory data
analysis look at the data try to
understand what is the central tendency
of your data values now we can also give
some limits by using the X limb and Y
Lim and then I can also specify what is
the limit so we have given some values
here wherein we have said your X limit
is 0 to 40 and Y limit is 0 to 5 now if
you compare this with the previous one
which we had created this one based on
the frequency had taken the limits but
we can assign limits explicitly by
giving this and then create a histogram
which makes more meaning now let's take
another data set that is air quality
let's view this to see what does that
data contain so you have ozone solar
wind temperature month and the day so
this is the kind of information we have
in the air quality now let's use the
plot function to draw a scatter plot
where as I mentioned you would be
interested in analyzing variables and
see what is the relationship between
them so to plot a graph between ozone
and wind values so we will say plot we
will say the data which is air quality
from that I would be interested in the
ozone column or ozone field and the wind
field I can create a plot based on this
now I can also be saying what should be
the color what is the type of the data
which you would want to create and you
can look at the in information so you
can create a histogram you can create a
a scatter plot to basically understand
the data better and then infer some
information from that data so let's take
the air quality data set itself without
specifying any particular column and you
can create a plot which shows me all the
different values which you have in the
data and it basic basically shows you
the difference this is more of an
example like what we did for chick
weight where we did a base Graphics now
you can assign labels to the plot so
that is when you are creating a plot you
can say air quality you will say ozone
and then that's your ozone concentration
you have your ylab which is the number
of instances you have what is the title
ozone levels in New York City what is
the color so these are the details what
we have given with our plot function and
let's look at the data so it just tells
me that this is the ozone
concentration uh the number of instances
what you have and you looking at the
data now we could also create a
histogram by picking up a particular
column that is such as solar from your
air quality and that basically shows me
the frequency of solar values and we can
then try to find out what is the mid
what is the mean what is the standard
deviation and so on you can also look at
your histogram and try to understand if
it is left skewed and right skewed so we
can do that now here let's get the
temperature out from this particular
data set let's create a histogram on
temperature and that basically shows me
the frequency of the temperature values
and what values have the most frequency
or most occurrence now you can create a
histogram with
labels so let's do that with the limit
and then let's also use text to
basically given the values which also
takes the values and for each set of
frequency or each set of values it gives
me the labels now you can have a
histogram with non-uniform width so you
could do that by doing a hist function
and then passing in your temperature you
can say what what will be the main what
is the title what will be your
xlab it will tell you a limit around x-
axis what is the color what is the
Border what are the brakes you would
want to have for your bars and you can
simply create a histogram using this so
This basically takes the breakes which
we have given such as 55 to 60 60 to 70
70 to 75 and so on so this is B
basically creating a histogram with
nonuniform width and it purely depends
on the kind of values what you have now
you can also create a box plot which
sometimes helps us in understanding the
the data quartiles also understanding
our outliers so you can create multiple
box plots based on the data from air
quality so we'll select all the data and
then we'll do some slicing on the data
so let's create a box plot which tells
me the values and if you look look at
these points here like single dots these
are basically your outliers we can learn
about that more in later sections so you
can use your GG plot 2 library to
analyze a particular data set so for
that we will first use the install.
packages and get ggplot 2 so it says do
you want to restart R and I can say yes
so let it get the package I think the
package was is already
there and now let's look at using ggplot
2 so for that I have the library
function and let's do a attach where I'm
getting the data set which is empty cars
now then I will create a variable P1 I
will use GG plot I will pass in my data
I'll give the athetics what is the
columns which you would be interested in
and then you are using using gomore
boxplot to basically create a plot which
gives me the box plot for the values
here and this is based on the cylinders
which is there in your data so we can
always look at what is our data contain
and what kind of values or features are
available in the data now let's create a
box plot we will also use the coordinate
function and that basically gives me
based on the data so as have changed the
coordinates now if you look at the
previous one where we created a plot we
had mileage on the y axis and cylinders
on the x axis now I did a coordinate
flip and that's like your transpose
function so you have created the box
plot but you have just flipped the
coordinates you can create a box plot
and then say fill which is the factor of
cylinder so that can be used to fill up
the values in your box plot now what we
can also do is we can create factors so
we have learned about factors earlier
which is usually used to work on
categorical variables so here let's
create a factor which is empty cars gear
you have am you have cylinder and if you
look at the factors which we have
created we have passed our data what is
the field or the column we are
interested in what is the level of
values there and what are the labels for
those values right so we have learned
about factors you can always look into
the previous section and learn more
about factors now let's create a scatter
plot by using the GG plot function again
we will use the data as mty cars I will
go for mapping option and then I will
give my Aesthetics that is what would be
x what would be your Y and you also
would want to use what kind of function
you're using so let's go for gome point
point and that basically helps me in
creating a scatter plot now you can
create a scatter plot by factors so here
we will say GG plot so notice in all of
these cases depending on the kind of
data you have depending on the kind of
plot you are interested in you will use
the GG plot and then basically a
function with that or the inbuilt
package so here I'm saying data is empty
cars I'm going for mapping which
basically will take the values for your
X and Y what is the color and the
coloring will be done based on the
factor values now if you remember
factors will obviously have some levels
and uh those levels will basically help
you in differentiating between your
categorical variables so I'm saying as.
Factor on cylinder and then I'm using
gome point to basically create this
scatter plot so let's do this and I can
look at the values of this one so it
says must be there is an error which
says must at least one color from the
Hue pallet so let's look at that one so
the error which we were facing when we
gave color as the factor values was
because when you look at these factors
which were created with some labels if
we look at the values of these it tells
me there are any Val values in that
particular column similarly your gar or
similarly you can completely look at the
complete data set it tells me cylinder
you have am you have gar now these have
some we have created some labels but
these have any values so what we can do
is we can create a scatter plot as we
did earlier by giving the Aesthetics and
that's a simple scatter plot wherein I'm
also using Gom point so that I can have
these points by defaults or with
defaults you can also give a color
specific basically if you would want to
have different kind of data in the same
plot or I can create Scatter Plots by
different sizes by giving a size or I
can give a color and size and that's
again one way in which you can create
your Scatter Plots now let's also see
how you can visualize one more data set
which is MPG so I can also do it in this
way where I said GG plot two and then
pass in look at the data set what we
have here you can just do a view on this
to see what my data contains if the
fields have any na values if that's
going to affect your plotting so now
what we can do is we can create a bar
plot or a bar chart so I'm saying GG
plot the data would be as we have given
in previous lines that is ggplot 2 MPG G
then I will say what should be in my
Aesthetics and what kind of chart are
you going to create so I'm saying gomore
bar so that's my bar chart and that has
basically your class and count now you
can create a stack bar chart where your
information is stacked in the same bars
and we are still using the same data we
are going for Aesthetics which is class
and then when you say geome bar which
creates your stand act bar we will use
fill which is drive and we can always go
back and look at our data for example
you can always look into this so you
have the drive column here and you are
also working on this complete data set
so let's go ahead and create a stack bar
chart and that basically gives me the
information where you have the drive
information which is stacked here now
you can do a Dodge by giving the
position as Dodge so we are still going
to go for a stack chart but this time
the bars will be next to each other and
that can also be done which is very
useful you can use this by using geom
point where you are mapping and you
specifying what are your Aesthetics so
we were creating a scatter plot now you
can also use or give more details where
you can say color can be based on the
class and we have different class
and based on that my points have been
colored now you can also use a plot ly
or plotly Library so let's install this
one I will say yes for example let it
basically restart so that all my
packages are updated then I can access
that package using Library function and
then create a variable to which you are
assigning your plot unor ly plot so data
is empty cars what will be your x axis
what will be your y AIS and details on
your marker which we have given wherein
I will give a list which is size color
which is a combination and then you have
your line what kind of color it will
have and what will be the width so this
is where I'm going to use plot ly and
let's look at this
plot so it basically gives me some
information now we see some warnings
which are getting generated
but there is you don't need to worry
about that so you can look at the
packages what you have and what options
you're using so similarly we can create
one more plot using plot ly and look at
the values of those so that's a plot
with a trend which explains me about my
data so this is a simple small tutorial
on understanding or uh how you can have
your graphics or visualization
used to understand your data obviously
there are much more examples much more
ways in which you can pass into your
plot functions or your GG plot and the
inbuilt packages which are available in
R for your visualization now that could
be for explorat data analysis or
explanat data analysis so try these
graphs and see if you can change these
options and try or create new
visualizations good morning and good
evening everyone so welcome to this
session where we will learn on time
series analysis using our programming
language so this is basically a mini
project where we will look at time
series data and how we can analyze it
visualize it to basically find some
important information or gather insights
from the data now when you talk about
time series analysis time series is
basically any data set where your values
are measured at different points in time
so when you talk about time series data
data is usually uniformly spaced at a
specific frequency for example hourly
weather measurements you have daily
counts of website visits monthly sales
total and so on so when you talk about
time series that can also be irregularly
spaced and sporadic for example example
time stamp data in computer systems
event log or history of 911 emergency
calls now when we work with time series
data for example here I'm taking a
energy data set we can see how
techniques such as time based indexing
resampling rolling windows can help us
explore variations in electricity demand
and renewable energy Supply over time
now here we will look at some aspects of
this data set which I'm considering so
there is this is open Power Systems data
set and here is the data set I have we
can look at the data set now this is in
a simple format it has time it basically
has values for consumption and then you
have data for wind and solar and wind
plus solar so in certain cases you have
only the date and the consumption but
then if we scroll down we will also find
data for wind solar wind plus solar and
so on so this is a Time series data set
which we would want to work on sometimes
you may also have the data collected
which just does not have the time but it
may also have time stamp that is it
would have say hour minutes and seconds
and that can also be worked upon so
let's consider this data set and let's
work on this project where we will
analyze this time series data set now
here we can work on this time series
data we can basically create some data
structures out of it such as data frames
we can do some time based indexing we
can visualize the data we can look at
the seasonality in the data look at some
frequencies and also do some Trend
detection now when you talk about this
data set it has electricity production
and consumption which is reported as
daily totals in gigawatt hours and here
are The Columns of the data which I was
just showing you so you have data you
have consumption you have wind you have
solar and wind plus solar so this is the
data we have and we will basically
explore say electricity consumption and
production in Germany which has varied
over time so some of the questions which
we can answer here is when is
electricity consumption typically
highest and lowest how do wind and solar
power production vary with seasons of
the year what are the long-term trends
in electricity consumption solar power
and wind power how do wind and solar
power production compare with
electricity consumption and how has this
ratio changed over time we can also do
wrangling or cleaning of this data or
pre-processing of data and create a data
frame and then we can visualize this now
let's see how do we do that so I will
open up my R studio and let's look at at
the data set so here is the data set now
I'm picking it up from my machine you
can also pick it up from GitHub so all
the data sets or similar data sets can
be find in my GitHub repository and here
I can look in the data sets you will
find a lot of different data sets here
there are some time series data sets
such as power I can search for power or
you have basically coal
or you have
this
opsd Germany daily data set and there
are many other data sets which you can
work on now to get the documentation on
this project you can also look in my
GitHub repository and you can search for
repositories and then basically you can
look in data science and R and here
there is a project folder where I've
have given the documentation sample data
set
and also your time series analysis
related document this is also the code
which you can directly Import in your R
studio and you can practice or work on
this project so let's see how does that
work so first thing is we will create a
data frame from this data set now here
if you see I using header as true so
that it understands the heading of each
column I'm also giving row. names and
I'm specifying date so there is this
date column in the data set as I showed
you earlier let's look at it again so
you have date consumption wind solar
wind plus solar so you can suggest that
date should become the index column
which can be useful so you can do this
now let's just create this let's look at
what does this data frame contain and
here if you see it shows me some data
which has been
now as a part of this data frame
structure it starts with consumption
wind solar wind plus solar and if you
see this one is becoming my index column
so I can always do a head and look at
part of the data frame using head or
tail so look at the first records so
let's see this now that shows me the
head data I can also do a tail and look
at the ending values so if you closely
see here we have wind solar wind do
solar and that basically has na values
so there are missing values but let's
look at the tail and that tells me that
there is some data available for wind
and solar and wind solar now we can
always look in a tabular format using
View and we can look at the data so this
shows me that there are values in these
columns we see na values but if I really
scroll down I can see some values which
would be available for wind and solar
and wind solar so I can just use view
now I can look at the dimensions of this
particular object and that tells me
there are 400 uh
4,384 rows and four columns you can
always look at the structure that is
check the data type of each column which
can be very useful so if I see here I
don't see the date column because date
column was cons considered as an index
which can be useful but I also look at
my other columns they are of the num
types so that's the data type for each
attribute or each column here now we
would be interested in looking at this
date column so let's look at the data
type of this date column now if I try to
do this this will show me that this is
null because date as a column does not
exist because we created it as an index
so if I look at row names and then I
search for my data show me the index
column or row. names it tells me these
are the values that's the date column
which we are seeing here now we can
access a specific row by just doing a my
data and give the index value or row
name value so let's look at that and
that shows me based on this index you're
looking at the value you can obviously
search for a different date something
like this you can also pass in a vector
and you can give range of values so that
is 0 1 2006 to 4 of January and we can
look at this one so it shows me these
are the values so here actually I'm not
giving a range but I'm just selecting
multiple values from row. names now we
already know that in R you have a
summary function so you can always do a
summary and that gives you for each
column it gives you minimum first
quartile median mean third quartile and
maximum values so we are looking at
consumption we are looking at wind solar
and wind. solar now this is good but
then if I would want to really visualize
the data access the data do some
analysis then it would be good to take
all the columns and then we can later
decide to change the data type of say
date column if we want to use it so
earlier I was using date as row. names
or the name of the rows or index what
you call in any other programming
language so here I will just use my data
set and I'll say header is true I'm
calling it my data 2 let's look at the
data and this one shows me five columns
where in My First Column is the date
consumption wind solar and so on now
looking at the structure so let's look
at the data type so it tells me that if
now I'm interested in looking at the
date column from my data 2 Data frame it
tells me it is a factor with 4 384
levels and these are the values so it is
not in a datetime format it's a factor
now what we can do is we can convert
this into a date format how do we do
that so so let's have a variable X and
I'm going to use as. dat function and
I'm going to pass in my date column so
that's assign to X now let's look at the
head of X and it shows me the values we
will also see what kind of class it is
and we will look at the structure of X
so class already says it is date type
and look at the structure so it shows me
the format now we have converted this
column or column related value into X
now how do I
basically extract values out of it or
make it a part of data frame so first I
will use so all once it has been
converted in date format I will go for
as. numeric and here I will create a
variable called ear and I will just do a
format on X which is basically of date
type and then I'm saying percentage y so
that will get me the ear component out
of this let's look at the values that
shows me year component now similarly we
can get the month out of this and then
basically look at the month values we
can get the day out of it and we can get
the day component now if I look at my
data 2 which we had created earlier this
basically had date consumption wind
solar wind solar so what I can do is I
can add these extracted columns such as
year month day to my data frame using a
cbind that is column bind and I will
assign it to my data to again so let's
do this and now if you look at head it
shows me date so that should be date
format consumption now this one might
not be date format but we'll see you
have consumption wind solar and we have
extracted the year month and day which
can help us for group buy we can do some
aggregations we can do a plotting and we
can do various things by these
additional columns now let's look at
first three rows here so I'll say 1 is
to three for my data 2 and that shows me
some data here you can always do ahead
and look at the sample of data so that
basically shows me month day your
columns and then you have your date now
what we can do is we would want to
visualize this data we would want to
basically understand the consumption now
as I said if we want to visualize the
data say for example I want this which
is consumption of data over years and
this one is in terms of gigawatts per
hour as we were mentioning here gigawatt
hours so if I would want to create this
visual to basically understand the
pattern of the data how do we do it so
we can you create a line plot of
full-time series of Germany's
electricity consumption using the plot
method now how do we do that so here one
of the option is I can straight away use
the plot method I can then say what
would be in my x-axis what would be on
my y AIS what would be the type of graph
I would want to plot what is my name on
x-axis y AIS and this is the simplest
way so I'm saying my data 2 I'm
extracting the year column and here I'm
taking the consumption so let's create a
plot and here if you see we are looking
at a plot we do see some tick times and
we see that the data has been divided
with every two years so from 2006
onwards to
2016 but then really this data does not
give me uh you know a very useful way of
looking at the data or understanding it
might be what I can do is I can use the
same way but I can give apart from
x-axis and Y AIS I can say the limits
that is X limit is 2006 to 2018 and Y
limit is from 800 to 1700 so we can do
this and let's look at this again this
is a plot but it really does not help me
in visualizing and understanding the
data so what are the better options I
can go for multiple plots in a window as
of now we are just sticking to one plot
in window so if if you would want to
have multiple plots you can always
change the value here and make it two or
three that will say how many rows and
how many columns so as of now we will
just keep it as it is par MF row now if
I would want to plot I can straight away
give the column name so I am interested
in getting the consumption now I can
just do a plot I'll say my data 2 and I
will choose the second column which is
consumption which we saw here
from our data so consumption was the
second column so I can just do a plot in
a straightaway way without mentioning
your x axis y AIS limits and so on and
if you look at this this one is giving
me a pattern now here I am looking at um
x-axis Y axis which is not really named
we do not have a name to this graph and
we are looking at the data it does show
me some kind of pattern but mightbe we
can make it more meaningful so I can do
it this way where I say my data second
column let's give access as ear x-axis Y
axis is consumption now that has changed
the xaxis and y- axis now I can also
give some more details I can say type
should be line I have the line width I'm
saying color is blue and let's do this
so this looks more meaningful might be
shows a wavering pattern of consumption
over years I can also give a limit of x
that is 0 to 2018 and that basically
shows me the range now we can change
that and we can be more specific and
saying X limit should be 2006 to
2018 and let's look at this now this one
once you have given a proper limit it
shows the line graph and it shows what
was the consumption in 2006 and over a
period till
2018 I can then use any of these options
are fine but it depends on what and whom
you are presenting the data or what kind
of analysis you're doing so I can do a
plot I can choose column second xlab
which is x axis Y axis type is line
width giving X limit y limit and then
I'm giving a title to this which is
consumption graph and then basically
you're looking at the line graph now
those are the options which you can do
either you could be very specific or you
could just give your column which you
want to plot or obviously make it more
meaningful by giving all the details now
what we can do is if we would want to
look at this data and understand it
better rather than just looking at a
simple line I can take the log values so
here I'm saying log of my data 2 second
column so I'm taking log log values of
consumption and I'm taking the
difference of logs so I can say
difference and then you can basically
increase or decrease this by multiplying
it by some number so rest Remains the
Same I'm changing the color and let's
look at this plot and you see this
basically is giving me a better pattern
which makes meaning here we see the log
values so this is you are using a simple
plot
function in R you can also use G ggplot
now for that we can install the ggplot
package it's already there in my machine
so I'll say no I will access this by
using the library ggplot
2 and now I can use ggplot to plot so
the way you specify here you can say my
data 2 that's the data frame I'm saying
type as o and when I'm saying line I am
basically going to use x axis which is
here Y is consumption and let's look at
this plot so again we are back to the
one which we were doing earlier really
does not make any sense gives us some
data but then really does not give me
enough information I can in my
Aesthetics I can say x is ear Y is
consumption I can do a grouping and then
I can give line and plot so again we
have some information but really does
not help me right now let's look at
other example so I'm just doing the same
thing here and I'm looking at line type
being tached I'm using the GG plots
other methods such as gome line and gome
point to give me more information and if
I look at the plot it does give me data
it tells me what are the different
values it gives me some kind of pattern
but I would still prefer the way we were
doing with plot now we can change the
color and obviously add details to it so
what we see is when you use the plot
method which I did earlier it was
choosing pretty good tick locations that
is every two years and labels the years
for the x-axis which was helpful right
but with these data points which we were
seeing here or say for example this
one or say this one or say this one we
are looking at some data but then that
really is quite crowded and it is hard
to read you can look at the values but
then it really does not give you enough
information so we can go for plot method
but then we will see how we can consider
different data now if I would want to
plot the solar and wind time series so
let's see how do we do that so wind
column is what I'm interested in so
first thing is it was always good to
find out the minimum and the maximum
values in every column so I'm saying
minimum I'm saying let's put in here my
data
2 and then let's look at the values so
we are looking at the columns we know
consumption is the second column wind is
the third column and you have solar is
the fourth and this one is the fifth so
let's say let's find out the minimum of
each of these columns which we would
want to plot so let's say minimum of
data third column and here I'm also
saying remove the na values because we
do not want to consider the na values so
let's look at the minimum that shows me
5.7 757 what is the maximum value it is
826 so that also helps me in giving a
limit if I want to plot wind on Y axis I
can give a y limit from 5 to
850 consumption wise let's find out the
minimum from second column and and
maximum and similarly for solar find the
minimum and maximum and wind plus solar
minimum and maximum so this will be
helpful when you would want to plot
multiple graphs or give some limits so
that's fine now for multiple plots as I
said instead of having one plot let's
plot consumption and wind and solar and
try to see a pattern so I can say par
function and I will say three rows and
one one column so now when I start
plotting you will see you will have
multiple plots in one single window so
let's see how we do it so here let's
look at plot one so this one is
consumption as we did earlier and let's
look at the data so that gives me some
data you can always do a zoom and you
can look at the data you can basically
expand this graph or you can reduce this
graph to see what kind of pattern we
have in consumption similarly we can
basically choose date being x axis my
consumption being y AIS right so this is
being more specific because here we have
a range but it really does not give me
enough information so I will basically
give xaxis Y axis I will give the name
that is daily totals and then I will
basically give consumption color and Y
limit based on my minimum and maximum
limits so let's do this and now we can
look at the data here so let's see this
data makes a little more meaning because
we are looking at the
dates and let me do a zoom so it shows
me all the dates it shows me the data
points it shows me how the data pattern
is changing for consumption now this is
for consumption so what we can do is we
can also extract specific data so if you
see here I have done some testing where
I saying okay I would want to get a date
specifically I would want to extract
some Valu so we are looking at the date
column but if you remember we did not
change the data type we just changed the
data type of date column we extracted
year men mon month out of it it would be
good if we can convert a column into
date time format and put that in our
data frame now let's look at the plot
two this is mainly for your uh column
which should be consumption and wind and
solar so here I see it is solar data and
I can plot this one to see how it looks
like and that tells me from 2006 onwards
we have some pattern
I can be more specific where I say I
would be giving date and then the column
for solar x axis y AIS what is the type
what is the Y limit and what is the
color it is always good to specify your
X and Y axis given name rather than let
it automatically pick up now this makes
more meaning because it shows me some
dates similarly we can do for wind so
either you do it just by giving the
column or you give your X and Y AIS so
let's look at this one and this shows me
the data so we can choose plot three
this one we can choose plot two we can
choose plot one and we can put all that
data in one graph so that's when you are
putting in multi plots in one particular
graph you can always do a zoom you can
always look at the data right and this
is usually useful to look at the pattern
what kind of pattern we see what data we
have and so on now moving forward so we
have seen how you are creating these
plots all in one window let me reset
this back to one plot per window and
let's basically plot time series in a
single year so what we have seen is that
when you look at the plot method it was
quite crowded then we looked at solar
and wind and if you compare that you
will see your consumption p pattern your
solar pattern your wind pattern and
basically we can see from this
particular data some kind of pattern so
electricity consumption is highest in
the
winter where we will see what is the
consumption is it highest in Winter or
is it in summer we can see that by
breaking a year further into months we
can see that but we see a pattern which
goes for every year or every two years
being higher at a particular point of
time and then it drops down so
electricity consumption is highest in
Winter and that might be due to
electrical Heating and increased
lighting usage and lowest in summer now
when you look at electricity consumption
appears to split into two clusters we
can always look at the consumption one
with oscillation centered roundly around
1400 gaws so you can always look at
1,400 gaws and you see all the values
here which are in that particular
consumption another with fewer and more
scattered data points entally roughed
around 115 so if you really expand this
you can see you will have lot of data
points at this point now we might guess
that these clusters correspond with
weekdays and weekends which we can see
if you break that data into yearly
monthly weekly and so on now if you look
at solar production that is highest in
summer when sun light is most abundant
and lowest in winter so obviously when
you're making or gathering some insights
when you're looking at the data you are
also using your domain knowledge your
business knowledge your you know
knowledge of business to understand how
this goes if you look at wind power
production that's again highest in
Winters and drops down in summer so due
to stronger winds and more frequent
storms and lowest in summer so there is
some kind of increasing Trend in wind
power production over years which we can
see here over the years and all the time
series data what we are looking at is
referring or showing us some kind of
seasonality that is we are looking at
seasonality in which a pattern is
repeating again and again at regular
times at regular intervals so if you
look at consumption solar and wind time
series that oscillates between high and
low values on a yearly time scale which
we can break down and see I'll show you
that it corresponds with the seasonal
changes in weather over the year so
seasonality does not have to correspond
with meteorological reasons for example
if you look at retail stale sales
data uh that will show you yearly
seasonality with increased sales in
particular months so seasonality when we
say can occur on other time scales so
the plots what we are seeing here
they are fine but if you look at those
plots they might show some kind of
weekly seasonality also so in your
consumption corresponding to weekday and
weekend so let's plot for one single
year now how do I do that so first is I
will look at my data
2 that shows me the structure it shows
me date which is Factor other columns
which are all numerics now like we did
earlier I'll repeat this step where I'm
going to convert the date column into
date type look at head of it look at
class of it look at the structure of it
right and then what I want to do is I
want to add
this as to my data frame so I will
create a variable called mod data and
this one will have as data and I'm
formatting the value of x which is date
time into month day and year so let's do
that and now you look at the mod data
which I created like modified data so
this is the format I have it is in date
type if you carefully see here and then
I can look at the head of it so it says
me mod data now we are what we did here
is when I said my data
3 so my data 3 we did a cbind and I did
a mod data which is is going to add this
column to my other Columns of my data 2
so my new data frame is my data 3 let's
look at the structure of it and you see
there is this date column I can delete
it I can remove it I can let it be right
so that depends on our choice might be
we want to once our analysis done we
want to remove the mod data right so we
can keep both of them now let's
basically extract data for a particular
year now how do you do that so this is
some wrangling so I will say my data 4
let's call it my data 4 and I will use
subset function so subset will work on
my data 3 that's the data and what I'll
do is I will do a subset how do how is
the subset found so I'll say take the
mod data column the value should be
greater than or equal to 2017 and should
be less than 2017 December 31st so I'm
getting data for one year and I'm
storing it as my data
4 let's get the head of it and you see
we are specifically looking at 2017
related data now let's do a plotting of
this where I will only create a plot for
one year so I'm saying my data 4 that's
my
new data what we got so here I am going
to take the first column
which is mod data I'm going to take the
third column which is consumption so I'm
looking at the date format for one year
consumption values for it and then rest
of the things as we have done earlier
let's look at the plot and this makes
more meaning right so when you look at
this plot it tells me Jan to Jan it
shows me some kind of pattern where I
have divided the year into months right
and it is is broken down into say two
months so Jan and March and May and July
and so on but we still see a pattern and
that gives me good understanding of
pattern where I've broken it down into
months so this is where you have taken
time series in a single year to
investigate further and this is what we
see right now we can clearly see there
are some weekly o
oscillations what one more interesting
feature is that at this level of
granularity that is when you're looking
at yearly data there is a drastic
decrease in electricity consumption in
early January and late December during
the holidays or probably we can assume
that this is holidays now I can zoom in
further and look at just Jan and Feb
data let's see how we do that and let's
see how we work by zooming in the data
further so to zoom in the data further
let's see how we do it now here we have
this my data 4 which is basically having
a subset right so let's work on this one
so I will say my data 4 which earlier I
was taking data three I was doing a
subset and I was giving the date but
this time I will make it more narrower
so I'll say my data four I will say
subset from my data 3 and I will choose
mod data column which we have modified
with the date format I will choose the
starting date as
1701 that is Jan and then let's go till
Feb and let's create
this now let's look at the head of this
so it shows me we have the data which is
Jan and then you you can basically look
at more on this now again as I said
earlier let's find out the minimum of
this from the First Column so that is
basically your mod data so let's look
into this one and that
basically will give me minimum and
maximum let's look at the values so this
one tells me Jan 17 January 1 and
maximum is
your Feb 28th 2nd month 2017 so we are
actually looking at two months data here
let's look at the Y minimum so this is I
will look at column three now what is
column three consumption so let's look
at the minimum value for consumption
maximum value of consumption let's look
at the values which can be given as our
limits now this is the minimum and
maximum now let's do a plotting for this
data which has been narrowed down for
consumption based on my data so I'm
saying My First Column which is mod data
and then third column which is
consumption I'm giving some naming
convention for sorry namings for your x
axis Y axis what is my
consumption or what is my title here
what is the color and then you see I'm
using X limit to give the minimum and
maximum limit and Y limit so let's look
at this data and if you look at this
data it is specifically for two months
and again I can look at the pattern here
what I can also do is I can add some
grid here here so I can basically look
at this data and make more meaning out
of it so it is bi-weekly data you can
see now I can add a line here using AB
line and then I can basically choose
what lines I would want to add
horizontally so that basically allows me
to dissect the data and look at data in
a more meaningful way I can also add
vertical lines so vertical lines is I'm
saying sequence will be minimum maximum
and I'm saying an interval of seven so
let's do this and this basically has
added some lines every week and you can
see at the end of week it is dropping
and then it is starting again it Peaks
somewhere in the mid of the week and
again it drops down so this is you're
looking at your consumption data right
now what we can also do is we can create
some box plots so when we looked at
zooming in data for Jan and Feb you can
add some data points like this so
consumption is highest on the weekday as
I showed you here and lowest on the
weekends so this is what we are seeing
when we are breaking the data or zooming
it further for a couple of months so we
have vertical grid lines and we have
nicely formatted tick labels that is Jan
1st Jan 15 Feb 1st and so on so we can
easily tell which days are weekday and
weekends with use of these grid lines
and basically breaking down so there are
many other ways to actually visualize
your time series data depending on what
patterns you're trying to explore you
can use Scatter Plots you can use heat
maps you can use histograms and so on
now moving further we would want to
explore the seasonality right so when
you further explore the seasonality of
our data we can use box plots basically
to group the data by different time
periods and display the distrib bution
for each group now how do we do
that let's come here and let's see how
box plot works so I can just do a simple
box plot and I can choose my consumption
column and that gives me just the
consumption data but this really does
not give me any meaning I can look at
solar data I can look at the wind data
and we can also see some outliers here
so we can create box plots but if we
would want to do a box plot what is box
plot it is basically a visual display of
your five number summary that is you
want to look at your mean median you
want to look at your 25th percentile 50
percentile or 75th percentile so we can
use a quantile function use the
consumption column and then you
basically give a vector which shows you
five number summary so that's your quti
and then let's do a box plot so if you
are looking at it tells me what is the
minimum what is 25th percentile 50 75th
and 100 that's from my consumption
column so let's create a box plot for
consumption let's give it a name as
consumption let's give Y axis as
consumption and a limit for y axis now
that's my consumption graph so I can
look at yearly data now that will make
more meaning rather than just looking at
the complete consumption data so how do
we do it yearly
so we will say consumption and then I
will say the ear column so it is
consumption but grouped based on ear so
here I can give xaxis y AIS and I can
give y limit so let's create this and
this makes more meaning we can give some
coloring scheme here but now I'm looking
at 2006 2007 8 9 and so on and we can
look at the data what is the range right
it gives me 5 percentile or sorry five
number summary of the data per year and
it basically allows me to look at the
seasonality of this similarly we can
create box plot by just giving
consumption yearly grouped and here I'm
giving the title as consumption y AIS
xaxis and Y limit wherein I can also use
lass so this is one more feature which
you can do and that basically Al will
give me the tick points if you compare
this one to the previous graph so when I
created this previous graph I had 2006
2008 and I had from 600 to 18800 and if
I go for the next one I am basically
seeing more useful information now let's
look at monthly data so I would want to
group it based on months and let's
create that so this gives me the monthly
data where I'm looking at
months and I could select a particular
year or I can just do a grouping based
on months so I can have multiple plots
to see a difference here so let's do
this now let's create a box plot for
consumption which is monthly data and
let's give it a color let's look at the
wind data which is again grouped monthly
and let's look at the solar data which
is grouped monthly now if I zoom in it
basically gives me the seasonality of
the data for your wind for your
consumption for your solar so what we
are doing is we are creating these box
plots which are giving us values now
what I can also do is I could look at
the day wise also but before we look
into this how do I infer some
information from these box plots which
are being created so this is what we we
have done where we are looking at the
data for month and these box plots give
me year seasonality which we were seeing
in earlier plots but give some
additional insights so if I look at the
data here it tells me the electricity
consumption is generally higher in
Winter now this is based on months so we
can see consumption is higher in Winters
and lower in summer so we can obviously
look at our plot we can see where it is
lower where it is higher and then we can
look at the median and lower two
quartiles are lower in December and
January compared to November and
February so that is you look at the
quartiles and you will see that the
median and lower two quartiles are lower
in December and
January here Chan and December so you
can look look at from my plot now this
is giving you some idea on
seasonality now that might be due to
business being closed over holidays now
this one we were also seeing when we
looked at time series for 2017 only and
box plot basically confirms that there
is this consistent pattern throughout
the years now when you look at your
solar and wind power production both
will give you a year seasonality
what we are seeing here and if basically
I look at the data so it depends on what
parameters you are choosing but if you
look at solar it will reflect the effect
of occasional extreme wind speeds
associated with storms and other
transient and since we are grouping it
based on months we can see this pattern
is quite evident every year now what we
can do is we can group the data day wise
so here let me again reset this to one
plot per graph now I'll say box plot
I'll say consumption which is group
based on day now we know that there is a
day column and let's give a y limit and
let's look at the data so this is where
I'm grouping the data day wise so you
look at 31 days and you look at the box
plot so this is where you are plotting
it on a daily basis so you can look at
the data you can break it it down to a
particular week so here I have given day
and I have chosen all the 31 days but I
can break it down to a week and I can
look at the data so if we look at the
data per week or per day we can
basically infer that electricity
consumption where I'm doing a
consumption group by day is higher on
weekday than on
weekends so time series with strong
seasonality
can often be represented with models
that can decompose signal into
seasonality and long Trend now this is
an easy way now how do we look at the
frequency of the data that could be
interesting to see so let me uh look at
say the yearly
data which we were seeing
here now let's go further and here we
have looked at data so what we will do
is we look at the frequency now when you
look at the frequency when you talk
about frequency in your data so we have
the modified date column which gives me
a frequency and if we really look into
the data that will tell me that the data
is on a daily basis so for that let's
look at my data three again which gives
me data and you can just see all the
datas data or dates are in sequence so
your 22 23 24 25 26 and so on I can look
at I can access a deer
package that is basically allowing me to
work in a better way now I can look at
the summary of this and for all my
columns I am seeing what is the minimum
five number summary date and consumption
so date does not show me anything
because this is not in a date format it
is just a factor but other things have
the final summary so we are looking at
wind plus solar we are looking at year
and month and day and all these columns
now what we will do is we will want to
find out the sum of each column how many
entries does it have and we will say the
value should na value should not be
considered so let's look at this one so
it tells me for my particular columns so
let me run this again
and that shows me for each column how
many values you have and these counts do
not include the na values now similarly
I can find out specifically for
consumption I can find out is there any
na value so I'm saying is do Na and
let's find out if there is any na value
or missing value in consumption it says
zero okay that's good if you look in
Wind
it tells me there are, 1463 entries
which are na similarly solar similarly
wind do solar or wind plus solar so it
gives me a count of Na values that is
missing values and also values which are
not missing so to understand frequency
what we can do is we can find out the
minimum on the date that is the First
Column and I'm saying r M na. RM is true
that is get rid of Na values and find
out the minimum and let's look at the
minimum value this is the minimum from
my modified date now if I would want to
get the frequency I can basically use
sequence function so I can say from X
minimum that is the minimum value I want
to look at the frequency that is day
wise and let's just look at five entries
and see if there is a
day byday frequency so let's look at the
value of this and obviously it tells me
that is day wise frequency so that
allows me to look at the frequency look
at the type of it it is an integer class
is a date so similarly we can say from X
minimum we can basically look at the
frequency month-wise
and I can again look at five records so
that shows me monthly data right so I
can extract the data for frequency
similarly yearly data and that's also
very useful now we can select data which
has na values for wind so how do I do it
I would want to find out the wind column
and I want to find out where the values
are and a so I will create a variable
and here I will say my data three and
then I give a conditional where I say is
na in the column so let's do this now
once I've done this once I've done this
I have said that my selected win data
from my data 3 where we said na values
and I will give the names to this so
names should be in my data 3 I'm
interested in mod data consumption wind
and solar so these are the four columns
I'm interested in let's look at first 10
records here or first 10 rows so that
tells me these are the values where wind
has na or missing
values I can always do a view and that
gives me the complete data so it
basically shows me, 1463
entries and here it shows me all na
values so you can look at all the way to
the end and it shows me wind has na
solar does have some value here in the
last row but but then also if you see
the numbers
have a difference so you have 1461 and
then you have 2174 so there is a
difference so there is some data in
between where wind has some values so we
have found out na values now what we
will do is we will select data which
does not have any values so I will call
it cell selected wi two I'll again use
my data 3 I will say which but now I'm
saying not na from this column and I
will select the data for the columns so
I'm interested in looking at 10 records
and this shows me not any values so no
more missing values so if I really look
at this data as I saw earlier which has
Na and if I look at these values which
are not na for the wind column so
looking at these two result we will know
that in year 2011 wind column
has some missing values so let's focus
on year 2011 so how do I do that let's
call it a different variable I'll say my
data 3 I will say here when I say which
where we were saying na here I will say
the year should have a value of 2011 and
I want all these
columns let's look at the data here and
this is showing me 2011 but we are are
not seeing all the values so there are
some values but then there are some
missing values also for 2011 based on
whatever analysis we have done so let's
look at the class of this it is
basically a data frame do a view and
this one will help me in finding out
where are the na values so if you just
scroll down looking at all the data
let's search if wind column has a na or
a missing value and I will see if there
is any missing value in which column or
which row it is for the wind column so
we have all the values which are
existing I could select and search for
one specific value and I'll show you how
we can do that so here let's scroll all
the way down so it's like you're
exploring your data and seeing
is wind column having na or missing
value for a particular row and let's
scroll here and here you see there is a
missing value for one particular row so
13th December 2011 has wind value 15
December has wind value but your 14th
December does not have right similarly
we can search so there was only one
entry which was missing now that could
be for some reason mightbe it was not
calculated might be it was not tabulated
so we have a missing value and that can
affect my plotting that can affect my
analysis so let's look at the number of
rows in this which will tell me how many
rows we have for 2011 so it tells me 365
so that is basically the number of days
in a year now we will find out if there
were any values so we earlier checked
total number of Na values per
column that is in your row number 265 to
269 we can see here 265 to 26
9 so this is where we were seeing are
there any na values right so let's go
back
here and we want to find out the number
of Na values for a particular year how
do I do it so I can just do a sum I will
say is na now I'm interested in my data
three wind column and I'm saying my year
has to be 2011 but I'm finding out the
na values so so let's do this and it
tells me one and that's right that's
what we saw when we did a view let's see
how many non na values you have and that
is 364 so that
basically satisfies my logic so it's 364
plus one missing so there are 365 let's
look at the structure of this it tells
me you have modified date and date
format you have consumption wind and
solar now let's create a variable s
selected wind four I will say wind three
that is which was having all my Na and
non na values for 2011 I will say let's
find out the na value because I'm
interested in finding out that
particular row so I'm saying find out
where the value is na a and I want all
the columns let's look at this one and
this is my specific row which has a na
value
now we know that data follows a day wise
frequency which we have clearly seen now
let's select data which has Na and Nonna
values so let's say let's call it test
one I will use wind 3 which has Na and
non na values but now I will say I want
the modified date which should be
greater than
1222 2001 now remember we had when we
were doing a view we saw that one
particular day or what we see here 14th
of December there is no date so I will
select a subset of data which includes
This na and non na that is might be I
can take 13th of December and 15th of
December so let's start from
1212 so the date should be greater than
122 that means 13th and it should be
less than 16 so that is 15th and the
columns right so now we have some data
let's look at this so I have a I've
selected a subset of data I could have
done this using subset also so I have Na
and non na values now why are we doing
this so sometimes you might have some
data for a particular column and you may
want to find out if there are any
missing values might be you want to fill
them up or replace them with something
so that is usually useful when you are
doing a trend detection so say for
example you have data for every month
and might in one one of the months you
have missed or might be you have data
for every year collected monthly and
then in one of the years for a couple of
months you don't have the data like I
can say 2016 I have data for all 12
months 2017 all 12 months 2018 might be
I don't have data for March and June
2019 I don't have data for same months
so I can forward fill or backward fill
them using the previous years same month
data so we can do that so here I have
test data where I've extracted a subset
of data I can look at the class of this
it is a data frame structure of this it
has the columns now let's use the
library and function and use the Tidy r
package and what we will do is we will
fill it up so I will use test one I will
fill the wind column which has a missing
value value now once you do this if you
notice it has done a forward fill so it
has taken the previous value and it has
just filled up that so you can fill up
the data using different directions such
as up and down left and right and so on
so we can take care of missing values in
our frequency data which allows us to
basically analyze the data in a better
way now here we will want to also look
at some more data so this is to deal
with frequency so fill column wherein
you can take care of missing values
forward fill so filling values can be
done in different directions as I said
and you may want to First convert your
time series to specified frequency if
your data does not have a frequency but
we had now if you do not have a
frequency might be you can convert it
into a frequency such as weekly daily
monthly as I showed you and then
basically you can do a forward fill for
the values so for example if I have my
data I can break it down into weekly and
then look at the values and if there are
any values missing for weekly data I can
use a forward fill so that can take care
of my frequency data then let's look at
the trends of the data which is the last
part of this project so basically let's
look at the trend So when you say Trend
what does that mean
so in Time series data you always have
some kind of trend so that will exhibit
some slow gradual variability in
addition to higher frequency variability
such as seasonality and noise now to
visualize these Trends what we do is we
use what we call as rolling means so we
know how our data is spread over year or
month or day but how about looking at a
rolling average and see what is the
difference so a rolling mean will tend
to smooth a Time series by averaging out
the variations and
frequencies so this can be higher than
the window size so there is something
called as windowing where you can choose
a set of time frame you can also average
out any seasonality on a time scale
equal to window size so this will allow
you to look at lower frequency variation
in the data so when we are looking at
electricity consumption time series we
already saw there is a weekly pattern
there is a yearly seasonality which we
saw using box plots so we can also look
at the rolling means of the time scales
how do we do that so for this you can
use some package like zoo and then you
can basically use a rolling mean using
the zoo package and you can say what is
the frequency with which you want to
calculate the rolling mean now how do we
do this let's look at this data so here
I'm going to my look at my data 3 which
we have been using so far now let's call
it a three-day test you can give it any
name I'm going to use my data 3 I'm
using the pipin function now I will use
deer and I will arrange the data
descending in ear now you can always
break it down step by step and you can
see the result of this so I'm going to
arrange this data in descending order of
year so obviously my last one 2017 or
2018 will be on the top you want to
group the data by year so it depends on
how many years we have we'll see so you
can group the data by ear now this data
is then used to basically mutate so
mutate function is going to allow me to
use this rolling mean so I'll call it as
says 03 day so I'm going to calculate a
rolling mean every 3 days for my
consumption column and basically let's
ungroup this so let's see how this
works sorry yeah let's look at this and
here when I'm doing a 3-day test let's
look at the result of this and then I'll
explain this so if you see here we have
the test 3-day column now this has the
rolling average now what does that mean
so first first value here what we see is
1367 is the average consumption in
2017 from the first date with a data
point on either side of it that is you
can look at this date so
1130 then you look
at you're looking at the value 1367 here
so you look at 11 13 0
1441 153 0 if I take a mean of these so
for example if I would just to this
part and that is giving me mean okay
because I have a comment so let's
basically add anything as comment and
then let's do this so it saves me 1367
that's what we are seeing here right so
you're got getting a rolling average
every 3 days similarly if you want every
five days it takes the five values and
it gets the mid value right so you can
always find out the mean rolling mean
for a particular frequency now let's do
that for 7 days that is weekly data and
yearly data that is 365 days so how do I
do it same logic my data test now I'm
using my data 3 I'm arranging it in a
descending order I'm grouping by year so
when you do a group by year so earlier
when we did a grouping by and when we
looked at the data it was telling me how
many rows we had right so let's do a
grouping by year here and let's say test
07 so that's a rolling average every 7
days and I'm also saying take care of
the na values similarly I'm getting
rolling average every 365 days might be
you can do quarterly might be you can do
half yearly and let's do this so let's
create this my data test and let's look
at the result of this so I will use my
data test I will say arrange based on
modified date now we you know there is a
column called modified date I want to
just look at 2017 data so I'm doing a
filter right and then I will choose what
are the columns I'm interested in so I
will look at the 7 and 365 day and let's
look at say first seven records so let's
do this and that basically gives me the
consumption value modified date year and
my rolling 7day average or 7day mean
which is for first 7 days and then 365
you will not see the data here but if I
do a view on this I can basically see
the values so you can always select a
particular column to see the
values these are the values for every 7
Day rolling average this is for 365 days
every 365 days so you see all the values
are missing but every 365 entry you will
have basically some data now let's do a
plot of this and basically visualize
this data which we are seeing rolling
average so let me first do a plotting
one plot per graph and let's do a
plotting I will take consumption
data x axis y AIS color and give a title
to this so let's create this and that's
my consumption data which is spread over
a period of time and that's fair enough
but now let's add some more plot to this
so I will add the 7day rolling average
to this so for second plot to be added
in the same one in R you can use points
so I will say points I will choose seven
data column type is line width x limit y
limit and color so let's do this and
that's my pattern 7day rolling average
which basically gives me some kind of
trend similarly I can add one more here
and this time I will choose the 365 day
and look at the pattern lines so now you
see some Dots here well you could do it
in a different way so I can just add
Legend to this and I can say Legend will
bew in x-axis and y axis so I'm saying
it will be
2,500 and Y is 1,800 so my Legend will
come in somewhere here I'm saying my
Legend will have consumption test list
and this one I can give some names I can
give what is the color I can say what
kind of Legend it explains what is for
each color and then basically a vector
so let's add a legend to this and I've
added a legend now you can do a zoom and
look at the
data and here I see that uh my x- Axis
is fine but Y axis is going a little
little out of my plotting area so I can
actually change that so here I have
1,800 how about making it
1,600 and let's look at this one so we
can
basically uh go for this one and start
again here plot and points and line and
then add a legend right and you can
basically place your Legend anywhere in
the plot so this basically is giving me
me the trend what I'm looking at my
rolling average so similarly you can
look at the trend for wind and solar
data so what we are seeing here is when
you look at Trend this is one more way
of looking at it you can always create
plots in different ways so 7-Day rolling
mean has smoothed out all week Le
seasonality which we were seeing Here in
My Graph where you look at every 7 Day
Pres observing the yearly seasonality so
7day will tell that electricity
consumption is typically higher in
Winter and lower in summer so better is
you break it down uh yearly so here if
you look at every year you can see when
is winter when is summer what is the
seasonality what you're Trend what
you're seeing here and if there is a
decrease or increase uh for few weeks
every winter so similarly if you look at
365 now as you said as I said rolling
average basically uh reduces the
variation so if I look at 365 rolling
mean we can see long-term Trend in
electricity consumption is pretty flat
now that's what we are seeing it's kind
of pretty flat there is not much
variation over years if you really join
these dots so we can basically see some
highs and lows and that gives me a trend
now this is how you can do a Trend
detection and similarly we can do
plotting for wind and solar so this is a
small project which I demonstrated using
R now all this code which you have here
in the form of a project. r file you can
find here in my GitHub page this is the
document which explains some things feel
free to download this and you can add
details to it this is the sample data
set which you can also find in my

description box Excel is a really
powerful tool for data analytics and
Reporting and pivot tables are one of
the features that Excel offers for
creating tabular reports to summarize
our data let's begin by understanding
what is a pivot table a pivote table is
a tool that summarizes and reorganizes
selected columns and rows of data in a
spreadsheet to obtain a desired
report it does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives pivot tables are especially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be timec consuming to calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a pivot table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
displays the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is is a good
time for us to analyze India's last
census data from 2011 and see where
different states and cities across India
stood in terms of population literacy
and other socioeconomic factors we will
analyze this data by creating different
pivot tables in Excel and explore some
of its features so let's begin first
I'll show you one of the features that
Excel offers us so suppose I click on
any cell and hit control+ Q you can see
our entire table is selected and and at
the right bottom there's an option of
quick analysis now you can see by
default Excel has prompted certain
features such as formatting we have
charts totals and there's one more
called tables now Excel by default has
created some P tables for us now the
first one you say is sum of district
code by state names next we have sum of
sex ratio by state name then we have sum
of child sex ratio sum of male graduates
and some of female graduates by state
name and there are others before
creating our pivote table so let's have
a final look at our data set so First
Column you see is the city column so
there are different cities from
different parts of India then we have
the state code we have the state name
district code we have the total
population followed by male and female
population next you can see we have the
total literates from each City then we
have the male and female literates next
we have the sex ratio then we have the
child sex ratio next we have total
number of graduates and finally you can
see we have male and female graduates so
using this table we'll create several P
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the total population for each
of the states in descending order so to
create a peot table you can click any
cell in your data go to the insert Tab
and here left you can see we have the
option to create a p table so let me
select pivote table now my range is
already selected the entire table and
here I'll choose existing worksheet
because I want to place my pivote table
in the same worksheet and I'll give my
location I'll point to cell Q5 now let
me click
okay you can see the P table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name onto rows so here in our P
table you can see we have the different
state names listed now we want
the total population for each of these
states so in the field list I'll search
for total population which is this one
and drag it under
values you can see we have a sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I write right click
go to sort option and choose Zed to a
that is largest to
smallest you can see here in 2011
Maharashtra had the highest number of
population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andra Pradesh and if
I come down we have nagaland and andan
and nicobar Islands towards the end so
this is a simple pivot table that we
created
now the next problem we have is we want
to find the total sum of literates in
each City belonging to a certain state
so let's see how to do it I'll click on
any cell go to insert and here I can
click on pavot table my range is
selected I'll choose existing worksheet
and give my location which is Q5 I click
on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all the
states next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then we'll drag City onto
rows you can see here we have our pivote
table
ready to the left of the pivot table you
can see we have the state names and the
cities per state and on the right you
can see the total number of literates
from each City if I scroll down we have
Assam then you can see we have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
there Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
Karnataka and other states as well
moving
on okay so the next next thing we want
to see is what is the average sex ratio
and the child sex ratio for each state
with that we also want to find the
states that had the highest and lowest
sex ratio in
2011 so let's create a peot table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average X
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want want to see it based on
different states so what I'll do is I'll
take state name and put it under rows so
here you can see we have our pivote
table ready on the left you can see we
have the different state names listed
and on the right we have the values now
we want to find the average Now by
default Excel will sum the numeric
columns you can see it tells you sum of
sex ratio and child sex ratio so what
you can do can click on this drop down
and go to Value field
settings and here summarize values by
you can choose average you can see the
custom name it says average of sex ratio
click on
okay our entire column is now giving us
the average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into
average I'll again click on the drop-
down go to Value field settings click on
average and click
okay and you can see here we have the
average of child sex ratio for each of
the states now the next question says
which states had the highest and lowest
sex ratio so we'll consider this column
so we'll sort it in any order you want
you can do it either ascending or
descending let me short it in descending
order
you can see we have our column sorted
now so in
2011 Kerala had the highest sex ratio
and if I scroll down to the bottom you
can see himanchal Pradesh had the lowest
which is around
[Music]
8818 up next let's explore one more
feature of peot table so suppose you
want to see the top or bottom few rows
of a peot table you can do that as well
so here we have a question at hand we
want to find the top three cities with
the highest number of female graduates
so let's see from the entire pivot table
how we can filter the top three cities
so I'll go to insert click on the P
table option go to existing worksheet
click on
Q5 and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows
and then we want the female graduates so
in the search bar I'll look for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the highest number
of female graduates in the top three
cities so let me first sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can see that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities but
it's displaying all the cities for us so
let's filter only the top three so what
you can do is right click and go to
filter under filter you have the option
of top 10 I'll select this here I only
want the top three so either you can
go down like this or you can directly
type
three your column is already selected
let me just click on okay there you go
we have the required pivote table ready
and it only displays us the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a peot
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and and Karnataka so let's
create a p table for this and see how
you can use a slicer to filter the
table click on existing I'll click on a
location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values and then I'll select the
city on two rows and then the state name
also
I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the pivot table all the states
and their
cities and on the right you can see the
total population for each of these
cities but our question is we want to
find only for Rajasthan and Karnataka
now for that what you can do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option and
here you have the option to create or
insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll se search for
these two so here we have Karnataka so
let me select Karnataka
first and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our P table we only
have data for Rajasthan and
Karnataka so this P table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and and similarly we also have
for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do that
I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty
cell okay now here since we want to find
the percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literates onto values followed
by female literates on two values by
default it has summed up the male lit
and female lit value
and also I want to drag State
column to
rows so here you can see the sum of male
literates and female literates per state
I want to convert this as percentage
contribution so what we can do is I'll
select any cell and I'll right click and
I'll go to so value as and here I have
the option to select
percentage of grand total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male lates through the
total now if I sort this you will get to
know which state contributed or has the
highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
male
literates then we had utar Pradesh in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and Andaman
and nicobar
Islands as two states which had little
or minimal contribution to male
literates similarly let's do it for
female literates I'll go to so value as
and select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature
to convert your data and see it and
terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto rows and let's
drag the city column onto
rows next we want female graduates so
let me look for female graduates in the
field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and to the
right of the peot table you can see the
sum of female graduates from each
City now first I sort this column I'll
right click go to sort and click on sest
to largest now we have sorted our female
graduates
from shortest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to the
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now I
replace top 10 with bottom and I want
the bottom three cities from each state
I have my column selected that is some
of female graduates if I click on okay
you can see here some of the states
don't have three cities so you can see
andan and nicobar islands has only one
city that is Port player while the
remaining you can find the bottom three
cities with the lowest number of female
graduates so Andhra Pradesh had these
three in Assam we had Naga then there
was tiar and CA similarly if I come down
in harana we have palwal kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka there's gangavati this
Rani benur and this scholar similarly
you can see for Kerala as
well now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a peot table so in a p
table you can create or use custom
formulas to create calculated fields or
items calculated fields are formulas
that can refer to other fields in the
pivot table calculated Fields appear
with other value fields in the pivote
table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
Su of followed by the field name so here
we have a sales table that has columns
like the items which has different
fruits and vegetables and those have
been categorized as fruits and
vegetables we have the price per kg and
this is in terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you you can do that with
the help of a p table I'll create a p
table
first click on an empty cell hit okay
now if you see on the top under P table
analyze and under calculations we have
the option Fields items and sets if I
click on this drop down I get the option
to create a calculated field or insert a
calculated field I click on this I'll
give my field name as as sales and I'll
select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I'll
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculated field that
is present in the pivote table fields
which is Sals but it did not add it to
our original table or original table is
the same but here we have added a
calculated field which is present only
in the pivote table list now we can use
this it has already taken it under
values now let's say I want to find the
sum of sales for each item under each
category you can see it here we have our
c category fruit and we have our
category vegetable and under that we
have different items like apple apricot
banana similarly in vegetables we have
broccoli the carrots corn eggplant and
others so this is how you can create a
calculated field in a pivote table now
this's one more good feature that Excel
offers us in pivote table is to create a
pivote chart so you can use your pivote
table and create different charts so
I'll show you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts if I click on this
Excel gives me some default charts which
you can use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
has created this is called a pivote
chart now here you can see the category
fruits and vegetables and the different
fruits and vegetables or the
items in the y axis you can see the
total sales if you see from the graph
guava me the highest amount of Sals now
if I sort this let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I saw sorted and changed my P
table the P chart also automatically
gets updated similarly there are other
charts also that you can create let's go
to the insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pi chart so this is a pie chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our pie chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the pi
that has the highest area represents
it had the highest amount of sales in
this case you can see it is guava and
similarly we have other items as well
this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivote table
go to insert and under recommended
charts let's now select a line chart if
I hit okay move it to the right
so this is a line chart you can see it
starts from guava which had the highest
amount of sales then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800
rupees and our lowest was eggplant at
900 rupees for fruits papaya sold the
least at 700 rupees
let's take another chart I'll go to
insert under recommended charts let's
see this time we'll see a bar chart now
this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
let take the area chart for now so this
is an area chart again it looks similar
to the line chart it starts with guava
which had the highest amount of seals
similarly papaya under fruits had the
lowest amount of sales under vegetables
it was broccoli and finally eggplant
made the lowest amount of Sals under
vegetable now let's go to our first
sheet and summarize what we have done in
this demo for people tables in Excel so
we had our
data this is 2011 Census Data from India
we had the different cities the state
names and we had the total population
total literates female literates male
literates we had the sex ratio total
graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple P table where we
calculated the total population for each
state and sorted it in descend in order
we found that Maharashtra utar Pradesh
had the total population in
2011 then we saw another prevote table
where we calculated the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical qual so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex
ratio after that we saw how you could
find or filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater Mumbai and bangaluru were the
top cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a p table SL we sliced a table based
on Rajasthan and Karnataka State and saw
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and
Karnataka in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates one thing
marked that some of the states did not
have three cities for example Andaman
had only one city that was Port player
but the others we found out the bottom
three cities that had the lowest female
graduates finally we looked at how to
create a calculated field in a pivote
table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called sales and then
we explored how to create different
charts and graphs so this was an area
chart that we saw there a column chart
we also saw or looked at a bar chart
that was a horizontal bar chart
similarly we saw how to create a pie
chart as well in this video we'll be
creating two dashboards using a sample
sales data set so if you want to get the
data and the dashboard file that we'll
be creating in this demo then please put
your email IDs in the comment section of
the video our team will share the files
via
email now let's begin by understanding
what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards an advantage of dashboards is
the quick detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data VIs
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first so here is the sales data set that
we'll be using for our demo so this data
set was actually generated using a
simulator and is completely random it
was not validated though we have applied
certain transformations to the data
using power query features
so this data as you can see has thousand
rows so using the simulator we had
generated thousand rows of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has 17 columns now let
me give you a brief about each of the
columns so first we have the region
column so we have Middle East and North
Africa there's North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others
similarly we have the country names from
which the item was ordered the third
column is the item type so we have
different items Cosmetics vegetables
there's baby food cereal fruits Etc then
we have the representatives name or you
can say this as the customer name who
ordered the product then we have a sales
Channel column so there are basically
two channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date colum then we
have the order ID the ship date next we
have unit
sold which is basically the total number
of units sold for each item then we have
the unit price column this is the price
at which each product was sold then we
have the unit cost column which is
basically the production cost for each
of the items next we have the total
revenue the total revenue is actually
the product of unit sold and unit price
then we have the total cost column now
the total cost column is actually the
product of units sold and the unit cost
similarly we have the total profit
column so total profit is the difference
between total revenue and the total cost
and finally we have created two more
columns that is order year and then we
have order month now these two columns
were actually generated using the power
query features so we used the order date
column which is this column and
extracted order year and Order
month so first we are going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate P tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
Fields now let's create our first report
to see the total revenue generated each
year so we need to create a p table for
this I'll click on a cell in my data set
and then I'll go to the insert tab here
we have the option to select the pivote
table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
click on okay there you go so we have a
new sheet where I can place my P
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order year
column
under rows and then I'll select the
total revenue column under values you
can see I have my P chart ready now if
you want you can sort this so from the
data you can see we have order Year from
2010 to
2017 now based on this data let's create
our pivote chart so I'll click on any
cell go to insert insert and here you
have the option to select recommended
charts I click on this now actually I
want a line chart so I'll click on line
here and select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivot
chart now let me show you how you can
format this chart to make it more
readable so first let me delete these so
I'll right click and select hide all
field buttons on the chart so this will
delete the buttons present on the chart
now let me go ahead and edit the chart
title so the title I want is total
revenue I'll type it
down by
Year all right next let's do a few more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is gone
now let me add access titles so we'll
label our xaxis and y axis so here under
x-axis I can write it as
year similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right
now let me select this chart Style
option and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color okay
and then let me go back to style let's s
cect a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
data labels you can see we have the
revenue for each of the years now this
is not readable at all so we'll format
this a
bit if I click on this Arrow here I have
more options
if I scroll down you can see we have
something called as number here I'll
expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here we'll give a format
code which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
a formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than
let's say 9 lakh
999,000 let me make sure there are six
nines here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go I'll close the
bracket I'll give a
hash give two
commas so if the revenue is greater than
999,000 I'll put it in the form at of
millions So within double quotes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another
hash and if the value is less than the
desired
number it should be 0 million let me
click on add all right you can see how
nicely we have formatted our data and
you see here we have
added the new format which is in
millions all right now if you want you
can go ahead and adjust
the boxes let me move this a bit up I'll
delete this now if you notice this line
chart you can make a few conclusions for
example if you see here in 2010 the
total revenue generated was nearly 175
million now this came down to 150
million in 2011
then the revenue constantly grew from
2011 till
2014 it reached 195 million and after
2014 it again came down to 180 million
and the revenue dropped significantly
between 2016 and
2017 in 2017 the revenue was just 96
million now before moving ahead to my
next chart let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write it as
Revenue by Year all
right
now let's analyze the revenue generated
each year in different regions so for
this we'll create another peot table let
me close this I'll click on any cell go
to insert and select pivote table I just
click okay so that my pivote table is
placed on a new sheet
all right now this time we want the
revenue by each year and region so first
of all let's drag region to
columns
then let's drag the order ear column
under rows and then I'll select total
revenue onto values so here you can see
we have the pivote table ready so for
2010 you can see in Asia this was was
the revenue generated similarly if you
see for
2013 this was the total revenue
generated in Europe and we have for
other years as well now let's create a
line chart based on this pivote table so
I'll select any cell in the pivote table
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
recommended charts from this list I'll
select my line chart and click on okay
there you go so we have our next pivote
chart
ready so on the right you see the
different regions that are present in
different colors let me just expand it
so that you can see all the regions we
have so in total we
have seven
regions and each of the regions have
been represented in different
colors so if you notice this
graph for the subsaharan African region
in
2012 subsaharan Africa met the highest
amount of
sales now from the sample data you can
also tell that the revenue for North
America has been significantly low
compared to other regions similarly if
you
see for
Europe This was the revenue Trend
between 2010 and 2017
so if you see here in 2011 the sales
were at this level then it significantly
dropped in
2012 then in
2013 there was a huge Spike and then in
again came down in 2015 and so on so you
can make your own conclusions by looking
at these line charts now let's format
this chart so first of all let's delete
the field buttons PR present on the
chart and we'll
also delete the Legend all right now let
me just reduce the size of the
chart next we'll add a chart title
so
will give the title as
Revenue
by year and
region okay
you can also format the Y AIS in terms
of
millions so I'll right click on this
access and I'll select format
access I'll scroll down and here we have
the number drop down let me scroll again
under category I'll select custom and I
will use this format that we created for
our previous chart there you go you can
see our access labels have been changed
in terms of millions now so let's close
this and let me save it now you can
reduce the font size or increase the
font size let me just show you suppose
you want to increase the font size of
the chart title so you just select it
and from here you can either reduce or
you can increase you can see now it's 12
if you want you can make it 16 similarly
you can also edit the access labels also
by selecting the chart title you can
also move it to left or right or you can
place it in the center as well for the
time being let me just keep it to the
left all right now we'll see the revenue
and total cost by each region and we'll
create a combo chart for this so let me
show you how to do it I'll go to my data
sheet I have my cell
selected go to insert and click on
pivote table let me just click on okay
all right so for this I'll select my
region on to
rows and
then I'll
have two columns under values the first
one is going to be total revenue and the
next column will be the total cost
column all right so here we have the
pivote table ready now based on this
pivote table let's create our pivote
chart chart so I'll go to recommended
charts and if you see below at the
bottom we have combo chart so this is
the preview of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay there you go so we have a nice
combo chart ready here now the way to
look at it is the bars represent the
total revenue which is this
column now the line represents
the total cost so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so first of all
let's delete the field buttons all right
and let's also remove the legend from
here next we'll add data labels so I'll
click on data labels here okay so these
are the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
now let's format the data labels in
terms of millions so I'll click on this
Arrow go to more options if I scroll
down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I'll choose my type that is in
millions all right so you can see we
have formatted our
data next thing we'll add a chart title
so here I'll write a
as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by
region before moving ahead let me rename
the sheets as well I'll write revenue
and total
cost similarly
sheet three also I'm going to rename it
as
Revenue
by year and
region so this makes your sheet more
readable all right now moving
ahead next we are interested to get the
revenue generated by order priority and
for this we are going to create a pie
chart
so let's go to the data sheet and create
our P table first and click on okay now
I'll select order priority under rows
and under values I'll select total
revenue so this is a very simple pivote
table so you have your order priority so
C is for critical H is for high L is for
low and M is for medium now based on
this let's create create a pie chart so
I'll go to recommended charts and here
you have pie chart I want to select this
3D type of pie chart and I'll click on
okay all right so we have our pie chart
ready let me just resize it and from
here I'll remove the field buttons and I
also don't need the legend so I'll
delete this as well all right now let's
give a chart title so this is going to
be
Revenue
by order
priority now let's add our data labels
I'll check this
option okay now let's again format this
in terms of
millions so
here I'll click on the last option I'll
go to numbers under category I'll select
custom and my type is going to be in
terms of millions there you go
let me close
this I will just move this to the
center all
right now if you want you can change the
color of the text as well so let's have
it in white color and see how it looks
okay so this looks pretty decent
cool now
moving to our next report so this
time we are going to find the total
revenue by countries so we have multiple
countries present in our data set we
want to visualize the revenue generated
in each country so for this we are going
to create a horizontal bar chart so let
me show you how to do it but before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
Revenue by I'll just put op which stands
for order priority all right now let's
create our horizontal bar chart I'll go
to insert click on pivote table and
select
okay so I want my Revenue based on
different count so I'll select country
and put it under rows and then I'll
choose total revenue and place it under
values so here you have the different
country names we have Afghanistan this
Albania let me scroll down you have
Bangladesh there
are a number of countries you have Czech
Republic there's Estonia France Gabon
similarly if you scroll down we have
India there's Jamaica Italy and all the
way to the bottom if you go we have New
Zealand this Netherlands Philippines
Portugal we also
have
Singapore lots and lots of
countries we have the UAE United States
of America Zimbabwe and
others all right let me go up so based
on this pivote table let's create our
pivote chart so I'll go to insert and
select recommended charts from here I'm
going to select the column chart you can
see the preview here and let me click on
okay all right so here you can
see the different country names at the
bottom and
the revenue for each of the countries
let's go ahead and edit this chart so
first of all I'll
delete the field buttons okay and let me
also remove the
legend here I'll write
Revenue
by
countries this is going to be my chart
title
okay let's format this chart a little
more so I'll click on this option and
we'll select a new style let's
say I'll
select style six okay and let me now go
under colors and we'll select the color
of the bars so let's choose this color
okay so you have
a horizontal column chart
ready and at the bottom you can see the
different country names and we have
the
revenue
cool now let me go ahead and rename this
sheet so I'll write Revenue
by
countries and hit enter okay
and finally we'll create another report
which is going to be part of our Revenue
dashboard and this is revenue by items
so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have Cosmetics
vegetables cereal fruits the cloths
snacks hous souls and other products as
well so let's check the revenue for each
of these items
so we'll continue the same drill I'll
create my P table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item type under rows and we'll have
the total revenue under values so here
on the left of the table you can see we
have the different item names and then
we have the total revenue so let me just
short this total
revenue from from largest to smallest so
you can see here office supplies meet
the highest amount of Revenue followed
by household then cosmetics and fruits
meet the lowest amount of
Revenue I'll click on this go to insert
and select recommended charts this time
I'm going to create a bar chart so this
is how my bar chart is going to look
like I'll select okay all right now
let's format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be
Revenue by items
cool we also want to change
the color of the bars so I've have
selected all the bars I'll go to my home
Tab and here let's say I want to select
green color all
right I've edited my chart a bit
now
let's make
it
14 and I'll remove the
Bold okay here if you want you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items
cool finally now it's time for us to
merge all the charts that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how you can create the dashboard
I'll create a new sheet and first thing
I'm going to do is
I'll click on The View Tab and uncheck
grid lines so this will remove the grid
lines present in the
worksheet next I'm going to insert an
image so we'll have a background image
on our dashb so the way to do is I'll go
to the insert Tab and under
illustrations I have the option to
select pictures or insert pictures so
I'm going to insert picture present on
the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit insert so this is
going to insert an image now let me just
drag this image so it covers a fenov
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can
still expand this background image a bit
to the right
cool now the next
thing is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle and I'm going to name this text
box as
Excel Revenue dashboard
on
Sals
I'll centraline
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see shape
format here I'm going to expand this
shape fill and I'll select no fill so my
text box is transparent now and I'll
also remove the outline all right now
let me just double click on the title of
my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica bold and
I'll increase the size to let's say
30 all right I'll just drag the text
box I'll make the text as white instead
of black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select
pictures I'm going to
add this two pictures which is of a
store and a
cart to make it look
visually appealing so I'll place the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place
the cart and the
store to the right as
well all
right
next the idea is
to bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
the dashboard so I'll hit control V to
paste
it and we'll resize this as
well all
right similarly let me bring in all the
other charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts our column charts the
combo charts the Spy chart and others
now let me go ahead and format these
charts a little more so you can see this
looks a bit cluttered so let's adjust
the lab
let me bring this down similarly I'll
bring 190
million a little
below all right this looks fine
now one more thing we are going to do
is we'll remove the white background
from each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart then I'll
right click and go to format chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here now
let's also remove the white outline that
we have so I'll select this chart go to
format and here I'll go to shape out
line and I'll select no outline you see
this so we have our total revenue by
year which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box so I'll go to insert and in
insert we have the option to create a
shape so I'll click on illustrations and
here I'll choose a shape and let me
select a rectangle so I
just create a rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose bring to
front and I'll place this
shape below it all right now the next
thing is to edit the shape so first I'll
change the color of this box so let me
select
this blue color and and let me increase
the transparency so I'll right click and
go to format shape here I'll increase
the transparency let's keep it to
25% or let's say 20% all right next
thing we'll just convert all the font to
white
color including the access label
the chart
title will
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just adjust
our chart over
here next thing let's just remove the
outline so I'll go to shape outline and
I'll select no outline you see we have
now formatted our chart let's just pull
this a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to white color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back
again all right so now you can see on
your screens we have nicely form added
our dashboard so I have added a few
logos for each of the charts you can see
the logos here so for Revenue by
countries we have a globe then if you
see here this is kind of a map or a
location similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the labels in terms of
Millions
if you look on the Y AIS even the
revenue for year and region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of millions so the way to do is
you can select this graph right click
and go to format
access here if I scroll down you have
numbers and under category I'll select
custom then I I'll select my type as
this format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our y-axis
labels all right so the next thing is to
add slicers and timelines to our
dashboard now slicers are used to format
your data based on a particular column
suppose if you want to see Revenue by
certain items you can add item as a
slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under filters we have slices and
timeline or if you go to the pivote
chart analyze tab here also you have
insert slicer and timeline option so
I'll select insert slicer here first now
it's giving me the list of fields
present in the data set so I'll select
country region and let's say we want
to know by item type and sales channel
so these are going to be my four slicers
and click on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for Country slicers and then for
item type also we have all the items
that were present in our data set
now moving ahead we need to connect all
the slicers to a dashboard
so what I'll do is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we
created you currently see only one of
the P table is selected so we need to
select all the peot tables so let me
check all the P tables present in this
workbook and click on okay all right now
that we have connected one of our
slicers we'll now connect the other
remaining slicers so I'll right click on
this go to report connections and I'll
check all the pivote tables present in
this worksheet click on okay similarly
let's do it for the country slicer I'll
go to report connections and let me
select all the pivote
tables and finally we have item type so
I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
P
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit so I'll
place my Pivot
tables to the
right I'll just reduce the
size let me scroll down
I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my final slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a
timeline all right now I have arranged
all my slicers
so let's say you want to find the
revenue that was generated for an item
type let's say beverages so you can just
select beverages here and all your
charts show the respective revenues so
you have the total revenue by year for
beverages
only similarly here you can see the
revenue by year and region only for
beverages item type if I scroll down
now this chart represents the revenue
that was generated in each of the
countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck
it all
right let's say you want to
see the revenue generated for a country
like India so I have selected India here
and now you can
see My Graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated based on sales channel
so we have two sales channel that is
offline and online suppose you want to
know the revenue generated offline so
I'll just select
offline you can see the values have
changed so these were the revenues
generated for each of the items only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions
so this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard on sales we created multiple
charts and graphs then we applied
different formatting we added different
icons then we formatted the labels also
next we added slicers and finally we saw
how we could filter our data based on
these
slicers likewise now we are going to
create a profit dashboard based on the
same data so before moving ahead let me
rename this sheet as Revenue dashboard
I'll write r
dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our pivot tables and
P charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivot table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart to visualize the profit for
each year so I'll drag my total profit
column to values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our prevote table ready now you can sort
this data to get an idea as to
which year had the highest profit and
which year had the lowest profit so from
this P table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order so
2004
had the maximum amount of profit and
2017 had the least amount of profit I'll
just do control Z to undo it all right
now based on this P table let me go
ahead and create my P chart so I'll go
to recommended charts and click on a
line chart so this is the preview of the
chart I'll click on okay let me close
this
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete
this let's do some more
formatting so I'll go to
style
and this
time I'm going to select
my style type okay and if you want you
can choose the colors as well for the
time being let's have this yellow color
next let me add the data labels so again
if you see here this is not formatted
properly so let's go ahead and format
the data labels so I'll click on
number and I'll select custom here
and the type I'm going to select is in
millions and I'll click on close so here
you can see we have
our line chart ready which shows total
profit by year let's rename this sheet
as
profit
by Year all right now let's move back to
our data sheet
again next we are going to
show the total profit by countries for
this I'm going to create a map so let me
first create my P table so I'll go to
insert and I'll click on pivote
table let me click on
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under rowes and then
I
have my total profit under
values the next thing I'm going to do is
I'll just rename the row labels as
countries
and then I'm going to delete the grand
total which you can see at the bottom so
here we have the grand total let me just
delete the grand total so I'm going to
select this pivot table go to the design
tab here we have sub totals and Grand
totals I'll switch off the grand total
let me just verify it again I'll scroll
down you see the grand total has gone
now all right now we want to create a
map out of this the way to do is I'm
going to select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here using this data I can
create my field map now so I'll go to
insert here we have the option to create
a field map there you go you can see we
have our map ready I can expand this now
as you can see
our map has a color scale which comes
from light gray color to dark blue color
so the countries that are in Gray or you
can say light blue have the lowest
amount of profit while the regions or
the countries that have been shaded
in dark color a dark blue color have
highest amount of profit I will go ahead
and delete this
scale okay next we need to connect this
map to the original data source so what
I'll do is I'll right click on this map
and I'll go to select data here instead
of the previous range I'll give my new
Range now so my new Range will be my
original P table that I had
created go on top and click on okay so
we have our map ready now now if you
want you can change the color of the
shade so I'll just C colors and let's
say we'll keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on next we want to create a pivote table
that will show us the profit by year and
sales channel so for this we are going
to create another line chart so I'll go
to insert and click on pivote table so
I'll select new worksheet here since I
want to know the profit by year first of
all I'll drag my order year column to
rows and then I'll choose my total
profit column under values next I'm
going to select my sales Channel under
columns there you go so we have our P
table here based on this P table let me
create my P chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and I'm going to
create a line
chart I close
this you see here based on this chart
you can tell the profit generated with
online sales were actually lower than
that of offline so here the Blue Line
represents offline profit and the Orange
Line represents Online Profit if you
Mark Clearly in year 2012 the Online
Profit was actually higher than the
offline profit so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so we'll delete
the field buttons I'll also delete the
legend for now let me go ahead and add a
chart title so I'll
write
profit by
year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
profit
by
countries
similarly let me rename this sheet as
profit
by year and let's say SC for sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivot table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only so this
is going to be a simple pie chart so
I'll first go to insert click on pivote
table and click on okay so I'll drag my
sales Channel under row and then we'll
have the total profit column under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other types of pie charts we
have okay so I'm going to select a donut
chart here I'll click on okay let's edit
this chart I'll remove the field buttons
let me now remove the legend as well
I'll just resize it and this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay let's also
add data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this
label I'll select the category as custom
and my type will be in millions okay let
me just move
this to the left and this to the right
okay let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit
by let's say see which stands for sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my total profit under
values and we'll also have the revenue
column so I'll put my Revenue at the top
then I'm going to
select item type under rows so here is
my pivote table based on this pivote
table let me now create a combo chart so
you can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this first let's remove the field
buttons let's also
remove the legend
here the we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit by
items okay if you want you can also go
ahead and change the color of the
bars so let me just
select one of these colors okay
all right so we have our five reports
ready that we are going to use for our
profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building our
dashboard so I'll click on a new sheet
let me just rename this as profit
dashboard all right we'll continue with
the previous drill so first of all let's
go to The View Tab and remove the grid
lines now we'll insert a background
image like we did for our Revenue
dashboard so I'll go to insert under
illustrations I'll click on pictures and
select this device I'm going to have the
same background I'll click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right now let's copy the title of my
profit dashboard so here you can see I
have brought my Revenue
dashboard and I'll copy the title and
the logos that we used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to
be
Excel profit dashboard instead of
Revenue now we'll copy each of the
charts that we just created for example
the revenue and profit by items then we
had profit by sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it
here and later on we can make the
adjustment copy this as
well similarly I'll bring the other
three charts onto my sales dashboard
okay so here on my profit dashboard I
have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I have
reduced the size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we also did for
the revenue dashboard first let's remove
the white background from all the charts
so I'll select the first chart I'll
right click and I'll click on format
chart area here under fill I'll select
no fill next I'm going to remove the
grid lines so I'll just delete it let me
close this now we also have a outline so
I'll go to
design actually format and I'll remove
the outline
next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here okay let me just
select the chart and I'll bring this to
front and I'll move
this to the
back next I'm going to change the font
color all to White so that that it's
clearly visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the x-axis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready the same I'm going to do for the
rest of the
charts okay so now you can see here I
have formatted all my charts I've also
added a blue
background you see here I have also
formatted the vbls in terms of mill I
which is actually the profit similarly
here I have added the data labels this
is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red represents online
similarly here you have the Legends I've
also formatted the map as
well okay now the next thing is to make
this dashboard more inter active so
we'll add our slicers as well as
timeline first let me show you how to
add a timeline so I'll select one of the
charts and I'll go to insert under
insert I have the option to create a
timeline so I'll
just click on
timelines so timeline is actually based
on date columns so since in our data set
we only have two date columns one is
order date and one is ship date so Excel
has only
shown us two columns so I'm going to
create my timeline based on order date
so I'll select my order date column and
I'll click on okay you can see here this
is called a timeline I can expand this
now this timeline is based on months now
now if I scroll this timeline you can
see here I have my order year 2010 and I
have all the 12 months similarly we have
for 2011 then we have for
2012 all the way till 20
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till
2017 let me just squiz this and I'll
place it somewhere here on the
right now let me go ahead and create a
few slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on slicer
you can see it gives me the list of
columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create a region let me
also select
country let's say I
want the representatives name or the
customer's name and I'll click on okay
so here I have created three
slicers let
me first resize it and I'll place
it on the
right similarly I'll place the country
column
also then we have the region
slicer I'll resize this and I'll bring
it here okay the next thing we need to
do is I have to connect all the slicers
and the timeline to the pivot tables for
the profit dashboard so I'm going to
click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivote tables that are
related to
profit so here I have selected four and
I need one more which is po table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region filter to
all the P tables so I right click go to
report connections
here I'll choose all my pivote tables
which are based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the country slicer as
well click on okay and similarly I'll
connect my timeline as well I'll go to
report
connections and I'll
select all the pivote tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the Poo charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective peot
tables that are based on
profit click on
okay now let me just bring it here all
right the next thing I want to show is
how are we going to use the timeline
first so you see we have all
the years here from 2010 till
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the year
2012 so I'll just click on this range
and and now you can see our charts only
show information for 2012 so this dot
represents that was 51 million profit in
the year 2012 similarly you can see
here the profit by sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in
2012 if I scroll down you can see the
revenue and profit by items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can
see our profit by year and sales channel
for offline and online you can see the
map or the line chart for total profit
by year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in 20 13
similarly our map has also changed now
this is a sort of an information that we
have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted all right so this is how you
can use a timeline now as I said we
checked by years you can also see it for
months and quarters as
well let me just uncheck
it I'll send it back to the place where
it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam Churchill this is
the profit generated by Adam
Churchill
similarly you can select multiple
persons as well now suppose you want to
see the profit by different countries so
you can use the country slicer let me
just bring this to the middle and let's
expand our chart a
bit okay so here you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for all the items
that was sold in United Kingdom so you
had beverages cloths household office
supplies you can see clearly office
supplies item meet the highest amount of
profit in united king Kingdom now you
can also select multiple countries let's
say I want to know for France as well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United Kingdom and France selected
and the other charts present in my
dashboard change accordingly now I have
my country selected as India you can see
the map of India
here and and these were the respective
profit values now one thing to note here
is this is actually not millions that
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as thousand and not in
millions even for this this is actually
K and not
million all right so we have
successfully created our second
dashboard that is on profit
let me just resize this a bit and we'll
place it where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
peot tables and poot charts and then we
formatted our po charts based on our
requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes so here you can select
different themes currently we are with
the office theme now let me just select
another theme let's say fa it you see
the colors have changed and it
looks really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and select
whatever theme suits the best all right
now let me just move back to my Revenue
dashboard and see how it looks there you
go so since we changed our theme even
our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects all right so in this demo we saw
how to create a RW R new dashboard so we
created line charts this combo chart pie
chart horizontal and vertical bar charts
and then we learned how to add slicers
and connected to different pivote tables
and we filtered our data to see Revenue
as well as profit by items by countries
by different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map and log
more let's quickly see some more
examples of doing data analysis using
Excel and for that we can use some
inbuilt addins which can be added to our
Excel sheet so for example if you would
want to do a descriptive analytics or
descriptive analysis on your data say
for example getting your descriptive
statistics such as your mean median mode
and so on so we can do that and we can
use Excel for it so for example you can
if you are given some data say I have
temperature price of ice cream unit sold
and I would want to have descriptive
statistics on this what I can do is I
can click on file and here in file you
can click on options and within options
click on addin now within addin you have
Excel addin which is selected here so
click on say go for example and that
shows what add-ins are available and you
can choose which ones are you interested
in so for example I have chosen analysis
tool pack and solver addin and click on
okay now that basically should add more
options to your Excel so if you click on
data so here you see data analysis and
solver and this is what we would want to
use to get our descriptive statistics
for these three columns so for example
let's say
temperature or you can even give the
names later once you get your
descriptive statistics so for example
let's go for data analysis and here it
says what are you interested in there is
a two factor with replication you have
correlation co-variance descriptive
statistics you have histogram so let's
click on descriptive statistics click on
okay now this one basically asks your
input range so while your cursor is
blinking here also it is said grouped by
so let's give it a range so for example
I will say say
temperature now if I do this and I have
selected The Heading just look at that
and now you need an output range so
let's just select this and then you can
have your cursor blinking in here let's
select say Fields here and this is where
I would want the output now it also said
what options do you want so it has
output range we can then select summary
statistics confidence level so I will
say summary statistics is what I'm
interested in say okay and this says
input input range contains nonn numeric
data now why is that because we chose
temperature The Heading also so click on
okay and here we will alter the range so
this one is our range should be only the
values numeric values on which we would
want the descriptive statistics we have
output range already selected we have
summary statistics and now you can click
on okay and that basically gives your
descriptive statistics for temperature
so here I could basically given a value
for this so I can say temperature and
that's my descriptive statistics for
temperature might be I can just do some
formatting and that's it so that gives
me descriptive statistics for the values
here now similarly we can do it for
price of ice cream so what we need is we
need to basically go for
data data analysis descriptive
statistics say okay now you need to give
a range so here I will change my range
to these values output range is already
selected now we are interested in
summary statistics click on okay and
this says output range will overwrite
existing data press okay to overwrite
data in range I will say cancel no
that's not what we want to do we need to
give a new Range so let's select our new
range which is here and now click on
okay so now we get the values which is
for your price of ice cream so again we
can basically select this and say price
of ice
cream and we got our descriptive
statistics for price of ice cream and
like we did earlier I can select this I
can basically do a merge and center and
that gives me descriptive statistics for
price of ice cream so we could also
basically change this now I can go into
data and I can go into Data
analysis descriptive statistics so we
know that we had selected this B2 to B8
and this one which is H6 to h19 we would
want to shift it might be two columns up
so might be I can just say
H5 and I can manually change change it
to H 17 and let's say
okay and we will basically get this and
I can get rid of this so I can have it
in the same range so similarly so this
one will have to be renamed and I can
basically say price of ice
cream and that's basically my
descriptive statistics for my price of
ice
cream and similarly we can do it for the
third column which is units sold so we
would want to have this now let's see we
can click on data we can click on data
analysis descriptive statistics so we
need to give the range correctly so this
time our range changes to units sold now
we can also say labels in first row okay
if we were selecting The Heading so
let's do in this way so in my range in
my range let me empty this I can
basically select this which we know has
non-numeric data in the first row say
for example I'll say labels in first row
I'm interested in summary statistics and
this range will now have to be changed
from H to basically something like J so
let's say J and let's select these
values so that should take care of
things and now you see you have your
units sold you did not have to manually
rename it and you have basically got the
descriptive statistics so this is how
you can simply perform analysis using
data analysis here you can basically get
your descriptive statistics for your
columns and then you can do whatever
needed formatting you need to basically
make your data look in a good way now
let's look at one more example of data
analysis where we may want to look at
the frequency of values or frequency of
values occurring in a range of values so
for example if you have been given
temperatures you have been given some
pins where you would want to identify
how many values fall into the range of 0
to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 and the
easiest way to do that would be creating
histogram now histogram is usually used
for data analysis where you would want
to look at different variables or say
features for example temperature is one
such feature might be there might be one
more variable or feature such as sale of
ice cream and you would want to see if
the increase or decrease in temperature
affects the increase or decrease in s
sale of ice cream might be sale of ice
cream is a is a response based on
temperature so it depends so sometimes
you may want to find a relationship
between two variables whether they are
positively or negatively related or you
would want to do different kind of
analysis and in certain cases we may
want to First do analysis on one single
variable look at the frequency of values
might be also look at the defects and
for which we can use something like par
chart so we can go for histogram and
that basically gives us the frequency of
values now how do we do that so we have
already added
the addin which is data analysis earlier
so we can just use the same thing again
here we would want to create a histogram
so let's say okay now I have already
selected input range so if you see here
my input range is temperature which is
also with the headings and I have bin
range which is basically the range of
values so for example I can select this
and that's my bin range I am selecting
or the option labels because I'm using
the first row which has the heading such
as temperature and pins now we need to
give a output range so for example let's
say I would want my data here and that
becomes my output range so you can have
a sorted histogram or basically a par
chart so if that's what you're
interested in looking at the frequencies
for your different ranges and here I'm
also selecting chart output because I
would want to have a visual histogram
which gives us the frequency and it's as
simple as this just click on okay and
now you get your pins so it basically
tells you frequency of values which is
basically 20 but that does not mean it
is only talking about the values 20 it
is basically talking as a range of 0 to
20 so we have 0 to 20 that is two so we
can basically say there is one 12 here
with the 20 being the maximum value and
then there is one more 20 so that's your
0 to 20 then you have 20 to 30 which
shows three values so might be in that
case I can say
26 is one thing then I can say 30 that's
the second one and then basically I can
look at 22 so basically this one does
not select 20 as the lower range but it
basically selects 30 as the higher range
so I do see 20 to 30 there are three
entries similarly we can see values of
40 and 50 and since we have selected
parto or sorted histogram that shows in
a descending order what is the highest
frequency
of values within a particular
range so that shows me highest frequency
is five and then you have three and
three and then two so this is how we can
create a histogram and we can perform
analysis on a single variable now as
discussed earlier as I said sometimes we
may be interested in finding out the
correlation between different variables
such as say here we have temperature
price of ice cream and units sold and we
may want to find out the correlation
between one variable to another variable
or we would want to find out the
relationship between variables are they
linearly related are they positively
related negatively related and so on and
for that we can use the
correlation of your data analysis add in
so for example you want to find
correlation of temperature and units
sold and what we can do is we can find
out that using a formula so for example
if I search for something like Co
relation and let's search so there is a
function called correlation which we can
use and we can use this to calculate the
correlation of temperature and units
sold so for example let's select this
and that's the function so it says give
me an first array and and a second array
so we are interested in finding out
correlation of temperature and units
sold so let's select the range of values
for temperature and then I'm interested
in finding out the correlation of
temperature and units sold so let's
select this and that basically gives me
a range of values it gives me the
correlation value which is
2859 say okay and that's your value so
similarly we can do it for temperature
and price ice cream so let's go
for correlation so that's the function
we are interested in you need to give a
range of value so here we are interested
in temperature and price of ice cream so
let's select temperature and then the
second array or list of values is price
of ice cream let's select that let's
close our bracket and here we have the
correlation value of temperature and the
price of ice cream similarly you may be
interested in finding out temperature
and units sold like what we have done
earlier so we can do the same thing
based on function so this is same as
correlation of temperature and unit sold
so I can get rid of this one now how do
I do it using the data analysis add in
so for that what we need is we need to
go into Data we need to go click on data
analysis and here you have the option
called code correlation let's select
this now that basically needs an input
range so we need the range now I might
be interested in finding out the
correlation between temperature and
price of ice cream and units sold so
I've selected all the columns here we
will say Group by columns obviously we
need to select labels in first row
because that is basically taking care of
the first row is heading now output
range you can just give one simple cell
and that's where your data will start
from or you can give a new workbook so
click on okay and that basically gives
you that basically gives you correlation
of your different variables and what are
the values and we can check these values
based on the values what we have here so
we have basically temperature and price
of ice cream
and that basically shows me
96149 you have temperature and units
sold so you have
2859 now you can also look at units sold
and say for example price of ice cream
you can look at these particular values
so if I would be interested in finding
out what is the relationship between
these variables I can easily find using
correlation so I could be basically WR
writing in a formula here and selecting
what are the cells so here we were
selecting A2 and C here we were
selecting A and B now might be I'm
interested in price of ice cream and
units sold and if that's what I'm
interested in then I will give a range
of B2 to B8 C2 to C8 and similarly you
can get your analysis or correlation
values so it's very symbol in Excel and
you can use either the data analysis Tab
and get your correlation or you can use
formulas and do that now one more
important part of data analysis is doing
your sampling now sampling could be
periodic sampling or random sampling so
sometimes you may want to look at a
variable and you may want to get some
values based on periodic data that means
might be I'm interested in range of
values I'm interested in seeing a sample
of values for uh a particular period
which could be
basically uh a range of values or you
could just do a random sampling so for
example if I go for periodic sampling so
out of these values which I see here
might be I want to see say periodic
sampling that is a frequency of two
values how many times we have these
values occurring here or I would go for
random sampling so basically randomly I
would want to pick up say three
temperature values now how do I do it so
for example here I have seven values now
if I go for periodic sampling the sample
or periodic sample value which I need to
give has to be lesser than the total
input value values so for example we can
do this let's go in here and let's go
for data analysis so we can go for
sampling here click on okay and that
needs a range of values so we will
select A2 to A8 now I could have
selected all the values for this one
temperature and in that case I can give
labels which is going to take care of
the first row now here we can go for
number of samples which you are
interested in or giving a period so
let's go for period and say for example
I have seven values so what if I select
five so for example if I say five that
means I could just get one value so
basically when I'm saying five out of
seven so that's just giving me out of
five I want one value so I can then just
give an output range so here I can
basically select this cell I'll say okay
and now you see it just shows me one
value so out of the first range that is
I have said five it has given me the
fifth value that's your periodic
sampling so for example we want more
values so let's reduce this period to
might be two which basically gives me
every second value so I can basically
say
for example two and say okay and then
say okay so that shows me
26 then you have 35 then you have 40 and
then well this one does not have any
more values so that's your periodic
sampling now if you go for random
sampling that's basically randomly
picking up values and you can choose how
many values you want so go for data
analysis go for sampling I'll go for
number of samples how many you want so
for example out of seven values randomly
I want three values and I can just give
this say okay and then we will do a
cancel because we need to change that
range so let's select this and say okay
and that gives me random three values
from this values of temperature so we
can use Excel to do a simple sampling
and we can choose whether we would want
to go for want to be a certified data

description box hello everyone and
welcome to this interesting video
tutorial by simply loan today we're
going to perform two Hands-On projects
on covid data analysis using Python and
tblo this is going to be a really
interesting and fun session where I'll
be asking you a few generic quiz
questions related to Corona virus please
make sure to answer them in the comment
section of the video we'll be happy to
hear from you covid or Corona virus is
an ongoing Global pandemic of Corona
virus disease that emerged in 2019 and
was first identified in Wuhan China it
is defined as an illness caused by a
novel Corona virus called severe acute
respiratory syndrome Corona virus 2
commonly known as SARS Cove 2 on March
11 2020 the wh declared covid-19 a
global Health Emergency the virus has so
far infected over 22 CR people and
killed more than 4.5 million Innocents
in India there have been over 3.3 CR
confirmed cases and nearly 4 lak 41,000
deaths have been reported so
far this data is according to official
figures released by The Union Ministry
of Health and Family welfare
as the world tries to cope up with this
deadly virus we request all our viewers
and their family members to follow all
the necessary precautions to avoid
getting
infected quiz
time now let's see our first quiz in
this
project what does Corona in Corona virus
mean here are the options is it a
beer B respiratory is it C crown or is
it d sun this is a very generic question
I'm sure a lot of you may already know
some of you may
not please let us know your answers in
the comment section of the video we'll
be glad to hear from
you now in this video we will use three
different covid-19 data sets and perform
data analysis using Python and tblo the
project will give you hands-on
experience working on real world data
sets and how you can use the different
python libraries to analyze and
visualize data and draw conclusions you
will learn how to create different plots
in Tableau and and then make a dashboard
from the visuals the project will give
you an idea about the impact of Corona
virus globally in terms of confirmed
cases deaths
reported the number of recoveries as
well as Active
cases we will also see how India has
been affected since the pandemic started
and dive into the different states and
union territories to learn more about
the covid-19 influence and the
vaccination stos first let me show you
the two data sets that we'll be using so
for our first project using python we'll
be using the first two data sets
covid-19 India and covid vaccine
statewise let me open the two data
sets Okay so this is the first data set
you can see here we have the date we
have the time then we have the different
state names let scroll down you can see
we have Kerala Tamil Nadu Delhi harana
Rajasthan this ladak Punjab Telangana
and other states then we have something
called as confirmed Indian national so
actually this two data sets confirmed
Indian national and confirmed foreign
National we won't be using so in the
demo itself we'll be dropping these two
columns what we are concerned about are
the last three columns the cured cases
or the recoveries the number of deaths
reported and then we have the total
number of confirmed cases let me just
sort the B column that is the date
column so that you have an idea about
the recent data we have I'll continue
with the current selection and sort it
you can see here this is till 11th of
August
2021 so this data was collected from Kel
it has some descries that we will see in
the demo the data is available for free
we will provide the link to the data
sets in the description of the video so
please go ahead and download them the
visualizations and results that you will
see in the demo are based on the data
sets that we'll be using we haven't
pre-processed the data to remove
outliers or any missing
values now before I jump into the demo
let me show you the second data set that
we are going to use okay so covid
vaccine statewise is my second data set
let me open it there you go
so this is the second data said that
we'll be using in the python project you
can see we have a column called updated
on then we have the state again you can
see here there are a few discrepancies
here uh it has taken the country name
and not the state name below you can see
there are the different state
names
and you can also see we have information
about the total doses administered we
have the sessions sites first do
administered then we have the second
dose then we have information about male
and female doses can see here the
different vaccines administered
covaccine and coov shield you have
Sputnik V and here are the different age
groups as well and finally if you see we
have male individuals vaccinated the
total number of female individuals
vaccinated for a particular day we have
information about transgender
individuals vaccinated and finally we
have the total individuals vaccinated
each day all right before we jump into
the Hands-On part let's have a look at
the second quiz in this
project so here is the second quiz
question which is the first country to
start covid vaccination for toddlers is
it a Japan B Israel C Portugal or is it
D Cuba this is a very recent development
ment that took place if you watch Daily
News updates on Corona virus you'll be
definitely able to answer the question
please give it a try and put your
answers in the comment section of the
video it is really important for our
viewers to know the right
answer all right so now let's begin with
our
demo so I am on my jupyter notebook so
the first project we are going to use
Python jupyter notebook I'll just rename
this notebook as
covid data
analysis
project I'll click on
rename all right so first and foremost
we need to import all the necessary
libraries that we are going to use so
first I'm importing pandas as PD this is
for data manipulation then we have nump
as NP nump is used for numerical
computation then we are importing
matplot lib cbon and plotly these three
libraries will be used for plotting our
data and creating interesting
visualizations finally I'm also
importing my date time function all
right so I'll hit shift enter to run the
first cell now it's time to load our
first data set which is related
to the covid-19 cases in India for the
different states and union territories
so I'll create a variable called coore
DF DFS for data frame I'll use my pandas
library and
then give the read CSV function since
our data sets are CSV files and inside
double codes I'll pass in the location
where my data sets are present so I'll
just copy this
location I'll paste it
here we'll change
the back slash to forward
slash and after that I'm going to give
my file name followed by the extension
of the file I'll say
co9 india.
CSV let's go ahead and run it all right
now to see the first few rows of the
data frame I'm going to use the head
function I'll say head and within
brackets let's say I'll pass in 10 which
means I want to see the first 10 rows of
data if I run it there you go here you
can see from zero till 9 so we have 10
rows of information and these are the
different column names you have S number
date time state or Union territory then
you have confirmed Indian national
confirmed foreign National
cured cases deaths reported and the
confirmed
cases all right now moving ahead let's
use the info function to get some idea
about a data
set if I run it you can see here it
gives us the total number of columns we
have nine columns the total number of
entries or the rows we have 18,0 rows of
information starting from 0 till
18,19 you see here the different types
of variables or column names that we
have then it has information about the
memory usage as
well and this side you can see the data
types
cool now we'll use another very
important function which is to
get some idea about statistical analysis
the basic statistics about your data set
for that I'll be using the describe
function okay so if you can see
here the describe function is for
numerical columns only and you have the
measures such as count the mean standard
deviation maximum minimum the 25th
percentile 50th percentile and the 75th
percentile
value okay now let's move ahead and UT
the second data set which is related to
vaccination so I'll create a variable
called vacc inore DF I'll write PD
do read CSV function which is present in
pandas Library I'll move to the top and
I'll copy the file location and we'll
change the name of the file copy this
and let me paste it here and instead of
coore 19 _ India I'm going to say
covid
underscore
vaccine underscore
statewise okay so this is the data set
that we saw coore vaccine uncore
statewise all right let me run
it
cool and let's display the first seven
rows of information from this data
frame I'll be using the head function
and inside the function I'll pass in
7 there you go so here you can see we
have from 0 till 6 there are total 24
columns a lot of them have null values
you can see
here all
right
now from the First Data set which is
the coore DF data frame we'll be
dropping a few
unnecessary columns such as the time
column confirmed Indian national and
confirmed foreign National as well as
the s number we don't need these columns
so it's better to learn how to drop the
columns for our
analysis so I'll see
coore DF
dot I'll use the drop
function and within square brackets I'll
pass in the column names the first is s
number I'll give a
comma within double quotes I'll see the
next column is time my third column that
I want to drop is
confirmed Indian
national give another comma within
double quotes I'll say
confirmed foreign
National outside the square brackets
I'll give another comma and pass in my
next
argument that is in place equal to I'll
say
true I'll give another comma and say
axis equal to
1 let's run it
okay it has thrown an error let's debug
the error says confirmed Indian okay it
should be Indian national and not Indian
Nation I'll
just mention it as National we'll run it
again okay now we
have removed these four
columns let me show you the data set now
there you go so we have only the date
column state or Union territory cured
Debs and
confirmed now let's see how you can
change the format of
the date column for that you have the
function called to date time I'll say
coore
DF I'll pass in my column name that is
date I'll say equal
to PD
dot I'll use the pandas function that is
2core date
time I'll say coore DF which is my data
frame
name pass in my variable which is
date give a
comma and I'll use my argument that is
format equal
to I'll say percentage
y give a dash say percentage M give
another Dash and say percentage
D let's run it and I'll
print the head of the data
frame
cool now moving
ahead now we will see how to find the
total number of active cases so Active
cases nothing but the total number of
confirmed cases minus the sum of cured
cases plus deaths
reported so
let's find the Active cases I'll give a
comment
okay I'll first write
my data frame name that is coore
DF within square brackets I'll give my
new column which is
activecore cases
I'll say equal
to Kore
DF and My First Column would
be the confirmed KES
column
minus I'll say coore
DF then I'll pass in my Cod colum
plus I'll again
say Co WID underscore
DF and add my deaths
column this time let's print the
last five rows from the new data frame
that we have
created okay let's run it okay it has
thrown an error let's debug
it says data frame object has no
attribute take this should be
teal there you
go can see here we have added a new
column called Active cases which is the
confirmed cases minus the sum of cured
and deaths reported
column now we will learn how to create a
pivot table using the Panda's Library so
in this table we'll be summing all the
confirmed deaths and cured cases for
each of the states and union territories
so we'll be using the pcore table
function for
this I'll create a variable called
statewise and say PD
dot I'll use the pivote uncore table
function I'll pass in
my data frame that is coore
DF and then we give my
values parameter inside the square
brackets I'll pass in
my columns
confirmed
deaths and then we'll have
the cured
column we give a comma and next argument
would be
index which is going to to be my state
slash the union territory
column let me bring this to the next
line so it is more
readable I'll say Union
territory I
will give a comma
Now and pass in my last argument which
is
AG function that means aggregate
function
and this function would be
Max all
right let's run
it okay now I'm going to find out the
recovery rate so recovery rate is
basically the total number of cured
cases divided by the total number of
confirmed cases into 100 so I'll
say statewise
and within square brackets
I'll pass in my variable that I want to
create which is recovery
rate this will be equal
[Music]
to
the Cur
cases multiplied by
100 by the total number of
confirmed
cases within square brackets I'll give
my column as
confirmed let's run this okay I'll just
copy this column paste it here so this
time we are going to find out the
mortality rate so mortality rate is
nothing but the total number of deaths
divided by the total number of confirmed
cases into 100 so I'm just going
to replace the names here I'll say
mortality all right and then instead of
cured I'll say my deaths column into 100
divided by the confirmed cases let's run
it okay
now we are going to sort the values
based on the confirmed cases
column and we'll sort it in descending
order so let me show you how to do it
I'll say statewise equal
to I'll use the function sore values
so I'll pass in my variable statewise
Dot and use the short
underscore values function I'll say by I
want to sort it by my
confirmed cases
column give a call comma and I'll say
ascending equal
to
false let's run
it now we are going to plot our pivote
table using a
nice visual so for that I'm going to
use my background underscore gradient
function and inside that function we'll
pass in our cmap
parameter I'll show you how to do
it say style
dot
background underscore
gradient and inside this we'll pass in a
parameter called cmap so cmap stands for
color Maps this is present inside the
matplot lib Library so here you can see
there's a nice documentation on choosing
color maps in matplot lip this is
provided by matplot lp.org
if I scroll down you can see there are a
number of c maps that you can use
purples Blues you have something called
Reds there are other things like magma
you have summer autumn spring winter
cool all these you can use whichever
color map that you want and here you can
see the different
Shades or the
gradients
okay so I'm going to use my color map as
cube
Helix let me run it and show you the
pivote
table there you go here you can see we
have our pivote table
ready now as I said in the beginning
there are a few discrepancies in the
data set so here you can see
there's one called Maharashtra and
there's also Maharashtra Triple
Star this you can ignore even if I
scroll down you have madhia Pradesh
followed by three asri you can ignore
this value as well even for Bihar we
have so these have been
duplicated and here you can see the
different state names and Union
teritories then on the top you have the
confirmed cases cured cases the deaths
reported and the new columns that we
created these are calculated columns
recovery rate and mortality
rate and we have ordered it
in descending order of confirmed cases
so so
far our data says that Maharashtra has
the highest number of cases followed by
Kerala Karnataka Tamil Nadu Andra
Pradesh and utar Pradesh so these are
the top five states which have the
highest number of confirmed cases even
if you see the mortality rate is also
high for
Maharashtra
and if I scroll down the mortality rate
is also high for utarak if you see
here if I scroll further you have Punjab
the mortality rate is also
High all
right so this was our
first visual that we created in the co
data analysis project now moving ahead
we'll see
the top 10 states based on the number of
active
cases so we'll
start I'll give a comment top
10
Active cases
States
okay so we're going to explore another
very important pandas function in this
which is known as Group
by so I'll
first pass in my data frame which is
coore
DF dot followed by the group by
function I'm going to group my data
based
on state SL Union territory
column then I'll say
do Max which is to find
the maximum value from the
states that
have the highest Active cases so I have
passed in my Active cases
column and we're also going to group
it based on the date
column after that we we going to sort
the values so I'll use my function that
is
sortore
values I'll say short
by my column that
is Active
cases let me bring this to the next
line
underscore
cases I'll give a comma and
say ascending equal
to
false say dot and
then reset my
index for that I'll use reset uncore
index
function okay let's check if everything
is fine I have missed a square bracket
here let me give another square bracket
here
okay and all this we are going to store
in
our variable called top underscore 10
underscore
active underscore
cases okay now let me go ahead and run
this cell okay there
is a syntax error
here now let's run it okay
now I'll create another variable called
fig here we pass in the PLT which is for
matplot Leb library and we give the
figure
size using
the Fig size
argument say equal to and within a
topple and passing the size let's say 16
comma 9
we'll run
it okay
and let's
give a title to our plot so here we are
going to create a bar
plot
so using PLT do tile we'll pass in the
title let's say top 10
states with
most Active cases in
India I'll give a comma and pass in the
size of my title that's a
25 okay you can see we are
slowly being able
to create our graph the most important
thing is to pass in the xaxis and the y
axis I'll say ax which is for
axis to pass in the axis I'm going to
use the barplot function that is present
inside the cbor
Library I'll say SNS do
barplot I'll say data equal
to my variable which is top _ 10
underscore
States this is actually active
States all right and now I'm going to
use the iock
function and take the first 10 states so
I'm using a colon and then giving 10 as
my value I is for index
location I'll give a comma and see my y
AIS To
Be Active
cases give another comma and say my my
x-axis to
be
state
slash Union
territory give another comma we're going
to pass in the line
width to two let say line width equal to
two and we'll give an edge
color let's say the edge color
is
red okay so I have my AIS defined now
let's run
it there's an error here it says stopped
in active States not
found let's go to the stop and see the
exact okay so this is top 10 Active
cases let me change it
to cases
here now run it okay the x-axis also has
some stake this should be State /un
territory now let me run it there you go
we have
our plot created but as you can see here
the labels of the different states and
union territories are overlapping so for
that let me first pass in the X labels
I'll say PLT
dox
label and my
X label would be
States then I'll see PLT do y
Lael my y label will have the
total Active
cases and finally I'll write PLT do show
before I run it let's collate all the
lines of code that we have written for
our top 10 states for most active cases
in IND into one cell so what I'll do is
I'll just copy
this and we'll keep
adding in this cell
itself
okay I'll go to the top next we'll copy
my figure
size and
we'll paste it
here next let's take
the title and put it
here give us
piece and we are going to
copy this cell and I'll paste it
here all
right now it's time to run
it there you go you see it
here we have a nice bar plot ready on
the top you can see the title top 10
states with most active cases and you
see see the edges are in red color for
all the bars on the xaxis you have the
different state names Maharashtra
Karnataka Kerala we also have Andra
Pradesh Gujarat West Bengal and chattis
Gad so as you can see Maharashtra has
the highest number of active cases based
on our data followed by Karnataka Kerala
and Tamil Nadu at second third and
fourth place respectively and in the
ninth place we have West Bengal in the
10th place we have chattis Gad
on the y axis you can see the total
Active cases which are in
lacks okay now moving ahead now we'll
see the top 10 states based on the total
number of deaths reported so I'll give a
comment top states
with
highest
deaths Okay so so I'll first create my
variable saying top
10or
TS this will be very similar
to what we did here just that we need to
change a few column names so instead of
Active cases we'll be using
deaths
okay so I'll start with my data frame
that is coore DF followed by using the
group by function and I want to group my
data based
on the state
slash Union territory
column then I'll choose the max
function and
within double square brackets I'll pass
in my column names
deaths and
date let's make it consistent I'll be
using single
Cotes okay I'll say
dot going
to short my result therefore I'm using
the sore values function I want to short
it
by deaths
column I'll give another comma and
say ascending equal to false which means
I want to order my result
in descending
order then I'll say do reset
index
okay after that I'll give
my figure size I'll say PLT do
figure and within brackets I'll pass in
my argument which is fig size equal to
using a tle I'll say 18 comma let's say
5 now let's give a title for that I'll
use the title function which is present
in the mat plot lab Library I'll say top
10 states with
most
deaths and let's give a size to the
title
25 now it's time for us to give the
access labels I just scroll down
okay so I'll say ax equal
to again this will be a bar plot so I'm
using my cbon library followed by the
barplot
function my data will be
top _ 10 uncore deaths which is this
variable I'll
give my index location i
l I'm going to choose
12 States the reason being there are
some discrepancies in the data I'll show
you once I plot this result so in the y
axis we'll
have deaths
column in the x-axis we'll
take state
slash Union
territory okay here I'll give another
comma and
say line
width equal to
2 and we'll give an edge color to our
bars like we did
here so I'll say Edge color equal to
let's
say
black okay
now finally we'll give
the X label the Y
label so I'll say PLT do X label X label
would be
States my y
label will
be total death
cases then I'll write PLT do
show now let's run
it there you go you can see here we have
a nice bar plot on the top we have the
title top 10 stats with most deaths now
what I specifically wanted you to see
was these discrepancies in the data you
can see here Maharashtra is repeated
twice even in our data that we collected
from Keel Karnataka spelling has an
error you can see here we have a few
rows of information where Karnataka is
spelled as k a r a a n instead of k a r
n a all right so
to
remove these two results or to ignore
these two results I had given my index
location till 12 so we have Maharashtra
Karnataka Tamil Nadu Delhi then utar
Pradesh West Bengal Kerala Punjab Andra
Pradesh and
chatard with the states that have the
most number of deaths reported
okay now we'll create a line plot to see
the growth or the trend of Active cases
for top five states with most number of
confirmed cases so the states are
Maharashtra Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu
and utar Pradesh I can show you so these
are the states with highest number of
active
cases okay hello everyone welcome to
today's video tutorial by simply
in this video we are going to perform a
really interesting data analysis using
python on the Spotify music streaming
service platform data set I'll also be
asking you a few questions related to
Spotify during our discussion please
make sure to answer them in the comment
section of the video so now let's get
started Spotify is a Swedish audio
streaming and media services provider
founded in April
2006 it is the world's largest music
streaming service provider and has over
3 381 million monthly active users which
also includes 172 million paid
subscribers the total number of
downloads on the Spotify app in the
Android store exceeded 1 billion in May
2021 so millions of people listen to
music all day even I'm hooked to music
as an analyst what's better than
exploring and quantifying data about
music and drawing valuable insights
before I move ahead I have a quiz
question for you people the name Spotify
comes from a combination of two words so
which are those two words please let us
know your thoughts in the comment
section below I would like to repeat the
question again the name Spotify comes
from a combination of two words so what
are those two words we would love to
hear from you so please put your answers
in the comment section
below now let's use Python libraries and
functions to analyze and visualize our
data set first I'll show you the two
data sets that we'll be using
so here is the first data set that we'll
be using for our demo and then I have my
second data set called Spotify features
which is essentially about the geners of
the different
soundtracks now these data sets have
been downloaded from kel.com now the
Links to the data sets have been
provided in the description box please
go ahead and download them now let me
just go ahead and brief you about the
columns that are present in our first
data set which is about tracks we have
our column A which is ID this is the
unique ID for each of the songs then we
have the name column which is
essentially the name of the song then we
have a column for popularity so the
popularity ranges from 0 to 100 then we
have duration in milliseconds this is
the duration of the track in
milliseconds next we have a column
called explicit now we are not bothered
about this column because we are not
going to use it in our
analysis then we have artist so the name
of the artist who has composed or sung
the song then we have ID of the artist
then we have a column for release date
which is basically the date on which the
song was released then we have a column
for danceability so this describes how
suitable a track is for dancing based on
a combination of musical elements such
as Tempo Rhythm stability be strength
and overall regularity the value ranges
between 0 and
1 next we have a column for energy so
the energy is a measure between 0.0 to
1.0 and represents a perceptual measure
of intensity and activity typically the
energetic tracks feel fast loud and
noisy higher the value the more
energetic is the song then we have a
column for key so key is the pitch notes
or scale of song that that forms the
basis of a song there are 12 Keys
ranging from 0 to
11 moving ahead we have loudness so the
overall loudness of the track in decb it
ranges from - 60 to 0
DB then we have mode so songs can be
classified as major and minor 1.0
represents major or one represents major
and zero represents
minor next we we have speech so speech
recognizes the presence of spoken words
in a track more exclusive speech like
the recording example talk show Audi
book or poetry the closer to 1.0 the
attribute
value then we have a column for the
costic so a confidence measure of 0 to 1
of whether the track is acostic or not
so 1.0 represents high confidence the
track is acostic then we have other
information
about
instrumental then we also have a column
for liveness so liveness detects the
presence of an audience in the recording
then we have a column for Valance so
Valance is a measure between 0.0 to 1.0
and describes the musical positiveness
conveyed by a track or a
song and finally we have have the
columns for Tempo and time
signature now even in the second data
set we have almost the same columns just
that we have an additional column that
is about the genre of the songs present
in the data set cool now let's head over
to our jupyter notebook and we'll start
with our
analysis okay so one more thing to
remember our data has information from
1922 onwards so all the songs from 1922
till
2021 cool okay so I'm on my jupyter
notebook
so you can see I have a few cells that
have already been filled up so we'll
start with our analysis first of all
let's go ahead and import the necessary
libraries so I'm importing numpy pandas
mat plot lib and cbor for my analysis
and visualization I'll hit shift enter
to import the libraries all right and in
the next cell I'm going to load my data
set using the pandas read CSV function I
have my location already put here let me
show you the location where the data
files or the data sets are located so
this is my location under Chrome
downloads I have a folder called Spotify
data sets Okay so let's import and
and check the first five rows in the
data set so for that I have used the
head function there you go so here you
can see I have my first five rows of
information from the data set and on the
top you can see the different columns
you have ID name
popularity artist then we have the
release date danceability energy key
loudness liveliness or
liveness balance Tempo and other
information cool
now let's check for null values in the
data set I'll just give a comment as
null
values every time when you download a
data set from an open repository there
are chances that the data set would
contain null values so it's better to
check them
beforehand so I'm going to use the isol
function present in the pandas Library
PD I'm using because I had imported
pandas as PD so PD do is null then I'm
going to use the variable name dfdore
TRS because I uted my data set and
stored it in the variable dfdore TRS so
I have my data frame under dfdore tracks
variable and then I'll use the sum
function to check the total number of
null values present in the data set for
each of the columns if I run it there
you go
so here you can see my name column has
71 missing values or null values and we
don't have any null values for the rest
of the
columns
okay now let's use the info method that
will give us the total number of rows
and columns in the data set and we'll
also check the data types and the memory
usage so I'll say my data frame name
that is DF TRS doino
if I run it you can see here now if you
mark there are total 5 lh86
61 names or the names of the songs
present in the data set while the rest
all have 5 l
866727 song names or sound tracks
missing from our data
set and Below you can see the data types
we have Lo integer and object and then
you can see the memory
usage
cool now before I move ahead with our
next analysis I have another question
for you which artist or musician has the
most number of followers on Spotify I
repeat which artist or musician has the
most number of followers on Spotify
please put your answer in the comment
section below we would be happy to hear
from
you now let's move ahead and do our
first major analysis in this demo we are
going to find the 10 least popular songs
present in the spottify data set so I'll
create a variable called sorted DF that
will be equal to my data frame name that
is DF TRS dot I'm going to use the
sortore values function and
say my column name is
popularity so I'm going to sort the
values based on the popularity and then
say ascending equal to
True since I want only the least popular
songs and then I'm going to say head of
10 which means I want the top 10 least
popular songs now let's go ahead and
print sorted DF if I run it you can see
we have the list
of 10 least popular songs on Spotify you
can see that popularity is
zero and you can see the names of the
songs some of them
are songs which are not an English
language and you can see the artist
names as well cool
now moving
ahead let's see some descriptive
statistics for the numerical variables
that are present in our column so I'll
say DF tracks do
describe which is the function to get
some descriptive statistics and I'm
going to use the transpose function
after
that if I run it there you go so we have
the statistics about count mean standard
deviation minimum value 25th percentile
50th percentile 75th percentile and the
maximum value for these columns like
popularity duration in milliseconds then
we have energy key loudness
mode cool now if you see this popularity
column the minimum value is zero and the
maximum value is 100 and you can see the
50th percentile is 27 which is
essentially the
median you have the standard deviation
as 18.37%
it so in this cell I'm going to create a
new variable called most
popular and I'll say
dfdore tracks dot this time I'm going to
use the query function that is part of
pandas Library again I'll use the column
that is popularity and we'll set the
condition popularity should be greater
than 90 I'll give a comma and say
in place equal to false because I don't
want to change my original data
frame and then I'll say
sortore
values and I'm going to sort it based
on
popularity
in descending order so I'll
say ascending equal to false
and then
let's take only
the top 10 popular songs so I'll say
most popular use square brackets use
square brackets and we'll then pass the
slicing operator and say colon 10 now if
I run this there you go so here you can
see the 10 most popular songs that is
present in our Spotify data set first we
have
features by Justin
Bieber Daniel Cesar and gon then we also
have a song name called driver's license
astronaut in the ocean save your tears
you also have the business streets and
heartbreak anniversary so these are the
most popular songs that are present in
our data set based on their popularity
you can see Peaches has the highest
popularity with 100
all right now moving to the next cell so
here we are going to set the index to be
release date column in the main data
frame so I'm setting my index using the
setor index function I have passed in my
column name as release date and I'm
saying in place equal to True which
means I want to change it in my original
data frame and then I'm changing the
value to date time format and let's
print the head of the data set so you
can see here we have successfully
changed our index now here you can see
instead of 0 1 2 3 we have the release
date column and the rest of the columns
are
intact
cool now let's move ahead so suppose you
want to check the artist at the 18th Row
in our data set you can use the index
location method for that let me show you
how to filter only specific rows of
information from the data set I'll use
my data frame DF tracks and using double
square brackets I'll
say my column name which is
artist and I'll use the index location
method and say let's say I want to check
the artist who is
present in the 18th Row in my data set
so I'll use iock 18 if I run it the
artist name is Victor
voucher
cool now let's move ahead we are going
to convert the duration in milliseconds
to just seconds
so if you see our data set we have a
column called duration in milliseconds
so all our songs are present in
milliseconds let's convert them into
just seconds so for that I'm using the
Lambda function and dividing the
values in milliseconds by thousand so
that they get converted into just
seconds I have used in place equal to
true so I want to change it in my
original data frame let's run it and do
the necessary changes all right now
we'll print the head of the data set
just to check the duration column so
I'll say
dfdore
tracks dot
duration do head if I run it there you
go so you can see the values have now
been changed to just
seconds
cool I have the final quiz question for
you who has the most monthly listeners
on Spotify please put your answers in
the comment section below we' be glad to
hear from
you now coming to the next
cell so here we are going to create a
the describe function will only give
information about numerical columns so
here you can see we have the total count
the mean of each of these columns you
have the standard deviation the minimum
and maximum value and then we have the
25th percentile the 50th percentile and
the 75th percentile value of the columns
ID age height weight and
year all right now one thing to notice
here is if you see the year column the
minimum year is 1896
so this is when Olympics started and
until recently the r Olympics that was
held in
2016 all right now moving
ahead now let's check if there are any
null values present in The Columns of
the data set so first I am going to
create a variable called n
values give equal to I'll see at
athletes uncore DF and the function to
check is I'll say is
na I'll create
another variable called n
anore
columns and here I'll use the any
function I'll say Nan
underscore this variable which is
underscore
values dot I'll see
any and I'll print my n n columns
variable so this will display the result
in terms
of Boolean values so if there are any
null or n or missing values in any of
the columns it will say true otherwise
it will say false let's display the
result there you go so if you Mark here
clearly so there
are nearly six columns where we have
missing values you have age height
weight medal region and notes columns
that have missing values so hence it has
given us true the rest of the columns do
not have any n or missing values hence
they are false all
right me scroll
down
now let's see the total number of null
values for the above six
columns so I'll
say
athletes uncore DF dot I'll use the
function is null and again I'll use the
sum
function okay this should be is null if
I run it you can see it
here so our age column has 9,474
rows where we have null values then we
have some null values for the height
column as well for the weight colum so
these are the total number
of rows where we don't have any
information regarding each height weat
or
region notes this metal is
self-explanatory because a lot of the
athletes who participate in Olympics
don't win any medals so for them the
value is na now before I move ahead I
have a question for you people so the
question is I want you to print the
column names containing null values or
missing values in the form of a list so
please answer this question and put it
in the comment section of the video we
would be happy to know your
approach so the question I'll repeat it
again I want you people to print the
column names containing null values or
missing values in the form of a list so
basically
on the top we saw there
were six columns that had null values I
want you to print these six columns in
the form of a list all right now moving
ahead now let's see the data for
specific countries let's say you want to
see the athletes who have participated
in the Olympic Games from the beginning
for India for that you can filter your
result using a function called query so
let me show you how to do it I'll say
athletes unor DF dot we'll use the query
function and
then I'll say team which is my column
name should be equal to equal to and the
value I'll give is
India now let's display the first five
rows of information or the details for
the athletes who are from India if I run
this okay there is some error here okay
so we need to make sure this entire
expression or the condition should be
within single code I'll just delete this
single code from here and we'll add it
in the
end now let's run it there you go so
here you can see we
have the top five rows
of the athletes who are from India you
can see here the region is India you can
see the nooc is India the team is India
and let me go to the left you can see
the name of the athlete the sex age so
for age you have some missing values you
have the weight team year and everything
all right similarly you can also check
for Japan let me just copy the above
code I'll paste it here and instead of
India I'll say
Japan I'll run it there you go so if you
see here you can see all the details are
for the athletes who are from
Japan all
right moving ahead now I want to know
the top 10 countries who have
participated since the Inception of
Olympics in
1896 so for that I'll create a variable
called topor
10or
countries let say equal
to I'll use my data frame that is
athletes uncore
TF I'll say dot
team then I'll use the
function value underscore
counts I'm going to
sort my count in ascending
order just Mark the way in which I'm
writing the
functions any error in terms of syntax
of the flow will throw you an error I
want to display the top 10 countries now
let's go ahead
and print it I'll say topor 10 _
countries all right let me run
it okay it has given us an error let's
debug it okay so this should be value
counts and not count let's run it again
another
error okay so this should be short
underscore values and not value let's
run it again there you go so here you
can see the the top 10 countries
participating in Olympics since 1896 you
have United States then we have France
so these are the number of participants
who have taken part since
1896 so the most number of participants
have come from us then we have France
Great Britain Italy Germany Canada Japan
Sweden we also have Australia and
Hungary I'll scroll
down now we are going to to convert this
table that we got or the output that we
got in the form of a graph so I'm trying
to create a bar plot to plot the top 10
countries who have participated in Lumix
so here I'm using
the figure function to give the figure
size so these are the dimensions 12a 6
now I'll tell you what this PLT XT means
just wait for a while I have given a
title to my plot saying overall
participation by
country and then using the cbor library
and the bar plot function I am plotting
the X and
the y axis so my x-axis has top I should
make this top 10 countries because above
we used topor 10or countries similarly
for y axis I'll make topor 10or
countries and then I'm using a color
palette called set
two let's run it there you go so if I
scroll down you can see here we have a
nice bar plot this is a vertical bar
plot and here you can see the bars which
represent the different country names
first we have United States which has
the highest participation since the
beginning of the Olympics then we have
France Great Britain Italy Italy Germany
Canada and we have the rest of the
countries
cool now moving
ahead the next visualization we are
going to see is the age distribution of
the athletes so for this we are going to
create a histogram I'll be using the
matte plot lab Library specifically for
this
visualization so I'll say PLT do
figure we'll give the figure size using
the argument fig size equal
to and this will be a tle actually my
size is going to be 12a
6 I'll
say
PLT
dot
title now you can
give any title that you want I'll say AG
distribution of the
athletes then we'll also give the X
labels I'll say PLT
dot X
Lael this will have
age then we see PLT do y
label and this will
have the label as number and The Edge
you can see here we have the white color
all
right now moving
ahead now in the initial slides of the
video we discussed the summer and winter
Olympic games let's look at the
different sporting events that are part
of the summer and winter Olympic Games
just to give you a heads up the Winter
Olympic Games are held once every 4
years for sports practiced on snow and
ice so here I have my variable name
winter _ sports so I'm
extracting for season equal to equal to
Winter and I am going to display only
the unique values now let me run this
cell okay so you can see here these are
the different winter sports that
are held during the winter Olympics now
similarly let's see for Summer Olympics
so what I'm going to do here is I'll
just copy this cell of code and we'll
edit the variables I'll say
summercore Olympics so these are the
sports that are played on snow and ice
and these are the sports that are played
during
summer moving ahead now it's time to
analyze the total number of meal and
female participants who have taken part
in different games since 1896 till 2016
Rio
Olympics all right so I'll
see
gender underscore counts which is my
variable name I'll use
my data frame that is
athletes DF
dot my variable name that is sex dot
Valore
counts and then we are going to
print gender uncore
counts let's run this there you go so
since the Inception of Olympics we have
more number of male participants than
female
participants now here in this current
cell you can see we are trying to plot a
pie chart for male and female athletes
so I have given my figure size then I
have my title as gender distribution I'm
using the matplot lab library and the pi
function I'm using the variable gender
that we used here then I'm giving my
labels as gender counts. index now I'm
using this Auto PCT the autop PCT
parameter enables you to display the
percent value using python string
formatting so this is my string
formatting that I have used and I'm
initialized my start angle for the pie
chart as 150° and I'm also giving Shadow
to my pie chart so I have written Shadow
equal to True let's let's run it all
right so you can see here this is my pie
chart that shows you the distribution of
the male and female participation so for
male it is
72.5% for female so far it is 27.5% as
per the data set that we have we can
change this start angle to let's say
180° and it
will change the pie chart to this
direction
cool now moving
ahead this time we're going to find the
total number of medals that the athletes
have won so I'll use
my data frame athletes DF Dot and then
my column that is medal I'll say dot
value underscore
counts let's run it there you go so you
can see the gold medals the bronze
medals and the silver medals are very
much similar to each other the numbers
are pretty much the
same all right now it's time to focus on
the total female athletes who have taken
part in each
Olympics so I'll create a variable
called female
uncore
participants I'll say equal to and then
use my data frame name that is athletes
DF using square
brackets I'll
say
athletes uncore DF
dot the gender should be equal to equal
to
female and I'll use
erson I'll
say just copy this
paste it
here LC do
season equal to equal to we'll check for
Summer
Olympics and I want to extract only the
gender column so here it is sex
comma my year column which is
year
okay and then I'll
say female
underscore
participants equal
to I'll just copy
this paste it here and then I'll use the
group by
function say Group by which is part of
the pandas
Library I'll see
here and then I want to find the
count I'll reset the
index say reset uncore
Index this is a
function and finally we are going to
print female uncore
participants and let's say the
head all right so what we are trying to
do is I'm trying to filter my data only
for the female athletes for Summer
Olympics and here I am
printing the participation
based on each year so I'm finding out
the count so here we need to
add one more square
bracket all right now we'll run it and
see the result there you go so you can
see here from 1900
194 all these years you can see the
female
participation let me change it to tail
so that we have the recent data of the
Olympics
you can see it here for the Beijing
Olympics
5,816 women athletes participated in
2012 London Olympics we had
5,815 Olympics similarly for the 2016 R
Olympics we had more participation than
the London Olympics so
6,223 women athletes had
participated all
right now here this is this is another
way in which you can filter your data
for female athletes so I'm using two
parameters my gender should be equal to
female and season is Summer Olympics let
me just run it I have stored it in a
variable called women
Olympics now here I'm trying to find a
count plot or I'm trying to create
account plot using my cbon SNS Library
I've set my style to D dark grid then my
figure size I have given as 20 comma 10
my count plot will have the
x-axis as ear the data is women Olympics
and pallet I'm using as spectral and
then I have given a title women
participation let's run and see the
output there you go if I scroll down you
can see on the top I have the title for
my count plot which says women
participation and on the y-axis I have
have the count and at the bottom you can
see the different year values from 1900
till
2006 and 2016 had the highest number of
female
participation cool let me scroll down so
in this cell of code we are trying to
plot a line graph let me run it and show
you the output so this line graph shows
the trend which says plot for female
athletes over time so here you can see
the line graph so gradually the women
participation has increased in Olympics
since its Inception there was a slight
decrease here this is
around
1950s and again that you can see here
there's a decrease with the women
participation in 1980 but since then
since 1980 there has been
continuous increase in the participation
of female athlete
numbers cool now coming to the next
section of our
analysis now we are going to filter the
data to see the details of the athletes
who have won gold
medals so I'll create a variable called
gold
medals let equal to I'll use
my data frame as athletes DF
and within parenthesis I'll use my data
frame name which is
athletes
underscore DF
dot I'll use the condition medal equal
to equal
to and my value would be
gold next I'm going to
say gold medal
do
head let's run it there you go so here
we have
the top five rows of the athletes who
have won a gold medal you can see all
the records have medal as
gold now we are going to use
this
subset of the data and perform some more
analysis so here
I want to take only the values that are
different from n so I'm going to use is
finite function and inside that I have
said gold medals age let me just run it
cool now I want to
see the athletes who have secured a gold
medal beyond the age of 60 years which
is very rare
so we'll see the total number of
athletes with more than 60 years of age
having won a gold
medal so here I'm going to
say gold
medals I'll use
my column as
ID and
then I'll
use my variable gold medals
and
then I'll say
age should
be greater
than
60 and then I'll close my square bracket
and say
count okay let me just verify if
everything is
fine yeah I'll run it and we'll see the
result so there are
total six athl Lees who have won a gold
medal having age more than 60 years
cool now let me
check for
which sport these six gold medals have
come so I'll
say sporting _ event this is going to be
my variable
name equal to I'll use
the same variable name gold
medals I'll going to
choose my sport column and
then I'll give
my condition
age greater than
60 now let's go ahead and we'll
print the variable SP footing event if I
run this you can see it
here so for art
competitions even for archery and
suiting and this's one called Rook we
have had gold medals from athletes who
had an
age more than 60 years now we are going
to
plot this result or the table that we
achieved on the
top so so I'll say PLT do
figure I'll give
my figure
size equal to let's say 10A
5 then I'll say PLT
dot we'll use
the tight
layout see tight uncore
layout then I'm going to use the cbon
library and
create a count plot for my
variable spoting uncore
event then I'll see PLT do
title I'll give the title as gold
medals
for athletes over 60 years of
age let's run it
and if I scroll down you can see here we
have a nice count plot I have my title
gold medals for athletes over 60 years
and since for archery we had three
players who secured a gold medal having
an age more than 60
years you can see here archery is three
art competition one Rook is one and
shooting we had one
medal all
right now we'll see the total gold
medals from each country so for
that I'll
say
gold
medals dot we'll use
the region column and followed by that
I'll use the value underscore counts
function and I'll reset the
index with name
equal to I'll provide the medal
column then we are going to print the
head for the top
five countries let me run it you can see
it
here
so
USA has secured the most number of gold
medals then we have Russia Germany UK
and then we have
Italy
cool now in this cell I'm going to
create a plot
to visualize the table that I got above
so I've used my labels my titles I'm
using the cat plot function that is
present in the seone library I have my
xaxis my Y axis the data which is total
gold
medals let me just
verify okay and we'll run it
if I scroll
down you can see this is a different
pallet that I had used which is
rocket and you can see USA has got the
most number of gold medals then we have
Russia Germany UK Italy and France now
we also have included France here which
was not present in this table the reason
being I have used head as six so it will
give me the top six
countries all right
now we will
analyze and look at the data for the
most recent Olympic event that is
present in our data set I'm talking
about the 2016 Rio Summer
Olympics so first of all I'll create a
variable called Max
year which will be equal to my data
frame name athletes unor
DF my column name year and I'll use the
max
function then let's go ahead and print
my Max
here I'll just show you the output you
can see here my Max here present in the
data set is 2016 the r
Olympics
next we will create another variable
called teamore
names that will be equal to my dataframe
name athletes
DF within square brackets I'll give
parenthesis and then say athletes uncore
DF dot
year should be equal to equal
to my output that is Max here which is
actually
2016 and then I'll
say
Amberson I'll just copy this
we'll paste it
here this time I'll use
the metal column and say equal to equal
to
Gold I'll say dot
team then I'll say
teamore names
dot value
underscore
counts do head and we'll display the top
10
countries let me run this there you go
so in R
Olympics United States secured the most
number of gold medals now the reason
this is 137 is we have also counted the
team events for example basketball
similarly Great Britain had 64 gold
medals in total Russia 50 we have Brazil
34 Argentina 21 France 20 and Japan
17 all
right
now using the above result we are going
to create a bar plot I'll just change
this teamore list to teamore names
similarly here also I'll make the
corrections as
teamore
names cool now we'll run it and you can
see here we have a nice horizontal bar
plot so we have United States at the top
Great Britain Russia Germany China
Brazil so here I'm displaying the top 20
Nations since I have used head as 20 so
these are the top 20 Nations who secured
the most number of gold medals in the
you
Olympics all
right now in the final section of this
video we will create a scatter plot to
visualize the height and weight of male
and female athletes who have won a medal
now it can be a gold medal a silver
medal or a bronze medal but before that
we need to filter the data only for
athletes who have won a medal now if
you had noticed here
are medal column also had a few null
values so we are not going to consider
those null values here we are only going
to consider for the athletes who have b
a medal so for that I'll create
a variable called notore
nullcore
medals equal to I'll
see athletes underscore
DF
then I'll give
my let's make it
DF I'll give my
condition let me just copy
this I'll paste it
here and
then I'll give my condition
height and use
the not null
function and then I'll say
Amberson create another parenthesis I'll
say athletes underscore
DF this time we'll consider the weight
column again I'll use the function as
not null
and I'll close the
parenthesis okay I had missed one s here
cool let me just run it now all
right now we are going to create our
final plot I'll say PLT do
figure I'll give my figure size
equal
to I'll say 12a
10 I'll say
access equal to SNS do we'll be creating
a scatter plot to plot
the height and weight of the athletes
who have won a
medal I'll say scatter plot in my x-axis
I'll have
height comma in my Y axis I'll have
we
comma my data should
be not underscore null underscore
medals so this is what we created here
notore nullcore medals comma I'll use H
equal to my sex
column cool finally I'll say PLT dot
I'll give a title to my plot
saying height
versus
weight
of
Olympic
medalist cool now let's see are
scatterplot this might take some time to
give the result because there are so
many athletes present in a data set who
have won a medal and also we are
filtering in terms of hue which is for
male and female there you go so if I
scroll down you can see here we have a
nice scatter plot on the top you have
the title of the plot saying height
versus weight of Olympic medalist you
can see
our age as the Hue so blue points are
for the male athletes and orange points
are for the female
athletes and on the y- axis we have the
weight in terms
of kilog and you have the height in
terms of
CM
cool so that brings us to the end of
this demo session on Olympics data set
analysis so we used two data sets
to carry out this exploratory data
analysis and we created some
visualizations to analyze and visualize

world of technology now let's get
started and unlock the potential of chat
GPD for data analytics together and guys
if you're one of the aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
graduating from the best universities or
a professional who elicits to switch
careers with data analytics by learning
from the experts then try giving a short
to Simply learns Purdue postgraduate
program in data analytics in
collaboration with IBM the link is in
the description box that will navigate
get you to the course page where you can
find a complete over of the program
being offered so let's get started guys
so guys an Excel data analyst always
looks for ways to improve their
efficiency and gain deeper insights from
the data that's where chare jity comes
in handy so chat gity is an AI powered
language model that can assist you in
various task including Excel based data
analysis and for that data analysis
let's dive into some demos to see how it
works so guys as you can see this this
is the chat GPT 4 and you could see this
has the support of D browsing and
Analysis and usage limits May apply like
we have the version that has some usage
limits and for the data I have
downloaded the data from the K I will
provide you the link in the description
if you want to download the same data
you can and I have that in my downloads
so this is the data that we'll be using
so the first thing we'll be doing is
data cleaning and preparation so firstly
let's explore data cleaning and
preparation before diving into analysis
it's essential to ensure our data is
clean and ready for processing so for
that we will write a prompt in chat jpt
and ask him to clean the data chat jpt
has the feature to insert the files
provide the Excel file to the chat jpt
and we'll ask him that can you help me
identify and remove duplicates in this
Excel spreadsheet so let's ask him can
you help me uh identify and remove
duplicates duplicates from this Excel
spreadsheet from the
provided
Excel spreadsheet you could see that sh
J has started generating the response
and he is telling us that he can
definitely help us with that and he is
analyzing that
so you could see that J has provided us
the response so let's first go to our
spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet
order number quantity
ordered price of each quantity and Order
lines so you could see that first chart
GPT has encountered an error and that is
with the corrector and coding missp
and then he has loaded the spreadsheet
successfully with the second attempt and
you could see that he has provided a
like the smaller or the briefer version
of the spreadsheet that is the data set
consist of sales data with column such
as order number quantity order price
each order line sales order date status
so he's asking us could you specify how
you would like to identify duplicates
for example should be consider a row a
duplicate if all its values match
another row exactly or are this
specifically columns we should focus on
to determine duplicates so we should or
here we will be focusing on the column
section so here we want to
identify colum
section so is asking which columns they
should identify duplicates so we own the
duplicates in order
number so the J GD has started analyzing
the
spreadsheet so you could see that CH G
has puras the response that they have
identified a total of
28007 rows in the spreadsheet that have
duplicates based on the order number
column so this IND indates that multiple
rows share the same order number
suggesting there might be different
items or transactions within the same
order would you like to proceed by
removing these duplicates while keeping
either the first or last Ence of each
order number or do you have another
approach in mind for handling these
duplicates so before identifying the
duplicates what we'll do is we'll first
get rid of the extra spaces so we'll ask
chat GPT that first
find the Extra
Spaces in the
spreadsheet
and help us remove
them so you could see that it has
started analyzing
it so he is asking us that would you
like to proceed with any further
cleaning or data manipulation yes we
going to proceed further with data
cleaning only and now we will treat all
the blank cells if there are
any now treat all the blank
cells if there are
any so the spread sheet contains blank
cells in the following columns with the
respective counts of blank entries that
is address line to has 2521 blank sales
than the state so depending on
preference or the requirements of your
data analysis we can treat these blank
cells in several ways such as filling
them with a t holder value that is not
provided using a specific value that
makes sense for data that is example a
default state of Tory but potentially
leaving them as if blanks carry
meaningful information in the context of
your data so what we will do we will
provide a placeholder
provide a placeholder
instead that
is not provided or not applicable
okay so you would see that has responded
that it has replace the blank cells in
the columns that is address line two
state postal code and territory with the
placeholder note provided so you could
see there's a verification sample
showing the updates so this is how you
could clean the data and now with chat
jpt you can quickly identify and
eliminate duplicates in your Excel
spreadsheet using build-in functions and
formulas saving your time and effort so
that would be done by the chat jpt and
you can download the Excel file from the
chat gbd only after that you can just
ask him that provide me the output or
the resulted spreadsheet so if we talk
about now data analysis and
visualization let's delve into that so
Excel offers powerful tools for
analyzing Ing and visualizing data and
chat jpt can help you make the most of
them so for this also we'll write a
prompt to the chat jpt and we'll write
for example we'll write please create a
PIV table and a corresponding chart to
analyze sales performance by region so
let's see like this prompt what output
does CH Jey show to us so let's ask him
please create a PV
table and a corresponding
chart to
analyze sales performance by
region so you would see that chat has
started analyzing the data and the
spreadsheet and you could see that the
pivot table below shows the sales
performance per region or the territory
so this table indicates that the EMA had
the highest sales performance followed
by regions where the territory was not
provided then ape and finally Japan so
now let's create a chart to visually
represent this sales performance by
region you could see that it has
provided a chart that is a b chart
illustrating the sales performance by
Tory so you could see the guys that it
has provided us the analysis and CH jpd
can guide you through the process of
creating pivot tables charts and other
visualizations in Excel enabling you to
gain valuable insights from your data
with ease so let's move to Advanced
analysis and automation so lastly we
will explore Advanced analysis and
automation so Excel capabilities extend
beyond basic functions and chat jpd can
help you leverage its full potential and
for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat GPD that can you assist me in
building a forecasting model to predict
future SA
based on historical data present in the
spreadsheet so let's see what chat J
respond to us so let's ask
him can
you assist
me in
building a forecasting
model to predict future
sales based on historical
data so let's see
what CH respond to us so you could see
that building a forecasting model to BU
future sales based on historical data
invols several steps so for this you
have to prepare the data select a model
train the model evaluate the model and
make predictions so let's start by
preparing the data we'll aggregate sales
by order date to create a Time series of
total daily sales then we'll choose a
model based on data's characteristics so
we
will grant the permission to chat gyy to
proceed with the steps so we started
analyzing the
data so you could see that that the data
has been prepared into a Time series of
total daily sales and before choosing a
forecasting model it's helpful to
visualize the sales time series to
understand its characteristics such as
Trend and seasonality
so Chad jpd has fled a daily sales data
and then he has given the visual Trends
and the possible seasonal patterns and
the next steps would include testing for
stationarity model selection and
parameter touring model training and
then forecasting so you could follow all
these steps with the help of chat GPT
and could create a forecasting model if
you want we can move to the next step so
you could like provide a prom to the
chat chipy that move
to or proceed with Next
Step so step by step Chad Gip will
provide you forecasting model or it will
help you create a forecasting model as
you can see it has started analyzing it
to the augmented Dy Fuller that is ADF
test gives up a P value of approximately
0.33 since this P value is less than the
common significance level of 0.05 we can
reject the null hypthesis that the time
Series has a unit rote meaning the time
series is stationary so you could see
that he's asking us shall we proceed
with the Sima model parameter selection
yes here is the model parameter
selection so you could select any based
on the trends and the bar graphs ploted
by the chat
gbd so you could see guys that the chat
has analyzed the spreadsheet and
provided the response that the grid
search for the optimal Sima parameters
based on the
lower information Criterion suggest the
best fit model uses the parameter 011
and for ARA and
01112 that is for the seasonal component
so you could see that it has provided
the model and the parameters now he's
asking us shall we move on to
forecasting future sales with this model
yes proceed with that so you could see
that with Chad Gip assistance you can
build complex forecasting models in
Excel allowing you to make informed
decisions and plan for the future
effectively so chat jpt is a valuable
tool for Excel users and data analysis
offering assistance in data cleaning
analysis visualization and Automation
and by integrating chat J in your Excel
workflows you can enhance your
productivity and uncover new insights
from your data so you can try J gbt for
Excel data analytics today and take your
Excel skills to the new level and you
could see that uh there's an error in
the analyzing and he has encountered an
error while trying to plot the forecast
with its confidence intervals so this
type of error can occur due to data type
issues particularly when handling data
indices in forecast and despite the S up
the forecasting process using the ca
model was completed and we were able to
generate forecast for the next 12 months
unfortunately due to the plotting issue
we couldn't visually displayed so we'll
ask him can you try once
again so you could see that this time CH
gbt has provided us the forecast for the
next 12 months that is the forecast have
been successfully ploted along with the
historical daily data so here we have
our forecast model and with the chat
jip's assistance we can move with other
analysis also we are going to learn
about databases how data is stored in
relational databases and we'll also look
at some of the popular databases finally
we'll understand various SQL commands on
my SQL Server now let's get started with
what is a
database so according to Oracle a
database is an organized collection of
structured information or data that is
typically stored electronically in a
computer system a database is usually
controlled by a database management
system or
dbms so it is a storage system that has
a collection of data
relational databases store data in the
form of tables that can be easily
retrieved managed and updated you can
organize data into tables rows columns
and index it to make it easier to find
relevant information now talking about
some of the popular
databases we have mySQL database we also
have Oracle database then we have mongod
DV which is a no SQL database next we
have Microsoft SQL Server next we have
Apache a cassendra which is a free and
open source nosql database and finally
we have postest SQL now let's learn what
is SQL so SQL is a domain specific
language to communicate with databases
SQL was initially developed by
IBM most databases use structured query
language or SQL for writing and querying
data SQL commands help you to store
process analyze and manipulate databases
with this let's look at what a table is
so this is how a table in a database
looks like so here you can see the name
of the table is
players on the top you can see the
column names so we have the player ID
the player name the country to which the
player belongs to and we also have the
goals scored by each of the players so
these are also known as fields in a
database here each row represents a
record or a tle so if you have the
player ID which is 103 here the name of
the player is Daniel he is from England
and the number of goals here scored is
seven so you can use SQL commands to
query update insert records and do a lot
of other tasks now we'll see what the
features of SQL are SQL lets to access
any information stored in a relational
database with SQL queries data is
extracted from the database in a very
efficient way the structured query
language is compatible with all database
systems from or IBM to Microsoft and it
doesn't require much coding to manage
databases now we will see applications
of SQL SQL is used to create a database
Define its structure implement it and
lets you perform many functions SQL is
also used for maintaining an already
existing database SQL is a powerful
language for entering data modifying
data and extracting data in a database
SQL is extensively used as a client
language to connect the front end with
the back end the supporting the client
server architecture SQL when deployed as
data control language DCL helps protect
your database from unauthorized access
so what exactly is a CTU ask now if you
are a beginner in SQL let's say you
wanted to Club two different tables or
more different tables maybe three or
four right so you will be using one
keyword which is join right and let's
say you may have to create a query in
such a way that you have to Club
different tables and you have to extract
the results from one table into another
and finally create a output table right
so this might be sounding a little too
complex so basically what CTE does is it
acts as a temporary table right now you
can write a query and save it as a CTE
right and that particular resultant
table from CTE will not be created but
will be in the memory as a temporary
data or an intermediate resultant data
right now whenever you want to use a
join or whenever you want to use the
same query inside a bracket or inside
something in your query you can just
simply use the name of the CD and then
the data you require the columns you
require and done you will get the data
now this might be a little too
complicated to understand in just m
words now let's just go through the
formal definition of what exactly is a
CTE and what it does and then let's
quickly so it's a little too complicated
to understand it just with m words so
let's get started with the Practical
examples but before that let's
understand a formal definition of what
exactly is a CTE in SQL so CTE also
known as or also called as the Common
Table expression or some people also are
used to call it as a width expression so
the keyword is withth so a comma table
expression in SQL is a temporary result
set that you can Define within a query
as I said it helps to break down the
complex queries make the code more
readable and allows you to reuse the
result set multiple times within the
same query just you need to use the name
of the CTE in the places where you want
in your query and it reduces the code
length as well as the execution time now
CTE are defined using the withd keyword
as we discussed before followed by the
CTE name right so for every uh column
name or anything in your data set you
give a name right similarly when you are
using CTE in SQL you also need to give a
name to the CTE and that particular name
will be used in your subquery positions
that will reduce the query length and
execution time so you should be giving a
name and the query that generates the
result set the CTE is available only
during the execution of that particular
query or specific query right so as I
said the CTE table the resultant table
which is created while you are using the
CTE will not be created as a permanent
table in the P right it will be a
temporary or intermediate result which
will be active as long as your Cent
query which is using the CTE is active
now let's go to the demonstration mode
there we will try to create some simple
queries right and we will understand how
exactly a CT can be beneficial in those
situations now let's go to the MySQL
workbench this is my MySQL workbench
bench so I have a lot of tables here we
have the credit card data set we have
the sakila data set SLP data set says
Superstar World Etc right so we will be
using the Superstar data set uh I mean
the database so firstly we need to write
in the query which means that I am going
to use the superstore database
right sorry
Superstar so I uh prefer using uh
smaller case or lower case for database
names and column names and uh uppercase
for the keywords for example here use is
uppercase and Superstar is the name of
the keyword right so uh that is for uh
identifying or easy readability which is
a keyword and which is a name right so
let's execute this query and have access
to the superstore data set and in Super
Store dataa I have one table called is
Excel data now let's quickly check what
we have in Excel data so let start from
Excel
data here we have R ID order ID aut dat
ship mode customer everything right so
we have region we have uh sales quantity
discount profit rate right so we have a
number of possibilities and number of
reports that we can generate but let's
try to keep it simple let's try to find
out unique regions right
select unique of regions
right or just
regions
data Group by regions so let's quickly
execute this statement and see the
output or maybe we can make some
modifications to it right instead of
that you might want to use you might
want to use distinct function so that
you don't get all 10,000 plus rows so
basically uh this particular data set
has about 10,000 or more rows in it and
it's not real it's completely made up
report using artificial intelligence so
we use chat GPT to create 10,000 RS of
data for 30 years maybe from 2000 or
2001 to up to 2030 or 31 right so we
don't want all those 10,000 plus column
sorry rows so let's use a distinct here
and uh try to exit this statement so
that we get um five uh of uh the regions
what we have so there you go we have um
five regions as expected NorthEast
Southwest and Central now you can also
uh
select uh kind of maybe average of sales
uh maximum of sales and total sales so
uh this is bringing us somewhere we can
you know try to find out region wise
sales right so region wise sales Group
by ear like 30 years what was the sale
happened in the year
2021 sorry 2001 right we begin from 200
or 2001 to all the way up to 2030 or
2031 right so we can see if there is an
increase in the year- on-ear sales or
decrease in the year on year sales we
can identify the best performing year
the worst performing ER right so uh this
sounds like a good use case now let's go
to the code where I've written it as uh
CTE and understand the
workflow so here I have uh named my CTE
as sales CTE so I'm starting it with the
keyword with right so with sales CTE as
now this is our query right what am I
doing I'm extracting so according to the
D set we have the date right so the date
is year month and date of that
particular day right but we want just
the year so we're using the year
function to extract the Year from the
date as sales a region uh sum of sales
right we wanted to find out the total
sales happened in that particular year
as total sales from the data set Excel
data and gr by a right we wanted it in
increasing order so 2000 to all the way
up to 230 or 2031 correct so that's how
it is and I'm saving all this as a CTE
named as sales CTE now I want to select
some parts of that particular CD so we
want to select sales here region total
sales from sales CDE which is right over
here and order it in form of sales and
region right now let's try to copy this
code and run this in our work
right now let's Okay let me close this
quickly so that we have a complete view
of the code right so let's now select
all the
code so now we have selected this
particular code let's try to run this
and see the output there you go we okay
we have the output but there is
something wrong we did not get uh the
ears right so all the 30 years of data
here it is Group by region which is fine
okay we don't want region we want to
group it by ear that's okay and the
thing is we need to fix this particular
year so maybe there is something wrong
with the order date right so I think uh
the database has saved this particular
or okay okay since this is generated by
chat jpd maybe the data type of the date
is other than data right other than date
data type it may be string now we might
have to do some type casting to change
the data type of the audit date and
let's quickly do that so now we have
updated the year so what we have done is
just uh cast here right so we have uh
changed uh the string type of date to
the normal date which follows by year
month and date so this is a simple type
casting that you can do and uh rest
everything and we've also added a where
condition so where uh date is not added
or date is equals to null and you can
just uh ignore that and uh now let's try
to execute this query and we have also
removed that region thing right Group by
region or order by region so we want
that to be ordered according to the year
which should start with uh 2001 or the
first ever year add to the last ever
year according to dat set now let's
select the entire CT query and run that
and check our outputs so there you go so
you have the year onar sales from 2001
to all the way up to the year
2030 and
2031 right so that's how the CTE or
common uh table expressions in SQL or
the width query in SQL can be used so
welcome to the demo part of the SQL
project so in this we will do digital
music store analysis okay so this SQL
project is for the beginners so what you
will learn from this uh project main
thing is like so what's the objective of
this project this particular project so
this project is for beginners and we'll
teach you how to analyze the music
playlist database and you can examine
the data set with squel and help the
store understand its business growth by
answering simple questions so as you can
see I will show you so I have three set
of questions first one is easy okay and
the second one is
moderate and the third one is advanced
level so we have three set of questions
easy set moderate and the advanced okay
so every set is of three three questions
I guess yes every set there is three
three questions so okay in easy one
there are five so we have 5 + 3 8 8 + 3
11 we have 11 questions to solve okay
from this you will understand how you
can you know analyze data with SQL how
you can extract something from database
how you can store something like this
okay so and one more thing I will show
you the schema of the particular uh data
set which we will you know soon we will
restore so we have the tables in this
artist album track media type genre
invoice line invoice customer employe ID
playlist playlist track and all okay so
this is the music playlist database
schema so without any further Ado let
me create one database so here just
right click create
database
okay here I will
write music
okay and
save so now our database is created okay
so if you will go to
schema and if you go to tables there is
no tables in it means there is no there
is database but nothing is there the
database is empty so now what I will do
just go to your database just right
click here you can see the restore
option okay
restore so format as it is then here
file name go to this music store
database I will put this database Link
in the description box below don't worry
open then
restore process started process complete
some people will face this uh that the
process is failed or something okay so
for that what you have to do just go to
file then
preferences here you have to set the
path just binary path okay see I am
using the 15th version okay so I have
set the path here also and this also but
you have to set this path is important
okay if you will not set this edv
Advanced server PA it's fine but this
part is most important
okay but for the future reference I have
added on the both what you have to do
you have to just just see where you will
find this path just go to this PC then
OS then program
files here you will find this post G SQL
then I'm using
C15 15 then bin so you have to
copy this
path right have to just copy
it and paste it here and then select
this one after that just save you won't
won't find any failed thing okay the
process will complete right so now let's
move forward and see the tables okay
it's still empty while just refresh it
see now you can see all the you know
columns in my tables okay
so what I will do for the checking I
will run one query here okay let me
close it okay I will write here
select
star from
album okay let me run
it so now as you can see here my table
is working fine everything seems
good okay so now what we will do we will
solve question one by
one okay so the first question let's see
the first question easy one who is the
senior most employee based on job title
okay who is the senior
most okay so I will
write
here like first question is
who is the
senior most
employee based
on
job
title okay so this is our
question so we know we have the table
name called employee so we will select
that table first so I will write here
Select Staff
from
employee so
you should know uh which table should to
select okay so here as you can see in
this question there is you
know word employee who is the Senor most
employee based on the job title most
employee means employees and employee
table
right
so I will run it
okay so what I will do I will just
select this and run it okay so now you
can see there in employer there is
employee ID last name first name title
report levels but date higher date and
all the details of the
particular
okay so we will do so there is one more
thing you can see the levels okay level
one level two so we have to write who is
the senior most employee based on the
job title so what I will do I will write
here
order
by levels and decreasing order
okay so first I will do so now you can
see the levels are in the descending
order from C
senior to this okay L7 to L L1 so what
we want we want only
one employee name so what I will write
here limit is
one okay I will copy this and done it
okay so now you can see the last name is
Madan moan sorry moan Madan this is last
name this is first name so moan Madan is
the senior most employee
based on the job de so question
first is done so the second question is
which countries have the most
invoices okay first I will write down
the question
which country has
the have the
most have the most invoices
okay so for
this what we have to do see just first
check first we have to check from which
table you know we will get the solution
so here you can see the word
invoices okay so we have one table
invoice and invoice line we have to
select it from this
okay so I will write here
select stuff
from
invoice
okay so we have customer ID invoice date
billing address billing city billing
State and
everything so here you can see we have
the billing country as well okay because
we need the country name so we will take
this column right so I will write
here so I will write
select we change it
select
count
start from
the select star billing
country from
invoice Group
by billing
country so why I doing this group by
because as you can see uh we have you
USA multiple times USA USA USA then
Canada also and the other countries as
well so from this I will get only the
one okay I will group them and I will
get the one fine so from this we will uh
get the
count so after this I will write
order
by where I will
write see
see descending okay let me run
it so now you can see the billing this
is the billing order okay so or you can
see the on voices USA got the
131 and Canada 76 Brazil 61 if I will
write here again the limit one what I
will get
see
USA we got the USA so USA is the country
which have the most
invoices okay if you will remove this
limit so you will
get the other country as well second in
Canada third is Brazil and like this
okay and the third question is what are
the top three values of total
invoices okay again we need the same
table okay first I will write the
question third question is what
are are
the top three values of total
invoices top three
value of
total invoices okay I know I can just
solve this question by the second one
but I want to do it from the
starting
okay so first I will take select stuff
from
invoice let me run
it so first we will sort the data here I
will write order
by total
because the last you know this is a
table name okay
total and the descending
order so first I will
select so we need just the top three so
first I will do everyone know limit
three
okay okay
so here I have done I have wrote this
star that is why it's giving me the all
the values if I want this only this
value so I can write select
total from invoice ordered by
this okay I will say and run it so I
have this total like 23.75 999 and 19.8
and 19.8 so these are the top three
values of total invoices
okay so here the fourth question is
which city has the best customer we
would like to throw a promotional music
festival in the city we made the most
money write a query that returns one
city that has the highest sum of invoice
Total return both the city name and some
of the all invoice total so let me write
the question first okay I writing
question for you know your better
understanding okay
question
fourth which
city has the
best
customers we
would like to throw a
party uh
promotional promotional Music Festival
in the
city we made the most
money we made
the most
money write
a
query that it does one
city that has
the
highest some sum of
invoices as sum of
invoices
Total
return
both the
city
name and
some of
all devices
okay so we have this question okay so
which city has the best customer we
would like to throw a promotional music
festival in the city we made the most
money write a query that returns one
city that has the highest sum of invoice
Total return both the city name and the
sum of all the invoices okay so first
what we will do we will
select select stuff
from
invoice okay
sorry we'll select this okay so first we
will select the billing city we have to
focus on this and the total in this two
table we have to just focus on okay so
here I will write
sum
of total
as
invoice
total comma
billing
city from
invoice so this time we will do group
by
billing city because we need the city
names
uh then I will add
order
by
invoice
total in the descending
order seems good select some total as
invoice Total Building City from invoice
building okay so let me select
this so as you can see see the highest
billing city
is
parag Prague and the best customer is
from the parak
city okay so this city has the best
customer obviously parag pragu or sorry
for the you know
mispronunciation okay so this is how we
have solved our fourth question as well
okay
because written both the city name and
the sum of all the inv you know these is
the city names and the invoice total
okay moving forward to a fifth
question which is again the long one who
is the best customer the customer who
has spent the most money will be the
declared the best customer write a query
that Returns the person who has spent
the most
money okay so I will write here
who is is the
best
customer the
customer who has
spent the
most
money will be
declar the best
customer so write a query
right everybody that returns that
Returns
the
person who has
spent most money
okay yeah so who is the best customer
the customer who has spent the most
money will be declared the best Comm
write a query that Returns the person
who has spent the most money okay okay
so for this we have to take this
customer Data customer table data okay
so I will write as
select stuff
from
customer okay I will select this and I
will run
it okay so this is
our know data table data of customer
Okay so we have the country facts emails
state city address last name first name
okay so as you can see there is
nothing uh like no detail of invoice or
the money okay which have spent by the
customer so what we will do we will look
at our schema so now what we can do if
we can't solve a particular question
from with one table we have to you know
join the table to the other table so
here we have to join customer table to
invoice table so in this you can see
there is customer ID and here also
customer ID so on the basis of customer
ID we can join the join both the table
and with the help of this total we will
sort out the uh that guy okay that
customer
right so for this this I will
write here
select customer
Dot
customer ID
comma
customer
DOT first
name comma
customer dot last name because we need
need the full name of that guy comma
Su invoice do
total as
total
okay okay let me can be POS okay I don't
need the search
pad
right then I will write from
customer okay my
bad then
join
invoice
on customer
do
customer
idals
to
invoice
do customer
ID
then I need Group
by
okay Group
by
customer
Dot customer ID after
this uh uh let me order it by the
descending order so the most you know
spend customer will come
up so I will write here Order
order
by
total the descending
order then
limit = to
1 fine let me run it let's see what
output
should
okay okay some error is coming liit okay
sorry okay so as you can see the
customer ID is five first name is our
the last name is mother our mother is
spent the highest value
14454 and two so who is the best
customer mad our mad sorry my bad our
mother right our mother has spent the
most
money okay so this is how we are done
with our easy set of questions now let's
jump into the moderate one okay so let
me write the question first for the
moderate so I will write
here moderate
questions so these analytics skill help
you in the data analytics to become a
data analyst or to become a data
scientist okay
so the question first
is
write
quer to
return
okay write query to
return the
email query to
return the
email comma first name
first
name comma last
name
and
genre of
all rock music
list okay then
return
your
list order
alphabetically by
ail
starting with a okay
let
yeah so for
this
okay let me open this first
yeah okay fine so first what I will
do so now in this question as you can
see we need the we have to return the
email first name and the last name and
the genre of all rock music listener so
if you will see select stuff from
customer okay be done this
and if I will see there is no column
name genre okay if I will show you the
schema of this see the genre is here and
the customers is here okay we need the
first name last name and the email ID
and the genre okay and the genre is Will
should be Rock okay so what I can do I
can connect this genre with
track then because here is also track ID
and here is to track IDs then track ID
to invoice line then invoice line to
invoice then invoice to customer with
the customer ID okay this pattern I have
to
follow right so for this I will
write select just copy
this okay just follow the
steps
select distinct
email comma first
name comma last
name
from
customer
join
invoice
on
customer
Dot customer ID
equals
to invoice
do customer uncore
ID then
join
invoice underscore
line
on
invoice do invoice ID
okay then
invoice underscore
ID then
where
track ID should be
in here I will
do
select track
ID okay
from
track then
join then join
genre
yeah
on track dot genre
dot ID equs
to genre
dot genre
ID
where this is important
genre
name
like
rock because we need as you can see
righty to return this this is this and
genre of all rock music
listeners okay
rock right
then order
by
email okay before that let me show you
this track okay select star from track
okay let me show you this
table you can see the name the track ID
album ID Media type genre ID
okay then the composer this this this
bytes and the unit
price
right okay so you know this we have then
this customer okay invoice ID we took
right fine so now what I will do I will
just select this
and okay invoice ID okay invoice ID is
ambiguous here I have to
write
invoice
line do invoice
ID okay let me now
run let me run it okay one more join
genre on track. genre ID there is entry
for table genre but it cannot be
referenced from this part of the query
okay
okay as you can see the here the table
name is JRE _ ID
that was the
mistake okay one more genre.
name spelling
mistake sorry my bad guys sure it
happens okay now you can see we have all
the people who love rock music and we
have the email then first name then the
last name see Adan Mitchell Alexa
Roa a
grber like this cam Dan Edward like this
okay so there are total 59 people who
loves rock music from this particular
database okay now question
two question two is let's Okay first let
me show you let's invite the artists who
have written the most rock music data
set write a query that Returns the
artist name and the total track count on
the top 10 rock bands okay so
let's
invite the
artist who
have
written the
most rock music
in our data
set so
write write a
query that
Returns the artist
name
and and the total account of
track count
of top
10
rock
band so now what we need here okay let
me do
this so what we need here so let's
invite the artists who have the written
the most rock music first we need the
artist okay and the second is rock music
then we need track okay and the total
count total track count means we will
get from the track so
here we have track
column track uh table and we have the
artist so now let's see the schema part
so we have we need
genre okay
for the you know uh rock music then we
have
to combine this Vis the track ID because
J ID is there from track ID to album
because uh we need the artist name see
artist ID and artist ID so this is how
we have to connect the table
now so for this I will write here just
follow the steps select
artist
dot artist
ID
comma artist dot name
comma
count
artist. artist
ID
as number of songs because we need the
total number okay who have written the
most rock music number of
songs fine
from
track now we have to
join
album
on on album
album
ID equals to
track
dot
album
ID okay then we have to join the artist
with artist
ID so join
artist column on the basis of
Artist Artist ID equals to then
album to album.
artist ID
okay so here I have joined the artist to
the album Colum
table okay then I have to join johra to
the track table with the track table
okay so here I will write
join
genre
on genre
dot genre
ID equals
to genre
ID okay sorry track
ID track doj
ID okay so here I will write
where where JRA
dot
name
like
shock
okay loock
fine then I will Group
by my bet Group
by
artist dot artist ID I need the ID as
well then order
by order
by number
of
songs in the descending then limit I
need only 10 rock bands liit will be
10 let me run it
okay let me run
it okay
album
okay now let me run it okay now you can
see this guy let zeppin rid is 22 and
wrote the most songs 144 then U2 122 d
purple 92 then then this this this then
this okay so this is how we solved our
second
question right so now the third
question okay
all the track names names that have a
song Length longer than the average
song Length return return the name and
the millisecond of the each
track ordered by the song
Length
okay so first I will write this
question Q3
three so return all the
track names
that have a
song
Length longer
than the
average strong length Okay first we
return all the track names that have the
song Length longer than the average song
Length okay
then
return the name and
milliseconds for each track
fine after that order by them a by the
songs with
the
longest
song listed
first okay fine so we have to return all
the track names that have a song L and
the
okay first we will find the total length
of this songs then we will do the where
then we will put the V Clause to find
out the
particular uh longest song okay okay so
this is this will do in the two you know
step first you will find the average
strike
length Okay so I will write here
select select name comma
milliseconds
okay
from
track where
milliseconds here I will write
select
average from the
millisecond
okay then I will write here
as
average TR
length Okay then here I will write from
track after this I will write
here order
by
milliseconds I need in the descending
order
okay so let me run
it so now you can see see first I will
uh read it again so return return all
the track names that have a song Length
longer than the average song Length
written the name and the millisecond for
each track order by the song with the
longest song listed first okay so this
is the longest song okay so we have all
the songs which are the longer than the
average song L
right so now moving forward we have
jumped into the advanced set of
questions okay so now we will do the
advanced questions okay so let's see
first find how much amount spent by each
customer on artist WR a query to return
customer name artist name and total SP
okay so first we will write down the
questions okay then question
one question one okay
find how
much
amount
spent by
each
customer on
artist write a
quiry to return
customer
name comma artist
name comma total
Spin and total
spent okay so how to solve this so first
find which artist has earned the most
according to the invoice lines okay
first uh let me show you the schema okay
we need the artist name we need the
customer name and we need the total
spend okay with the invoice line because
the quantity should be there okay so
first we'll see how to join these three
table artist table customer invoice and
invoice line like this okay this is how
we
will you know join the table fine so now
I will tell you the you know steps so
first find which artist has earned the
most according to the invoice line okay
the second now use the artist to find
which customer spent the most on the
artist so for this query you will uh be
need to use the invoice invoice line
track customer album and the artist
table so just remember this one is
tricky because the total spent in the
invoice
table right let me show you so total
spend on the invoice
table might not be a single product so
that is why I was saying we need the
quantity so we need the invoice line
table to find out how many each product
was purchased then we have to multiply
this by the price of each artist okay
fine so now so this is a lengthy one I
will just you know write it for you and
get back to
you yeah so this is how you can see okay
Group by five I have wrote this you can
just you know write
it okay like this okay we took artist
name then sum of invoice line unit price
into invoice line the quantity that I
showed you okay we have multiply this
total with the quantity okay then we
join the table track with invoice album
with track artist with album okay so now
let's run it
yeah so now you can see this H or queen
amount spend 27 the customer ID is this
okay then
Nicholas scer then 18 okay we have
the everything okay customer name artist
name and the total spend this is the
customer Name the artist name and the
total amount they spent fine
so now let's move forward to the next
one which
is
okay okay yeah so the second one is this
we want to find out the most popular
music genre for each country we
determine the most popular genre as a
genre with the highest amount of
purchase so write a query that returns
each country along with the top genre
for countries with the maximum number of
purchases shared return all the genres
okay so what I will do first I will
write the
question okay so we
okay question
do so
find how the
most
popular music
music genre for
each
country okay
determine
determine the
most
popular genre as the
genre with the
highest amount
of
purchase
okay then write a
query that
returns
each
country along with the
top
genre
for
countries where the
maximum number of
purchase
okay
so so there are two parts in this
question first the most popular music
genre and the second is the need of data
at the level okay so we can do it from
the two methods okay using CT and the
using the recursive method so I will use
the using City I will do this city so
for that you have to write
with
popular
genre
as select
count
invoice
line
dot
quantity
okay
as purchases
comma customer
dot
country comma
genre.
name comma genre
dot
gen
ID
okay
then here I will write row
underscore
number
number then I will write
over partition
by customer.
country order
by
count
voice line
dot
quantity okay into descending order
as row
number
okay so
from invoice
line
okay
yeah so here I will join the tables
join invoice
on invoice
do invoice
ID equals
to
invoice
line do invoice
ID okay then again
join
customer on
customer. customer
ID do
idore ID equals to
invoice Dot customer
ID
fine then again we have to join
track track
on track. track
ID equals
to invoice underscore
line dot trackcore
ID
then
join Jo
genre on
genre
dot genre
ID okay
then track dot John
Ry okay then I will do group
by Group by 2 comma 3A 4
then I will do order
by two then ascending
order and then one two descending
order
okay
okay then now I will write
select star from
popular
genre
where row
number is less
than greater than
one okay now let me run
it so now you can see we
have okay will let me read so we have to
find the most popular music genre for
each country okay so now we have the
country name Argentina the most popular
is alternative and punk John R is this
St number is
this okay purchases this then the
Australia this rock rock rock rock rock
okay certain Rock USA Rock and
everything is there right so this is how
you can
find the most popular music genre for
each country okay the last question is
still
here now the last question
is write a query that determines the
customer that has spent the
most on the music for each country right
a query that Returns the country along
with the top customer and how much they
spend okay for the countries where the
top amount of spent is
shared right
and they provide all the customer who
spend this amount okay so for this um
this is like a similar to this question
okay so there are two parts in this
question find the most spent on music
for each country and the second is to
filter the data for the respective
customer it's very easy okay
so okay I will write the solution okay
you can check the question from there I
will write
customer
with
country
as as uh I will here
select customer do customer
ID comma
first
name comma last
name comma
billing billing
country
comma
sum should be
total as
total spending
right then I will
write
zow
number same over we have also written
here
now right the same we have to write here
over then
Partition
by billing
country order
by a
sum
total descending
order as row
number okay so after this I will
write here
from invoice you have to
fetch then again the same thing we have
to join the
table
join
customer on
customer
Dot customer
ID equals to
invoice do customer
ID okay then here I will write Group
by by 1A 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma okay
that's
it okay then I will write here order
by
four ASC ascending
order comma
five to descending
order
fine so now I will write here
select start from
customer
with country
where
row
number is one
fine so let me run
it see we have first name last name
billing country total betting row number
and the customer ID let me show you the
code
question here write a query that
determines okay let me make it
okay
yeah so write a query that determines
the customer that has spent the most on
the music so customer we have the
customer name for each country write a
query that return the country along with
this so we have the country name with
the top customer how much they spend we
have the total spending for the
countries where the top amount is shared
that provide all the customer who
has customer who spent this amount okay
so we have everything
here right we have this Le from Brazil
this this this this this okay with the
customer ID so this is how you can solve
these questions so till now I can say
you have a good data analytics skills so
for this I can say this will help you in
the interview of data analyst in data
science or any SQL hello and welcome to
data analytics interview questions my
name is Richard kersner with the
simplylearn team that's www.s simply
learn.com get certified get
ahead today we're going to jump into
some common questions you might see on
numpy arrays and Panda's data frames in
the python along with some Excel Tableau
and
SQL let's start with our first question
what is the difference between Data
Mining and data
profiling it's really important to note
that data mining is a process of finding
relevant information which has not been
found before it is a way in which raw
data is turned into valuable information
you can think of this as anything from
the
cells uh stats and from their SQL Server
all the way to web scraping and Census
Bureau information where the heck do you
mine it from where do you get all this
data and information
then we look at data profiling is
usually done to assess a data set for
its uniqueness consistency and logic it
cannot identify incorrect or inaccurate
data values so if somebody has a
statistical analysis on one side and
they're doing their you might the wrong
data to then program your data setup so
you got to be aware that when you're
talking about data mining you need to
look at the Integrity of what you're
bringing in where it's coming from data
profiling is looking at it and saying
hey how is this going to work what's the
log what's the consistency is it related
to what I'm working with find the term
data wrangling and data analytics data
wrangling is a process of cleaning
structuring and enriching the raw data
into a desired usable format for better
decision making and you can see a nice
chart here with our Discover it we
structure the data how we want it we
clean it up get rid of all those null
values we enrich it so we might take and
reformat some of the settings instead of
having uh five different terms for
height of somebody you know an American
English or whatever who clean some of
that up and we might do a calculation
and bring some of them together and
validate I was just talking about that
in the last one need to validate your
data make sure you have a solid data
source and and then of course it goes
into the analysis very important to
notice here in data wrangling 80% of
data analytics is usually in this whole
part of wrangling the data getting it to
fit correctly and don't confuse that
with data cooking which is actually when
you're going into neural networks
cooking the data so it's all be between
zero and one
values what are common problems that
data analysts encounter during
analysis handling duplicate and missing
values collecting the meaningful right
data the right time making data secure
in dealing with compliance issues
handling data purging and storage
problems again we're talking about data
wrangling here 80% of most jobs are in
wrangling that data and getting it in
the right format making sure it's good
data to
use number four what are the various
steps involved in any analytics
project understand the problem we might
spend 80% doing wrangling but you better
be ready to understand the problem
because if you can't you're going to
spend all your time in the wrong
direction this is probably uh the most
important part of the process everything
after it falls in and then you can come
back to it two data collection data
cleaning number three four data
exploration analysis and five interpret
the results number five is a close
second for being the most important if
you can't interpret what you bring to
the table to your clients you're in
trouble so when this question comes up
you probably want to focus on those two
noting that the rest of it does 80% of
the work is in two three and four while
one and five are the most important
parts which technical tools have you use
for analysis and presentation purposes
being a data analyst you are expected to
have knowledge of the below tools for
analysis and presentation purposes
there's a wide variety out there uh SQL
Server
MySQL you have your Excel your SPSS
which is the IBM platform tblo python uh
you have all these different Tools in
here now certainly a lot of jobs are
going to be narrowed in on just a few of
these tools like you're not going to
have a Microsoft SQL Server MySQL server
but you better understand how to do
basic SQL polls and also understanding
Excel and how the different formats um
for column and how to get those set
up number six what are the best
practices for data cleaning this is
really important to remember to go
through this in detail these always come
up because 80% of uh most data analysis
is in cleaning the data make a data
cleaning plan by understanding where the
common errors take place and keep
Communications open identify and remove
duplicates before working with the data
this will lead to an effective data
analysis process focus on the accuracy
of the data maintain the value types of
data provide mandatory constraints and
set Cross Field validation standardize
the data at the point of entry so that
is less chaotic and you will be able to
ensure that all the information is
standardized leading to fewer errors on
Entry number seven how can you handle
missing values in a data set listwise
deletion and listwise deletion method
entire record is excluded from analysis
if any single value is missing sometimes
we're talking about records remember
this could be a single line in a
database so if you have uh your SQL
comes back and you have 15 different
columns every one of those that has a
missing value you might just drop it
just to make it easy because you already
have enough data to do the processing
average imputation use the average value
of the responses from the other
participants to fill in the missing
value this is really useful uh and
they'll ask you why these are useful I
guarantee it uh if you have a whole
group of data that's collected and it
doesn't have that information in it at
that point you might average it in there
regression substitution you can use
multiple regression analysis to estimate
a missing value that kind of goes with
the average imputation input uh
regression model means you're just going
to get you're going to actually generate
a prediction as to what you think that
value should be for those people based
on the ones you do have multiple
imputation so we talk about multiple
inputs uh it creates plausible values
based on the correlations for the
missing data and then averages the
simulated data sets by incorporating
random errors in your
predictions what do you understand by
the term normal distribution and the
second you hear the word normal
distribution should be thinking a bell
curve like we see here normal
distribution is a type of continuous
probability distribution that is
symmetric about the mean and in the
graph normal distribution will appear as
a bell curve the mean median and mode
are equal that's a quick way to know if
you have normal distribution is you can
compute mean median and mode all of them
are located at the center of the
distribution 68% of the data lies within
one standard deviation of the mean 95%
of the data Falls within two standard
deviations of the mean 99.7% the data
lies within three standard deviations of
the
mean what is time series analysis time
series analysis is a statistical method
that deals with ordered sequence of
values of a variable of equally spaced
time intervals time series data on a
covid-19 cases and you can see we're
looking at by days so our space is of
days and each day goes by if we take and
graph it you can see a Time series graph
always looks really nice we have like
two different in this case we have what
the United States going over there I'd
have to look at the other setup in there
but they picked a couple different
countries uh and it is is time sensitive
you know the next result is based on
what the last one was CO's an excellent
example of this uh anytime you do any
word analytics where you're figuring out
what someone's saying what they said
before makes a huge difference as what
they're going to say next another form
of Time series
analysis 10 how is joining different
from blending in Tabo so now we're going
to jump into the tblo package data
joining data joining can only be done
when the data comes from the same Source
combining two tables from the same
database or two or more worksheets from
the same Excel file all the combined
tables or sheets contains common set of
dimensions and
measures data blending data blending is
used when the data is from two or more
different sources combining the Oracle
table with the SQL server or two sheets
from Excel or combining Excel sheet and
Oracle table in data blending each data
source contains its own set of
dimensions and
measures how is overfitting different
from
underfitting always a good one uh
overfitting probably the biggest uh
danger in data analytics today is
overfitting model trains from the data
too well using the training set the
performance drops significantly over the
test set happens when the model learns
the noise and random fluctuations in the
training data set in detail and again
the performance drops way below what the
test set has the model neither trains
the data well nor can generalize to new
data performs poorly both on train and
the test set happens when there is less
data to build and an accurate model and
also when we try to build a linear model
with a nonlinear
data in Microsoft Excel a numeric value
Val can be treated as a text value if it
proceeds with an apostrophe definitely
not an exclamation uh if you're used to
programming in Python you'll look for
that hash code and not an Amber
sign and we can see here uh if you enter
the value 10 into a field but you put
the apostrophe in front of it it will
read that as a text not as a
number what is the difference between
count count a count blank and and count
if in
Excel we can see here when we run in
just count D1 through
d23 we get 19 and you'll notice that
there is 19 numbers coming down here and
so it doesn't count the cost of each
which is a top bracket it doesn't count
the blank spaces either with the
straight count when you do a count a
you'll get the answer is 20 so now when
you do count a it counts all of them
them even the title cost of
each when you do count blank we'll get
three why there's three blank
fills and finally the count if if we do
count if of E1 to e23 is greater than 10
there's 11 values in there basic
counting of whatever is in your column
pretty solid on the table
there explain how vlookup Works in
Excel vlookup is used when you you need
to find things in a table or a range by
Row the syntax has four different parts
to it uh we have our lookup value that's
a value you want to look up we have our
table
array uh the range where the lookup
value is
located column index number the column
number and range that contains the
return value and the range lookup
specify true if you want an approximate
match or false if you want an exact
match of the return value
so here we see V lookup F3 A2 to C8 2
comma 0 for prints now they don't show
the F3 F3 is the actual um cell that
prints is in that's what we're looking
at is F3 so there's your prints he pulls
in from F3 A2 to C8 is the the data
we're looking into and then number two
is a column in that data so in this case
we're looking for uh uh age and we count
name as one ages two keep in mind this
is Excel versus a lot of your um Python
and programming languages where you
start at zero in Excel we always look at
the cells as one two three so two
represents the age zero is uh false for
having an exact matchup versus one we
don't actually need to worry about that
too much in this zero or one would work
with this example and you can see with
the Angela lookup again her name would
be in the F column number four that's
what the F4 stands for is where where
they pulled Angela from and then you
have A1 to C8 and then we're looking at
uh number three so number three is
height name being one age two and then
height three and you'll see here it
pulls in her height
5.8 so we're going to run jump over to
uh SQL how do you subset or filter data
in
SQL to subset or filter data in SQL we
use where and having clause and you can
see we have a nice table on the left
where we have the title the director the
year the duration we want to filter the
table for movies that were directed by
Brad Bird um why just because we want to
know who what Brad Bird did so we're
going to do select star you should know
that the star refers to all in this case
we what are we going to return we're
going to return all title directory year
and duration that's what we mean by all
from movies movies being our table where
director equals Brad Bird and you can
see um he comes back and he did the
incredible on RIT
2E to subset or filter data SQL we can
also use the wear and having claws so
we're going to take a closer look at the
um different ways we can filter it here
filter the table for directors whose
movies have an average duration greater
than 115 minutes so there's a lot of
really cool things into this SQL query
and these SQL queries can get pretty
crazy select director some duration as
total duration average duration as
average duration from movies Group by
director having average duration greater
than
115 uh so again what are we going to
return we're going to return whatever we
put in our select which in this case is
director we're going to have total
duration and that's going to be the sum
of the duration we're going to have the
average duration average underscore
duration which is going to be the
average duration on there and then we of
course go ahead and group by director
and we want to make sure we group them
by uh anyone that has an having an
average duration greater than
115 these SQL queries are so important I
don't know how many times your the SQL
comes up and there's so many different
other languages not just MySQL and not
Microsoft SQL but in addition to that
where the SQL language comes in
especially with Hadoop and other areas
so you really should know your basic
SQL doesn't hurt to get that little um
cheat sheet and glance over and double
check some of the different features in
SQL what is the difference between wear
and having clause in SQL where wear
Clause works on row data in wear Clause
the filter occurs before any groupings
are made aggregate functions cannot be
used uh so the syntax is select your
columns from table where what the
condition is having Clause works on
aggregated data having is used to filter
values from a group aggregate functions
can be used in the syntax is Select
column names from table where the
condition is grouped by having a
condition ordered by column
names what is the correct Syntax for
reshaped function in numpy so we're
going to jump to the numpy array program
and what you come up with is you have uh
in this case be numpy do reshape a lot
of times you do an import numpy as in P
reshape and then your array and then new
shape and you can see here as we uh as
the actual um example comes in the
reshape is a and we're going to reshape
it in two comma five uh setups and you
can see the print out in there that
prints in two rows with five values in
each
one what are the different ways to
create a data frame in
pandas well we can do it by initializing
a list so you can Port your pandas as PD
very common data equals Tom 30 Jerry 20
Angela 35 we'll go ahead and create the
data frame and we'll say uh pd. datf
frame is the data columns equals name
and age so you can designate your
columns you can also designate index in
there should always remember that the
index uh in this case maybe you want the
index instead of one two to be um the
date they signed up or who knows you
know whatever and you can see right
there it just generates a nice pandas
data frame with Tom Jerry and Angel
another way you can initialize a uh data
frame is from dictionary you can see
here we have a dictionary where the date
equals name Tom Jerry Angela Mary age is
20 21 19 18 and if we do a DF
pd. dataframe on the data you'll get a
nice the same kind of setup you get your
name age Tom Jerry Angela and
Mary write the python code to create an
employees data frame from the empcs v
file and display the head and summary of
it to create a data frame in Python you
need to import the panda library and use
the read CSV function to load the CSV
file and here you can see where we have
import pandas as PD employees or the
data frame employees equals pd. read CSV
and then you have your path to that CSV
file there's a number of settings in the
read CSV where you can tell it how many
rows are the top index uh you can set
the columns in there you can have uh
skip rows there's all kinds of things
you can also go in there and double
check with your read CSV but the most
basic one is just to read a basic
CSV how will you select the department
and age columns from an employees data
frame so we have import pandas as PD you
can see we have created our data uh we
will go ahead and create our employees
PD data frame on the left and then on
the right to select department and age
from the data frame name uh we just do
employees and you put the brackets
around it now if you're just doing one
column you could do just department but
if you're doing multiple columns you got
to have those in a second set of
brackets so it's got to be a reference
with a list within the
reference what is the criteria to say
whether a developed data model is good
or not a good model should be intuitive
insightful and
self-explanatory follow the old saying
kiss keep it simple the model developed
should be able to easily consumed by the
clients for actionable and profitable
results so if they can't read it what
good is it a good model should easily
adapt to changes according to business
requirements we live in quite a dynamic
world nowadays so that's pretty
self-evident and if the data gets
updated the model should be able to
scale accordingly to the new data so you
have a nice data pipeline going where
when something when you get new data
coming coming in you don't have to go
and rewrite the whole
code what is the significance of
exploratory data
analysis exploratory data analysis is an
important step in any data analysis
process exploratory data analysis Eda
helps to understand the data better it
helps you obtain confidence in your data
to a point where you're ready to engage
a machine learning algorithm it allows
you to refine your selection of feature
variables that will be used later for
model building you can discover hidden
Trends and insights from the data how do
you treat outliers in a data set an
outlier is a data point that is distant
from other similar points they may be
due to variability in the measurement or
may indicate experimental
errors uh one you can drop the outlier
records pretty straightforward you can
cap your outlier data so it doesn't go
past a certain value you can assign it a
new value you can also try a new
transformation to see if those outliers
come in if you transform it slightly
differently explain descriptive
predictive and prescriptive analytics
descriptive provides insights into the
past to answer what has happened uses
data aggregation and data mining
techniques examples an ice cream company
can analyze how much ice cream was sold
which flavors were sold and whether more
or less ice cream was sold than before
predictive understands the future to the
answer what could happen uses
statistical models and forecasting
techniques example predicts the sale of
ice creams during the summer spring and
rainy days uh so this is always
interesting because you have your
descriptive which comes in and your
businesses are always looking to know
what happened hey did we have good sales
last uh quarter what are we expecting
next quarter in sales and we have a huge
jump when we do uh
prescriptive suggest various courses of
action to answer what should you do uses
optimization and simulation algorithms
to advise possible outcomes example
lower prices to increase sell of ice
creams produce more or less quantities
of certain flavor of ice cream and we
can certainly uh today's world with the
covid virus because we had that on our
earlier graph you could see that as a
descriptive what's happened how many
people have been infected how many
people have died in an area predictive
where do we predict that to
go um do we see it going to get worse is
it going to get better what do we
predict that we're going to need in
hospital beds and
prescriptive what can we change in our
uh setup to have a better outcome uh
maybe if we did more social distancing
if we track the virus how do these
different things directly affect the end
and can we create a better ending by
changing some underlying uh
criteria what are the different types of
sampling techniques used by data
analysists sampling is a statistical
method to select a subset of data from
an entire data set population to
estimate the characteristics of the
whole population one we can do a simple
random sampling so we can just pick out
500 random people in the United States
to sample them you call it a population
in regular data we also call that a
population just because that's where it
came from was mainly from doing
census systematic sampling cluster
sampling
stratified sampling and judgment or
purposive sampling then we have our
systematic sampling that's where you're
doing like uh uh using one five 10 15 20
use a very systematic approach for
pulling samples uh from the setup
cluster sampling uh that's where we look
at it and we say hey some of these
things just naturally group together if
you were talking about population which
is the really a nice way of looking at
this cluster sampling would be maybe by
ZIP code we're going to do everybody's
zip code and just naturally cluster it
that way stratified sampling would be
more uh looking for shared things the
group has like income uh so if you're
studying something on poverty you might
look at their naturally group people uh
based on income to begin with and then
study those individuals in the income to
find out what kind of traits they have
and then judgmental uh that is where
where the uh researcher very carefully
selects each member of their own group
uh so it's very much um based on their
personal
knowledge jumping on the 26 what are the
different types of hypothesis testing
hypothesis testing is a procedure used
by staticians and scientists to accept
or reject statistical hypothesis we
start with the hypothesis testing we
have null hypothesis and alternative
hypothesis on the null hypothesis it
states that there is no relation between
the predictor and the outcome variables
in the population it is denoted by H
notot example there is no association
between patients BMI and
diabetes alternative hypothesis it
states there is some relation between
the predictor and outcome variables in
the population it is denoted by H1
example there could be an association
between Pat patient BMI and
diabetes and that's the body mass index
if you didn't catch the BMI and you're
not in
medical describe univariate B variate
and multivariate
Analysis a univariate analysis it is the
simplest form of data analysis where the
data being analyzed contains only one
variable an example is studying the
heights of players in the
NBA because it's so simple it can be
described using Central Tendencies
dispersion quartiles bar charts
histograms pie charts frequency
distribution tables the B variate
analysis it involves analysis of two
variables Define causes relationships
and correlations between the variables
example analyzing sale of ice creams
based on the temperature outside byari
analysis can be explained using
correlation coefficients linear
regression logistic regression Scatter
Plots and box
plots and multivariate Analysis it
involves analysis of three or more
variables to understand the relationship
of each variable with the other
variables example analyzing Revenue
based on expenditure so if we have our
TV ads we have our newspaper ads our
social media ads and a revenue we can
now compare all those together the multi
verted analysis can be performed using
multiple regression factor analysis
classification and regression trees
cluster analysis principal component
analysis clustering bar chart dual axis
chart what function would you use to get
the current date and time in Excel in
Excel you can use the today and now
function to get the current date and
time and you can see down here with the
two examples were just equals today or
equals
Now using the sum ifs function function
in Excel find the total quantity sold by
cells Representatives whose names start
with a and the cost of each item they
have sold is greater than
10 and you can see here on the left we
have our actual table and then we want
to go ahead and sum ifs so we want the
uh E2 through E20 B2 through B20 greater
than 10 and this basically is just
saying hey we're going to take
everything in the u e column and we're
going to sum it up but only those
objects where the D column is greater
than 10 that's what that means
there is the below query correct if not
how will you Rectify it select customer
ID year order date as order Year from
order where order year is greater than
or equal to
2016 and hopefully you caught it right
there uh it's in the devils in the
details we can't not use the Alias name
while filtering data using the wear
Clause so the correct format is all the
same except for where it says where the
year order date is greater than or equal
to 16 versus using the order year which
we assign under the select
setup how are union intersect and accept
used in
SQL the union operator is used to
combine the results of two or more
select
statements and you can see here we have
select star from region one and we're
going to make a union with select star
from region two and it basically takes
both these SQL tables and combines them
to form a full new table on there so
that's your union as we bring everything
together when we look at the intersect
operator Returns the common records that
are the result of the two or more select
statements so you can see here we select
star from region one intersect select
star from region two and we come up with
only those records that are shared that
have the same data in them and hopefully
you jumped uh ahead to the accept the
accept operator returns The Uncommon
records that are the result of two or
more select statements so these are the
two records or the records that are not
shared between the two
databases using the product price table
write an SQL query to find the record
with the fourth highest market
price so here we have a little bit of a
brain teaser uh they're always fun and
the first thing we want to do is we're
going to go ahead and uh I'm going to if
you look at the uh script on the left we
really want the fourth one down so we're
going to select the top four from
product price but we're going to order
it by market price descending SP order
by market price ascending so we do is we
take the top four of the market price
ascending and that's going to give us
the four greatest values and then we're
going to reverse that order and do
descending and we're going to take the
top one of that which is going to give
us the lowest value which will be the
fourth greatest one in the
list from the product price table find
the total and average market price for
each currency where the average market
price is greater than 100 and currency
is in the r or the
AUD so um INR or AUD India ruple or
Australia dollar you can see over here
the SQL query if you had trouble putting
this together uh you might actually do
some of it in reverse and you can see
right here where the average market
price is greater than 50 remember we use
having not where at the end because it's
part of the group so Group by currency
because we want those two currencies and
we want the currency India rou the INR
or the
AUD and um as you keep going backwards
we're actually going to be selecting the
currency the Su of the market price as
total price and the average market price
as average price so there's our select
it's going to come from the product
price which is just our table over there
and then we have where our currency is
in uh and like I said you can put
together however you want but hopefully
you got to the end
there so this question will test your
knowledge in table exploring the
different features of table and creating
a suitable graph to solve a business
problem and of course table is very
visual in its use so it's very hard to
test it without actually just getting
your hands on and if you can't visualize
some of this and how to do it then you
should go back and refresh yourself
using the sample superstor data set
Create A View to analyze the sales
profits and quantity sold across
different subcategories of items present
under each category so the first first
step is to go ahead and load the sample
superstor data set so make sure you know
how to load the sample the superstore
data set that's underneath either the
connect button in the upper left um or
the um tblo icon up there and be able to
pull in the data set and then once
you've done that you just drag the
category and subcategory on rows and
salaries onto columns it will result in
a horizontal bar
chart so in this one we're just going to
drag profit onto color and quantity onto
label sort the sales axes in descending
order of sum and cells within each
subcategory and if you're at home doing
this you'll see that chairs under
Furniture category had the highest sales
and profit while tables had the lowest
profit for office supplies subcategory
binders made the highest profit even
though storage had the highest sales
under technology category copers made
the highest profit though it was the
least amount of
sales let's work to create a dual axis
chart in Tabo to present sales and
profits across different years using
sample superstor data set load the
orders sheet from the sample superstor
data
set drag the ordered data field from the
dimensions onto columns and convert it
into continuous
month drag sells onto rows and profits
to the right corner of the view and
until you see a light green rectangle
one of those things if you haven't done
this Hands-On you don't know what you're
doing you're you're going to run into a
buy you're going to be just kind of
dropping it and wondering what happened
synchronize the right axes by right
clicking on the profit
axis and then let's finalize it by going
under the marks card change some cells
to bar and some profit to line and
adjust the size and then we have a nice
display that we can either print out or
save and send off to the uh
shareholders let's go and do one more
table uh design a view in Tabo to show
state wise sales and profits using the
sample Superstore data set in here you
go ahead and drag the country field onto
the view section and expand it to see
the states drag the states filled onto
size and profit onto
color increase the size of the bubbles
add a border and a Halo color States
like Washington Washington California
New York have the highest sales and
profits while Texas Pennsylvania and
Ohio have a good amount of sales but the
least amount of
profits we'll go ahead and Skip back to
python numpy Suppose there is an array
number equals NP or numpy if you're
using numpy depending on how you set it
up do array and we just have one to nine
broken up into three groups extract the
value8 using 2D indexing so you can see
the left we have our import numpy as NP
number equals our NP array if we print
the number we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
since the value eight is present in the
second row and First Column we use the
same index position and pass it to the
array and you just have number two comma
one and you get eight and remember we're
in Python so you start at zero not one
like you do in Excel always gets me if
I'm working between Excel and python
where I just kind of flip and usually
it's the Excel that messes up because I
do a lot more
programming suppose there's an array
that has value 01 all the way up to nine
how will you display the following
values from the array 1 3 5
79 uh so first all we go and create the
array uh np. a range of 10 which goes
from zero to nine because there's 10
numbers in it but we don't include the
10 we print it out the first thing you
want to do is what's going on here with
with 1 3 5 7 9 well if we divide by two
there's going to be a remainder equal to
one and then from python remember that
if you use the percentage sign you get
the uh remainder on there so the
remainder is one and then you have the
your numpy array and then we just want
to do um a logical statement of all
values that have a remainder of one and
that generates our nice
13579 there are two arrays A and B stack
the arrays A and B
horizontally boy these horizontal
vertical questions will get you every
time and in numpy we go ahead and we've
created uh two different arrays over
here A and B uh the first one is your
concatenate np.
concatenate A and B on axes equal
one that is the same as
hstack and in the back end they're still
identical they run the same that's all h
is a concatenate axes equals
1 how can you add a column to a panda
data frame suppose there's an imp data
frame that has information about few
employees let's add address column to
that data frame and you can see in the
left we have our basic data frame uh you
should know your data frames very well
uh basically looks like an Excel
spreadsheet as you come over here it's
really simple you just do um DF of
address equals the address once you've
assigned values to the
address using the below given data
create a pivot table to find the total
cells made by each cells represented for
each item display the cells as a
percentage of the grand total so we're
back in uh Tabo select the entire table
range click on insert Tab and choose
pivot
table select a table range and the
worksheet where you want to place the
pivot table it will return a pivot table
where you can analyze your
data uh drag the cell total on the
values in sales rep an item onto row
labels it'll give the sum of the CES
made by each representative for each
item they have
sold and finally right click on sum of
sell total and expand show values as to
select percentage of grand
total uh real important just to
understand what a pivot table is we're
just pivoting it from rows and columns
and switching this direction on there
and finally uh we have our final pivot
table and you can see the values roles
and sum of total
sale so we're going to go ahead and take
a product table this is off of an SQL so
we're going to do some SQL here and
we're going to use the product and sales
order detail table find the products
that have total units sold greater than
1.5 million and here's our sales order
de detail table so we have a product
table and a sales order detail table two
separate tables in the database and
we're going to do is put together the
SQL query we want to select PP name sum
sod unit price as Sals and then we have
a pp. product ID from production product
as PP inter jooin sales. salesorder
detail as sod on PP product ID equals s.
product ID Group by pp. name comma pp.
product ID having a sum of s. un price
greater than uh the 150 million there
that's a mouthful and again these SQL
queries they start looking really crazy
until you just break them apart and do
them step by step and what we're looking
for is the inner join and how did you do
the group ey that's really one they know
how do you do this inner join this comes
up so much in SQL uh how do you pull in
the ID from one chart and the
information from another chart and the
sum totals on that
chart how do you write a stored
procedure in SQL let's create a storage
procedure to find the sum the squares of
the first in natural numbers so here we
have our formula n * n + 1 * 2 n + 1/ 6
and you can see from the command prompt
uh or the setup you have depending on
what your login is the command is create
procedure Square sum one
declare a variable at n of integer as
begin then we're going to declare the
sum of integer Set sumal n * n + 1 + 2 *
n + 1 um over 6 and then of course we
can go ahead and print those out print
First cast um IGN n or a variable as a
variable character 20 natural numbers
print the sum of the square is cast the
at sum as a variable character 40 end
then we do the output display the sum of
the square for first four natural
numbers we have execute Square sum one
and then we're going to put in four and
you can see here where brings up the
first four natural numbers sum of square
is
30 write a store procedure to find the
total even number between two user given
numbers couple things to note here first
we go and create our procedure you have
your two different variables the N1 n
two and we go ahead and begin we're
going to declare our variable count as
an integer we're going to set count
equal to zero and then we have while n
is less than N2 we're going to begin and
if N1 remainder 2 equals zero so we're
going to divided by two even number
begin we're going to set the count equal
to count plus one we're going to print
even number plus cast in as a variable
character 10 for printing count is plus
cast variable count as variable
character 10 and else print odd number
plus cast variable number one as
variable character 10 and then we go
ahead and set the um increment our
variable one up one so they go from n
one all the way to n two and it'll print
the total number of even numbers and you
can see here we went ahead and executed
it we're going to count the even numbers
between 30 and 45 and you just see it
goes all the way down to
eight what is a difference between tree
maps and heat maps in
Tabo now if you've worked in Python
other programmingsoftware
see the squares over here this is our
tree map over here with the each block
also has its information inside of its
different
blocks a heat map helps to visualize
measures against Dimensions with the
help of colors and size to compare one
or more dimensions and up to two
measures the layout is similar to a text
table with variations in values encoded
as colors in heat map you can quickly
see a wide array of information and in
this one uh you can see the use the
colors to denote one thing and the size
of the little square to denote something
else a lot of times you can even graph
this into a threedimensional graph with
other data uh so it pops out but again a
heat map is the color and the
size using the sample superstor data set
display the top five and bottom five
customers based on their profit so you
start by dragging the customer name
filled onto rows and profit on columns
rightclick on the customer name column
to create a set give a name to the set
and select top tab to choose top five
customers by some profit similarly
create a set for the bottom five
customers by su
profit select both the sets right click
to create a combined set give a name to
the set and choose all members in both
sets and then you can drag top and
bottom customer sets onto the filters
and profit field on on to color to get
the desired
results as we get down to the end of our
list we're going to try to keep you uh
on your toes we're going to skip back to
numpy how to print four random integers
between 1 and 15 using numpy to Generate
random numbers using numpy we use the
random random integer function you can
see here we did the import numpy is in P
random Arrangement equals np. random.
random integer 1 through 15 of
four from the below data frame going to
jump again on you now we're into pandas
how will you find the unique values for
each column and subset the data for age
less than 35 and height greater than six
to find the unique values and the number
of unique elements use the unique and
the in unique
function you can see here we just did DF
height so we're selecting just the
height column and we want to look for
The Unique
that returns an array where in unique if
we do that on the height or the age we
return just the number of unique values
and then we can do a subset the data for
ages less than 35 and height greater
than six so if you look over here we
have a new DF uh remember this is going
to be taking slices of our original data
frame it doesn't actually change the
data frame so our new DF equals the data
frame or DF the data frame where age is
less than 35
and the height is greater than
six and in case you're not using TBL
blue which has a lot of its own uh
different mapping programs in there make
sure you understand how to use the
basics of matap plot Library plot assign
graph using numpy and matplot library
and Python and the way we did this is we
went ahead and generate an X we know our
y equals np. sin of x if you print out X
you'll see a whole value here our map
plot Library P plot as PLT if you are
working in Jupiter notebook make sure
you understand the matplot library
inline that little percentage sign M
plot Library inline that prints it on
the page in the Jupiter notebook the
newer version of Jupiter notebook or
Jupiter Labs automatically does that for
you but I usually put it in there just
in case I end up on an older version if
you print y you can see here we have our
different y values and our different X
values you simply put in PLT do plot XY
and do a plot
show and before we go let's get one more
in we're going to do a pandas uh using
the below Panda's data frame find the
company with the highest average CES
derive the summary statistics for this
sales column and transpose these
statistics that's a mouthful and just
like any of these computer problems
break it apart uh so first of all we're
looking for the highest average cells so
group the company column and use the
mean function to find the average sales
you see here buy company equals DF dog
Group by
company once we've done that using the
describe function we can now go ahead
and look at the summary of statistics on
here use the describe function to find
the summary uh so by company there's are
groups we're just going to describe them
and you could actually bundle those
together if you wanted and just do them
allinone line uh so here we go by
company. discr you can see we have a
nice breakout always good to remember uh
whether you're using any of the packages
whether it's tableblue or uh pandas in
python or even r or some other package
being able to quick look and describe
your data is very important and then we
can go ahead and just do a basic apply a
transpose function over the describe
method to transpose the statistics all
we've done here is flip the index with
the column names but if you're following
the numbers a lot of L of times it's
easier to follow across one line or
maybe you want to average out the count
