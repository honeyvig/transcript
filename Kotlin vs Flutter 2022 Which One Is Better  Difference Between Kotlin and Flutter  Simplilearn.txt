hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn
in this session we will be learning
about two very popular mobile
development platforms that is kotlin and
flutter
in this video tutorial on kotlin vs
flutter we will not only learn about
them but also will compare these two so
let's go ahead and have a look at what
we will be covering today
so we will start with what is kotlin
then we will understand what is flutter
and then we will do the comparison
between kotlin and flutter in various
aspects
and at last we will be learning about
the advantages kotlin and flutter
respectively
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our youtube channel and
press the bell icon to never miss an
update so let's go ahead and learn about
kotlin
so what is kotlin
kotlin is a journal purpose statically
typed programming language developed by
jetbrains in 2010
and later released in 2016.
here statically typed means the type of
the variable is known at the compile
time
kotlin is interoperable with java which
means both the languages can share and
use the information or we can say
we can use kotlin side by side with java
and just like java compiler the kotlin
compiler also generates the byte code
which can run on jvm
that is java virtual machine
it is very easy and friendly language
and kotlin language is developed by
selecting the good features of different
languages like java javascript c-sharp
etc
also in 2017 google announced kotlin as
an official supported language for
android
now as we have understood about kotlin
now let's go ahead and learn about
flutter
so what is flutter
flutter is a user interface toolkit
which was developed by google in 2017
it is not only used to develop mobile
applications but web applications
desktop applications and some embedded
device as well
flutter is not a language but a
development kit which contains all the
necessary libraries tools documentations
etc to build the software
dart is the programming language which
is used in flutter
that was developed by google in 2011
and is very suitable for mobile and web
applications
flutter is an open source framework and
offer a complete package of widgets
tools etc for the development purpose
now let's go ahead and compare both
cortland and flutter in terms of
different aspects so we'll start with
the performance
we'll start with kotlin
the kotlin applications directly
interact with the device which is why
the kotlin apps runs faster than the
flutter apps
also the kotlin code compiles in the
same format of the platform in which it
is written
which is why it is more suitable for
cross-platform mobile app development
and that makes kotlin a robust platform
on the other hand if we look at flutter
its debugging and development process is
quite faster because of its features
which is hot reload and hot restart
these features allows the developers to
change the code instantly and see its
effect which helps in speeding up the
development process and helps in
building apps at much faster rate
although comparing kotlin and flutter is
not that fair because they don't have
the common grounds when it comes to
performance
flutter is a ui toolkit its performance
depends on how the interface of the app
looks and its frames per seconds etc
on the other hand kotlin is a
programming language which is used to
develop android and cross platform apps
so its measurement of performance is bit
different from flutter
both kotlin and flutter have different
approaches and amazing performance
but still if we have to compare them
then flutter has the upper hand because
of its hot reload feature
now let's go ahead and compare kotlin
and flutter in terms of ease of learning
kotlin is quite an easy language
especially if you know java
then it will be very easy for you to
understand and learn this language
because kotlin is inspired from java
language and the users of java language
will find the syntax of kotlin very
familiar
for the beginners also kotlin is an easy
language
learning this language will hardly take
a month because of its concise and easy
to learn syntax
now coming to flutter
to learn flutter first you have to learn
dart programming
to develop web mobile and desktop
applications
which is also an easy language to learn
its documentation is more comprehensive
than
kotlin although kotlin has lesser
learning resources than flutter but
still it is easier to learn it because
in flutter you have to learn the dart
programming from scratch
but it is not so in case of kotlin and
also kotlin syntax is similar to java
which gives kotlin an upper hand
now
let's move on to popularity
kotlin's popularity on github is 40k
stars
which is quite less than flutters
on the other hand flutter's popularity
on github is 98.9 k stars
since its 1.0 release which is quite
good
however as per google trends comparison
the difference between average interest
is not that much between flutter and
kotlin
cotton language lies at 72 and flutter
language lies at 76
in terms of average popularity out of
100.
as per stack overflow the percentage of
stack overflow questions for flutter is
approx 2.50
and for kotlin it is 1.17 percent
now
moving to the fourth comparison which is
integration of third-party libraries
kotlin language doesn't require a set of
libraries and tools to make a connection
because it works with native platform
ecosystem
the app developers can deploy the same
libraries and third party tools instead
of making new
one on the other hand flutter is a ui
development tool
so it needs third party libraries and
tools to make a connection with native
environment
now
last comparison would be the apps
developed by kotlin and flutter
kotlin has developed many apps including
vmware pinterest coursera zometo netflix
and uber etc
on the other hand flutter has developed
apps including cryptograph google ads
post muse hamilton app tree etc
so as we have compared both kotlin and
flutter
now next we will be moving to the
advantages of kotlin
first we will start with null safety
null safety is one of the most
innovative feature that comes with
gotling language
this null safety feature eliminates the
risk of null pointer exception
the kotlin type system helps in
differentiating between nullable and
non-nullable references
and kotlin doesn't compile the code
which tries to return null
next advantage is robust performance
as we already discussed that in kotlin
language the code we write is compiled
in the same format as the platform of
which it is planned
this feature provides the performance to
the native app development which makes
cotton language a robust platform
next is easy to learn syntax
kotlin language is easy and simple to
comprehend
it is inspired from languages like java
c-sharp etc
its syntax is also quite similar and
less strict to java
due to its similarity with java the
users who knew java found this language
very familiar to java and easy to grasp
also due to its interoperable nature
with java both languages can co-exist
which make things easier for developers
next advantage is kotlin is concise and
easy to maintain
in kotlin language you don't have to
write extra code
unlike java you don't have to write the
entire code you can simply write the
same code with fear lines
also kotlin has a single code base that
makes it a stable language for
development and you can easily detect
errors before running the code
now moving on to the advantages of
flutter
so first advantage is hot reload feature
of flutter
this feature allows you to see the
change that you have created like fixing
bugs building user interface etc
and those changes are then reflected
instantly
also it helps you to write the code
faster with ease
next advantage is flutters less
development cost
in flutter you have the advantage of
using the same code because of native
app development
which allows us to reuse most part of
the code
this helps in cutting the development
time and resources along with that it
helps in reducing the budget up to 30 to
40 percent
next is widgets
flutter sdk comes with numerous widgets
which offers many capabilities
these widgets helps in making the app
attractive
it is used to display it is used to
design something and it is also used to
handle the interactions as well
the choice of widgets is responsible for
the design or view of the screen
now
moving on to the next advantage which is
mvp
mvp and prototype development
here mvp stands for minimum viable
product
it is a simpler version of the app or
software that solves the problem
statement
mvp helps in giving the true potential
of the idea
it helps in attracting the interest of
the users in the product
that you are planning to launch
flutter is a cross-platform development
tool so minimum time and resources are
needed and can be assessed if the idea
is good or not
so these were some advantages of kotlin
and flutter
and with that we have come to the end of
this session if you like this video
