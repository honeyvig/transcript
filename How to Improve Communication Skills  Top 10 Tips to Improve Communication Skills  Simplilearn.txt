that will help you improve your
communication skills the first one is to
be an active listener being a good
listener is as essential as a being good
speaker it enhances the quality of your
verbal instruction for example you
should first listen to everyone speaking
without interrupting them in the middle
it will not only help you process the
information and put your points forth
but it will also give people the
impression that you were listening to
them carefully an active listener should
keep the following points in his mind
receiving understanding remembering
evaluating and responding moving on the
second hack is think before you speak
this hack is very important in today's
era by managing their thoughts in
advance one can eradicate many account
statements and pauses while talking it

more concisely for example when you are

points arrange them properly and present
them it will not only boost your
confidence but also help you give an
amazing presentation without any hurdles
the third hack we have is be clear and
concise the most effective way to convey
your points is to make it clear and
concise avoiding using complex convo tip
sentences and try to State your
arguments in plain language before
saying ask yourself what is the most
evident way I can make my point and the
fourth one that we will see is speak
with confidence speaking confidently
will unable you to build confidence and
control the affection of your audience
several elements can affect your ability
to speak confidently including your
knowledge of this subject phrases chosen
tone of voice body language and many
more for example while you are
presenting your confidence is one that
will attract the audience you must keep
eye contact with your audience and speak
clearly when explaining the fifth hack
is look where your vocal tones now the
tone is the most important aspect while
speaking if used wisely it can do
wonders for one but if used harshly it
can also worsen matters while speaking
we should always remember that our tone
is subtle and not monotonous speaking
continuously would eventually bore your
audience and probably reveal your
interest instead highlight key points
with voice modulation and convey emotion
with different voice pictures this will
maintain your audience interest in what
you have to convey at 6 we will discuss
be aware of non-verbal communication
cues while speaking your body language
affects how other would analyze your
words and thoughts always pay attention
to your gesture facial expressions and
body language to ensure they align with
the messages you are trying to convey
for example hand movements during a
presentation will help you to convey
this better seventh is to think about
your audience perspective just because
you have a strong knowledge of a topic
doesn't mean the people you speak to
have the same knowledge as you try to
think about how somebody else will
understand what you are trying to convey
especially if they lack the technical
facts about a subject you own for
example use phrases such as I hope you
have a general understanding about it to
ask them whether they are familiar with
the subject you are discussing I would
like to explain it then briefing
introduced to the topic Etc the eighth
is to write things down take notes while
talking to somebody or when you are in a
discussion do not depend on your memory
prefer sending a follow-up email to
ensure you understand what was being
spoken during the discussion for example
note all the important points whenever
you are in a meeting to help if you
write questions or understand better the
ninth is treat everyone equally treating
everyone equally when communicating
whether in person or online is important
every individual earns to be respected
and hurt no matter who they are or their
position treating others respectfully
will facilitate them to do the same to
you and make a more positive atmosphere
for everyone involved for example
teachers should treat all students
equally while responding to questions
from students and the last one is to
maintain a positive attitude and smile
smiling and giving a pleasant attitude
are important while communicating
smiling sadly shows you are friendly and
approachable while maintaining a
positive attitude shows your confident
