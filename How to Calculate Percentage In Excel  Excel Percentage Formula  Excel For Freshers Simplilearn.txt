hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel
in this session we will be learning
about how to calculate percentage in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is calculating percentage in
excel
now let's get into practical move
so on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet
so we will be calculating what are the
total marks obtained by the students in
overall subjects and calculate what is
the percentage now we will carry forward
a few simple inbuilt functions in excel
to calculate that
first we will be calculating the sum of
marks so here
equals to
sum function
and select the range of cells
close the bracket press enter
so you have the sum now
so we have to calculate it repeat so by
clicking on the same formula now we have
the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing
407 by 500 and then we will be
multiplying that into 100 so that's how
we calculate the percentage
so
cell
g2
divided by
cell h2 press enter and you will end up
with you know uh the decimal format
that's perfectly all right
now we have also extended the same
formula for all our cells
now select this overall column or select
the highlighted cells
right and get into the data type here
you have general so
that's why we have got that
decimal format but when you press
percentage you'll have the actual
percentage of all the students according
to their marks achieved
so that's how you calculate percentage
in excel so with that we have come to an
end of this tutorial on how to calculate
percentage in excel if we have any
