now and join the course the course link
is mentioned in the description box now
let's get started started so let's first
start with understanding the basics so
what exactly is data science think of it
as Art and Science of extracting useful
information from the data it is a mix of
various Fields like computer science
statistics and domain specific knowledge
data science helps organizations make
better decisions predict future Trends
and improve their operations a data
scientist is like a detective who uses
and uncover hidden patterns and insight
they have to know progr programming
understand statistics and have a good
domain knowledge now basically
statistics and probability are your best
friends here you will need to understand
Concepts like mean median mode variance
standard deviations and probability
distributions these are the building
blocks of data analysis now next process
is learning a language now what
programming language you're going to
choose so I'll refer you to take on
python python is a great choice because
of its Simplicity and vast number of its
Library available for data science start
with Basics like variables data types
control structures like FNL loops and
functions once you are comfortable in
Python dive into python libraries like
numpy pandas and Matt plot Li now let us
discuss each of these libraries one by
one so basically first one is numpy now
numpy's primary object is the
homogeneous multi-dimensional array an
array that that can be indexed sliced
and iterated over similarly to list in
Python but with much greater efficiency
you are going to get vectorized
operations numai is going to allow you
for element wise operations and
broadcasting which makes code more
concise and faster compared to python
Loops now the third one is mathematical
functions it also provides a wide array
of mathematical functions like linear
algebra operations random number
generation and for year transforms next
next one we have is pandas now we all
know that pandas is a powerful library
for data manipulation and Analysis it
introduces two primary data structures
series and data frame which are built on
top of numpy if we talk about series
series is a one-dimensional labeled
array capable of holding any data type
next one we have data frame a
two-dimensional labeled data structure
with Columns of potentially different
types similar to a table in database or
an Excel spreadsheet you can also do
data manipulation pandas provide
functions to handle missing datas for
filtering data merge or join data sets
and perform group operations like
aggregation
transformation and finally we have Matt
plotly Now Matt plot La is a powerful
plotting library in Python which is used
for creating static and animated and
also interactive visualizations it is
highly customizable and integrates well
with other libraries such as num p and
pandas the key features of this Library
are that it has versatile plotting
functions it creates a wide range of
plots including line plots Scatter Plots
bar charts histograms Etc next one it
can be used for customizations we can
customize every aspect of a plot such as
titles labels Legends colors and line
style so these were some of the benefits
of using matte plotly now let us move on
to the another programming language
which you can also choose that is R now
if you prefer R it is also a powerful
tool especially in the academics world
so when you are starting out learn the
basics of our and explore libraries like
dplr for data manipulation ggplot 2 for
data visualization and tiyr now next let
us focus on what are the mathematics
that is needed for data science so we
all know that mathematics is a
foundation of data science you don't
need to be a math genius but
understanding some key Concepts will be
very helpful the first one we are going
to choose that is linear algebra learn
about vectors matrices and their
operations this is crucial for
understanding how data is manipulated in
algorithm next you have to focus on
calculus focus on differentiation and
integration partial derivatives and
gradient descent these Concepts help in
understanding how optimization
algorithms work next one we have
statistics and probability get
comfortable with with descriptive
statistics like mean median and mode and
also standard deviation probability
distributions hypothesis testing and
influential statistics these will help
you to make a sense of data and draw
conclusion now let's start with the next
part that is mastering data manipulation
and cleaning data is often messy so
learning how to clean and manipulate it
is very very essential use pandas and
python to read data from different
sources like CSV files or databases
clean the data by handling the missing
values removing duplicates and dealing
with the outliers next one you have to
transform the data as needed and create
a new features to improve your models
now after you have done this you need to
get Hands-On with data
visualization visualization is a key to
understanding data and communicating
your findings start with matplot lib and
cbon in Python to create basic plots
like line bar and Scatter Plots
customize your plots with titles labels
and legends to make them more
informative if you are using R then
ggplot 2 is your gotoo library it uses
the grammar of Graphics to create
beautiful and complex visualizations
with A's next one you have to go for Eda
which stands for exploratory data
analysis Eda is like a detective work
you have to explore the data to uncover
patterns spot anomalies and check
assumptions perform univariate and
bivariate Analysis look at at
correlations and create profiles of the
data this step helps you to understand
data better and guides you to your next
step the next step we have is machine
learning now is the time to get into the
heart of data science that is machine
learning start with unsupervised
learning which includes regression
predicting continuous values or
classification which means predicting
discrete categories then explore
unsupervised learning techniques like
clustering which means grouping similar
data points and dimensionality reduction
which means reducing the number of
features while retaining important
information learn how to evaluate models
using metrics like accuracy precision
recall and F1 score cross validation is
also a technique to assess how well your
model generalizes to unseen data after
this you have completed move on to deep
learning now we all know that deep
learning is a advanced area of machine
learning involving neural networks start
with the basics of neural networks and
then explore more complex architectures
like CNN which means confusional neural
networks for image data and recurrent
neural networks for sequential data
popular Frameworks like tensorflow and
pytorch are great for implementing deep
learning models after you have completed
this move on to NLP now NLP is all about
teaching machines to understand and
generate human language start with teex
P processing techniques like
tokenization stemming and lionization
then explore sentiment analysis topic
modeling and word embeddings like word
and glob to represent Text data in
numerical form after this you have done
go on to exploring Big Data Technologies
now sometimes data is so large that
traditional tools also cannot handle it
and that's where the big data
Technologies come in learn about Hado
ecosystem and Apache spark for big data
processing these tools help you work
with massive data sets efficiently and
after that learn about data Science
Project Life Cycle a typical data
science project follows a life cycle
like this the first phase is problem
definition understand the problem you
are trying to solve The Next Step you
have to move to data collection GA the
relevant data third step involves data
cleaning preparing the data for analysis
at the fourth stage you have to build
the model you have to choose and
implement the right models fifth is the
model evaluation s is the model
performance sixth one is deployment put
the model into production so these are
some of the steps which are involved in
data Science Project Life Cycle now
after you have done all this now it's a
time to apply what you have learned so
you have to do real world projects and
case
studies participate in competitions on
platform like kagle where you can tackle
challenging problems and see how you
stack up against others study successful
data science case studies to understand
how different techniques are applied in
various Industries now I would also
recommend you some of the additional
resources then you can add on while you
are on your journey to become a data
scientist so certain of the books like
python for data analysis by wz mcky is
also recommended then Hands-On machine
learning with psychic learn kiras and
