started data is the new goal imagine how
much data is generated by just your
smartphone every single day be the
pictures you click or the messages you
send nearly 41 million messages are sent
worldwide via WhatsApp every single
minute so safeguarding your personal
data against hackers has now become a
top priority did you know that India
leads the world when it comes to ethical
hackers with 23% of the worldwide
hacking population from India the top
ethical hackers earn more than twice of
what software engineers in India do but
what makes ethical hacking such a
demanding industry ethical hacking is
the process of taking security measures
to safeguard data and networks from
malicious cyber attacks the hackers use
every tool at their disposal to try and
breach the security barrier and find any
potential vulnerabilities the ethical in
ethical hacking denotes the lack of
malicious intent since these sessions
are often permitted by the system owner
or the network that is being hacked into
to fix any compromised entry points
before black hat hackers discover and
exploit them so what is a black hat
hacker you may ask a hacker who exploits
security vulnerabilities for monetary
gains like stealing or destroying
private data altering disrupting or
shutting down websites and networks is
known as a blackhead hacker on the other
end of the spectrum we have white hat
hackers who help people secure the
networks by stress testing the platform
against the most dangerous of cyber
attacks that is with their consent of
course but the most neutral of the bunch
are gray hat hackers who may not ask for
consent before snooping on a foreign
system but they do inform the owner if
they find any vulnerabilities sometimes
in exchange for a small fee the security
breaches have become less and less
prevalent thanks to rigorous ethical
hacking camp campaigns and corporate
awareness programs the ability to fix
critical security issues before blackout
hackers leverage them has saved
organizations billions of dollars Google
IBM Microsoft and virtually every major
corporation are looking to protect the
data so it shouldn't come as a surprise
that ethical hacking and information
security job market is set to rise by
nearly 28% by 2026 but salar is going as
high as
$225,000 perom so that's ethical hacking
wrapped up in 2 minutes we humans are
highly techsavvy in today's times with
the extensive use of the internet and
modern Technologies there is a massive
challenge in protecting all our Digital
Data such as net banking information
account credentials and medical reports
to name a few have you heard about the
deadly one to cry ransomware attack the
attack happened in May 2017 in Asia and
then it spread across the world within a
day more than 230,000 computers were
infected across world 150 countries the
one cry crypto worm encrypted the data
and locked the users out of their
systems for decryption of the data the
users were asked for a ransom of $300 to
$600 in Bitcoin the users who used the
unsupported version of Microsoft Windows
and those who hadn't installed the
security update of April 2017 were
targeted in this attack the one a cry
attack took a toll on every sector top
tier organizations like Itachi Nissan
and and FedEx had to put their
businesses on hold as their systems were
affected too now this is what you call a
Cyber attack to prevent such attacks
cyber security is implemented we can
Define cyber security as the practice of
protecting networks programs computer
systems and their components from
unauthorized digital attacks these
illegal attacks are often referred to as
hacking hacking refers to exploiting
weaknesses in a computer network to
obtain unauthorized access to to
information a hacker is a person who
tries to hack into computer systems this
is a misconception that hacking is
always wrong there are hackers who work
with different motives let's have a look
at three different types of hackers
black hat hackers are individuals who
illegally hack into a system for a
monetary gain on the contrary we have wh
hat hackers who exploit the
vulnerabilities in a system by hacking
into it with permission in order to
defend the organization this form of
hacking is absolutely legal and ethical
hence they are also often referred to as
ethical hackers in addition to these
hackers we also have the gray hat
hackers as the name suggests the color
gray is a blend of both white and black
these hackers discover vulnerabilities
in a system and report it to the
system's owner which is a good act but
they do this without seeking the owner's
approval sometimes gry hat hackers also
ask for money in return for the spotted
vulner
abilities now that you have seen the
different types of hackers let's
understand more about the hacking that
is legal and valid ethical hacking
through an interesting story Dan runs a
Trading Company he does online training
with the money his customers invest
everything was going well and Dan's
business was booming until a hacker
decided to hack the company's servers
the hacker stole the credentials of
various trading accounts he asked for a
lumps some Ransom in exchange for the
stolen credentials Dan took the Hacker's
words lightly and didn't pay the hacker
as a result the hacker withdrew money
from various customers accounts and Dan
was liable to pay back the customers Dan
lost a lot of money and also the trust
of his customers after this incident Dan
gave a lot of thought as to what could
have gone wrong with the security
infrastructure in his company he wished
there was someone from his company who
could have run a test attack to see how
vulnerable systems were before the
hacker penetrated into the the network
this was when he realized he needed an
employee who thinks like a hacker and
identifies the vulnerabilities in his
Network before an outsider does to do
this job he hired an ethical hacker John
John was a skilled professional who
worked precisely like a hacker in no
time he spotted several vulnerabilities
in Dan's organization and closed all the
loopholes hiring an ethical hacker
helped Dan protect his customers from
further attacks in the future
this in turn increased the company's
productivity and guarded the company's
reputation so now you know hacking is
not always bad John in this scenario
exposed the vulnerabilities in the
existing Network and such hacking is
known as ethical hacking ethical hacking
is distributed into six different phases
let us look at these phases step by step
with respect to how John our ethical
hacker will act before launching an
attack the first step JN takes is to
gather all the necessary information
about the organization's system that he
intends to attack this step is called
reconnaissance he uses tools like inmap
and hping for this purpose JN then tries
to spot the vulnerabilities if any in
the Target system using tools like inmap
and nexos this is the scanning phase now
that he has located the vulnerabilities
he then tries to exploit them this step
is known as gaining access after John
makes his way through the organization's
networks he tries to maintain his access
for future attacks by installing back
doors in the Target system the metas
sploit tool helps him with this this
phase is called maintaining access John
is a brilliant hacker hence he tries his
best not to leave any evidence of his
attack this is the fifth phase clearing
tracks we now have the last phase that
is reported in this phase John documents
a summary of his entire attack the
vulnerabilities he spotted the tools he
used and the success rate of the attack
looking into the report Dan is now able
to take a call and see how to protect
his organization from any external cyber
attacks don't you all think Jon is an
asset to any organization if you want to
become an ethical hacker like Jon then
there are a few skills that you need to
acquire first and foremost you need to
have a good knowledge of operating
environments such as as Windows Linux
Unix and Macintosh you must have
reasonably good knowledge of programming
languages such as HTML PHP python SQL
and JavaScript networking is the base of
ethical hacking hence you should be good
at it ethical hackers should be well
aware of security laws so that they
don't misuse their skills finally you
must have a global certification on
ethical hacking to successfully bag a
position of an ethical hacker like John
few examples of ethical hacking
certification are certified ethical
hacker certification C CompTIA pentest
plus and licensed penetration tester
certification to name a few simply learn
provides a cyber security expert Masters
program that will equip you with all the
skills required by a cyber security
expert you could have a look at it by
clicking the link in the description the
endless growth of Technologies in this
area is directly proportional to the
number of cyber crimes cyber crimes are
estimated to cost $6 trillion in 2021
hence to tackle these cyber crimes
organizations are continuously on the
lookout for cyber Security Professionals
the average annual salary of a certified
ethical hacker is $91,000 in the US and
approximately rupe's 7 lakhs in India so
what are you waiting for get certified
and become an ethical hacker like John
and put an end to the cyber attacks in
the world world so let's talk about
hacking and what exactly hacking is
hacking refers to exploiting weaknesses
in a computer network to obtain
unauthorized access to information a
hacker is a person who tries to hack
into computer systems now here there are
some keywords that we need to understand
first and foremost exploit when you're
exploiting weaknesses weaknesses are
technically called vulnerabilities which
are basically design flaws
misconfiguration errors usage of default
usernames and passwords which have not
been modified so any misconfiguration or
anything that has been left behind by a
Security administrator that can be
misused which means exploited by a
hacker to gain unauthorized access so
the next term is unauthorized access
something that you're are not allowed to
do and when you say a hacker is a person
who tries to hack it's basically a
person with malicious intent trying to
gain access to a system or a resource
that they are not authorized to access
in the first place how do they do it
they find the V that is a weakness or a
flaw and then they misuse it to gain
access to that particular Network so
here in the diagram you can see that a
sender on the left hand side is trying
to send some data to the receiver on the
right hand side the hacker would try to
gain unauthorized access to the
transmission that is being sent and
would try to capture the data packets
and read the secrets within let's look
at a business case scenario into hacking
now there is an organization uh
everybody's going around their own
business when they realize that their
systems may have been compromised now
they're trying to look at the customer
data to ensure that that has not been
compromised and trying to assure the
customers however they do realize that
some customer data has been lost and
even the company reports have been
modified as well now this is the
scenario where there have been some
security controls in place and those
controls have been identified they
realized that there is an attack that
has happened and based on that attack
they have realized that the data has now
been compromised and the records have
been modified uh by the hacker which
means that the data is no longer
trustworthy and thus cannot be used by
the business for any legal transactions
so then the hacker gives a call to the
organization or gets connected to the
organization demanding a ransom for the
data to be replaced to be taken back
into the original state where it was
trusted and thus the organization can
utilize it for business transactions the
organization has probably no backup so
they decide that they want to pay the
lumsum to the hacker to restore that
data so that they can continue on with
the business does money exchanges and
the hacker is able to restore that data
and the business continues that as usual
however the activity here of a hacker
trying to Leverage The misconfiguration
of the weaknesses in the organization's
security thus being able to hack them
and uh make these ransomware demands so
the company then uh wants to figure out
even if having a security system in
place how was the hacker able to hack
their systems thus one of the employees
comes up with a brilliant idea of
identifying vulnerabilities in the
network uh to proactively search for any
flaws that have been left behind uh so
that they can plug those flaws and
nobody can misuse them thus they figure
out that they want to hire a ethical
hacker who would help them identify the
security posture of the organization
identify the weaknesses vulnerabilities
and flaws and help them remedy those
flaws so that in future scenarios these
scenarios will not happen so before we
go into an ethical hacker let's
understand what are the types of hackers
so what are the types of hackers hacker
is a technically skilled person uh who
is very Adept with computers they have
good programming skills they understand
how operating system works they
understand how networks work they
understand how to identify flaws and
viabilities within all of these aspects
and then they understand and know how to
misuse these flaws to get a outcome
which would be detrimental to the health
of the organization so this six type of
hackers that have been identified black
hat hackers white hat hackers gray hat
script kites nation sponsored hackers
and a activists so blackhe hat hackers
are Bas basically uh the malicious
hackers who have malicious intent and
have criminalistic Tendencies they want
to harm the organization by hacking into
their infrastructure by destroying their
infrastructure by destroying their data
so that uh they can gain from it from a
monetary perspective uh these guys are
also known as crackers the main aspect
of these uh people are that they have
malicious intent they try to do
unauthorized activities and they try it
for personal gain another important
aspect to remember is that a black hat
hacker will always try to hide their
identity uh they will spoof their online
digital identity by masking it by
spoofing their IP addresses Mac
addresses and try to remain anonymous on
the network a white hacker on the other
hand is also an ethical hacker or a
security analyst who's an individual who
will do exactly the same thing that a
blackhead hacker would do minus the
malicious intent plus the intent of
helping the organization identifying the
flaws and remedying them so that nobody
else can misuse those vulnerabilities so
they are authorized to act on the
company's behalf they are authorized to
do that activity which would help the
company identify those flaws and thus
help the company mitigate those flaws
improving on their security posture so
these uh these kind of Security Experts
or ethical hackers would help
organizations defend themselves against
unauthorized attacks gray hat hackers is
a blend of both white hat and black hat
hackers so here they can work
defensively and offensively both they
can accept contracts from organizations
to increase their security posture at
the same time they can also get
themselves involved in malicious
activities towards other organizations
to personally gain or benefit from them
by doing unauthorized activity script
kites are people uh who are technically
not much aware about what hacking is uh
they rely on existing tools that have
been created by other hackers they have
no technical knowledge of what they're
doing it's just a hit or miss for them
so they just get their hands on a tool
they try to execute those tools uh if
the hack works it works otherwise it
doesn't so these people are basically
who are noobs or newbies who are trying
to learn hacking or uh just uh people
who with malicious intent who just want
to have some fun or trying to impress
people around then we have the nation or
the state sponsored hackers as the name
suggest these hackers are sponsored by
their government now this may not be a
legitimate job but most of the
governments do have hackers enrolled in
their pay on um on their organizations
to spy on their enemies to spy on
various countries and try to figure out
uh the aspirations of those countries so
this is basically a spying activity
where you're technically trying to get
access to other Count's resources and
then try to spy on them to figure out
what their activities have been or what
their future plans have been and then we
have the activists who is an individual
who has a political agenda to promote
and they promote it by doing hacking so
uh these guys what is the difference
between a black hat hacker and a
activist the black hat hacker may try to
hide their identity a activist will
claim responsibility of what they have
done so for them it's a political agenda
political cause and they will try to
hack various organizations to promote
their cause they would probably do this
by defacing the website and posting the
messages that they want to promote on
these websites so what exactly is
ethical hacking then we have discussed
the types of hackers we have identified
a malicious hacker as a black hat hacker
with the intent of doing harm to an
organizations Network for personal gain
we have discussed what the ethical
hacker is so an ethical hacker would be
doing the same activity but in an
authorized manner so they would have
legal contracts that they would be
signing with the organization it would
give them a definite scope of what
they're allowed to do and what they are
not allowed to do and the ethical
hackers would function within those
Scopes would try to execute those test
scenarios where they would be able to
identify those flaws or those system
vulnerabilities and then they would be
submitting a report to the management of
what they have found they would also
help the management to mitigate or to
resolve those weaknesses so that nobody
else can misuse them later on they might
use the same techniques and the same
tools that blackhe hat hackers do
however the main difference here is that
these guys are authorized to do that
particular activity they're doing it in
a controlled manner with the intent of
helping the organization and not with
the intent of personal gains so who's an
ethical hacker again ethical hacker is a
highly intelligent Highly Educated
person who knows how computers function
how programming languages work how
operating systems work they can
troubleshoot they're technically very
Adept at Computing they understand the
architecture they understand uh how
various components in a computer work
they can troubleshoot those components
and they can basically be uh very good
with programming as well now when I say
programming we don't want ethical hacker
to be a good developer of applications
we want them to understand program
programming in such a way that they can
create scripts they can write their own
short programs like viruses worms
Trojans or exploits which would help
them achieve the objective that they
have set out for so uh here you can see
the ethical hacker they are individuals
who perform a security assessment of the
companies with the permission of cons
concerned authorities so what is a
security assessment a security
assessment is finding out the exact
security posture of the organization by
identifying what security controls are
in place how they' have been configured
and if there are any gaps in the
configurations themselves so an
organization will hire a ethical hacker
they they would give the ethical hacker
the information about what information
is or what security controls what
firewalls what idss ipss inen detection
or intren prevention systems antiviruses
are already in place and then they will
ask the ethical hacker to figure out a
way to bypass these mechanisms and see
if they can still hack the organization
what is the need of an ethical hacker
the need of an ethical hacker is
proactive secur Authority the ethical
hacker would identify all the existing
flaws in an organization and try to
resolve those flaws to help secure the
organization from blackhe hat hackers so
ethical hackers would prevent Hackers
from cracking into an organization's
Network by securing the organization by
improving on their security on a
periodic basis and they would also try
to identify system vulnerabilities
Network vulnerabilities or application
Level vulnerabilities that would have
been missed or have already been missed
and then Tred to figure out a way of
plugging the them or uh resolving them
so that they cannot be misused by other
hackers they would also analyze and
enhance an organization security
policies now what are policies policies
are basically documents that have been
created by an organization of rules that
all the employees need to follow to
ensure that the security of an
organization is maintained for example a
password policy a password policy would
help users in an organization to adhere
to the standards the organization has
identified for a password complexity for
example example a password when a user
is creating them should adhere to
standards where they are using random
words they are they contain the alphabet
A through Zed uppercase and lowercase 0
through 9 as numerics and special
characters and they're randomized so
that the password becomes more more
stronger to prevent from Brute Force
attacks so what would an ethical hacker
do at this point in time they would try
to test the strength of the passwords to
see if Brute Force attacks or dictionary
attacks are possible and if any of these
passwords can be cracked they would
ensure that all the employees are
following the policies and all the
passwords are as secured as the policies
want them to be if there are any gaps in
the policies or the implementation of
the policy it is the ethical hacker
responsibility to identify those gaps
and warn the organization about it
similarly they would also try to protect
any personal information any data that
is owned by the organization that is
critical for the functioning of the
organization and they'll try to protect
it by from falling into the Hacker's
hands now what are the skills that are
required of an ethical hacker these are
the following skills so first and
foremost they should have good knowledge
with operating systems such as Windows
Linux Unix and Mac now when we say
knowledge about operating systems it's
not only about how to use those
operating systems but how to
troubleshoot those operating systems how
these operating systems work how these
operating systems need to be configured
how can they be secured for example
securing an operating system is not only
installing a firewall and an antivirus
but you need to configure permissions on
an operating system of what what users
are allowed to do and what users are not
allowed to do for example limiting the
installation of applications how are we
going to do that we need to go into the
system center the security Center of
Windows and we need to configure
security parameters over there of what
are acceptable softwares and what are
not same with Linux and uh Mac softwares
operating systems so we need to know how
we can secure these operating systems
similarly all of these would have
desktop versions and server versions of
operating systems as a ethical hacker we
need to know the desktop and server
versions both how to configure them and
how to provide services within the
organization on these servers so that
they can be consumed in a secure manner
by all the employees at the same time
they should also be knowledgeable of
programming languages or scripting
languages such as PHP python Ruby HTML
for programming if you will because web
servers come into the picture so again
they should not be great developers
where they can create huge applications
but they should be able to develop
scripts understand those scripts analyze
those scripts and figure out what the
output should be of those scripts to
achieve the hacking goals that they have
set out for an ethical hacker should
have a very good understanding about
networking no matter whether you're in
application security you're in network
security or you're in host based
security since a computer will always be
connected to a network either a local
area network like a landan or the
internet we should know how networking
works we should know the seven layers of
the OSI model we should know which
protocols work on those seven layers we
should identify the tcpip model and how
OSI model can be mapped to the tcpip
model we should understand how TCP and
UDP work how how each and every protocol
is crafted how they are supposed to
behave for us to analyze and understand
any network-based attacks we should be
very good in security measures so we
should know where those vulnerabilities
would lie what are the latest exploits
available in the market and we should be
able to identify them we should be able
to know the techniques and the tools of
how to deal with security how to analyze
security and then how to implement
security to enhance it as well along
with that it is important that a
security analyst or ethical hacker is
aware of the local security laws and
standards why is that because an
organization cannot do any illegal
activity whatever responses that they
have whatever security mechanisms
whatever security controls they will
Implement they need to be adhering to
the local law of the land they should be
legal in nature and should not cause
undue harm harm to any of the employees
or any of the third party clients that
they are dealing with so the ethical
hacker should be aware of what security
laws are before they Implement security
controls or even before they start
testing for security controls and all of
these should be backed up by having a
global certification or a globally valid
certification related to networking
related to security ethical hacking the
law of the land anything and everything
maybe even programming uh it's good to
have a certification in PHP Pearl python
Ruby and so on so forth why because most
of the organizations when they hire
ethical hackers look out for these
certifications especially globally valid
certifications so that they can be sure
or they can be assured that the person
that they are hiring has the required
skill set so let's talk about a few of
the tools that a ethical hacker would
utilize uh in their testing scenarios to
be honest there are hundreds of tools
out there what you see on the screen are
just a few examples of them uh nessus is
a vulnerability scanner what is a
vulnerability scanner it is an automated
tool that is designed to identify
vulnerabilities within hosts within uh
operating systems within networks so
they come with their readymade databases
of all the vulnerabilities that have
already been identified and they scan
the network against that database to
find out any possible flaws or any
possible vulnerabilities that currently
exist on the host or the operating
system or on the network similarly there
would be application scanners like uh
actic or Arachne that would help you to
scan applications and identify flaws
within those applications as well now
all of these are automated tools the
essence of ethical hacker is when these
tools churn out the reports the ethical
ha hacker can understand these reports
analyze them identify the flaws and then
craft their own exploits or use existing
exploits in a particular manner so that
they can get access or they can bypass
the access security controls mechanisms
that are already in place how can they
do that with the tool called Metasploit
you see that Big M there on the right
hand side that M logo is for a tool
called Metasploit which is a penetration
testing tool what is a penetration
testing tool it is that tool that will
allow a ethical hacker to craft their
exploits or choose their exploits for
the vulnerabilities that have been
identified by nessus since we are
interacting with computers we will
always be interacting using tools right
so the first tool nessus identifies the
flaws and the possible list of
vulnerabilities we do a penetration test
using Metasploit to validate those flaws
and to verify that those flaws actually
exist and try to figure out the
complexity of those flaws and that's
where Metasploit helps us do that wire
shock would be used in the background
while we are doing both the activities
using nessus or Metasploit to keep a
track of what packets are being send and
by received on the network which will
help us analyze those packets so
whenever I run an SS scanner I would run
a y Shar in the background it will
capture the data packets and I can go
through those data packets and analyze
that data packets to identify what NE is
actually trying to do similarly when I
try to attack a machine using exploit on
meta exploit I will keep on wire shock
running in the background to capture the
data packets that have been sent and the
responses that I've received from the
victim so that I can also go through
those packets and analyze the responses
and analyze the attack whether it was
successful to what extent was it
successful and basically we also give me
a validation a proof of the activity
that has happened nmap is another
automated tool that allows me to scan
for open ports and protocols so why
would I use nmap because Pro ports and
protocols become an entry point for a
hacker to gain access to devices for
example when we connect to a web server
we connect through a web browser but we
automatically connect to Port 80 using
HTTP and Port 443 using https so if I'm
connecting to a web server using https
it is safe to assume that Port 443 on
the web server is open to accept those
connections similarly there would be
other services that may be left open on
the web server because nobody thought
about configuring it or they
misconfigured the web server and they
left unwanted Services running so nmap
will allow me to scan those ports and
services and allow me to understand what
services are being offered on that
server so then I can start analyzing
that server identify those flaws within
those services and then try to attack
them if the application that I'm
analyzing is connected to a database and
I want to do a SQL injection attack or
if I if nessus tells me that there's a
SQL injection attack that may be
possible on that particular application
I can use an automated tool called SQL
map or SQL map that would allow me to
automatically craft all the queries that
are required for a SQL injection attack
and help me do that attack at the same
time so here I do not have to manually
create my own queries uh the SQL map
tool would automatically create them for
me what I would do is I would use nessus
to identify that particular flaw if
nessus reports that flaw I would then go
use the tool SQL map configure it to
attack that particular web server and
when I fire off the tool it will then
automatically start directing queries
SQL injection queries to the database to
see if those uh databases are vulnerable
and if yes what data can be retrieved
from those databases so all of these
tools in a nutshell would help me hack
networks applications operating systems
and host devices and this is what
ethical hacker does they use these kind
of tool sets they identify what attacks
they need to do they identify the right
tool for that particular attack and they
write their exploits they create those
attacks and then they start attacking
analyze the response and then give a
report to the management uh providing
them feedback about how the attack was
created or crafted what was the response
to that attack and whether the attack
was successful or not if successful they
would also give recommendations of what
to do to prevent these attacks from
happening in the future so when we are
doing these attacks or when we want to
launch these attacks what is the process
that that we would follow so there are
six steps that we would do as a ethical
hacker if you are just a hacker you
probably wouldn't do the sixth step
which is a reporting step so the first
step that would be done is the
recognizance phase which is the
information gathering phase which is
very important from ethical Hacker's
perspective or a hacker's perspective
because if I want to attack someone or
something as a digital device I need to
know what I'm attacking I need to know
the IP address of the device the MAC
address of those devices I need need to
know the operating system the build or
the version of that operating systems
applications on top the versions of
those applications so I know what I'm
attacking for example if I if I want to
attack a server I assume it's a Windows
based server and I use a particular tool
to attack it but it actually turns out
to be a Linux based server my attacks
are going to be unsuccessful so I need
to focus my attack based on what is
there at the other end so in my
information gathering phase I want to
identify all of that information once I
have that information done I'm going to
scan those servers using tools like nmap
that we just talked about and we're
going to try to see the open ports open
services and protocols that are running
on that server that can give me possible
entry points within the network or
within the device or within the
operating system at the same time along
with the scanning with nmap I would run
a vulnerability scanner the NS
vulnerability scanner we talked about or
acine etics for applications and then I
would try to identify vulnerabilities in
those applications operating systems or
networks once once I've have identified
those vulnerabilities in the scanning
phase I would then move on to the
gaining phase where I would then craft
my exploits or choose existing exploits
and start attacking the attacking the
victim at this point in time if my
attack is successful I will probably
have gained access uh by either cracking
passwords or escalating privileges or
exploiting a varability that I may have
found during the scanning phase once I
have gained my access I want to maintain
my access why because the vulnerability
may not be there for long maybe somebody
updated the operating system and hence
the flaw was no longer exist existing or
somebody changed the password that may I
may have cracked does I no longer have
access so what do I do to maintain my
access I install Trojans or backd door
entries to those systems using which I
can secretly in a covert manner get
access to those devices at my own will
at my own time as long as those devices
are available over the network so that's
where I maintain my access I have hacked
them now I want to maintain my access so
I install a software with which would
give me a back door entry to that device
no matter what once I've done this I
want to clear my track so whatever
activity that I've been doing for
example installing a Trojan a Trojan is
also a software that would create
directory directories and files once
installed on the victim's machine so I
want to hide that if I have accessed
data stores if I have modified data I
want to hide that activity because if
the victim comes to know that something
has happened they would start they would
start increasing their security
parameters they might start scanning
their devices they may take them offline
does my hack would no longer be
efficient the reason I'm clearing my
tracks is that the victim doesn't find
out that they have been hacked or they
have been compromised or even if they do
find out that they've been compromised
they cannot trace the compromise back to
me so I would be deleting references of
any of the IP addresses or Mac addresses
that I may have used to attack that
particular device and this is where I
will be able to identify where those
logs were created where those traces are
once I take off those traces the victim
would not be any wise of whether they
have been compromised or who compromised
their system and if I am successful at
all of these stages or what to whatever
extent the success that I've achieved in
any of these stages I would then create
a report based on that and I would
report to the management about the
activities that we have been able to do
and whatever we have been able to
achieve out of those activities for
example we identified 10 different flaws
there were 20 different attacks that we
wanted to do what attack did we do what
was the outcome of that attack what was
the intended or or the expected output
of that attack I'll create a report
which would give a detailed analysis of
all the steps that were taken along with
screenshots and evidences of what
activity was conducted what was the
output what was the expected output and
I would submit that report to the
management giving them an idea of what
vulnerabilities and flaws exist in their
environment or their devices that need
to be mitigated so that the security can
be enhanced so these are the six steps
that the ethical hacking process would
take uh just going through this the uh
recognizance is where you're going to
use hiking tools like nmap HP to obtain
information about targets there are
hundreds of tools out there depending on
what information you want then in
scanning again n map next p these kind
of tools to be utilized to identify open
ports protocols and services in gaining
access you're going to exploit the
vulnerability by using the metas sploit
tool that we talked about in the
previous slides in the maintaining
access you're going to install back
doors you can use metas at the same time
uh you can craft your own scripts to
create a TR and install it on the
victim's machine once you have achieved
that clearing tracks is where you're
going to clear all evidences of your
activity so that you do not get caught
or the victim doesn't even realize that
they have been hacked and once you done
all of this we going to create reports
that are going to be submitted to the
management to help them understand the
current security evaluation of their
organization so now let's see how we can
hack using social engineering now what
is social engineering social engineering
is the art of manipulating you humans
into revealing confidential information
which they otherwise would not have
revealed so this is where your social
skill and your people skills come into
the picture if you're able to
communicate effectively to another
person they would probably give up more
information that they intended to give
out let's look look at examples right if
you see on the screen fishing activity
what is fishing we receive a lot of fake
mails on a regular basis we have always
received those emails where we have won
a lottery of a few million dollars but
we have never realized that we didn't
purchase a lottery to win a lottery in
the first place we have always had those
Nigerian frauds where a prince died in
some South African country and you out
of 7 billion people on the planet have
been identified where they want to
transfer a few hundred million doar
through your account and they want to
give you 50% of that money in return as
thank you so some very basic attacks
where you go onto websites and there's a
banner flashing at you saying
congratulations you're the 1 millionth
visitor to this website click here to
claim your priz all of these are social
enging attacks fishing attacks fake
websites fake Communications being sent
out to users to pray on their Gil most
of humans always have that dream of
striking it rich winning a huge Lottery
once and for all and living their life
lavishly ever after but sadly in the
real world that's not that doesn't
happen that often and if you're
receiving those Mals it is very
important that you first research the
validity of those those Communications
before you even want to act upon them so
why are humans susceptible to social
engineering because humans have emotion
machines do not try pleading with a
machine to give you access to a account
that you have forgotten a password to
the machine wouldn't even know what
you're doing try pleading with a human
sympathy or empathy where you could try
to create a social injuring attack where
you can plead with them saying if I do
not get access to this account
immediately I might lose my job and then
that would put my family into problems
somebody would feel empathy or sympathy
towards you and help you reset that
password and give you access to that
account it's how good that attack is and
how convincing you are for the success
of this attack to happen so what is a
familiarity exploit attackers interact
with victims to gain information which
will benefit the attackers to crack
credentials as passwords if we want to
reset our passwords what do we have as a
mechanism to resetting passwords we have
some security questions that we set up
those questions are nothing but personal
information that we would know but
through a social engineering attack it
would be easily be able to uh gather the
information that you have set for your
security questions the security
questions can be as simple as the first
schol that you attended you probably
have that listed on your LinkedIn
profile where person can just go in
there and see your academic
qualifications and identify the school
that you were in right similarly it
might also be a question what was your
mother's maiden name that's a very good
attack and that's uh I mean if a person
can interact with you let's say they're
trying to take a survey and they
approach you for a feedback on a
particular product that you have been
utilizing and they ask you these
questions you wouldn't think twice
before giving those answers as long as
the request sounds legitimate to us we
are able to justify that request we do
answer those queries so it's upon us to
verify the authenticity of the request
coming in before we answer it fishing as
discussed would be fraudulent emails
which appear to be coming from a trusted
source so email spoofing uh comes into
mind uh fake websites and so on so forth
exploiting human curiosity curiosity
killed the cat right so there was
there's so many physical attacks where
hackers just keep pen drives lying
around in a parking lot now this is open
a generic attack whoever Falls victim
will fall victim so if I just throw
around a few USBS in the parking lot
obviously with Trojans implemented on
them some people who are curious or who
are looking for a couple of freebies
might take up those pen drives plug them
in their computers to see what data is
on the pen drives at the same time once
they plug in the those pen drives on
their computers the virus or the Trojan
would get infected and cause harm to
their machine then exploiting human
greed
we just talked about the Nigerian frauds
and the lotteries those kind of attacks
the fake money-making gimmicks now
basically this is where you pray upon
the persons greed kicking in and they
clicking on those links in order to uh
get that money that has been promised to
them in that email so one of the safest
mechanism to keep data private and to
keep yourself secure is using encryption
now encryption can happen through
cryptography what is cryptography
cryptography is the the art of
scrambling data using a particular
algorithm so that the data becomes
unreadable to the normal user the only
person with the key to unscramble that
data would be able to unscramble it and
make sense out of that data so we just
making it unreadable or non-readable by
using a particular key or a particular
algorithm and then we're going to send
the key to the end user the end user
using this uh same key would then
decrypt that data if anybody compromises
that data while it is being sent over
the network since since it is encrypted
they would not be able to read it so the
encryption algorithm would be something
like this now if you see uh the computer
word once made into unreadable format
would look like EQ o r XV GT for a end
user it wouldn't make any sense but the
person who has a key to unscramble that
would be able to convert it back to
computer and then understand the meaning
of that word so this is just a
substitution Cipher that is being shown
on the screen so what is the alphabet
the key is alphabet pluss three so C
plus three alphabets that becomes e o
becomes q m becomes o so the key that is
utilized to scramble the data is the
character that you are at the third
character from there would be the
corresponding key so the encrypted
message is also known as a cipher the
decryption is just the other way around
where you know the key now and you can
now figure out what that e corresponded
to by going back three characters in the
alphabet most of the times a certified
ethical hacker must decrypt a message
without knowing the secret key so let's
say a ransomware has affected your
organization or has affected a device
and you want to figure out uh or you
want to decrypt that data now as a
ethical hacker you wouldn't be for
paying a ransom to the hacker would you
so it is now your prerogative of how
you're going to work around and how
you're going to try to crack the
encryption mechanism how to crack the
cipher to decrypt that message and see
what's within it right decryption
without the use of a secret key that is
known as a crypt analysis Crypt analysis
is the reversing of an algorithm to
figure out what the decryption was
without using a key so Crypt analysis
can be done using various formats the
first one is a Brute Force attack second
is a dictionary attack third one is a
rainbow table attack a Brute Force
attack is trying every combination
permutation and combination of the key
to figure out what the key was it is
100% successful but may take a lot of
time a dictionary attack is where you
have created a list of possible
encryption mechanisms list of possible
cracks and then you try to figure out
whether those cracks work or not rainbow
tables are where you have an encrypted
text in hand and you're trying to figure
out uh the similarities between the text
that you have and the encrypted data
that you wanted to decrypt in the first
place so in the Brute Force attack
you're trying every possible combination
permutation of what the key would be in
dictionary attack you have a word list
that would tant amount to the key and if
you're you're trying to match all the
words listed in the text file or the
word list to see if any of those words
are going to work to decrypt that data
here in the rainbow table the cipher
text is compared with another Cipher
text you find out similarities and then
you try to work a reverse engineer your
way accordingly so let's have a quick
demo on cryptography before we end this
session so to begin with the demo of
cryptography we are on a website called
spam mic.com which will help us scramble
the message that we created into a
completely uh a format which would be be
unrelated to the topic at hand so if I
say I want to encode a message turn a
short message into spam so what this
does is want to send across a secret
message you type in The Secret Message a
short one it will convert that into a
spam mail you send it across so whoever
is reading that spam mail would never
get an idea of the embedded message
within it so if I want to type in a
message here hi this is a secret message
the password is ASD at 1 2 3 4 and I
want to send this out to people or to
one of my colleagues but I want to send
it out in a secret manner so that others
are not aware of this so when I press on
encode what the algorithm would do is it
will convert this message into a spam
mail so my message hi this is a secret
message the password is atate 1 1234 or
ASD at 1 1234 gets converted into this
now if you read it dear ecommer
professional this letter was specially
selected to be sent to you this doesn't
make sense there is nowhere or no
reference to the actual message that
I've already said so if I copy this
entire message and I send it let's say
via email to the recipient now the thing
is that the recipient needs to know that
I've encoded it using spam mimic the
algorithm needs to remain the same so
once they know that it is Spam mimic
what they can do is now in this instance
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open up a new browser and I'm going to
go to the same website and at this point
in time I'm going to click on decode
when I click on decode I I'm going to
paste the message that I have just
copied there we are and this message is
now being copied into a different
browser and if I decode this you will
see that it will convert it back to the
original message that there was so the
key is there at spam mimic and it is
embedded within the message so whenever
we we paste the message in the decode
Factor it knows what the key was and it
can decrypt that message and give me the
actual message that was embedded within
it there we are the entire message this
is what we created in the Google Chrome
browser and in the Firefox browser we
decoded similarly if I want to protect
these kind of messages there is an aspen
encrypt.me this by using let's say AES
which is the strongest Cipher right now
and I say encrypt so this is what the
encryption would look like and basically
uh if I don't have the password over
here if I decrypt it you would see that
the error has occurred now if I type in
the password over here and then decrypt
it it will be able to convert that back
into the unscrambled text and it will
give me what the original message was
this is a secret message the password is
ASD at the 1 234 so if I want to keep my
data secure from hackers I want to
scramble it in such a way that they
would not be able to to crack it or it
would be very difficult for for them to
crack it and this is one of the first
mechanisms that would be recommended by
any ethical hacker to keep the data
secure now let's talk about downloading
and installing KH Linux along with that
we'll also be looking at the basic
commands that are required for KH Linux
all right so I've opened my browser and
we want to go to the Kali website so we
want to go to kali.org you can directly
type in kh.org and go to the website I
can just do a Google Search and say k
download and it will give you the same
website but it will directly take you to
the downloads pages so either here and
or you can go to the homepage uh cookies
are being installed on your machine so
uh see which cookies you want to allow
I'm only going to use the necessary
cookies to support this site and you can
see that this gives you the latest KH
Linux news and tutorials gives you the
latest release what is in that release
and gives you a lot of documentation
which will help you understand what
tools have been developed and what
function has been given in the latest
version if you want to download you can
directly go here and you can download K
Linux now K Linux is a 2.6 gab download
so it's going to take time the latest
version being
2019.4 and we click over here I'm using
a download manager to manage all these
huge downloads and uh you can see it's
pointed to the operating systems folder
and it is going to be a 2.57 GB download
so you click on download and in the
background uh you can see this is going
to be downloaded and we're going to
minimize this and uh it will take a few
minutes for that to download but this is
an ISO image so we need to install it on
a virtual machine so what we need is we
need to use a hypervisor which will
allow us to create virtual machine so we
can either use VMware Workstation which
you can download from here however uh
this is paid version so you can see it
is around $250 or something for uh this
software but it is a very good software
to have so if you click on download now
it is going to start the download it's a
30-day trial period if you want to use
it after 30 days you'll need to enter
the key which you'll get after
purchasing the software if you do not
want to utilize this the free version
that you have you can either download
VMware Player but there are some
limitations for VMware Player that you
might want to look at does you want to
compare these products before you want
to purchase them right otherwise you can
download Oracle virtual box which is a
free hypervisor it's not as robust as
VMware Workstation but it does the trick
right so the the free version uh 6.1 is
free and you can then create your own
virtual machines over there and install
operating systems on them what I do have
I already have a VMware Workstation
installed so I'm just going to open that
up and that's my VMware Workstation as
you can see I already have a lot of
virtual machines created over here what
we going to do is we are going to
configure a virtual machine for the K
Linux operating system that we are
downloading which should be somewhere
here let's see it's at 43% so halfway
there till then let's create the virtual
machine so I cck click on file create a
new virtual machine I'm going to
customize the machine so click on next
this L default we don't want to change
that and then we want to install the
operating system later we don't want to
point it out right now so I'll just
click on I will install the operating
system later click on next we want to
install Linux now in the drop down you
would not see KH Linux over here however
you can choose uban 2 64-bit that's what
I'm going to choose there it is next
what is the name that we want I want to
give it KH Linux without the typo and I
want to store it in one of the folders
that I've created by default it stores
on the C drive which is not a good place
to store uh you don't want to run out of
space on your C drive so I'm going to
click on this PC and this is my data and
in here I'll have a folder called
virtual box or virtual machines there it
is within which you can see the other
softwares that I already created I'm
going to create a new folder and call it
Ki 2019 l l for his latest for me
because you can see already have a k
Linux so I'm just going to identify this
folder with the L at the end going to
select it and click on okay you can see
the path being changed over here click
on next it's going to ask you how many
processors now depending on the
processor that you have you can see I've
got a 8 core i7 so if I give it 16 cores
or 16 processors that's not going to
work I cannot go beyond what the
physicality already is so for this
machine One processor with one core is
more than enough if you're going to use
a lot of tools at the same time you
might just want to give it two cores so
you're given it two cores it will ask us
for Ram to be provided for this Virtual
Machine by default 248 mbes that's 2 GB
of RAM is more than enough if you
require more we can change this later on
so click on next we want to use Nat for
now leave this default next whatever is
recommended keep it the way it is we do
not want to change it next create a new
virtual hard disk for this machine and
it is going to ask us the size 20 GB is
more then fine store it as a single file
we don't want to use multiple file
options click on next and then click on
browse where we want to store the vmdk
file or the virtual hard disk file and
we go back again to the same folder that
we had created virtual machines and we
look at the K Linux Ki 2019 L and we
want to store the vmdk file over there
once we save we want to click on next
and then we want to click on finish so
this is the virtual machine that has
been created right here right now this
is the basic configuration now where are
we at with the operating system and you
can see the operating uh system has been
downloaded and it is stored in this
particular folder so we go to e Drive so
we looking for the so the operating
system that we have downloaded we
downloaded in the operating systems
folder and if you go in here you can see
the current one the K Linux
2019.4 ISO right here so what we do we
go back to the KH lanux machine that we
have created edit virtual machine
settings and we point this virtual
machine using the CD DVD and then we
point the iso the one that we downloaded
over here so we go back to e Drive we go
back to OS and we click on KH lanx 2019
click on open so now when this boots up
it will boot up with this ISO and then
we it will allow us to install the
operating system so click on okay then
we click on power on this virtual
machine it will start powering on it
will boot to the iso and it will start
giving us the booting options so I'm
just going to uh enter the full screen
mode over here for this to be better
visible and we don't want the live mode
what we want is we want to use the
graphical install and then we highlight
that we press enter and you can see the
setup starting up we'll wait for the GUI
to pop up there it is which language do
we want for now we want English click on
continue where are we located click on
continue and the configure your keyboard
we want the US keyboard American English
continue it is going to detect the
hardware so as you can see on the screen
it's a tempting uh Auto configuration
for most of these uh settings the
network with DHCP it has identified the
network cards uh Hardware like uh the
processor that has been provided now it
is asking for a host name we're going to
leave it at default we're going to click
on continue domain name I'm not joining
this into a domain as yet there is going
to be a standalone machine so I can
leave this blank click on continue now
it is going to configure the network it
is asking for a password at this point
in time the root password type in any
password that you want Ure that you
remember the password now by default the
username for the account is the name is
the word root we just creating the
password for the root account and then
we want to click on continue setting up
the clock looking at the Hard dis now
here it asks us do we want to use the
entire disk the 20gb virtual hard disk
that we had provided or do we want to
give it a manual configuration or a
guided one where we want encryption and
a logical volume management coming into
the picture we just going to use the
first option guided you use entire disk
don't worry it's only going to use the
virtual disc that we had created click
on continue it will give us that it's a
21.5 GB VMware virtual disc that we had
and click on continue all files in one
partition that's what we want
recommended for new users whatever it is
we don't want to change these folders
continue and this is what we have
configured uh once we click on continue
it is going to say you are you sure you
want to make these changes click on yes
click on continue and it will start
installing KH Linux on your device now
this is going to take a few minutes for
the installation to work all right so
that's the installation that's completed
now it's asking us to configure a
package manager a network mirror can be
used to supplement the software that is
included on the installation media this
may also make newer versions of software
available do you want to use a network
mirror we can click no for now and then
click on continue now this is going to
install the GRUB boot loader this might
take a few minutes as well install the
group grub loader to the master boot
record yes click on continue click the
hard dis that you have just utilized
this is the one click on continue it
will install the grab boot loader
running through the last phases of the
installation and now it says the
installation is complete we want to
click on continue finishing the
installation and then it will do a
reboot all right and you can see this is
starting up so we are going to use you
just wait out the boot and now it
started the booting sequence just going
to maximize the screen and you can see
it's asking me for the password this is
the one that we created now that's the
that's not the password that's the
username that's the root and the
password that we had created at that
point in time and then click on log in
and this is your screen uh now what we
need to do here is we need to install
VMware tools which will help us manage
the screen and help the virtual machine
to be a little bit better uh integrated
on the system so that's not mounted yet
so we're just waiting for it to Mount
there it is and what we want to do here
is open VW tools upgrader all right so
what we want is we want to extract or we
want to use this open X archival and
once we do that we'll see the VMware
install. PL double click on that all
right we got the VMware tools here what
I've done is we have extract two and
I've extracted that on the desktop right
so what we just did was click on the
desktop over here open and this is what
it will do and click on extract now the
eror is happening because I've already
extracted this open this up we want to
run this VMware install. PL so what do
we do we open up the terminal window
which is the command line interface over
here and now this is where some of the
commands come into the picture so for
example PWD it will show us the present
working directory LS will show us the
list of the folders that are there so
the folder that we have is on our
desktop so we'll just change directory
to desktop press enter do an LS that
will show us the list and you can see
VMware tools distrib that's the folder
that we have right here right so we want
to go into that folder CD VM where at
this point you can just click on Tab and
it will populate everything over there
press enter do an LS and we want the vmw
hyphen install dopl to be executed all
right so we tried executing that command
we had an error over there so what we
need to do is we need to execute this
command so/ VMware hyen install. PL and
we'll start creating now uh it will ask
you for your input installing VMware
Tools in which directory do you want to
install the binary files uh by default
it is going to use /usr SL bin if I just
press in uh enter it is going to use the
default as you can see the input over
here what directory do you want the in
directories I'm just going to press uh
keep on pressing enter for the defaults
to come in this part does not exist it
is is going to create it default yes
defaults everywhere and then it tries to
start initializing it to maximize the
screen and this is where it is
installing and you can see by just
installing that it automatically
adjusted the screen and now we got a
full screen of K Linux right here right
and that is what VMware tools does for
us once we have installed the operating
system and now you can see the entire
screen on here you will see the tool
sets that are given here now why we
using K Linux in the first place because
this comes in uh with a bundle of
thousands of softwares that are ready to
be utilized for ethical hacking right
and they have been categorized over here
for information gathering vulnerability
analysis web application analysis and so
on so forth so you can see from forign
six onwards reporting tools and as you
scroll down you can see your development
tools Graphics coming in Internet uh and
the system configuration coming into the
picture these are your settings for your
operating system so these are basically
your tools we are right now the
favorites if I click on information
gathering you will see that other tools
for information gathering start
appearing over here for viability
analysis we have got Sparta inmap
fuzzing tools web application analysis
we have got comics skipfish SQL map
database assessments password attacks
and so on so forth so if you just go in
the favorites this was the terminal
emulator that we utiliz this is the
command line that we saw we use the CD
command we use the PWD command we did
the ls command as well to give us the
list of the directory that we are in
similarly there would be commands like
cat so let's go to CD downloads let's
see what the uh what's there you can see
this case sensitive so if I type in a
capital D and then do a tab LS there's
nothing over here on download so CD do
dot will take us back One Directory now
you can see we are back from downloads
to root if I want to go to desktop this
is how I go to desktop do a LS you can
see the VMware tools uh folder over
there CD VMware tools and we go into
that folder LS it will give us the list
of all those files now you can see
install is a file that we had edited
back then so if I do a cat install you
will see the cat basically is the
command that will help us look at the
contents of the file all right without
opening of the file or without editing
the file so you can see just uh if I
scroll up this is where we gave the cat
command it then uh printed the contents
of the file over here and then it exited
and gave me back to command line right
here right now if I want to copy this CP
root desktop VMware install and you want
to copy it to root downloads and press
enter now what we going to do is we
going to see if this file the install
file that we just edited over here has
been uh copy to the downloads folder so
we do us uh we are currently in the
VMware on the desktop VMware tools
District folder we do a CD do dot that
takes us down One Directory so we are
still in the desktop do a CD dot dot now
you can can see we are back in the root
and now we going to do a CD downloads do
an LS and you can see the copied file
right here so if I do a cat install you
can see the same content of that file
coming in so these are some of the
commands that we would need to learn as
we go ahead the remove command is let's
say we've got install we do a man RM man
is the manual page command that uh gives
us the pages with the description of how
that particular command is to be utilize
so RM is remove files or directories
synopsis the description the options
hyphen f for Force hyphen I for prompt
hyphen capital I prompt ones before
removing more than three files and so on
so forth if you want to exit this you
can press Q to exit and you come back to
this page so if I say RM install LS
you'll see that the install file has now
been deleted so in Windows we use the d
d command in Linux it is the RM command
so this is what we wanted to look at the
demo for Kali Linux how to download it
how to install it and some of the basic
commands that we can utilize all right
let's begin with the fishing uh tutorial
we have the K lanx operating system
booted up over here uh what we going to
do is we're going to open up a tool
called SE social engineering toolkit
which you would find in this option and
that's the tool that we want it's a
command line tool uh a menu driven tool
we are going to host a fake uh Facebook
page and we can see how we can Harvest
credential by this kind of an attack so
these are some disclaimers you might
want to go through there do you want to
agree to the terms of service yes press
enter and that's your social engineering
toolkit and we are talking about a
fishing attack which comes under the
social engineering attack so it like I
said it's a menu driven tool so we just
have to look at these options and then
just type in the number of the option
that we want so we want to do a social
engineering attack so I type in one
press enter and that it is asking me
whether I want a spear fishing attack a
website attack Vector we going to choose
a second option so I type in two press
enter and then it asks me uh what I want
to do I want to take the third option
here credential Harvester attack
methodology and we want to do the third
attack now it is asking whether we want
to use the inhouse website templates
that it already has or do we want to
clone a site or do we have a customized
site that we have prepared that we want
to migrate into this tool you're going
to do the site cloning option so we're
going to type in two press enter and
then it is going to ask me the IP
address where it wants to capture and
store the credentials by default this is
the IP address that I'm using so if I
leave it blank it will take my default
IP address so I'm just going to press
enter and now it is asking me the URL to
clone so I type in
HTTPS dubdub dub.
facebook.com what it is going to do it
is going to connect online and it is now
just it has cloned the website Facebook
login. PHP the best way to use this
attack is that if use the if the
username and password form are in the
same field or the same page regardless
this captures all posts on a website so
you may need to copy tbdb du star into
HTML depending on where your directory
structure is PR if you understand what
we are saying here so press enter the
social engine toolkit credential Harvest
attack is running on Port 80 information
will be displayed to you as it arrives
so the site was 71130 4 right the
default IP address and this is where the
website is being hosted let's check that
out so let me open up a browser on my
host machine and uh let me point it to
the K Linux machine that we have just
created 192 16871 134 and you should see
a log to Facebook coming up right here
looks genuine it is genuine because we
just went online and downloaded this
let's just have a recap let's have an
explanation of what we are trying to do
I I'm trying to host fake Facebook page
on my server which has an embedded
script in it which is going to do
credential harvesting so the attack here
is let's say if I'm now hosted this I
can craft a fake email send it across to
a victim saying uh your Facebook account
has seen some unforeseen activity create
a hyperlink using HTML coding within
that click here to access your account
and verify uh that the account is
secured and when they click on that link
they will be redirected to my fake page
which is here you can see the uh IP
address is my virtual machines IP
address but I'm seeing a Facebook login
page and I'm going to type in someone at
somewh where.com and the password I'm
just going to type in the regular ones
that I use and if you see it when we
typed in uh the username and password
the page just refreshed and gave us the
login page again but now if you look at
the URL I'm actually on Facebook's login
page which is exactly the same that I
was hosting so a lman wouldn't probably
figure out they've been hacked by now
they just would figure out okay they
probably typed in the incorrect password
and the page refresh or something like
that and they're just going to log in
and they're actually going to access the
Facebook page thus uh they might not
even realize that something went wrong
but if I go back to my virtual machine
you can see that it has captured some
data and it is reporting over here of
what has happened so if I just scroll up
let's see what happened here and if
you've been able to capture anything so
we got a hit printing the output this
does the HTTP 1.12 200 okay response
coming in password field found and we
just looking there it is email someone
some.com and uh password that I typed in
ASD at 1 2 3 4 so it just captured the
username and the password right here uh
once you're done I mean this is the way
attackers work now this is a very basic
attack again uh in the actual trainings
you would then look at how you would
Host this on a real website make it a
global attack right now it's a virtual
machine with a Class C I IP address so
here the thought processes where can we
get a free hosting where we can host
this kind of sites maybe I'll have to
purchase a domain which looks like
similar to Facebook or the victim that
I'm trying to attack so this is just a
POC so we just wanted to find out if we
can how fishing is done and this is
exactly how it is done right so pressing
control+ C would exit this tool and
takes you back to the actual menu press
99 99 to exit and there it is close the
to window and that's the fishing
practical after fishing let's talk about
SQL injection SQL injection stands for
uh structured query language injection
which is a database attack though it
resides within the application so it's
the application vulnerability that we
are trying to uh look at to try to
bypass authentication as the name
suggests a SQL injection will liity
allows an attacker to inject malicious
input into a SQL statement what is a SQL
statement a query that is used by an
application and is fired off to the
database database executes that query uh
gets that uh information that is
required and sends it back to the user
if the user is authenticated so we're
going to look at the SQL injection
attack demo here and uh what we are
going to do is we are going to go back
to our VMware Workstation and I've got a
tool over here called oasp broken web
application which is a utility that has
been created for people like us to test
our skills to learn on how we can
develop our skills further so this has a
lot of uh vulnerable applications is
built within it we just going to try to
access it and we're going to see if we
can create a SQL injection attack just
waiting for it to boot up once it boots
up it will give us an IP address there
we are so we need to connect to 71. 132
so I can just use the same browser I was
using close of Facebook and now go to
192
16871 132 and this is the oasp broken
web application project uh what we going
to do is we going to go to mutil day and
this this is a application that has a
lot of information within it you can see
it gives you links about what you should
do help me video tutorials listing of
vulnerabilities that they have and so on
so forth so you can see we are not
logged in right now I'm just going to do
this as a demo so what we're going to do
is we're going to look at this and
bypass authentication so we are taken to
the login page where you need a username
and password to log in I'm going to type
in test as the username and test as the
password click on login and you can see
that account does not exist so the
Authentication mechanism works now what
we want to do is we want to create a
query now what does a query look like
when I type in a username and a password
if I just type in a single quote here it
is going to create an error and this is
what a SQL query looks like select
username from account where username is
a single quote and then the exception
error happened so it did it's not
showing the rest of the query to us what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
craft a query here uh single quote and
give it a condition r 1 equal 1 space
hyphen hyphen space what happens hyphen
hyen space is comments out anything
after that so the password field is
being commented out at this point in
time and I'm just giving it a condition
where the condition is true one does
equal one and if this condition is true
it is going to allow me to log in so you
can see right now we are not logged in
this bypasses the authentication
mechanism and you can see user
authenticated and we are now logged in
as admin so in the training what you
need to understand uh as a whole is how
SQL Works what are the queries that are
structured with how you can what are the
testing operators now the single quote
that we used that was an operator in the
SQL syntax what these operators are how
they function and then how you can
leverage these attacks there are
different tools that are given to you in
Khali as well that uh you can utilize so
in KH Linux you can just open up a
command prompt and there's a tool called
SQL map you need to give it a particular
site so SQL map hyphen U for the URL and
whatever the URL is now Ur are here and
then once you're here you just press the
enter key this tool will craft all the
queries in the background for you you
don't even have to no SQL query or SQL
languages uh this is a very easy tool to
utilize sadly I cannot demo this on a
live website because that would be
illegal but uh you can uh see how you
can operate this yourself that's what uh
SQL injections are all about moving on
we now talk about uh vpn's virtual
private networks and a virtual private
network is basic basically a secure
network that allows me to anonymize
myself over the Internet so what I'm
doing is I'm connecting from here to a
server that encrypts my channel encrypts
my connection and does allows me to keep
my data secure now the basic essense of
a VPN or a virtual private network is to
allow me this encryption mechanism where
I can encrypt and Safeguard my data the
added advantage that nowadays a VPN
gives is that it can allow us to spoof
our IP address or officiate our I
address so we can actually become
Anonymous on the internet it can allow
us to use multiple IP addresses and thus
uh secure ourself on the internet for
example I use VPN called cyber ghost and
what this allows me to do is it allows
me so many servers over here if you look
at the entire list all the servers then
there are no spy servers uh which and
guarantee me that they are not going to
keep and store any logs and thus they
are not going to record any of the
activity that I'm doing right since they
look Tred out of Romania this becomes a
little bit more safer for me because the
government and the laws over there are a
little bit more relaxed than other
countries uh they give me uh different
links for torrenting for streaming for
connection feature so uh there are a lot
of vpns out there so for example let's
go to the website cyber host.com so we
can see there's a a sale going on 76%
sale or you can go on to
expressvpn which is also a very good VPN
then there is nordvpn it depends on what
uh you want and how you want to utilize
it so just purchasing a VPN or getting a
free fre VPN is not enough it depends on
which country the VPN originates from
and which server you're connected to for
example most of the countes uh have a
pack where they share information
amongst themselves even if you're
connected to a VPN that means that these
companies that provide these Services
have to generate and store logs and
these logs have to be reported to the
government if they ask for it now if uh
there's a list of 14 countries that
actually focuses on this practice so you
have to find out VPN that and a server
that is not a part of those 14 countries
and ensure that those logs are not going
to be reported to the uh government and
these are three vpns basically are
something that which are good and I
personally use cyber ghost I've used the
others I just keep on rotating them just
to get an idea of which one is better so
uh these are VPN that can allow you to
anonymize yourself on the internet
moving on uh these are the ones that we
talked about there other safer VPN hide
my ass Express VPN and so on so forth
from our terminologies let's now talk
about VPS uh VPS is basically virtual
private server where you can rent a
service or server as a service a virtual
machine as a service so basically on a
cloud using infrastructure as a service
you can rent a server and utilize it for
whatever activity you want so let's go
to to uh these sites register.com go ID
Network Solutions or we can talk about
other Cloud Solutions as well so here
you can get register your domain names
uh so in the previous exercise for let's
say when we talked about the fishing
exercise uh what we want is we can go on
to register.com or we can go on to
go.com and we can purchase a particular
domain for example something like this
instead of the O's I'm typing in a
couple of zeros for the Facebook and see
let's see if uh anything of that is
available now something. photo is
available or face tips.com is available
uh there are other options that are
making over here that they're giving us
over here and once we purchase this we
can then have our own hosting uh with a
web hosting as a service and uh you can
have a Linux based uh hosting or a
Windows based hosting depending on what
you want and that's where your shared
hosting comes with the picture if you
just want uh if you want to look at a
virtual server and you want to rent a
server over there itself you can move on
to rackspace.com and here in your
services you can have physical server or
a virtual server in a public Cloud your
other Cloud providers uh for example
would be Amazon AWS and on AWS you can
basically look at ec2 elastic compute
Cloud which is basically virtual servers
in the cloud and over here you can rent
out a server with whatever capacity you
require you'll obviously have to pay the
rent for what what those servers are
going to cost but once you have those
servers you can then launch any services
on top of it uh looking at uh other
services that we have we talked about t
t is a onion routing uh software that
allows users to browse the web
anonymously so we can just go online and
we can try to spoof our identity and I'm
going to show you how so I've got a vmw
workstation right here the one so we
just going to pull that up and we going
to power on a Windows 7 machine where we
going to look at the onion routing so
Windows machine has booted up we just
going to log in and uh this is my
Windows 7 machine now I've got a Chrome
browser right here and we going to go to
a website called C myip.com which is
going to give the IP address that I'm
currently using so right now I'm not on
connected to any VPN or anything and you
can see that's my IP address that I'm
utilizing now if I want to anonymize
myself what I'm going to do is I am
going to uh use to and that's the T
browser that's set up right there if I
click on it it's going to open up the
software and it's going to create a new
network and it's going to connect to the
to network and allow me to anonymize
myself all right so that's the T browser
opening up and uh giving me a new
browser over here so I've got one which
is the old one which is uh my current IP
address if I just refresh that you'll
see that I'm still on the same IP
address as far as this browser is
concerned there's the refresh and it's
still showing me the same IP address
where if I go on to to right now and if
I go to C my ip.com you will see that is
going to give me and you can see the
amount of time it is taking to reach
that site that's because I am using a
VPN and there's a lot of encryption
running off and you can see now I'm
suddenly uh connected via Hong Kong and
even to reach this site what Tor does is
it gives me a proxy chain a proxy chain
is where it creates multiple hops to
hide my identity and uh before I reach
see my uh ip.com I am using three
different IP addresses over here one in
France one in Germany and one in Hong
Kong so if I do something over here to
trace back my steps to my actual IP
address the law enforcement agencies or
anyone who's going to search uh like a
foreign investigator would have to go
through these IP addresses before they
come back to me now it's not impossible
but the effort and time that's going to
be taken to come across three different
countries is going to uh be phenomenal
so it may just defeat the purpose of
having so much resources spent to
identify who did what so that's what Tor
does for us all right moving on from T
we going to look at Key loggers key
loggers are basically softwares that run
in the background and record all the key
strokes of the user so if I've got a key
logger installed right now whatever I
type will be stored in a text file for
the hacker so that they can look at it
later on and just to give you an example
of that we go back to my VMware
Workstation and we open up another
Windows 7 machine I'm going to power
this on and I'm going to close this one
till then so this virtual machine has
booted up we are going to use user One
log in as user one let close all these
softwares which are not required and
once this machine is booted up what
we're going to do is I'm just going to
open up a random websites and see what
we're doing basically there's a key
logger that's there in the startup
that's going to record our keystrokes
and we just want to see what it actually
does now Firefox is getting updated so
let's hold on now this is the latest
version of Firefox right and you're just
going to go to let's say Facebook
wait for the website to open up all
right let's try opening it up again and
that's facebook.com and we're just going
to type in some random username and
password somewhere someone at somewhere.
comom and the password being again ASD
at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 login obviously
that login is not going to work user
probably doesn't exist or if it does the
password probably is incorrect and uh so
we going to close this uh we're going to
let's say open up another browser window
go to another site uh
rediff.com and then go to Redi mail try
the same thing over here someone at
somewhere. comom password is 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 whatever it is don't say you can see
the combination is incorrect now there's
a key loger running in the background
and what we want is we now want to open
up the key logger now it is visible here
because I've kept it visible you can
hide it in the start menu and there's a
shortcut key for you to pull it up later
on so this completely becomes invisible
and uh what it can do is it basically
creates a record of whatever you have
been doing so far so you can see these
things populating on the 25th of
December so if I look at visited
websites you can see I opened up Mozilla
Firefox the first where it uh there was
a problem loading the page then we
opened up Facebook then we opened up
rediffmail.com and so on so forth so
this it just gives me the list of
visited websites whereas if I look at
Key strokes and clipboard you will see
whatever we have typed in so we first
typed in facebook.com then again uh the
second time I try try to type in then uh
I hit backspace then I type in
facebook.com and then you can see I
typed in someone at somewhere. comom and
in tab ASD at the R8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
we closed up the browser we opened up a
new one and we went on to rediffmail.com
and then you can see me typing this one
then going back one space then the rest
of what I typed and then the password
coming in so that's what a key logger
does if you look at the taskbar it's not
going to show you a key logger running
in the background it's in processes
you're not going to see anything at all
but it's going to mask itself as a
service so if you look into the
properties you can see that icon coming
in over here which matches this one and
so you can see that this masking itself
as a service.exe if this gets hidden as
well it would be very difficult for a
user to even identify this all right so
that's what a key logger is moving on
let's see what else we want to talk
about so we've talked about t we have
talked about key loggers and now we want
to talk about firewalls now for key
loggers to be prevented we need
antiviruses right so we know need a good
antivirus program that's going to be
installed updated and run on a regular
basis to protect ourselves from malwares
but what about network connections and
you need a firewall in a system to
prevent or to detect what kind of
connections are going on in the first
place now we cannot rely on software as
100% so even if a firewall is not
configured properly that's that's going
to be a problem so what we need to do is
we have to have a firewall configure it
correctly and then allow and this allow
certain activity from off uh happening
and what we going to do is I've got such
a system on my machine here I use a
software called glass wire what it does
is it is a network analyzer so it allows
me to analyze whatever is going on you
can see all the apps that I'm utilizing
and how much upload and download they
have been uh doing all the traffic so
you can see the protocols that I'm
utilizing so I come to know what's going
on in the background and this gives me
the entire graph of how much I have been
doing for the past 24 hours past 3 hours
past 5 minutes and so on so forth right
so this is what the activities and these
are the alerts that it has been
generating I can click on those alert
and it will start telling me what it was
all about if the graph doesn't work for
me it gives me usage as well so how much
I have utilized since I've installed
this software right and what
applications have been utilized which
hosts have been connected to and the
traffic type that was utilized and then
the things on my network so these are
the devices that I have currently on my
network that has been that have been
identified and then comes the firewall
so on the firewall the firewall is
clicked on you see all those services
that have been identified and you can
just click on a particular service to
lock that service so this becomes a
discovery tool identifies whatever
networking is going on gives me all that
information and then I can look at and I
can just click on any of these services
that I find it as malicious and block
them I can create different profiles for
different applications as I'm as and
when I want them and these are the
alerts so you can see that this was the
first time a network connection was
looked at from VMware and what this
allows me to do is whenever I execute a
file it can upload it to virustotal.com
and scan it as a third party antivirus
to ensure that there is nothing
malicious on it so I already have an
antivirus over here but if this ever
gets compromised I still can rely on a
third party service where in real time
as and when I execute my applications uh
they would be verified and I would be
assured that nothing is wrong with my
system and this software that I'm
utilizing glass wire basic is free and
then there are paid versions as well
it's just glass wire.com is where you're
going to find this moving on rootkit
rootkits are also malicious softwares
that you allow and on authorized user to
have access to a computer to restrict
areas of its software now a rootkit in
his ense is which a software a malicious
software that infects a machine and
prevents aun some functionality from it
like hiding data or preventing users
from uh running antiviruses and uh it's
basically a malicious software that is
used to hide information from the victim
so that they would not realize that they
have actually been compromised it's
going to be a difficult showing of a
root kit so I cannot show that demo to
you so we're just going to move on and
we are going to talk about ethical
hacking techniques now now when we say
ethical hacking techniques we want to
look at what kind of audits are
available when we want to do ethical
hacking so uh there's a black box audit
a white box audit and a gray box audit
so if I'm invited in an organization
ation to conduct a test to conduct a
audit to conduct a vulnerability
assessment or a penetration test to
identify V abilities and then try to
plug them out they're going to give me
three different variations in a blackbox
audit they're not going to tell me about
the infrastructure they're not going to
give me any information and they want me
to start from the basics of gathering
information identifying the systems and
based on the information that I gather
whether I'm able to develop any hacks
and get compromise their infrastructure
so it will be a simulation of a hacker
who's sitting outside the organization
and trying to find a way in whereas a
white box audit is where full
infrastructure knowledge is given
anything and everything that is required
for an audit is given and this is a
simulation of an Insider attack a person
sitting inside the organization misusing
their permissions and then trying to
compromise trying to get access to data
that they do not have access to so the
simulation is from a malicious inside a
gray box is where some partial knowledge
is available and from that partial
knowledge you're going to try to build
up more more information and then you're
going to try to get access to those
resources what are the tools that we
utilize so we've already had a couple of
demos on key loggers SQL injection SQL
map and so on so forth Metasploit is a
very much used tool for penetration
testing and uh having knowledge on
Metasploit is very much necessary as far
as ethical hacking is concerned nmap
this is a tool used for network
discovery Nessa a varability scanner y
Shar is a packet capturer that allows
you to capture packets and analyze
whatever is going on SQL map is
something that we have seen a SQL
injection attack tool which generates
its own queries and John the Ripper is a
password cracking Tool uh backtrack used
to be an operating system that was
utilized for penetration testing however
backtrack has now been replaced by
something called Kali Linux and that's
the operating system that we have
utilized in all our demos where we tried
to look at SQL map and those injection
attacks that we did so what are the
areas of ethical hacking we have just
talked about all these areas as well
Network Services we looked at the glass
Wire application that showed us how my
machine is consuming networks which
Protocols are being consumed how uh the
connections are being uh created if
somebody is able to install a troan on
my machine it is going to try to create
a new connection on the network with the
hacker to allow that hacker a backd door
access now if I have that glass wire or
a similar firewall implemented it is
this firewall that is going to detect it
and prevent that connection from
happening so if I install a software
that is suddenly suspicious or that
installs something else in the
background that I may not be aware of
that tool is going to identify all the
connections that are being made and it
is going to highlight that connection I
need to go through all of those
connections and identify whether they
are legit or not and if I find some
suspicious or doubtful I'm going to
block that connection and then I'm going
to investigate what's going on and
that's where ethical hacking comes into
the picture you want to find out if your
firewall that you have implemented is
going to work correctly or not if the
configuration of the firewall is done
properly or uh if the firewall is
misconfigured is it leaking out
information right at the same time
you're looking at web applications we
looked at the ovas broken web
application where we did some SQL
injection attacks right so that was a
weakness or avilability in that
application which would allow us to
bypass authentication and get access uh
to resources that we were not authorized
for and then client side attacks would
be where uh you install key logger at
the end of the at the client system and
then you try to capture whatever data
the user is typing in like usernames and
passwords on the Facebook and the
rediffmail.com website that we saw and
then try to misuse that information to
get access to those resources then Wi-Fi
networks right Wi-Fi is something that
we use on a regular basis we got our
smart devices nowadays smartphones
tablets faets that we can connect to
Wi-Fi and start using all our services
our banking applications and our
smartphones and thus we want to ensure
that wireless connectivity is simple and
is secured so you want to use encryption
mechanism you want to use tools on your
smartphones antiviruses firewalls on
your smartphones to ensure that whatever
you are utilizing is going to remain
secure and then social engineering we've
looked at the fishing website on
facebook.com we've seen how easy it is
to clone websites and uh host them on
aache server so if you look at it as a
from ethical Hacker's perspective the
job of ethical hacker is to simulate
these kind of attacks that a hacker May
conduct and uh first of all you're
basically going to find out areas where
these attacks can happen think of it
from a hacker's perspective try to
simulate those attacks and see if those
attacks are going to be effective can
those attacks be prevented and can your
current security controls that you have
put in place identify detect and prevent
these attacks from happening in the
first place and that is what ethical
hacking is all about let's look at the
metas sploit attack Metasploit is a
framework of penetration testing that
makes hacking very simple you just need
to know how to utilize the tool you need
to identify the vulnerability associated
with a particular exploit and then run
the exploit on metas sploit we'll be
demoing this during the Practical so
there are active exploits and passive
exploits in active exploits exploits a
specific computer runs until execution
and then exits uses brute force and
exits when an error occurs in a passive
exploit these exploits wait for incoming
requests and exploit them as soon as
they connect they can also be used in
conjunction with emails and web browsers
so in passive exploits we create a
payload we uh like a reverse conect
connection payload we send it to the
victim once the victim installs that
software the machine will then initiate
a connection to us our machine will be
in a listen mode and then we will once
the software is executed at the end we
would then try to connect and exploit
that particular vulnerability this is
the uh practical that we'll be doing on
metas spit so let's move on with the
demos and then we'll see uh what we can
discuss amongst them all right let's
have a look at some of the demos that we
had uh talked about in the ethical
hacking and penetration testing module
we going to look at three different
demos the first one is going to be a SQL
injection attack that we're going to
perform on this tool that we have the
second one is a password cracking attack
on Windows 7 and the third one is a meta
based or a metas sploit based shell
shock attack on a Linux based web server
so let's get cracking I've powered on
this virtual machine uh which is the
ovas broken web application it is a tool
that is provided for people who want to
enhance their skills and they can
practice uh how to do these attacks in a
legal manner so we are going to go to
this site I'm just going to open up my
browser the IP address is 7113 to and
that's the ovas broken web application
that we want to utilize we're going to
head off to mutil Day 2 and we are going
to look at a SQL injection attack where
we want to bypass authentication now
this takes us to the login screen so we
can just try our luck here and see that
the authentication mechanism works the
account does not exist so the username
and password that we have supplied is
not the correct one so we want to ensure
that there's a SQL database and uh we
can uh try to attack it and see uh if we
can bypass the authentication now uh
what we want to do is we want to create
a SQL based malformed query that can
give us a different output so I'm just
going to type in a single quote over
here and type login and you can see that
this is now suddenly recognized as a
operator and there's a error that is
given out compared to the login that we
tried uh earlier when we used a proper
text based login mechanism it gave us
the account does not exist but here the
single code gave us a error and it shows
us how SQL works this is the query that
we had created now in the trainings that
you have for ethical hacking there would
be explanations of what these queries
are all about how the syntax works here
we just going to see if we can create a
malform query to log in as a user in
this case so what I'm going to do is uh
create the query over here and we're
going to give it a comparison so we're
going to give it R 1 equal 1 space
hyphen hyphen space and if you now click
login you should be able to bypass
authentication and you can see user has
been authenticated and we now have admin
access to this application now here the
SQL queries need to be crafted in such a
perspective that they're going to work
so there would be a lot of exercise in
identifying what the database is there's
a Microsoft database and Oracle database
and so on so forth and then you have to
choose those proper commands but identif
in that would come in the training right
now we're just looking at at a demo this
is how a SQL injection attack works now
let me log out here similarly now we are
in a login page the same query worked
wonders where it allowed us to bypass
authentication so it also depends on
what kind of a page I am and what query
would be accepted at this point in time
so here application understanding would
also come into the picture where uh
which function we calling upon when we
connected to a particular page now this
is a user lookup function right so again
here we try the same method test test
that's not going to work authentication
error B user on password and if we type
in the same query over here single quote
or and give it a condition single quote
r 1 equals 1 space hyphen hyen space now
here it is not going to log Us in
because this is not a login page this is
a user lookup form so here it would
instead give us a dump of all the
databases that it has so you can see all
the usernames and passwords coming in
that are stored in the user lookup field
so this is where the understanding comes
in of which query to create at what page
we depending upon the function that is
being called right so that's the SQL uh
injection attack that we wanted to look
at let's move on to password cracking
now this is a Windows 7 machine that we
have I'm just going to do a very basic
password cracking example we're just
going to log in now here the assumption
is that we are able to log in we have
access to a computer and we want to
check out other users who are using this
computer and see if we can find out
their passwords so that that uh we can
log in as a different user steal data if
required and we wouldn't be to blame if
there are any logs that have created so
here we've got a tool called can and
able that is installed right here now
I'm already an administrator on this
machine I'm checking out other
administrators who share the same
privileges or any other user who may be
on this system whose password I can
crack and thus I would be able to get
access through their account and then do
any malicious activity right so this
allows me to go into a haer tool and it
allows me to enumerate this machine and
identify all the users and passwords
that are there in this particular
machine right so I'm just going to click
on the plus sign and I'm going to import
uh hashes from a local system so where
are these files stored where does
Windows store its passwords in what
format are they stored and what this
tool does to retrieve those that's
something that we all need to know as a
ethical hacker right so import the
hashes from the local system click on
next next it's going to enumerate that
file and it is going to give you a list
of all the users that are there so you
can see the users are hacker admin test
the one that we are logged in as and
then there a user called virus as well
and you can see that this is the hash
value of the password that is being
utilized now there's a particular format
uh for the hash value for Windows and
how it stores but once we have these
hash values let's say if I want to crack
this password there are various attacks
that we can do for example a dictionary
based attack or a Brute Force attack
let's try root Force attack right ntlm
is the hashing mechanism that is used by
windows so we're going to try to create
an ntlm hash attack and here we're going
to use a predetermined rule set for
example we are not sure what characters
are being utilized over here so we just
create an attack like this using all
characters and uh lowercase a through
Zed uppercase a through Zed numeric 0
through 9 and all the special characters
let's say the password is between 7 and
16 characters and this is the character
set that we want to try the Brute Force
attack on what is a Brute Force attack
it is an attack where the computer is
going to try each and every permutation
and combination out of this character
set and try to figure out if the
password is going to be correct so if we
click Start it's going to start with a
particular characters and then it is
going to identify if that ntlm hash is
going to work against this character and
you can see the time is going to be
phenomenal over here so it's not
necessary that this attack would be
viable it will be 100% successful given
the time frame however the time frame is
huge enough for this attack to become a
little bit redundant there are other
attacks that we can do which can easily
identify this data for us as well but
that is something that we will look on
in future videos so that's how we can
get access to users and passwords uh
there are different mechanisms where
let's say we don't have login access
then what are we going to do how we can
create a fake user login or how we can
remotely access a machine and then try
to get the same access and that is what
we going to try to do in the next demo
on a Linux machine so what we are doing
in a Linux machine could also be doable
on the Windows machine with a different
exploit so what I'm going to do is this
is the Linux web server that I have that
I'm going to power on I'm going to use a
Ki Linux machine to hack that device and
I'm going to just power off my Windows 7
machine give it a minute till it boots
up now this is also a demo machine that
we have which has its own preconfigured
vulnerabilities so here we've got
something from the pentesters lab uh and
has a shell shock vulnerability imp
implemented inside shell shock
vulnerability affects Linux Mac and Unix
based operating systems for a particular
version of The Bash shell bash is the
bone again shell which is the command
line interface in these operating
systems so what we're trying to do here
is we going to use the K Linux machine
try to find out the vulnerability over
here and if it exists we're going to use
metas sploit to attack this machine now
the first and foremost thing is is we
want to identify the IP address we have
no idea what the IP address is we are in
the same subnet so we are assuming that
we able to connect to this machine so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open up a tool called zenmap I'm going
to open up a command line interface find
out what my IP address is and my IP
address is this with a subnet mask of
2555 255
255.0.0.0 live in a minute we'll get all
the IP addresses 71.1 2 133 254 and 120
we know that we are 128 at this point in
time uh 254 is the DHCP server so we
assuming that 133 is the machine that we
want to look at and let's then try to
see if we can scan that machine 133 and
we're going to do an intense scan to
find out which ports are open what
services are running over there and if
it is whether the pinest machine that we
were looking for can see of the start
Port 22 and Port 80 and somewhere here
it's going to give us the ports that are
open and the details about those ports
and somewhere here it will tell us that
this is the pentester lab machine that
we wanted which is correct so now we
want to do a vulnerability analysis on
this what we're going to do is I'm going
to use another GUI based tool called
Sparta which I can just find out from
here Sparta uses two tools in the
background a nmap tool and a tool called
ncto so we just going to to start
scanning 192 168
71133 was the IP address add to scope
and over a period of time you can see
all of these will start populating with
information there we are that's the ncto
tool coming in scanning on Port 80 which
is uh which means that it's a web server
using HTTP it tells us it's an Apache HT
httpd
2.2.2 and gives us the 22 port number as
well if we head over to the tab of ncto
or let's look at the screenshot first
this is what the website would be
looking like and ncto gives us the
options over here it tells us that there
is a vulnerability over here for shell
shock and this is the path where the
vulnerability is going to exist so what
we going to do we go back to the command
line sorry we open up a new one minimize
all these other windows and we are going
to open up Metasploit Metasploit is a
penetration testing tool that is used by
most hackers and ethical hackers to test
applications and test uh existing
exploits and vulnerabilities so just
give it a minute till it starts you can
see that already around 1,700 exploits
right here uh we're going to see all
those exploits with these commands there
we are sorry for the typo and it will
just give us a list of all the exploits
that are stored in Metasploit in this
version so all of these are windows
based if we scroll up we will be looking
at other vulnerabilities as well or
exploits the uni exploits LX OSX multi
exploits and we're looking for a exploit
for um multi- based Apache or HTTP let's
go up uh let's look at so this is the
one that we're looking for Apache mod
CGI bash environmental executable so
what we're going to do is we're just
going to copy it go back to the bottom
say use exploit and paste the one that
we wanted press enter say show options
so it will ask us to configure this I'm
just going to configure it based on the
knowledge that we have set our host
which is the remote host the victim's
machine so we put in the IP address
it asks us for the Target URI so that's
the path that we saw set Target URI to
CG hyphen bin SL status enter now with
the exploit we need to find a payload
that is going to give us the output that
we want so we say show payloads and it
will give us a list of all the
compatible payloads with this exploit
and we want to create a reverse TCP
connection which is this so we know it's
a Linux operating system we want this uh
payload to be set so set payload press
enter that's the payload coming in show
options now that we have set the payload
this is the options for the exploit and
now we want to set our options for the
payloads as well so we are creating a
reverse TCP connection which means we
are remotely executing code at the
victim side and making the victim
connect back to our machine which means
we need to set up a listener so I need
to put my IP address over here set local
host or lhost 192 16871
128 which was our IP address show
options again just to ensure everything
is fine which looks like it is and we
then type in the word exploit so that it
will start this attack you can see that
it has created a m pretor session at the
victim site and it has opened up a
session so if I do a PWD now PWD is a
Linux command for present working
directory and it will show us that we'll
connected to v dubdub dub CGI hyphen bin
do an LS it will list all the files
that's the status file over there do a
CD back slash it will take us to the
root of this machine now remember we saw
the uh passwords on a Windows machine
similarly we can head over to the CDC
folder LS and you can see these files
PSS WD and Shadow now PSS WD is the file
where Linux Stores it usernames and
Shadow is the file where passwords are
shown so do a cat command PSS WD and you
can see these users coming up so you can
see the last user pinest lab and you can
see there are no passwords so let's do a
cat Shadow and that's your hash value
for the password that we have for the
user pentest lab so these are the
different attacks that we need to
understand uh and we need to create
based on the vulnerabilities that exist
on different machines so we just looked
at windows and Linux and how we can
exploit them depending on existing
vulnerabilities as a ethical hacker this
is uh what we need to learn in our
trainings and then we need to clear our
exams based on this knowledge of how the
these things work so that uh we get
certified and then we can position
ourselves for the uh penetration testing
jobs now let's begin with who is a
certified ethical hacker a certified
ethical hacker is a person who's also
known as ethical hacker an ethical
hacker is just the opposite of an hacker
a hacker is a person who with Malicia
intent tries to misuse vulnerabilities
that they have identified in an
organization structure and then gain
access to unauthorized data whereas an
ethical hacker does the same thing they
try to locate the weakness they try to
loc at the vulnerabilities and they see
how they can be misused however the
intent is completely different and that
is what differentiates a hacker from an
ethical hacker hacker would be a
criminal with a malicious intent who
would try to misuse and personally gain
by doing criminal activity from that
particular activity that they have done
whereas ethical hacker would try to help
the organization in an authorized manner
so that's where the permission comes
into the picture the ethical hacker has
permission from the organization to
conduct some activity that would
identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses
in the information technology structure
of that organization and then once they
have been identified the ethical hacker
would then help the organization to plug
those vulnerabilities rather than misuse
those vulnerabilities so any person who
completes CH version 10 certification is
known as a certified ethical hacker so
there's a certification once you
complete that once you pass the exams
you can essentially call yourself as as
a certified ethical hacker and you're
going to get a certificate with the same
terminology so as you can see in the
diagram your responsibility would be as
a certified ethical hacker would be with
the proper permission of the
organization with the authorization
coming in with contracts coming in you
would legally help the organization to
identify those weaknesses and
vulnerabilities and once you find them
you're going to report them to the
organization and you're going to help
the organization with remediation plan
which will help them remediate mitigate
and resolve the vulnerabilities that you
have identified thus making the
organizations's security structure a lot
better based on which blackhe hat
hackers or malicious hackers would be
unable to attack the organization so
what is CH version 10 now this course
was initially introduced in September
2015 and I think if you look at the
versioning this the 10th version that is
there in the market so essentially CH or
the certified ethical hacking course as
the course itself has been for a long
time in the industry it's a very well
accepted course and it's a well-renowned
course the current version at as it is
was uh introduced in September 2015 and
is one of the toughest certifications in
the cyber security field this includes a
lot of information that you have to uh
learn that you have to know before you
can attempt the certification you will
master all ethical acing methodologies
that are used in penetration testing and
ethical hacking situations what does
that mean that means that CH version 10
is a structured course that will help
you look at all the phases that are used
in ethical hacking all the terminologies
that are utilized all the tools that are
utilized in such a manner that you can
penetration test or a vulnerability
assessment and identify and test the
vulnerabilities for their complexity and
this course once you complete the course
you would have mastered all the ethical
hacking techniques that are required
there are two exams one is a written
exam and the other is a practical exam
now you can opt for either or the
written exam is basically a multiple
choice question exam where uh they will
ask you scario based questions and you
have to answer those questions that is
something that we're going to look into
during this video the Practical exam is
basically a simulation exam where they
give you a scenario and you have to
complete some complete those tests and
prove that you are a good ethical hacker
based on the report that you give if the
report Tes to what the test was you
would be clearing that exam so practical
exam is a little bit tougher it's more
Hands-On it tests the actual skills that
you would perform in a hacking scenario
or ethical hacking scenario does the
Practical exam going to be that much
tougher the written exam to give it
Credence tests you a lot on your
mentality on your thought process on
your judgment characteristics so they
will give you a scenario and ask you
what do you think is happening what does
this attack T amount to or would be the
what what would be the next step in the
particular attack that they're
describing does it's more of an
intellectual uh test where you when your
thought processes are being checked and
uh you are giving those exam so what
would be the difference between these
exams in a practical exam you would be
conducting all those steps yourself and
you would be reaching reaching a
inclusion so here essentially you're
being tested on the skills that you have
developed on the execution part of it
and to see whether you can execute a
test end to end whereas in a written
exam you would be put in the middle of a
test where you have to assume something
where you have to understand what the
steps would have been performed in the
uh in the previous steps and what would
be the expected result and you're
supposed to analyze that and then come
to the correct answer so if there's a
question which which exam is better
written or practical the answer to that
is from int ual perspective a written
exam would be a lot tougher than a
practical exam and from an execution
perspective a practical exam would be
tougher than a written exam so it
depends on us which exam we want to give
both of them are widely accepted and
well respected uh in the information
security field so it's just the option
that we choose which exam we want to
give now this course the version 10
course is purely a tag based course okay
it is an offensive course there's no
defensive mechanisms so if you're
looking for questions of how to secure
yourself on the internet how to securely
configure operating system or how to
securely configure a server how to
configure a firewall this is not the
certification this basically talks about
attacking those devices so if you come
across a firewall how would you test a
firewall how would you identify
availabilities in those and how would
you bypass a firewall similarly if you
come across a server how are you going
to attack and hack the server Let It Be
windows or Linux based so this basically
becomes an attack based course you're
looking at offensive mechanisms over
here and not defensive ones at all so
what's new in this version in this
version there's a new module for iot
Internet of Things it focuses on
emerging attacks vectors like Cloud
artificial intelligence and machine
machine learning it basically talks
about smart devices and it talks about
the vulnerabilities the risk that the
smart devices face in today's world uh
for example it will tell you about the
industries that are utilizing all these
smart devices why are they utilizing it
for what kind of devices they are
utilizing and what are the risks within
those devices it will also give you a
lot of tools for you to practice upon to
identify such iot devices what would
constitute an iot or Internet of Things
device any device which has an IP
address and can connect to the internet
and create data so even your Smartwatch
your smartphone your cars that have
internet connectivity nowadays uh your
uh Google homes Amazon alexas all of
these devices would come under the iot
umbrella and have you ever wondered
about uh sitting at home having a Wi-Fi
having all of these devices even a smart
TV if you will connected to the Wi-Fi
and having you ever questioned how a
hacker would then be able to access your
home through all of these devices record
information and uh basically just spy on
you similarly an organization where they
utilizing iot they would be vulnerable
for the same vulnerabilities and this
course does include iot security to a
certain extent uh where we talk about V
abilities and how to identify those V
abilities in iot then there's a new
reability analysis module where it gives
you risk assessment it talks about CVSs
scoring systems it talks about how to do
a World Liberty Management program in
the first place what are the steps
required in a world liberity Management
program how should it be repeatable and
how it should be measurable as a program
and what should be the outcome so
basically it will give you a structured
way of how to do a vulnerability
management assessment and how do you
want to achieve the end goal thus
leading you to a penetration test so all
the modules are leveled up what do you
mean by leveled up that means they've
been updated to the latest tools latest
standards latest Technologies so you've
got cryptographic attacks you have got
attacks on appli apption like SQL
injection we will be talking about
packet sniffing using various tools all
of these are upgraded which means they
are up to the latest operating system so
even when we do this course you'll be
looking at operating systems like
Windows 10 Windows 8 Windows Server 2012
Windows Server 2016 KH Linux machines
Android machines and uben to desktop as
well so all of the operating systems are
latest the tools are latest and you will
be interacting with these tools and then
there's a mobile security tool kit as
well which uh will help you do a
penetration test on a mobile device so
these are what is new in version 10 now
let's talk about the roles and
responsibilities that ethical hacker
should have when they actually go into
the world now what are the
responsibilities roles what are the
capabilities that we should have that we
should be able to look at scripts that
would test for vulnerability so for
example a SQL injection attack it's a
script based attack let's say uh
cross-site scripting attack that is
again going to be a script based attack
so we maybe we want to go ahead a little
bit look at Windows systems and do a
Powershell attack and know about power
shell scripting a little bit if you look
at Linux Windows there's a bash shell
where there's bash scripting and you'll
want to learn that scripting as well now
the course doesn't include all these
scripting languages it does help you
understand what these scripting
languages are and it does have some
basic introduction to how these
languages can be utilized to create
those scripts then we also want to
develop tools to increase security you
want to look at those commands that are
utilized on all operating systems you
want to to look at the capabilities of
the operating systems of how to create
security parameters and ensure the
operating systems and applications
devices are secured uh you should be
able to perform risk assessment now when
you say risk assessment risk assessment
is the likelihood of an attack being
actually executed on an organization
based on the threats and the
vulnerabilities that we have identified
so risk assessment is something that uh
you find out a vulnerability and then
you try to figure out in a hypothetical
manner of what is the likelihood of that
vulnerability being exploited by a
hacker if they find that vulnerability
and if they do execute that what is the
impact that is going to happen on the
organization and what is the penalties
or the
to ensure that they are aware of these
vulnerabilities and they know what their
responsibilities are to maintain some
semblance of security in the
organization so why do we want to become
a certified ethical hacker now since
you're watching this video it's easy to
assume that we all are interested in
security we all are interested in
hacking but hacking is not a real job
for us to get a job in the industry on a
security parameter or information
security parameter we want to become a
certified ethical hacker so if you look
at the popular hacking cases that have
happened in 199 ' 90s there was a
national Crackdown on criminals
Microsoft ENT operating system was
hacked now this was back in the '90s
when security wasn't that much evolved
and there were a lot of attacks back
then uh that crippled infrastructure
that crippled Banks when they started
realizing that Computing isn't as easy
as it seems of course if you use a
computer the functionality is always
there but if the functionality is not
properly configured you're just exposing
yourself to cyber criminals where
they're going to steal information and
your organization may just go bankrupt
because of that in 13 an example Adobe
reported 2.9 Million accounts as stolen
in 2016 kasperski which is a Internet
Security firm uh announced that there
was 758 million malicious attacks that
occurred worldwide imagine that 758
million malicious attacks that were
identified and reported in 2018 Facebook
reported a loss of 13 million to
accounts that were stolen 2018 again
Kora reported 100 million customer
accounts being stolen and in 2018 again
Marriot 500 million Travelers accounts
stolen and manipulated now when you see
accounts for stolen how does it affect
the organizations now first and foremost
if those accounts were stolen that means
usernames and passwords were cracked and
those accounts may have contained credit
card information or may have contained
some personal information that would
identify the personal the person and
does make them gullible for a social
engineering attack or an identity theft
attack so it has a cascading effect if I
would have been affected or you would
have been affected with these attacks
the
repercutir a lot of energy and a lot of
time and at the end of it somebody has
to pay for that particular loss now in
this scenario the bank would have had to
Bear the loss but then that's a loss for
the bank and bank doesn't want to do
that and that's where they would try to
hire certified ethical hackers who would
try to test these vulnerabilities and
plug them in so that the end consumer is
also secured the bank is also secured
right in this case uh marot there were
500 million Travelers accounts that was
stolen a lot of credit card information
uh was uh leaked out email email
accounts were hacked and compromised and
thus there was a lot of repution that
happened now the thing is that there are
Al laws that these organizations need to
adhere to that tell the organizations
how to keep their information secure and
also have penalties in place if the
organization gets hacked and the
penalties are pretty severe so
organizations do not want to get hacked
or do not want to get compromised not
only from the customers perspective
where they would be losing customers
losing reputations and then thus facing
losses but also from a reg legislative
perspective where they would have to pay
fines to the government for the frauds
that have happened so so these are some
of the popular hacking cases that have
cost these organizations quite a lot of
money and thus uh they have a lot of
security in mind uh if you look at the
news uh in BBC News there was something
reported from a French uh police that
there was a virus that infected more
than 850,000 computers worldwide now on
the similar lines if you remember Ransom
Wares and if you look at wry that
happened in 2018 or 2017 it also cost
the world $4 billion in losses during
that just one small month of its
infection then Apple Google basically
disclosed that a large scale hacking
effort was targeted at Apple devices and
this has been uh it has reported that
there was a sustained effort to hack
iPhones over a period of at least 2
years which means that there's a
specific Target towards Apple consumers
and they are at a higher risk of getting
hacked than others then the Texas
government organizations hit by R
someware attack so hackers have infected
23 organizations connected to local
government government in the US state of
Texas with ransomware that means that
their databases have been encrypted the
government themselves do not have access
to that database the databases could
have been compromised by the hackers and
that means that whatever Services were
being provided to the users based on
that database May no longer be available
to the end users because of the
ransomware now moving on with these why
want do we want to become a certified
ethical hacker increased attacks lead to
more job openings now if you look at
ransomware the vokra attack that
happened in 2017 there was a knee-jerk
reaction given by the rest of the world
for it security suddenly budgets or
started opening up Suddenly people
wanted more ethical hackers on their
payrolls to test for vulnerabilities in
UK and Europe we have gdpr uh which is
again another law that imposes severe
penalties on organizations that get
hacked and for not having proper
security and a volum assessment and
penetration testing program in place so
that leads to a lot of job requirements
as well where organizations look at
people with the special skill set to
help them mitigate the vulnerabilities
to keep to safeguard them and their
customers from hackers and also from
penalties from law enforcement and
governments so thus the demand keeps on
increasing for ethical hackers which
automatically means that the salaries
are going to increase as well so more
the demand lesser the supply higher the
salaries that's plain economics then
challenge hacker with Malaysia's intent
so from a ethical hacker perspective it
is our duty to safeguard an organization
which means that we'll be pitched
against hackers and we have to ensure
that those hackers would be challenged
to the maximum limit before they even
try to get access to any of the
resources that we are trying to Pro
protect it offers a boost in your career
so more uh efforts that you put in more
vulnerabilities that you find the better
the career prospects that you have and
the better job aspects that you're going
to get and this also lets you keep
yourself updated on the latest
technology as the technology progresses
as we evolve on technology Security will
also evolve and the ethical hacker would
need to keep themselves updated on these
Technologies so this is what is a plus
point to become a certified ethical
hacker so why do we want to get the
certification and what would it mean by
being a c certified uh individual take
this into consideration you are applying
for jobs and uh you have been applying
for cyber security related jobs of
course and you go for an interview in
the interview you asked quite a few
questions and they will be testing you
on cyber security Concepts so they will
be asking you a lot of technical
questions about cyber security about
information security and any other
related topic so let's say in a few
minutes into the interview there are
some Concepts that you have not brushed
your skills upon and they ask you about
certifications and one of the main
certifications that is sought after is
the C certification and if if you're not
certified that's where things can become
a little bit problematic where
organizations today very proactively
start looking for people or candidates
who are already certified rather than
take them on board and get them
certified so in this scenari uh having a
certification would obviously help not
only to be uh shortlisted for the job
but the certification involves a lot of
training which would help you understand
the concepts and prepare you for the
interview a lot better as well right so
getting yourself certified is quite
necessary in today's world let's look at
what the certification is all about the
certification involves a very Hands-On
training that trains an individual into
thinking about cyber security from
Hacker's perspective and developing this
mindset is very important because To
Catch a Thief you have to think like a
thief teaches the candidate to spot
vulnerabilities in a system so it trains
you on how to identify flaws how to
verify that they exist and then how to
treat them as well like I said this is a
very sought after certification and
companies look for people who already
certified as C or a certified ethical
hacker so what is this certification all
about uh this is a globally accepted
certification and it tests the knowledge
that a candidate will have about threats
and their prevented preventive
mechanisms so the certification the exam
itself will test you on the parameters
the training would provide you with all
the information that you require to
clear the exam and to gain knowledge
from a real world perspective so will
train a candidate to think like a hacker
it will train the candidate to use the
tools to identify those flaws uh to spot
those uh flaws in the first place and it
will give an understanding to the
candidate where to look for those flaws
in the first place so essentially when
you get certified as a certified ethical
hacker you become a white hat hacker or
a ethical hacker which means that you
will be looking at flaws ethically and
Reporting them to those organizations
the certifying authori is the EC Council
it is a very wellknown and a widely
accepted certification Authority across
the globe it is based out of the United
States but the certification is valid
across the globe so what does it take to
take the exam and who can take the exam
in the first place now the basic
criteria is that a candidate should be
18 years and above so any person who has
completed an official EC Council
training is eligible to attempt the exam
without going through an application
process so there are two ways you can
actually attempt the exam you either
have work experience that means you're
already in the cyber security space you
already have some uh you already have
some Hands-On knowledge and you want to
give the exam in that scenario you just
have to prove that you have got two
years of experience with network or
information security and then you can
apply to EC Council to directly appear
for the exam without attending the
training else you can then approach
Council and register yourself for a
training course after which you can give
the exam so there are two ways that you
can deal with it what are the fees for
these exam now the fee itself is $500
for the exam candidates who take the
second route where they prove that they
have experience and they directly want
to appear for the exam there is another
additional $100 of application fee that
they have to pay to EC Council for them
to verify that you actually have that
experience and then allow you to appear
for the exam so what are the exam
questions like what what is the exam all
about the exam code is 312 hyen 50 and
there are 125 questions that need to be
answered in 4 hours now that sounds like
a lot of time but trust me it isn't the
questions are descriptive in nature they
give you a scenario you have to identify
those keywords based on the knowledge
and the understanding that you have and
then gauge the correct answer for that
particular scenario and the scenarios
could be a little bit complex could be a
little bit confusing the exam will be a
multi Choice question exam so one
questions with four answers if any
question has multiple answers they will
mention it in the question itself the
pass percentage cuts off at around 60 to
85% so there is no fixed percentile
every question has a different grade
every question has a different value and
based on the questions that you have
been asked and the correctness of the
answers you would either pass somewhere
between 60 to 85% the results are
immediate so once you complete the exam
you submit it it will uh let you know
that itself whether you have cleared or
not so what are the skills that you
require for this exam you must have very
good networking skills and when we say
networking skills you should know your
protocols you should know how computers
communicate with each other uh the
protocols like https FTP SMTP and
anything about the OSI layer you should
be good with your operating systems the
candidate should also have a very good
knowledge about operating systems and
then we say operating systems we want
the candidate to know about
troubleshooting methods and how the
operating system work in the first
manner so you should have some basic
skills about operating systems and the
configuration of these operating systems
uh you should also know the different
types of cyber attacks such as social
engineering fishing and how to prevent
these attacks so this is the exam skills
the training prepares you with all these
skills the candidate must be able to
hack into an organization system with
permission and erase all digital
evidences so uh the training itself will
get you accustomed uh with all the
hacking phases how a hack is constructed
how a hack is made more effective and
how the hack evolves and later on how
you can delete all the evidences of the
hack that has happened so for the exam
you should have or you should be very
good with your networking skills
understanding protocols and how they
work configuring operating systems and
troubleshooting them you should be able
to classify different cyber attacks and
know how to launch them as well and you
should be able to hack into devices and
erase all digital evidences that may
have happened password cracking and
cryptography is also a very much
required skill to clear the exam there
must be a few rules followed and there
is a Code of Ethics from EC Council so
they essentially give you a
non-disclosure agreement before you
start the training which you have to go
through and you have to sign it
submitted to EC Council only then are
you allowed to go forward with the exam
so what are the exam all about what are
thep topics within that exam and what
kind of questions would you get so there
are seven domains in this training based
on which they will ask you questions
when you say background uh background is
nothing but your knowledge on networking
skills U your knowledge on a little bit
of operating systems how Communications
happen how protocols work and so on so
forth analysis would be where you
analyze certain attacks and you're able
to uh analyze let's say packets and
based on those packets you can identify
whether uh it's a legitimate packet or
is it a malicious packet with any
malicious data within it then with
security tools you are able to talk
about security as in the concepts of
security like confidentiality integrity
and availability Triad the Ia
identification authentication
authorization and accountability Tri
aspects uh and various other Concepts
that are there in security so you'll be
questioned on those topics as well tools
and programs ethical hacking carries a
lot of tools and you should be
conversent with those tools uh in the
during the training there will be
hundreds of tools that you would be
going through and you would be facing
questions on these tools so there would
be some basic questions like commands
that would be given to you to identify
what that command would execute or there
would be a specific scenario given to
you and then they would ask you which is
the most uh suitable tool that you would
utilize to crack that particular
scenario and then there's the
methodology of course of how or which
steps would you take in this particular
attack to be successful then we talk
about policies and the ethics so as you
can see all of these domains have
different weightage in the exam 21.79%
for your backgrounds so you can see the
background information is very much
important operating systems networking
uh little bit of applications little bit
of architecture of how things are
deployed now CH is normally an advanced
certification right so there are a few
presumptions that you already know a
little bit about active directory how
operating systems work uh how identity
management works so there's a little bit
of presumption that you have these
background knowledge but in the training
you can be prepped up for that knowledge
as well so it does contain a little bit
of insights about how these things work
analysis is where you're looking at some
scenarios and based on the eviden is
given to you you can analyze what's
going on so that's at 20.73%
security which is the main topic is at 2
3.73% tools and programs related to
security would be at
28.9% the methodologies would carry a
weightage of
8.77 policies 1.90 and ethics
2.17% so you have 125 questions you can
figure out percentile wise how many
questions you would get on each of these
domains so let's have a look at these
domains a little bit more the background
is about Network and communication
Technologies again like I said protocols
procedures Services how computers work
so ports on a computer how uh how ports
are utilized by services and how
Communications happen over these
services and these ports how we can scan
these ports to identify what's going on
and then try to find out vulnerabilities
within them then we have got information
security Technologies and the
information security threats as well so
when I want to launch an attack on a
device where would I find
vulnerabilities is it just on the
network uh do I look at the operating
system do I look at different
applications that are there on the
opting system and so on so forth so
where are the threats that's something
that we need to identify and that's what
this domain deals with so uh 27
questions from this domain then analysis
and assessment information security
assessment and Analysis and the security
assessment process so uh let's say
you're in a penetration test and you
want to launch an attack what is the
assessment that you want to do before
you launch that attack what is the
process you want to conduct and how
you're going to analyze the viability in
the first place to identify
which penetration test or which attack
you should uh do at that particular
point in time then security would talk
about information security controls
controls would be all the uh security
elements that you can Implement to
prevent uh hacking so firewalls IDs IPS
antiviruses or endpoints all of these
would be included in this domain
information security attack detection so
it's not only about how you can attack
you also want to know if you're being
attacked in the first place so analysis
would basically identify how you're
being attacked and the detection is
where where you first detect that
something is wrong after which you can
analyze it right and how you can prevent
uh security attacks happening at your
organization as well so which firewall
would fit at what OSI layer what uh in
the architectural aspect where do you
want to place a ID uh IDs or an IPS
where would you want to place a firewall
whereever you want to place a UTM to
have a layered approach a structur
structured approach towards security
where a hacker would have to peel off
layers of security to reach the data
that they wanted to get access to in the
first place so there will be 30
questions from the security domain 16
questions on the analysis and assessment
domain the fourth domain is the tools
systems and programs so this is where
all the tools that you would have
utilized resume so this is where all the
tools that you have utilized in the
ethical hacking scenario and there will
be questions asked about those tools so
in the training there are some tools
that are prescribed in the course where
you'll have to concentrate on those
tools you'll have to get your hands on
on those tools to understand how those
tools work and then give appropriate
answers in this domain so there would be
36 questions for tools systems and
programs then the fifth domain is
procedures and methodology information
security procedures and assessment
methodologies would be asked over here
so how would you uh conduct a test how
would you conduct a avability assessment
what is the method and the procedures
that you would follow in conducting
these tests so there would be around 11
questions for this domain the sixth one
is regulations and policies so this is
all about uh some Basics that you need
to be aware about uh for information
security policies and Frameworks uh like
ISO 2701 pcidss and these uh regulations
that are available in the real world
that you can that you can help you or
guide you to place a security
architecture on your organization these
questions are not going to be in depth
about any of the laws or policies it's
just checking your awareness whether
you're aware of these laws or policies
and where they can be implemented so you
can see there only a couple of questions
that would come in regulations and
policies and then ethics ethics is the
code of conduct of how you are expected
to behave as a ethical hacker what is
expected out of your job rule what you
should be doing and what you shouldn't
be doing so there would be around three
questions of ethics in the exam now
let's look at a few sample questions
from the exam as well so this will help
you get an idea what the exam questions
would be so consider the attack scenario
given below there are five steps listed
step one starts with user browses a web
page the second step is where user uh
web server replies with the requested
page and sets a cookie on the user's
browser in the third step attacker
steals the Cookie by either creating an
attack of on the network for sniffing or
at the application with cross scripting
or sending a fake mail or hosting a fake
website by a social engineering attack
which is a fishing attack in the fourth
step attacker gets access using whatever
they have done and orders a product
using modified cookies and in the fifth
step the product is actually delivered
to the attacker's address whereas the
bill is footed by the victim so what is
the attack that is happening here
identify the web application attack is
it a session fixation attack is it a
unvalidated redirect attack is it a
cookie poisoning attack attack or is it
a denial of service attack so again
going through these steps which of these
would be the correct answer in this
scenario it is C which is a cookie
poisoning attack because if you look at
the steps the attacker basically
hijacked the cookie or stole the cookie
and then modified it to be utilized for
some malicious reasons second question
which one of the following scanning
techniques do attackers use to bypass
firewall rules logging mechanisms and
also hide themselves as usual Network
traffic a stealth scanning technique B
TCP connect scanning technique C
maintaining access or D fin scanning
technique now here as you can understand
we need to know what these techniques
are right so what does a fin scan mean
what is maintening access what is TCP
connect what does TCP mean TCP is
transmission control protocol how does
it work so when you connect using TCP
what is actually happening in the back
end that is what the knowledge is all
about and in here the correct answer is
a stealth scanning technique so what do
we mean by stealth how can we achieve
that which tools help us achieve that
that is what we want to gain an
understanding in before we can attempt
the exam question three which of the
following Wi-Fi chalking method refers
to drawing symbols in public places to
advertise open Wi-Fi networks War
walking War flying War chalking or War
driving now here we need to know first
that there is something known as W Wi-Fi
chalking right and there are some symb
sybols that are utilized globally and
they recognized globally they're
standardized by the way and these
symbols represent some type of Wi-Fi
networks for example open wi-fi which
means you can freely connect to the
Wi-Fi or paid Wi-Fi where you have to
pay before you can connect to the Wi-Fi
or once you get connected you're first
to have to make a payment only then the
internet would be activated right so for
different Wi-Fi mechanisms there are
different options that can be utilized
and which of the question is which of
the Wi-Fi chalking method refers to
drawing these symbols in public places
to advertise open wi-fi so in this the
answer is war chocking now the question
here itself is a little bit so here the
question itself is is a little bit
misleading because it mentions Wi-Fi
chalking in the question itself and that
would then lead us to whether war
chocking is a correct answer or not so
uh some of the questions could be a
little bit misleading so let's start
looking at the certifications so to be
an ethical hacker you must hold a
certification with specializes in
ethical hacking or in cyber security
companies look for candidates who are
globally certified when we say globally
certified they're looking for a
certificate that has been given by an
organization that is recognized globally
and is well accepted in the industry so
these are the top five certifications a
candidate can obtain the first one
become a certified ethical hacker then
there is global information assurance
certification penetration tester then
offensive security certified
professional
pentest plus and finally the license
penetration tester now these
certifications are offered by different
organizations all of these organizations
are recognized globally and their
certifications are well accepted uh in
the technical space so let's start off
with the certified ethical hacker and
we'll look at uh the organizations that
provide these certifications and how we
can attain them so C or certified
ethical hacker in its current form is in
its version 10 it's been re IED and
updated over a period of time EC council
is the certifying Authority for C they
have their own authorized training
centers through which you can attend
trainings give those exams get yourself
certified and thus become globally
certified and uh can be eligible to
apply for security related jobs it is a
very well-known certification and is
widely accepted at the same time it
would test the candidates knowledge of
security threats and preventive measures
now there are two types of exams that
you can give with CA one is a multiple
choice question exam which is
theoretical in nature they ask you
questions and you answer the correct you
select the correct answers if you're
clear you get certified the second
certification nowadays is where there's
a practical exam associated with it
that's a uh you'll have to purchase the
voucher for that exam and give that exam
the Practical exam is held in a Virtual
Lab where they you're given scenarios
and based on those scenarios you have to
resolve the questions given to you and
give proof of the resolution which would
then uh get you certified as an ethical
hacker the theoretical exam in this
scenario is the fees is around $500 this
is for the multiple choice question exam
uh where you can pay the fees and you
can uh attend through a uh online portal
and he can give the exam directly the
exam is 4 hours long in which you have
to answer 125 questions now 4 hours for
125 questions seems a long time but it
isn't it's a very technical exam there
are scenario based questions and it
would take some time for you to analyze
and understand the question and then
identify the equivalent correct answer
so it's a very competitive exam and
you'll have to study really hard to
clear this exam as well the cut off for
passing varies from 60 to 85% so there
is no exact grade and all the questions
have different weightages so depending
on the questions that have been given to
you and the way that you have answered
them you would pass at either 60% or you
would pass when you have scored 85% once
you are C certified which is a very
technical certification you will be
qualified to apply for job roles as a
penetration tester or a security
engineer these are job roles where you
would be responsible of ethically trying
to attack applications uh servers
switches and try to find out
vulnerabilities within them the training
of this certification will make you
Adept in most of these tools that are
required there are a lot of practicals
in this uh trainings and uh if uh you
successfully completed those practicals
clearing the exam is a easy task with
the practicals comes your knowledge and
would help you understand how you would
be performing penetration tests in the
real world an average annual salary in
the USA for a c certified person is
around
$91,000 and in India is around 476,000
odd rupees the salaries would vary as
far as organization are concerned uh
more established organizations can
afford to pay a little bit more but
these are average out salaries that we
have seen across the market the next
certification is the gpen also known as
the global information assurance
certification penetration tester this
certification looks into the different
pen testing practices and methods also
focuses on the various problems and Pen
testing so again this is where you
getting certified as a penetration
tester so it's again a technical
certification where your knowledge on
networking applications and security of
which will be tested uh you will be
trained on this of course so the
training will include all these areas
where you need to focus identify those
problems and thus be ready for the real
world scenarios the candidate will have
to understand networking Concepts and
operating systems such as Linux and
windows and you should be very well
aware of the tcpip protocols this is
true for any of the technical
certifications for ethical hacking Gia
is the certification provider it's gain
a very well-renowned and well accepted
uh certification Authority across the
globe the exam fees are
$1,899 82 to 115 questions to be
answered in 3 hours now why 82 to 115 it
depends on the test that has been
Associated and depending on how you're
answering those questions uh you would
be given those many number of questions
to begin with but all of these need to
be answered in 3 hours 74% is the past
percentage that is required to clear
this exam the average annual salary in
the USA is around
$96,000 while in India it is around uh
similar to certified ethical hacking
then looking at the next certification
from offensive security called the ocp
uh offensive security certified
professional this is another penetration
testing certification highly technical
in nature and it is an entirely Hands-On
certification the previous two
certifications that we saw we talked
about about CH where there are two
different exams you could either take
the theoretical exam and give your mcqs
or you could take the Practical one here
you don't have an option this is a
practical exam so the test is conducted
on a virtual Network so they send out
instructions to you there's a virtual
lab that is given out to you and they
give you the questions and you have to
perform those assessments create those
reports and provide it to the certifying
Authority in this case offensive
security uh if you match their criteria
as of whatever you have identified in
those reports you get certified here the
requirements of good understanding of
networking protocols how systems
function how K Linux operating system
functions and the candidate must
complete offensive Securities
penetration testing with the Ki Linux
course and pass the Hands-On exam so
this focuses purely on Ki Linux Ki Linux
is an operating system that is freely
distributed over the internet and comes
structured with around 300 plus tools
used for ethical hacking so this course
totally relies on KH Linux for you to
use as a tool set for penetration
testing the certificate provider has
stated is offensive security the name of
the course is OSP offensive security
certified professional exam is around
$800 to
$550 Now understand that this exam is
Technical and is Hands-On so for you to
prepare for this exam they come up with
virtual Labs where you can start
practicing and honing your skills
depending on the number of days for
which you have purchased the access to
that particular Labs the amount will
vary from $800 which would be the
minimum access days available to
$1,550 where the maximum number of days
would be given to you for practicing
once you're ready even during the time
time span of where you have that access
once you're ready for the exam you can
you can attempt the exam and clear the
average annual salary is similar around
$91,000 for the US market and and 95,000
rupees in the Indian market then looking
at the comia pentest plus comia is
another certification Authority or a
certification provider a training
provider that that will help you get
yourself certified in the ethical
hacking space so they have certification
called pentest plus which is focused
towards penetration testing so it is an
intermediate level certification it
assesses the vulnerability assessment
and the penetration testing skills of a
candidate here the training will provide
you with all the essentials where it
will help you identify how to do
vulnerability assessments how to
identify those vulnerabilities and then
which tools to utilize for what kind of
a penetration test for the requirements
a minimum of 3 to four years of hands-on
experience in the information security
field also a coma Security Plus or a
network Plus or equivalent knowledge is
required so in the network plus uh they
talk about securing networks and uh they
help you understand the OSI layers the
tcpip layers and uh help you understand
the protocols and all of those things so
having that knowledge is an added
Advantage the certificate provider is
comia and the cost of the exam is around
$349 maximum number of questions is
$85 and I think it's a 3our exam the
passing percentage is uh scoring 750
marks out of a possible 900 so the scale
is the minimum you can ever score is 100
if you're completely un prepared the
maximum you can score is 900 uh you get
a leeway of 150 marks for your uh
certifications so you have to score a
minimum of 750 to clear the exam average
annual salary for a Kamia certified
penetration test plus professional is
$97,000 in the US market and in the
Indian market it would be around 5 lakh
rupees then comes the license
penetration tester now this is an
advanced certificate again from EC
Council this is where EC Council gives
you license which certifies that you
have undergone thorough training and
have cleared your exam in which you can
conduct or lead a audit for
vulnerability assessment and penetration
testing it is an expert level
certification comes after the C
certification it is the Ultimus test
which tests this candidates penetration
testing skills so there are two
certifications over here one is the ecsa
EC Council certified security analyst
once you clear that you get you can
appear for the license penetration
tester both of these are Hands-On
certifications so you will be given a
Virtual Lab you will be given a scenario
in which you'll have to perform some
assessments create reports submit it to
the EC Council they will analyze your
reports if they meet the criterias that
have been identified you would then be
certified as a licensed penetration
Tester the candidate must be above 18
years of age a recertification is
required every 3 years so the validity
is 3 years after 3 years you will have
to be recertified or there is a
continuing Point education system over
there where you can score points by
publishing articles by attending
trainings or giving out trainings and
you can get yourself re certified it is
preferred that the candidate has CH and
the ecsa certification so the previous
certification that we saw certified
ethical hacker and then the ecsa EC
counil certified security analyst after
which you can appear for the lpt license
penetration Tester the certificate
provider again is EC Council the license
penetration tester exam has a different
process the candidate must purchase an
exam dashboard for
$899 which is valid for a year so once
you purchase the voucher the validity is
one year uh you can prepare within that
one year and then give the exam and
obain the certification only once you're
ready the exam can be scheduled and you
can give that exam the exam consists of
three different levels each level has
three different challenges the candidate
must pass at least one challenge in
order to qualify for the next level and
for each level the exam is 6 hours so
this is a grelling exam this is Hands-On
they're giving you challenges and they
are going to test you on your skills as
a penetration tester so be ready to be
very Hands-On for this kind of a
certification average annual salary in
the US is around $100,000 and above and
in India $825,000 and
above next shuti will guide you through
the career of an ethical hacker with the
increase in the number of cyber crimes
across the globe the there is also an
increase in the number of cyber security
jobs and the role of an ethical hacker
tops the list hi guys this is shuti from
Simply learn and today I will run you
through this video on ethical hacking
career so let's get started and explore
the world of ethical hacking let's begin
with a few facts did you know that by
the year 2021 there will be 3.5 million
cyber security job openings that is a
huge number isn't it and also according
to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
there will be 28% increase in the number
of jobs from 2016 to 2026 for
information security analysts which
includes ethical hackers this proves
that there is a great demand for ethical
hackers at the moment as I mentioned
earlier the number of cyber crimes
across the world will increase as the
digital era will only continue to grow
organizations will be on the lookout to
hire professionals who can fight these
cyber crimes and protect the company's
data and to fight these cyber crimes
crimes we will require individuals who
can think like a hacker and who is that
well to do this job we have ethical
hackers as you might be knowing an
ethical hacker is stained to discover
system vulnerabilities an ethical hacker
is also known as a white hat hacker he
or she is given authorization from the
company to perform security assessments
and at the end an ethical hacker would
have to report the findings back to the
company so that the vulnerabilities can
be fixed an ethical hacker performs
these security assessments with the help
of various hacking techniques and tools
let's now move on to our next topic that
is the steps to become an ethical hacker
you might wonder how to start your
ethical hacking career right well I will
take you through that step by step
firstly the candidate must have a
computer science or an information
technology bachelor's degree it is also
possible to become an ethical hacker
without these degrees but provided you
have the required skill sets and
experience the next requirement to be an
ethical hacker is that the candidate
must have a minimum of 2 years of
experience in the information security
field you have to start your career with
a software or a networking job and only
then can you move onto the ethical
hacking field you have to start your
career with a software or a networking
job and only then can you move into the
ethical hacking field coming to the
certifications it is necessary for the
candidate to hold various cyber security
certifications certifications play a
white vital role in the field of cyber
security your job opportunities can
solely depend on these certifications to
become an ethical hacker you can start
off with the foundational level
certifications such as the CCNA and
comia Security Plus certifications
finally the last step to become an
ethical hacker is to clear the certified
ethical hacker examination CH
certification is provided by the EC
Council it trains the candidate to
protect a company's Network by using the
same tools and methods that a hacker
would use the CH exam will have a
duration of 4 hours with 125 number of
questions if the candidate clears this
exam then he or she will become a
certified ethical hacker now that you
know the steps to become an ethical
hacker let's look into the skill sets
which are required to help you achieve
these steps first and foremost an
ethical hacker needs to have an in-depth
knowledge of the working of the
operating systems knowledge of Windows
Linux and Macintosh operating systems is
required for penetration testing
creating exploits and bug hunting
programming will be important so
knowledge of programming languages such
as C C++ HTML Python and PHP will be
very helpful basic knowledge of
networking tcpip protocols and OSI model
is necessary as networking is the
foundation of cyber security for
securing databases knowledge of SQL
nosql postgre SQL is necessary
cryptography is used to secure
information it is the process of
converting data from a readable format
to a non-readable format and vice versa
Crypt analysis is decryption without a
secret key in most cases certified
ethical hacker would need to perform
Crypt analysis hence ethical hacker has
to be comfortable with cryptography and
crypt analysis ethical hackers should be
proficient in network security control
measures such as intrusion detection and
intrusion prevention techniques now
let's move on to the responsibilities
which are taken care of by an ethical
hacker let's have a look at these
responsibilities an ethical hacker is
responsible for scanning systems open
and closed ports using tools like nessis
and nmap vulnerabilities and threats are
identified by doing this in addition to
scanning for vulnerabilities they also
search the Deep corners of the network
to spot critical information such as
passwords which can make the
organization vulnerable to an attack in
addition to building and maintaining IDs
IPS and firewalls they also try to evade
these security measures to gauge the
performance of the systems a lot of
times a company's online fraud or online
theft incidents are looked into by an
ethical hacker an ethical hacker also
checks for sniffing networks and
hijacked web servers and applications
those were the responsibilities of an
ethic eal hacker now let's look into the
various job roles an ethical hacker can
apply for it is a misconception that an
ethical hacker will perform only
penetration testing well there are a
number of other jobs an ethical hacker
can apply for the different job roles
such as that of a penetration tester
information security analyst security
consultant and an information security
manager let's have a look at each of
these job roles one by one a penetration
tester performs the typical
responsibility of an ethical hacker that
is he or she tries to exploit a security
system's vulnerabilities this is carried
out using different hacking tools and
techniques an ethical hacker can also
apply for the role of an information
security analyst there is a difference
between the job rules of a penetration
tester and that of an information
security analyst here the candidate will
be required to primarily design and
protect the organization's network from
various cyber attacks finally the
candidate is also require to document
the identified security breaches so that
it can be omitted the next time the
responsibilities of a security
consultant is more or less similar to
that of an information security analyst
that we saw previously as a security
consultant you will be responsible to
design Implement and maintain various
Security architectures in addition to
this you're also required to upgrade the
security systems as and when required
finally an ethical hacker can also apply
to the role of an information security
manager as the name suggests this role
will require the candidate to possess
managerial skills as an information
security manager is responsible to head
the it and the information security team
now that we have seen the
responsibilities the skills and the
steps to become an ethical hacker let's
have a look at the different companies
hiring ethical hackers to name a few we
have Bank of America Ernest and Young
KPMG Urban Pro and IBM let's now look
into to the salary structure of an
ethical hacker well in India the average
annual salary of a certified ethical
hacker is nearly
476,000 rupees and in the US the average
annual salary of a certified ethical
hacker is
$91,000 now I will guide you through a
sample resume of a penetration tester as
you can see on your screens this is a
sample resum of a penetration tester we
will look into this resume closely and
understand how your resum should look
like if you are applying for the role of
a penetration tester as always you can
start off with your name and your email
ID and your phone number followed by a
brief summary of your current job
profile it is preferred to add your
LinkedIn profile link here and also your
GitHub profile link if you have one as I
mentioned earlier this is a sample
resume for a penetration test term and
hence we have to have more than 2 years
of experience in the information
security field as as you can see under
the experience section the candidate has
two prior experiences out of which the
first experience is that of a software
tester and second is that of a
penetration tester you would have to
mention your latest or current
experience at the beginning you can
mention your job role and the company
and the duration under which you can
list out the various responsibilities
that you are looking into currently if
you are a penetration tester you can
mention responsibilities such as
security monitor ing blackbox testing
documentation of the results
vulnerability scanning and so on below
this you can mention your first
company's experience with the roles and
responsibilities that you have performed
earlier here the candidate was a
software tester before becoming a
penetration tester let's move on to the
education section here the candidate
holds a bachelor's degree in computer
science you can mention your degree
followed by the university name or if
you're applying for any other role in
the cyber security domain it is
recommended that you list out the
certifications as well to start off with
a CCNA certification will be preferred
followed by a certified ethical hacker
certification which is a must if you are
applying for the role of a penetration
tester in addition to it the certified
expert penetration tester certification
will also hold a great Advantage after
mentioning the certifications you can go
ahead and mention your skill sets here
we have the technical skills and non
technical skills under technical skills
you can mention the programming
languages that you know here we have C
C++ Java Pearl you can also mention the
operating systems that you have worked
on for example Windows Linux Unix and in
addition to the programming languages
and the OS you can also mention the
tools that you know such as nmap
Metasploit tools which will be helpful
if you are applying for the role of a
penetration tester then you can also
mention encryption Technologies
knowledge of SQL and Bug tracking
systems if you have worked on them
before if you have participated in eons
you can mention that here as well under
the non- technical skills you can
mention various competitions that you
have taken part in and the games that
you like and other extracurricular
activities finally you can also mention
the projects undertaken under the
projects undertaken you can talk about
the various projects that you have
performed in your company or outside the
company here we have two projects one as
a s sofware test engineer and second one
as a penetration tester so this is how a
resume of a penetration tester will look
like today we are going to talk about
some really interesting and Powerful
hacking gadgets you should know about in
2024 but remember this is just for
learning we don't want anyone getting
into trouble so moving on the best way
to keep your computers and devices safe
is to know about the risk so some risk
are easy to cater using strong passwords
and don't download from Bad webs we
sites and don't hand your unlocked
device to strangers but there are also
hidden dangers that can cause big
problems some tools look innocent but
can be very dangerous here are seven
gadgets that look normal but are
actually powerful hacking tools these
tools are made for Security Experts to
test system but they can be misused so
let's Ki things off with a device that's
small but incredibly powerful that is
Raspberry Pi so Raspberry Pi is a
compact and Affordable Computer
that has revolutionized the tech world
originally designed for educational
purposes it has become a favorite among
hobbist makers and even professionals
despite its small size it boasts
impressive capabilities including
multiple USB ports HDMI output and
support for various operating systems
like Linux and Windows 10 iot core the
Raspberry Pi can be used for a wide
range of projects from simple
programming and gaming to complex iot
systems and home automation the RAs Veri
can also be dangerous hacking tool with
the right software it can be used to
perform a variety of hacking task for
example it can run K Linux a popular
operating system for penetration testing
this allows it to be used for Network
scanning password cracking and even
setting up Rogue access points to
intercept data its small size makes it
easy to hide and its affordability means
it's accessible to many in the wrong
hands this innocent looking device can
become a powerful tool for malicious
activities now that we have seen the
potential of the Raspberry Pi which by
the way is one of the personal favorites
for tinkering let's move on to another
seemingly simple but powerful device the
Wi-Fi adapter so Wi-Fi adapter might
seem like a simple device used to
connect to wireless networks but it can
be a potent hacking tool in the wrong
hands these adapters when paired with
the right software can intercept and
monitor Wireless Communications making
them invaluable for network analysis and
penetration testing for example they can
be used with tools like air crack Ang to
crack Wi-Fi passwords hackers can use
Wi-Fi adapters to perform attacks such
as packet sniffing and man in the-
Middle attacks these activities can lead
to unauthorized access to networks data
theft and sever security breaches it's
like having a digital spy in your pocket
while essential for legitimate security
testing it's crucial to be aware of
their potential misuse and to secure
your own wireless networks against such
threats speaking of Wi-Fi you won't
believe how sneaky this next device is
let's take a look at a device that takes
Wireless seconding to a whole new level
the Wi-Fi pineapple the Wi-Fi pineapple
looks like a standard router but it is a
sophisticated device used for hacking
wireless networks it allows attackers to
create Rogue Wi-Fi access points
tricking users into connecting and
revealing their login credentials
imagine connecting to what looks like a
free public Wi-Fi only to have have your
data intercepted this device is capable
of advanced manin the-middle attacks
monitoring and recording data from all
connected devices Additionally the Wi-Fi
pineapple can capture Wi-Fi handshakes
which can then be used to crack Network
passwords its powerful feature makes it
a favorite among penetration testers for
assessing network security but in the
wrong hands it can be used for malicious
activities highlighting the importance
of robust wireless security so from
Wi-Fi to Bluetooth which is everyone
these days right let's now explore a
powerful tool for Bluetooth hacking the
ubertooth one the ubertooth one is an
open- Source Bluetooth testing tool that
appears to be a simple USB dongle
despite its unassuming appearance it can
monitor and analyze Bluetooth
Communications making it a valuable
asset for those testing the security of
Bluetooth devices think of it as a spy
for Bluetooth traffic the ubertooth one
can capture Bluetooth packets perform
Bluetooth attacks and even explore
vulnerabilities in Bluetooth networks
its ability to dissect Bluetooth traffic
makes it a powerful tool for both
legitimate security research and
potential misuse understanding its
capabilities helps highlight the
importance of securing bluetooth enabled
devices against unauthorized access and
attacks continuing with radio frequency
tools which honestly sounds like
something out of a spy movie so let's
discuss the hack rf1 and its versatile
capabilities so the hack rf1 is a
versatile software defined radio SDR
platform that can transmit and receive
radio signals from 1 mahz to 6 GHz it
looks like a standard electronic device
but can be used for a wide range of
hacking activities imagine being able to
capture and manipulate signals across a
broad spectrum with the hack rf1 users
can capture and analyze various radio
signals Jam frequencies and even spoof
signals to manipulate communication
systems this tool is particularly useful
for exploring and testing the security
of wireless communication systems while
it serves an essential role in
legitimate research and development the
hack rf1 also demonstrates the need for
robust security measures to protect
against radio frequency based attacks so
now let's look at a tool that takes
advantage of a computer's trust in USB
devices and trust me this one sneaky the
USB rubber ducky so the USB rubber ducky
is a device that looks like a regular
flash drive but acts like a keyboard
typing commands into any computer it's
plugged into hackers use it to execute
pre-programmed scripts that can steal
data install malware or take control of
the target device it's like a tiny
digital ninja this tool exploits the
trust computers have in USB devices
making it a potent weapon for cyber
attacks it's a reminder to be cautious
about plugging in unknown USB devices as
they could be rubber duck is in Disguise
ready to unleash harmful commands and
compromise your system security so
finally we have got a real undercover
Gadget here let's uncover the secret
capabilities of the land turtle the land
turtle looks like a typical USB ethernet
adapter but it's a covered hacking tool
used to Monitor and infiltrate networks
don't let its innocent appearance fool
you it provides hackers with several
capabilities such as Network scanning
DNS poofing and data capture the land
turtle can be discreetly plugged into a
network allowing access to gather
sensitive information and gain uned
access its ability to operate undetected
makes it particularly dangerous
emphasizing the need for vigilance and
robust network security measures to
prevent unauthorized devices from
connecting to your systems so there you
have it guys we have explored some of
the most powerful and dangerous hacking
gadgets out there these tools can do a
lot of damage if they fall into the
wrong hands that's why it's so important
to stay informed and Vigilant about
cyber security today we will explore the
world of cyber security with hacker GPD
specialized version of chat GPD designed
for ethical hacking and cyber security
in a digital landscape where cyber
attacks occur every 39 seconds causing
billions in Damages annually hacker GPT
provides the essential tools and
knowledge to defend against these
threats so hacker gbd offers guidance on
a wide range of topics including
security practices ethical hacking
techniques and scripting for system
security cyber crime damages are
expected to reach 6 trillion annually
making it a major challenge for
organizations and if we talk about some
of the breaches so in 2020 over 36
billion records were exposed due to data
breaches and the infamous Equifax breach
of 2017 where 147 million people's
information was compromised highlights
the importance of regular security
assessments and vulnerability management
these are the areas where hacker gbd
excels and hacker gbd strictly adheres
to ethical guidelines refusing to assist
with any unethical or illegal queries so
our commitment is to provide guidance
that adheres to legal and Professional
Standards helping you become a
responsible cyber security professional
so guys let's get started with hacker
gbt that equip you with the Knowledge
and Skills to defend against cyber
threats ethically and effectively so
guys this is Chad GPT and this is the
paid version of Chad GPT 40 and what I
was telling you is this is the explore
GPD section so here you can find all the
gpts that are created by Chad GPT open a
or the individuals or you can find the
companies who have created gpts so you
can found these are the recently used
and this is the most used hacker GPT you
can find other gpts also that is hacker
gbt and you could see that and they have
been used by 5,000 plus users and this
have been used by 10,000 plus users so
you can just search for ethical hacker
gbt here and it has been rated 4.5 Stars
10,000 Plus conversations and these are
the conversation status if you need any
assistance and the capabilities you can
see here and the ratings given by users
and more by the Creator who has created
this so we'll start with this we'll
start the chat here and I want to tell
you guys that Chad jity doesn't answer
non ethical questions so if you try to
extract that information from chat jpt
that won't be possible but but we can do
a bit like we can cross a bit line with
ethical hacker GPT but that should be
used for ethical purposes only so I will
show you guys how you can utilize this
GPT and one more thing guys if you want
to create your own GPT you can also
create that also you can go to explore
gbt section and here's the create option
click on Create and here you can start
creating your gbt if you click on
configure you can write the name of your
gbt description instruction s and the
conversation starters as you just saw
with the hacker gbt ethical hacker gbt
and the capabilities what do you want to
be enabled we could do that and here in
the create section you could write the
prompts here and it will take that
information and use it for more purposes
and here you could attach more files
that could help create your GPD okay
guys so here you could see the
configuration and the preview of your GP
and you can finalize that so moving back
we'll get back to ethical hacker gbt and
start with our conversation with him so
starting with the first thing we can do
is we can ask him like how can I perform
a basic security assessment on a web
application so if I tell you guys
performing a basic security assessment
on a web application is crucial for
identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring
the application is secure and this
process involves using various tools and
techniques to test the application for
common security issues so you could ask
him that how can I
perform a basic
security assessment on a web
application and just wait for a few
seconds and you could have the response
from ethical hacker GV so you could see
that performing a basic security
assessment on web application involves
several key steps and these are the key
steps number one is preparation and
information gathering and how you can do
that these are the steps identify the
scope gather information then is the
Second Step that is reconnaissance and
you can use the tools BB suit nto and
others similarly you could see all the
steps here so I won't be guiding or I
won't be reading what responses are
generated by ethical he gbt I have used
that and he provides very accurate like
I would say around 95 to 96% accurate
results here I want to show you guys how
you can utilize it so I will show you
prompts and what things you can ask him
so this was all about repeat so this was
about the general security thing now
we'll move to ethical hacking and we can
ask him how we can perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment so these are the prompts
that you can write that would be how do
I perform a SQL
injection attack and that to ethically
if you write this that would be good on
a test
environment and if I tell you guys so
SQL injection is one of the most common
web application vulnerabilities and
understanding how to perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment can help you identify and
mitigate this risk in your own
applications and you could see he has
responded and he has provided you the
steps that you can set up a control test
environment first thing then preparation
and you could use these tools then you
have the manual SQL injection testing so
these are the methods that you could use
that is or or 1 equal to one for the
database and automated SQL injection
testing so this is the command for that
and you could verify vulnerability
documentation reporting
so you could see that this GPD is
capable of answering the basic questions
as we have discussed the basics question
till now now we'll move to scripting and
automation so here you could see how he
respond to this so we'll ask him can you
provide a python script to scan open
ports on a
network so let's see what he
provides provide a python
script and that to to scan for
ports on a
network so scanning open ports on
network is a fundamental step in
identifying potential vulnerabilities
and a python script that can automate
this process making it easier to
regularly check for open ports and
secure them so this is the python script
you can use any ID and run on that and
you could see that he's explaining the
code also yeah you can ask him like can
you explain the code line by line and
this hacker gbt will do that for you and
how to run the script that also he has
provided you and similarly we can also
ask him that how we can write a bash
script to Monitor and log unauthorized
login attempts and if you want I can
also run this prompt how do I write uh
bash
script and that do to
Monitor and log unauthorized access
unauthorized login
attempts so we can monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and that
would be essential for maintaining the
security of your system so as you can
see he has written A bash script and
that can help you automate this process
and this will provide realtime alerts
and logs for further analysis and you
could see that he's provid wrting the
explanation and how you can run the
script and he's writing the note also
like you can write more prompts if you
have any doubts in any of the script or
any of the responses that hacker GPT has
responded and he will definitely provide
you with good responses so now moving on
now we'll ask this ethical hacker GPT
about some specific security tools and
we could ask him about BB suit and so
let's write a prompt can you
explain how to
configure and use bub
suit or we can write for web application
testing so if I sum you up so BB suit is
a powerful tool for web application
security testing and understanding how
to configure and use it effectively can
help you identify and address a wide
range of security vulnerabilities in
your applications so you could see he
has provided the initial steps that
would be downloading and installing BB
suit configuring your browser to use BB
suit as a proxy and then intercept and
inspect traffic and then you can use it
for testing purpose logging and
Reporting and tips for Effective testing
so this is the response for the security
tools and if we talk about incident resp
response we can ask him to write a
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so collecting system
logs is a critical part of incident
response and forensic analysis and this
script can automate processes that can
ensure that you have all the necessary
data to investigate security incidents
effectively so if I write here we can
ask this hacker gbt and I'm sure he will
provide the response for that and write
the script so
can you provide a
script to collect system
logs for forensic
analysis so as I told you this is the
critical part of incident response and
we have covered about the tools that is
BB suit we have asked him about the
automation process General cyber
security question ethical hacking that
would be SQL injection attack and the
python script tools can open ports on a
network so he can write scripts also
automation task and he could response
with the general cyber security
questions also and if you see here for
the incident response he has wred the
script to correct system logs for
forensic analysis so I won't be
explaining this code as we're just
looking for the prompts that we can give
to ethical HGB if you want you could
just ask him also that explain this code
line by line and here he has mentioned
also the explanation that is directories
and files to collect and after that he
is collecting the logs and that would be
copied in the directory that is he has
mentioned it a variable that is output
directory archiving logs cleanup and how
to run the script so this was about the
incident response Now we move to some
Advanced topics and in advanced topics
what we can ask him is he how to perform
a man in the- Middle attack in a control
environment and remember this that you
have to mention some of the keywords
that would be in a controll environment
and for that thing only he will response
or provide the response to you so I will
start here that how do I
perform a man in
the middle
attack in a control environment
so if you understand man in the middle
attack that works in a controlled
environment this can help you develop
better defenses against such attacks and
it's important to learn and practice
these techniques ethically so you can
see here that he's providing the
prerequisites and the stepbystep guide
how you can conduct a man in the middle
attack so first is set up the control
environment then install necessary tools
enable IP forwarding perform arp poofing
and then capture and analyze traffic
clean up and restore the network and
conclusion so you could just follow up
with more prompts that I want more
information about setting up the control
environment just write this prompt and
this ethical hacker GPT will provide
more responses to you so he will provide
you how you can set up the control
environment so now moving on we will ask
some more prompts and that would be
about the reverse engineering so we
could ask him that can you explain the
processes of reverse engineering a
malware sample or we can also ask about
honey port to detect malicious activity
that could be how can I Implement a
honey port to detect malicious activity
or what are the techniques for securing
a Docker container so we'll ask him when
prom here let's see what he responds to
that so how can I
Implement
a honey port to detect malicious
activity so you could see that he has
started responding to that and if I tell
you the sum so a hyport is a security
mechanism set to detect deflect or in
mechanism to some Manner and it
counteract attempts at unauthorized use
of Information Systems implementing a
honey Port can help you Monitor and
understand attack patterns and this is
the step-by-step guide to implement a
honey Port you can choose the type of
Honey Port prepare your environment
install and configure the honey Port
software and these are all the commands
how you can configure it then you can
monitor and analyze the Honeypot and
regular maintenance and updates and this
is the simple handport using hone you
could install that and run these
commands so with that guys and in the
last we'll also cover cyber security
policies and compliance so he could also
answer to those prompts also that you
can ask him that what should be included
in a company cyber security policy and
you could mention which type of company
you are running so I will ask him that
so you could ask him that what should be
included
in know at tech
companies cyber security
policy so let's
see so you could see here that creating
comprehensive security policy for an
atte company involves adding various
aspects and that would be introduction
first is the purpose for cyber security
policy scope roles and responsibilities
data protection and privacy Network
Security application security user
security awareness and training incident
response and management compliance and
legal requirements physical security
device and endpoint security so
similarly you could ask him that draft
me the company's cyber security policy
and start with the introduction so he
will provide you all the introduction
points and then you can ask him that
draft roles and responsibilities he will
draft that also so you could like break
it into parts and ask the ethical hacker
gbt and he will respond to you as it has
some limitations of some words and some
of the responses so you could ask him in
the breaking parts and he will respond
to you today we will see the starting
journey in cyber security that is super
exciting but can be a bit daunting so to
help you out we are going to talk about
some common mistakes that beginners
often make and how you can avoid them if
you're just getting started or looking
to improve your skills this guide will
set you on the right path so let's dive
in and make sure your cyber security
career gets off to a strong start so
let's get started and we'll see the
worst beginner cyber security mistakes
everyone makes and we'll start with the
number one point that is ignoring Basics
so many beginners rush into advanced
topics without mastering the basics
which can lead to confusion and
frustration later on it's essential to
build a strong Foundation before diving
into complex subjects if we talk about
number one is understanding networking
networking is the backbone of cyber
security learn how data travels across
networks different types of networks
like Lan and Van and basic networking
protocols knowing how Network protocol
functions help you understand how
attacks occur and how to defend against
them then comes mastering operating
systems so operating systems are another
critical area whether it's Windows Le
luux or Mac OS you need to know how
different OS work and learn about file
systems user management and basic
command line skills so this knowledge is
crucial for tasks like malual analysis
and system hardening then comes the
basic coding skills so coding is an
invaluable skill in cyber security you
can start with a simple language like
Python and learn how to write scripts to
automate task analyze data and
understand the logic behind software
vulnerabilities so basic coding skills
will help you to comprehend how attacks
are carried out and how to develop
counter measures so taking the time to
master these Basics will make advanced
topics much easier to understand and
will set a solid foundation for your
career in cyber security so remember
it's a journey and starting with the
basics will ensure you build strong
lasting knowledge now we'll come to
number second point that is skipping
handson practice so this is also one of
the cyber security mistakes that
beginners make cyber security isn't just
about Theory practical experience is
crucial and many beginners Focus too
much on reading and studying without
applying what they have learned this
creates a gap between knowledge and Real
World skills so the number one point
here is setting up a home lab so create
a home lab with an old computer or
virtual machine to practice what you
learn install different operating
systems set up networks and simulate
attacks in a controlled environment then
comes real world scenarios so use your
home lab to practice real world
scenarios like configuring fireballs and
detecting intrusions platforms like hack
the box and try hack me offer cyber
security challenges that mimic real life
networks and systems then comes building
confidence so Hands-On practice builds
confidence so solving real problems and
seeing the results of your actions make
you more comfortable with cyber security
tools and techniques and this confidence
is crucial when making quick informed
decision in this field so gaining
practical experience Bridges the gap
between theory and practice making you a
more effective and confident cyber
security professional so now we'll see
the third mistake that cyber security
beginners make that is lack of
documentation so documenting your work
is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect
of cyber security many beginners Focus
solely on learning new skills and
solving problems without keeping track
of their progress however good
documentation practices can
significantly enhance your learning
experience and by keeping detailed notes
on what you learn the tools you use and
the methods you apply you create a
valuable resource for future reference
and this habit helps you review and
reinforce your knowledge making it
easier to remember complex Concepts
additionally well documented work allows
you to share your insights and solutions
with others whether through blogs
presentations or team collaborations it
also helps in troubleshooting as you can
quickly revisit your steps to identify
where something might have gone wrong so
in the professional World documentation
is essential for maintaining clear and
efficient communication within a team
and by starting this practice early you
will develop a habit that will benefit
you throughout your career and now we'll
move to the fourth cyber security
mistake for beginners that is waiting
too long to start applying for jobs so a
common mistake many beginners make is
waiting until they feel perfectly
qualified before applying for cyber
security jobs this approach can be
counterproductive the truth is you might
never feel completely ready and waiting
too long can cause you to miss out on an
valuable opportunity so start applying
for jobs early in your Learning Journey
the process of applying and interviewing
is a learning experience in itself it
helps you understand what employers are
looking for and it can highlight areas
where you need to improve so early job
applications also provide you with real
world feedback and networking
opportunities remember many level
positions are designed for people who
are still learning and growing in this
field so employers often value
enthusiasm willingness to learn and
problem solving skills as much as they
do technical knowledge so by starting
early you can gain experience and build
confidence even if you are not yet
perfectly qualified and then comes the
next mistake that is trying to qualify
for all jobs so in the vast field of
cyber security trying to qualify for
every job out there is a common but
misguided approach cyber security
encompasses a wide range of specialities
from network security and ethical
hacking to incident response and
security analysis instead of spreading
yourself thin trying to learn everything
focus on a key few areas and become
proficient in them specializing in
special Fields make you more valuable to
potential employers it's better to be an
expert in one or two areas than to have
super faicial knowledge in many so by
focusing on specific skills you can
develop a better understanding and
expertise that sets you apart from
others so this focused approach also
makes it easier to stay updated with the
latest trends and advancements in your
choosen areas remember depth of
knowledge often outweighs breadth when
it comes to career advancement and job
satisfaction so this was all about
trying to qualify for all jobs now we'll
see the biggest mistake that is it
Foundation fallacy so many aspiring
service Security Professionals believe
they need a deep it background to start
their career
this is same as the number one point but
this is a misconception while having a
solid foundation in it can be beneficial
it's not a prerequisite for success in
cyber security what you need are the
specific skills and practical experience
focus on learning about networks
operating system and security tools
engag in Hands-On practice through labs
and simulations to build Real World
skills cyber security is a field where
practical knowledge and the ability to
apply Concepts matter more than
theoretical it knowledge and many
successful cyber Security Professionals
come from diverse backgrounds including
those with minimal it experience so they
succeed by continuing learning and
adapting to New Challenges so don't let
the lack of deep it Foundation hold you
back concentrate on gaining the skills
and experience that are directly
relevant to the cyber security roles you
are interested in now moving to number
seven that is not attending cyber
security events so attending cyber
security events is one of the best ways
to stay updated and connected in the FI
field these events including conferences
webinars and meetups offer a wealth of
information on the latest trends tools
and threats in cyber security they
provide a platform to learn from experts
gain insights into industry developments
and discover new technologies
additionally these events are excellent
networking opportunities meeting other
professionals that can lead to job
opportunities collaborations and
mentorship building a network within the
cyber security Community can provide
support and guidance throughout your
career and many events also offer
Hands-On workshops and training sessions
that can enhance your practical skills
so by actively participating in these
events you can demonstrate your
commitment to continuous learning and
professional development make it a habit
to attend cyber security events
regularly to stay engaged and informed
so this was all about number seventh
point that is not attending cyber
security events now mov to number eight
that is obsessing or which
specialization to choose so when
starting a career in cyber security many
beginners obsess over which
specialization to choose this can be
overwhelming and counterproductive
instead of stressing about making the
perfect choice allow yourself the
freedom to explore different areas of
cyber security the field is diverse with
specializations like penetration testing
incident Response Security analysis and
more take the time to experiment with
various topics and see what Intrust you
the most this exploration phase is
valuable for gaining a broad
understanding of this field so over time
you will naturally gravitate toward
areas that align with your strengths and
interest so remember your specialization
can evolve as you gain more experience
and insights early in your career focus
on building a solid foundation and
gaining exposure to different aspects of
cyber security this approach allows you
to make an informed decision about your
specialization when the time comes
ensuring you choose a path that truly
