without further delay let's get started
with building an interactive dashboard
in Excel so window here we have some
data set so we have uh row ID order ID
order date Shi date Etc so these are the
rows over here
let's quickly select the entire dat set
and remove any filters that we have so
the filters is gone and uh at the last
you can see country region product
category subcategory and extending
further we have sales data quantity
ordered discount and profit so now let's
proceed and try to build one single
dashboard okay now imagine yourself in a
situation where you're working for this
particular you know uh
store or a company which sells products
and you have a team meeting with
leadership and you are supposed to be
hunting for simplicities in complexities
and you need to present an interactive
dashboard which gives a visual
representation of what exactly is
happening with the company the sales the
quantity order profit Etc right and if
you show this particular data set as it
is in the form of named rows and columns
your leadership might not be able to
understand it or they might not be able
to justify what exactly needs to be done
in the future to keep the numberers same
or improve the sales right so in that
scenario an interactive dashboard could
be beneficial so in today's session
we're going to create the scene and
creating a chart that is an interactive
chart or a dashboard which is
interactive everything lies on one
single point that is the pivot tables
and pivot chart charts if you're good
with pivot tables and pivot charts you
can create interactive charts you can
create interactive dashboards and much
more so the process is simple but in
case if you need a quick overview of how
exactly a pivot table is created or
performed then you can check out the
link in the description box below which
will give you a complete detailed
description and to understand how to
create a pivot table and a pivot chart
in real time and move further right now
we will continue with this particular
topic for today which is creating a
dashboard now click anywhere in the cell
select the entire data set using contr a
and go to insert option over here and
choose pivot table right from the table
range should be the option here you can
see the table range has been selected
and uh you also have two more options
which will help you understand where
exactly to create your paper table so we
will be creating that in a new worksheet
so click on a new worksheet and press
okay there you go you have the puiv you
know table here and let's say we want a
few charts so here we have region wise
sales country wise sales and shipment
majorly used
subcategory uh category segment and
let's say we also want quantity wise
country and quantity
right or let's say Okay country and
quantity so how many number of orders
basically you receive from each country
right so let's say we want all these
charts now how many number of charts do
we have one 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 remember
creating a chart which is interactive
relies on pivot table now so far we have
created one pivot table or one pivot
chart or one p pivot sheet but we want
seven pivot charts how to do that it's
really simple just hold control and drag
that sheet and you have a new pivot
chart right you can do that few more
times seven so we have seven pivot
tables as we required there you go and
now let's get back to the first sheet
and let's see the first option we are
looking for so we want region wise sales
right we have a five different regions
north south east west and Central and we
want region ycs in a pictorial way for
that let's go to the options over here
we have the row uh names or the metadata
you can drag region into either columns
or rows wherever you want I'll Cho just
drag and drop it in the columns and now
go back to sales and you can drag sales
to rows values sorry sales and each
region right now you can go back to this
particular pivot table go to home
eliminate any and go to pivot table
analyze and here you can see pivot chart
click on that and now you have uh all
charts window on your uh desktop I mean
screen you can choose the one which you
uh feel is good right so I'll prefer a
bar chart column chart here click on
okay and there you go now you can edit
this particular data set and chart and
you can also remove any of the things
you don't want so for for example I
don't want Legends so I'll remove
Legends and uh this is what I have here
you can also edit from a few more things
right now I can simply copy this
particular chart and go to the dashboard
so let's create a new sheet and name it
as dashboard
mergin Center can add a
color now here you can paste the first
chart now you can rename
this chart title so you can rename this
as region
wise sales so therefore you have the
first chart we here you can also so
increase or decrease the size of the
chart by just dragging the corner points
and uh let's go to the second pivot
table we have the second pivot table
right here what was our second
request the second request was country
wise right now close this use the
country and drag it to columns or rows
let's go with rows this time and sales
so go to pivot table analyze pivot table
chart and here you can choose a py chart
since you're going with the country wise
and click
okay now you have
the by chart over here you can rename
that as country
wise you can copy
this and paste it onto the
dashboard in case you want to you know
uh keep the size of the pie chart and
the column chart in the same uh you know
width and height you can do that just go
to uh format here you can 5.6 and it can
be 9.9 and similarly you can go with
5.6 this can be
9.9 just so that you can accommodate a
few more chats in the uh dashboard you
can align them there you go right now
our next request is subcategory shipment
sorry so go to shipment so this is the
fifth uh sheet so we need to go to the
third spreadsheet where where is where
we have the pivot table so close the
format shape and we have shipment here
ship mode so select the ship mode drag
it to rows or columns sales to here and
we have uh or you can count it right you
can change it to count okay so you have
standard class with the highest number
of um you know sales happening so many
sales which are happening in your store
choose the standard class of shipment
right so very least people choose first
class where or same day shipment which
is highly expensive and standard ship
equ M will take minimum pricing and most
of the customers have chosen that now
you can choose the same data here go to
pivot table analyze and here we have
pivot charts and of this you can select
anyone let's say if you want to go with
the tree map or if you want to go with
the bar or anyone you can go with
that so let's go with the bar graph
press okay and here you're create
now rename this particular chart as ship
mode now you can copy the same chart and
press a paste it onto the
dashboard can close that if you go to
format you can do the same
setting 5.9 and
9.9 4.6 and 9.9 there you go you have
everything lined up and this this space
that we have over here we can add a few
more things which will come under
slicers and filters so we'll have to
wait for that until we can finish the
rest of the charts now we will go to the
fourth
sheet so what was the fourth request
let's check our list here so subcategory
wise sales now we can check the
categories subcategories over here yeah
we have the sub category select that and
track to rows or columns and sales to
values okay and there you go and if you
want to sort you can also sort by right
clicking and uh sort it to minimum
smallest lar largest to smallest there
you go so the highest number of sales
are happening through mobile phones next
comes the book cases next come copers
etc etc now select this and go to viiv
table Analyze This deliv chart and you
can choose any one of those we can go
bar chart or the column chart and you
can also rename this as subcategory
wise you can copy
it paste it on the dashboard and you can
also make few Arrangements if you want
you can resize
it 5.6 and this will be
9.9 the next request is the category
wise sales and
segment so we have the category here
drag it to rows and sales here you can
keep it the way it is or you can go to
Pivot analyze and here go to
charts choose the one you want and
proceed copy it and go to dashboard we
can paste it over
here there you
go country wise and segment
quantity so now you have country over
here like a country to rows and sales to
columns or you can yeah let's go with
sales since this is a sales dashboard
this should be beneficial now we have uh
we can also sort it again sort to
largest to smallest and we have from CH
with the highest number of sales I can
copy that or go to pivot table analyze
and here pivot chart you can go
with by
chart you can rename it as country
wise there you go and copy this paste it
on the
dashboard I think we already did a
country wise sales so I think we can
proceed with the next next type of uh
chart which is segment
wise let's go to the same sheet have we
created the country wise sales and close
the format delete the chart instead of
country we can select segment so which
segment has the highest number of
sales past it over here format to adjust
the size of the
chart there you
go so we have region wise sales
country-wise sales ship mode subcategory
wise category wise and segment wise
sales now we have a dashboard but to
make it a little more interactive we
might require a few filter like options
which are also called as slices so when
you add slices onto the sheet or the
dashboard what you can do was you can
select the options you want let's say I
want the region wise sales in Belgium
and you can identify that let's say you
want Australia's or Austria's shipment
modes what kind of shipment mode is most
used in Austria you can you can find out
it and let's say you want to find out
the Finland segment wise sales then you
can find out this is only possible when
you try to include a slicer into the
dashboard now let's go ahead with it now
if you select any of the charts let's
say I want to go with the first one now
go into insert and here you can see
filter options right so here you want to
insert slices now here you have a slices
right now okay so you can select the
slicer you want so I want the slicer for
region I want the slicer for Country I
want the slicer for ship mode which is
right here and I want subcategory wise
slicer I want country or category wise
slicer so category and segment wise
which is here so I want six slices there
you go I've got the six slices created
let's minimize to make it look a little
more better there you go and uh we will
paste the slice is right here you can
also you know modify the size of the
slices let's try to make them fit here
and uh the next one should be right
here there you
go now let's drag this
here the last Slicer in the last
section there you go now we have one
dashboard but is it interactive I guess
not so how to make it completely
interactive so you might have a doubt
let's say I want to click on machines
now only one out of the six charts is
you know uh reacting let's say I want to
click on papers it is giving me the data
for phones and Etc and if I click for
Belgium you can see only one chart is
being interactive right now what should
I do so that every chart which is on the
dashboard gets completely interactive
and shows all the data in real time that
can be done all you have to do is select
any of the uh slices right click and go
to the option which says report
connections so select all the pivot
tables pivot table which are present in
your uh chart right now sheet one sheet
two sheet three sheet four sheet Five
sheet six and Sheet 7 press okay now all
the charts are interconnected with each
other and now if you click on any one of
the options let's say I want the data
for Austria country and every data
changes
correct report connections you need to
do that with all the
slices press okay there you go now if
you select
Finland Denmark Austria you can see the
charts are changing right every chart is
now interactive so that's exactly how
you create an interactive dashboard now
you might be having a doubt okay it's
working for the existing data but what
if I add some new data so here we have
data until 2022 and this is the new data
until 202 3 now if I add this particular
data to the end of this particular data
set WR here and remove the row
heads and go back to dashboard go to PIV
chart yeah on data dashboard we need to
go to data and here click on refresh all
then you will get the updated data set
and now you have the updated results as
well and with that we have come to an
end of the session on sales dashboard in
Excel or realtime interactive dashboard
using Excel and if you have any queries
