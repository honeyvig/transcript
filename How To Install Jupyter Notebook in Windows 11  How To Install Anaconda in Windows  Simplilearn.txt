guys let's get started but before we
move on let's understand first what is
Jupiter notebook so guys as you can see
all over here that jupyter notebook is a
popular open- Source tool that basically
basally allows you to create and share
documents which contains codes equations
we can have visualizations also
basically it is used for data analysis
machine learning and scientific research
which makes it a very essential tools
for developers like data scientist and
researchers alike now before installing
jupyter notebook I request you that you
have python installed in your system so
the requirement should be python 3.6 or
greater so now let us officially
navigate to the Python's website so guys
as you can see all over here so on
python.org if I click on download python
so we're going to see that all over here
download python 3.125 so as I already
told you that the requirement of python
should be greater than 3.6 so just you
can click all over here and you can see
the download has
started so guys as you can see all over
here that we have installed the python
now let us open the file so you can see
the given software is going to installed
on this directory okay so just click all
over here so guys as you can see all
over here the python installation of
3.125 is in progress let's wait for some
time till it gets
installed so as you can see guys all
over here that we have successfully
installed our python now let us open our
terminal and let us check whether python
is correctly installed so we are going
to type python
slash
versin so as you can see all over here
we have successfully installed our
python so guys that was our prerequisite
now there are two ways to install
jupyter notebook the first one can be
pip okay pip is a package manager or
using Ananda distribution so let us see
with Pip first so guys pip is a package
manager which is used to install and
manage software packages libraries
written in Python so we can see all over
here that the python with version
greater than 3.6 have default pip
installed in them okay so we can use pip
command to install our jupyter notebook
so guys as you can see all over here we
have come to the official documentation
of jupiter. org and it is saying that
installing Jupiter lab with Pip command
so what you can do guys you can just
copy all over here you can go right all
over here and click on this now as you
can see all over here it started
downloading the Jupiter
lab so guys we are going to install our
Jupiter lab with the PIP command so this
is the official documentation of jitta
notebook okay and just all you have to
do is copy with this and type on your
terminal so as you can see all over here
it has started downloading the packages
which is required to download the
Jupiter notebook let us wait for some
time okay guys so we have successfully
completed this step now let us move on
to our next step so as you can see all
over here so we have installed okay then
what we have to do then you can type
this you can launch the jupit appb with
this command on the terminal now let us
wait so as you can see all over here
guys we have successfully installed our
Jupiter notebook so you can go all over
here and just create a new notebook and
you can also choose your kernel and you
can start working on your jupyter
notebook suppose I'll show you one
snippet so 3 + 5 let us try to run this
notebook so as you can see it is giving
us the eight as answer so it is
following the python syntax and in this
way we have successfully installed our
Jupiter notebook using the pep command
so now as you can also see all over here
you can also install Jupiter notebook
with this command typ install notebook
and then you can just open it this is
also an another alternative similarly
you can install with via also same
command and just open the Via now if you
are using any other operating system
like Mac OS or Linux then you you can
install by bre install jupit app so home
bre will be the package manager for macx
and Linux so I hope so you are pretty
clear with how to install Jupiter
notebook with the pep command now I have
downloaded anacondas from this official
website so as you can see all over here
this is the official website of anaconda
okay now just type your email and you
can just download it so similarly as you
can see after installing I'm going to
launch my installer and let us click
next okay let us click agree okay and
let us install this on the given
directory let us wait for some time till
the installation gets
complete so guys as you can see all over
here we have completed our installation
of Ananda so just click on finish and
you can see we have successfully
installed our anuka now let us open our
Anaconda Navigator so just click
on so as you can see all over here just
right click on this and our Ananda
Navigator will be opened so as you can
see all over here this is our Ananda
Navigator and it loading the packages
and for us to install the Jupiter
notebook so as you can see all over here
just click on launch so guys if you
click on launch it is going to open our
jupyter notebook so as you can see all
over here it is saying launching the
zupiter notebook and it is hosted on
Local Host 8889 so this is our hosted
Jupiter notebook and then similarly you
can create a new notebook all over here
and in this way you can start working so
guys that was all for today's video I
hope so you would have got a brief idea
regarding how to install Jupiter
notebook using pip command and also
through Ananda Navigator thank you guys
