hi everyone this is dr saiti team inbd
conquer so today's discussion is on
patient box
okay so wherein in your imbd exam we
have come across the clinical scenarios
or case based questions are being
presented in a form of a patient box
okay so in that in that box they give
the details of the patient they give the
background history they give the chief
complaint as well as the clinical
findings so at times they also post the
picture clinically or radiographically
which will help us to arrive at the
diagnosis okay so how these questions
are being asked is as i said it's in the
form of a case
that is presented in the form of a box
followed by the question and the options
and you have to go for the correct
answer so
today i'm going to discuss few important
cases from your oral medicine oral
pathology and wherever required the
radiograph is also included because at
times radiographic features actually
help us to arrive at the correct
diagnosis right so radiograph is also
required wherever the question has its
need okay so like that few questions i'm
going to discuss so that you'll have an
idea and also you'll have the practice
before arriving for your exam okay so
coming to the very first question so as
if here you can see here so it's a
patient that of a 14 year old female so
this girl is a 14 year old female so now
you have to be very
sure of each and every line that is
presented in this box okay so the chief
complaint here is that she has to
correct her crooked teeth okay so next
the background history it's quite
important because here the history says
that the family has uh the mom and dad
had a consequence marriage okay so
wherever
i mean it's not always but kansas
marriage cases might have a genetic
like
like genetic abnormality in the
offspring might have chances might be
there so that's the reason here the
background history definitely has its
importance and a very very important
which actually help us to arrive at the
diagnosis are the three points that are
being given here so these are the
clinical
findings or the key points which will
actually exactly arrive
as at the diagnosis right so here what
are those clinical findings that has
been given in the question is a
micrognathic left palate and the
glossopterosis so here if you see the
girl obviously you can appreciate the
micrognathia right so and in the
question it's clearly mentioned the
triad that is microgravity cleft palate
and glossoprosis so i think by now the
answer must have been clicked but let's
see the option so what is the syndrome
that you can diagnose in this patient is
the question so there are four options
that the stretcher collin p robin who is
juggle and parry romberg so we know in
um p d robin syndrome you see the
sequence you see this triad right so
happily you can go for the answer of
peri robin syndrome and you can
eliminate the others if you know the
findings of the other options also but
here it is a straightforward question
that's a period robin syndrome so what
exactly happens in a period orbiting
cinema is actually the sequence okay so
patient will be having in a hypoplastic
mandible because of which a secondary
enamel like the tongue will fall
backwards and gloss optics is occur and
the tongue will also obstruct the
palatal fusion and there will be a
u-shaped pallet and a cleft palate
occurs okay so these are the very
important sequence so that is
micrognathia glossoptosis and cleft
palate so this is a sequence or this is
important triad of a peri robin syndrome
okay so i hope you got an idea of how
the question can be asked in respect to
the important diseases or the important
syndromes from your
subjects in your exam okay so this is
the very first question now let's go to
the next question
so here again you have seen a data it's
a 53 year old female and the chief
complaint is she has a swelling of the
upper lip as you can see
that's since a very long time that's a
chief complaint and the patient has
developed swelling of the upper lip and
also there's a ruling of saliva in the
corner of the mouth so that is a history
now coming to the clinical findings
where we have to check further
key points okay so she's unable to smile
on the
same side there's absent of wrinkles on
the forehead and intraorally fissured
tongue is there as you can see so in the
background history also you have seen
that there is a drooling of saliva
from the right corner of the mouth and
in the clinical findings we have seen
that she is unable to smile on the same
side absence of wrinkles so all these
will help us to arrive at a
one of the component of a syndrome which
is nothing but the facial palsy right so
there is a paralysis of the facial knob
so this is that next fissure tank is
clearly given and there is a picture
showing the fissure tongue this is the
second component third component if you
see
the swelling
right so what exact swelling of the
upper lip so there are three components
now the swelling of the upper lip the
facial palsy and fissure tongue so we
know we out of this we have got the
three important key points right now
let's see the options so what is the
condition so peri romberg methods and
ross of the killer analyst and ramsay
hunter the options given so where do you
see these three components that is
fissure tongue the facial palsy and the
upper lip swelling which is nothing but
key light is granulomatosa so where do
you see that
so if you
go through a developmental disturbances
chapter from your oral pathology in your
schaefer these three components are seen
in our mechancel rosenthal syndrome okay
so you see fish your tongue
you see facial palsy so here the patient
had that all the features of the facial
palsy like absence of wrinkles unable to
smile ruling of saliva so these are like
arriving us for the
facial palsy obviously fissure tongue is
also the clinical picture of the fissure
tongue is also posted next the swelling
of the upper lip which is nothing but
key light is granulomatosa so these
three are the components of the
mechancyl or simple syndrome that's all
okay so we know that disease we know the
components but how it is being presented
in the exam and how we need to get
exposed is the main thing that we have
to do now that's all okay so next coming
to the next question so here is a 65
year old man who is living in so and so
plays in south east of iran okay and the
chief complaint is he has fever cough
chill shortness of breath so these are
like respiratory symptoms as you can see
and then the background history like
has history of keeping animals okay so
that is why they have given industry
maybe it has some importance and also
like sheep and goats but animals were
not infected and has a long issue of
copd also and the symptoms didn't
like improve despite of antibiotics and
the patient was referred to the hospital
okay and here is a radiograph that is
there okay now we'll see the current
findings of the clinical findings so
here the chest x-ray has shown a
mediastinal widening it's clearly shown
plural effusions are there parenchymal
infiltrations and lymphadenopathy is
there
and
the blood samples has revealed gram
positive strepto basilic the bamboo
stick appearance so that appearance
might have an importance again so that's
a key point again and the black culture
has shown a creamy grow
coarse grayish texture with irregular
border lines with hemolysis looking like
a jellyfish so all these now if you see
so how to think those now after seeing
this question one thing is clear that
this is an infectious disease for sure
okay because there are fever and there
is lymphadenopathy and all those
pulmonary symptoms are there so it's
infectious that is understood right next
in the background he is having a history
of animals and all that okay
and in the current findings that is the
chest x-ray if you see or the chest
radiograph what what you have observed
is a mediastinal widening which is a
very important key point
okay
and then a culture is taken and there's
a bamboo stick appearance so this is a
combination of oral path as well as a
microbiology
okay so this bamboo stick appearance you
see in a
bacteria okay already it is given the
gram positive streptobacillus so already
it is very clear that it's a bacterial
infection again okay so now let's go for
the options and let's arrive at the
answer
okay so identify the disease so it is
wool sort of pulmonary anthrax tetanus
is the options that is given and fourth
option is both a and b
so now it can't be tetanus because in
tetanus we definitely see that you know
rigidity the log jaw rigid muscles and
all that right so this can't be tetanus
so other option could be
since it's a gram positive bacilli
showing it
you know the bamboo stick appearance
it's nothing but a bacillus anthracis
caused disease
which is our anthrax so it is a
pulmonary anthrax so there's a
mediastinal widening is a very very
important radiographic feature it's gene
seen in the chest radiograph of whoever
is suffering from pulmonary anthrax okay
so it is caused by this bacteria that is
bachelor's and crisis and in a
microbiological view it is showing the
bamboo stick appearance so all these are
the key points to arrive at the
pulmonary anthrax option
but there is one more thing that is
being given that is a wool sorter's
disease right so wool sorter is other
name for pulmonary anthrax okay so wool
sorted this is other name for pulmonary
anthrax so here both a and b are your
answers okay yes
now coming to the next
a 25 year old female has come for the
regular dental checkup there is no
particular history over there but as you
can see there is a serpentis pattern in
the observed on the tongue now what is
that
simple it is showing a serpentis pattern
of decapitated tongue so it's a case of
a geographic tongue that solves a case
of geographic tongue which is also
called as benign migratory glossitis or
erythema migraines so answer here it is
both a and b so for the previous
question also the wool shortest disease
which is other name for pulmonary
anthrax so even there it is both a and b
and even here also it is geographic
tongue because you have seen the
serpentis borders on the tongue and
erythema migrants so both the and b is
answer simple this is a very simple
question right
next
here a patient has like it's a 20 year
old female regular dental checkup and
hyperplasia of the cingulum of the
anterior teeth is seen
so it's a developmental anomaly of the
tooth simple question i think you can
guess this it's just a
cingulum that is hyperplastic and you
can see that cone shape so what is that
so identify whether it's talents cause
when and why publisher attorneys are
options among the options it's a
straightforward question it's a
beautiful
picture is also posted so it is
hyperplasia scene on the cingulum of the
teeth so it's nothing but the talents
cusp so now my question is neymar
syndrome which is related to the talents
cusp so from your shaffer if you see the
syndrome which is associated or where
you see the talents cusp is a rhubarb
steam taste syndrome okay it's a
rubestine taste syndrome okay good so
yes let's go with the next question here
so here it is a male of a 10 year old
okay and he has cavities in the mouth
and reddish rashes on the hands and feet
that's his chief complaint
and he was born to a mother who has poor
prenatal care and belong to a less
socioeconomic group
okay and then the clinical findings so
what are the clinical findings so is it
refused arithmatus palmer plantar
keratoderma along with these commission
fissures and intraorally we have seen
dwarfed molars as you can see in the
picture and also their screwdriver
shaped incisors all these can be nicely
appreciated in the picture that is given
right
so very nice question to be honest
because you have seen a direct
uh the important or characteristic
feature of a disease where you see the
mulberry molars and the screwdrivers
shaped in sizes these are nothing but
hatchings teeth okay so there is a trial
which is called as in hutchins triad
where you see the screwdriver shape
incisors mulberry molars interstitial
keratitis and eighth nerve deafness
right so all these are the features or
the triad that our chinchin striat is
seen with
very good it's congenital syphilis right
so it's nothing but a case of congenital
syphilis so as you can also see a rash
besides that the intraoral findings are
these so obviously the question is
helping us to think of congenital
syphilis but yes before going for the
other thing we have to definitely read
all the options and what is exactly the
question being asked we have to think
right so what is the question now so
what are the other findings that can be
expected in this child
so here they are not asking us to
diagnose they are asking what are the
other findings that can be seen in this
disease or in this condition
so obviously we have arrived at a
diagnosis that it could be like it is
definitely because there's attention's
teeth there so it is in hatching since
triad is i mean it is component of
fascination's triad that is screwdriver
shape and sizes and mulberry moles so
obviously we know that it is a case of
congenital syphilis right so it is a
very clear-cut case of congenital
syphilis now what are the other findings
that will
be expected in this child so a scapula
in the vertebral border below the level
of the spine is having concavity instead
of convexity
yes this can be expected because this is
nothing but scaphoid scapulae
scaphoid scapula so this is a finding
that is seen in congenital syphilis gets
or children affected with congenital
syphilis so this is a scaffold scapula
next anterior bowing of the mid portion
of the tibia
yes this is nothing but
shaver
shin
okay this is nothing but shape or shin
even this you can expect in this
chill child okay next thickening of
sternoclavicular portion of the clavicle
yes this is
he go
saddle knows okay regades of flip all
these are the very very important
features of congenital syphilis besides
that hutchington's triad these are the
very important features of congenital
syphilis obviously our answer is any of
the above
right so this is how the questions can
be put forward either they'll ask you to
arrive at a diagnosis or they will ask
you to find give you give other findings
or they'll ask you to give an
investigation
the question can be asked here this way
or that way the only thing is you need
to get exposed to those type of
questions and you need practice that's
all okay so next the other question now
here is a 30 year old female pregnant
patient so she was having fever dry
irritating cough and growth on the
tongue this is a growth on the tongue as
you can observe
and the patient was having a bacterial
pneumonia few weeks back so this is also
an important point
now coming to the clinical findings so
there is a nodular ulcer with
undermining edges so this is our key
point always focus on the key points
given so there is an ulcer with
undermining edges so that is a key point
and a dorsum of the tongue and cancer
sauce and intra release was there and
cardo pulmonary examination has shown
these with scattered crackles as you can
see here and there
especially in the upper two thirds of
the tongue and a radiograph has shown
radio opacities throughout the lung
fields in the upper two thirds of the
tongue
and there was a granulomatous
inflammatory process so this is a
granulomatous infection obviously
undermining edges involvement of the
lungs this is nothing but a case of
just think before that will arrive at
the answers or i mean the options so
what is the diagnosis now so there's
squamous cell carcinoma no it will have
inverted edges so no canker it will be
painless
and it is seen in syphilis and lung
involvement may not be much tuberculosis
also with pulmonary involvement
yes yes the pulmonary involvement is
there you have seen radio opacity is a
gone focus that you see in the
tuberculosis besides that the very
important key point in properly is the
undermining edges of the ulcer so these
two are
the thing and granulomatous obviously so
all these are the key points which are
helping us to give a provisional
diagnosis of tuberculosis also with
a pulmonary involvement why is it not
final diagnosis because before doing i
mean you have to go for the acid fast
bacilla you have to do a montox test to
go for the final diagnosis this is just
a provisional diagnosis based on the key
points of the clinical or the current
findings and the history that is given
by this patient in the box that i have
presented okay so geotrichos is no
because it will be like a patch so
obviously the straightforward answer for
the options given in this particular
question where you can think of a
provisional diagnosis of tuberculosis
ulcer obviously there's a pulmonary
involvement there is fever there is all
these creatures that is there is helping
us to arrive at the answer there is a
bacterial pneumonia
right so it's a straightforward answer
that is tuberculosis ulcer with
pulmonary involved good
next question now so is a 11 year old
girl she wants a correct alignment of
her teeth considers marriage of the
parents so whenever there is consequence
marriage you can think of some genetic
abnormality in that offspring next what
are the clinical findings so there's a
mandible of facial disorders
white face hypoplastic maxilla
hypertelorism bulging of eyes as you can
see prognathism of the mandible as you
can see and the radiograph here it is
showing something which is very
important
okay so there is a radiographic picture
obviously the syndrome that we know
all the syndromic features are there
right
the radiograph is showing some very good
characteristic feature here so what is
that now
so it is nothing but a copper beaten
skull
or a hammer beaten or a metal beaten
skull
okay so
this is a syndrome
where you see the copper beaten skull is
the
let's see the options now
it's not upper syndrome because in a
person the most very important feature
is the socket feet and the mitten hands
that is synthetic tightly obviously the
other features could be there but that
is not presented here so it is not that
p robin as we have already discussed
that it will be have micrognathia
glossoptosis and cleft palate so it is
not that
retrocalling syndrome the patients will
have hyperplasia of the malar bones it
is not that the copper beaten skull
along with the characteristic features
that is given here it is nothing but a
krausen syndrome
so the copper beaten skull the
radiographic feature the radiographic
picture that is given
it is a straightforward case of crows
and syndrome no need to think of other
options also the copper beaten skull
hammer bitten skull netting beaten skull
is clearly seen in this syndrome that is
krausen syndrome
okay so that here in this particular
question though the clinical findings
history everything
is important but the most important
thing is our radiographic picture that
is posted okay so this is a case of
krausen symbol
next question i mean the main thing of
the crowson syndrome so here it is
characterized by primarily closure of
the fibrous joints
and the cranial sutures between the
certain portions of the bone so there is
craniosynostosis and distinctive facial
abnormalities is also there so that is
the primary characteristic of the
krausen syndrome
okay so next question now so here it is
a three-year-old girl
regular pediatric checkup second
segments marriage so genetic abnormality
so there's a depressed nasal bridge so
the nasal bridge is gone hypothesis of
eye hypertelorism maxillary hyperplasia
mitten hands and socket feet just just
now i have told the options in the
previous question okay so this is our
key point obviously the depress nasal
which is also a key point
so now what's the condition here so
let's eliminate browsing syndrome no
because the nasal bridge will not be
that depressed it will have a good nasal
bridge only and obviously syndactyly
won't be there hypertelorism all the
other features could be there okay so
it's not that cherubism it will be like
chubby cheeks so it's not that make
utilitarian you have the kefla spots and
all that and you know precocious puberty
so it's not that so obviously it is
upper syndrome so in upper syndrome you
see that syndactyly okay so where you
see the midterm hands and the socket
feet so it's a very very very important
feature of the kids or the children
suffering with upper syndrome okay so
what does that similarity with the
krausen's is so brachiocephaly
hypoplastic mid phase hypertalorism
proptosis all this could be there
and common radiographic is impacted
teeth delayed eruption and ectopic
you know
eruption supernumerity calcification of
styloid process could be there and
distinguishing from krausen is
neurological deficits syndactyly as you
can see here the fusion and also the
fusion of cervical vertebrae so all
these are the differentiating features
so here in this particular baby since we
have seen the midterm hands and socket
feed so that is a very important key
point for us to arrive at the epper
syndrome similarly the previous question
the very important feature was the
radiographic feature of a copper bit and
skull which is arriving at the krausen
syndrome okay so just know the
differences between the crows and versus
epper syndrome okay so now here you can
see an 18 year old male what is the
chief complaint so it's a complaining of
discolored teeth since his childhood the
background history that he shares that
is was like bluish discoloration of the
milk teeth okay and he underwent
crowding of the upper scissors two years
back and what are the clinical features
so there's a bluish amber colored teeth
with a translucent hue
okay
very important finding blueish hue
translucent hue so that is a key point
and opg revealed obliterated pulp
chambers as you can see so here you can
see that translucent hue in the teeth
and you can also see that pulp chamber
obliteration
okay so what it could be let's see for
the question now
so this is our patient box what are the
key points blue is through
bluish amber color translucent hue and
obliterated pipe chambers
so which type of collagen is affected in
this disease so now first where do you
see the bluish hue
on the teeth and the pipe chambers is
obliterated so which disease that you
can think of
okay so this is a case of obviously the
dentinogenesis imperfecta so
if associated with osteogenesis you can
also see the
blue issue in this clearer okay and in
osteogenesis imperfecta you can see that
fragile bones and all that why because
there is a defect in type 1 collagen so
this type 1 collagen is present in the
sclera is present in the dentin is
present in the bone so obviously if
osteogenesis imperfecta along with
antinogenesis or just a dentogen
densities imperfecta can occur obviously
the defect is seen with the type 1
collagen so wherever the typhoon
collagen is affected obviously the
patient will show the respective
clinical features so here the patient
show bluish
that translucent shoe of the teeth and
if the same patient also had bone
fragility and you know brittle bones and
the bluish hue of this clearer so you
can also think of osteogenesis
imperfecta so in that disease the
type one collagen is affected okay so
this is nothing but a case of
ostrogenesis or a dentinogenesis
imperfecta where the type one collagen
is affected okay
yes
now coming to the next question so here
a seven year old female crowded upper
front teeth so ophthalmic problems are
there and we pattern uh is there
travis misses their high myopia is their
cardiac problems are also they're like
mitral valve prolapse iotic aneurysm so
underlying that and patient has genetic
tests and there's a mutation of
fibrillin type one
okay so very very important key point
within the history only we got it okay
and next clinical finding so there are
elongated arms legs
fingers dolichocephalic head broad
forehead and a maxillary retinopathy
hypermobility of the joint so here
elongated arms and legs and fibrillin
type one genetic disorder and iotic
aneurysm
so what can you think of now go for the
options so what is the clinical finding
based on the history and the clinical
findings that is given what is the
diagnosis that you can think of
so first mcq and albert syndrome no you
see a catholic pigmentation and all that
so it's not that rubinstein taking no
anyways it's not that ls dawn of course
here you have seen little hypermobility
of joint but here in ls knowledge you
see hypermobility of the skin everything
the other features of elongated hands
and feet and mitral valve prolapse the
iot can neuralisms and definitely the
gene mutation of fibulin type one
so that is a very important key point of
our marfan syndrome
okay so there's clear-cut mutation that
has been presented it's an autosomal
dominant disorder where you see the type
one fibrillin that is got mutated okay
so it is a case of marfan syndrome so in
marfan syndrome obviously you have eye
problems you have heart problems okay so
abnormal chest heart related problems
okay and tall thin body frame and
obviously the long arms and long feet
and long fingers all that are the
features of the marfan syndrome so this
is a clear cut case of a martin syndrome
okay good
now here next case is 11 year old female
missing teeth and swollen gums and
there's premature birth delayed
milestones iq certified triosome 21
irregular sequence is there triosami 21.
so background history very important key
point
triosemi 21 and in clinical findings
brachycephaly
uh slanting uh
trees and horse voice so of course there
are many other features but very
straightforward feature or the thing
that we can completely focus is nothing
but our triosami 21. so what is that
trio 21 what syndrome is rhizome 21
simple down syndrome no need to think of
other options and eliminate also
triosome 21 is down syndrome that's all
okay so here this is a simple case of
down syndrome clear so in down syndrome
you see that all the other features that
were presented okay so palma crease all
that very important brush field spots in
the eyes so these are the very important
key points but yes rhizome 21 is nothing
but a genetic thing that you see with
the down syndrome okay good
now going to the other question this is
a 16 year old female fluid secretion in
the lower lipit is there history of
cleft clip and cleft wallet when he was
a toddler so what are the clinical
findings mid phase retention is a lower
lip bilateral lipids are there so if you
see the picture lipids are there
and the conjunctivally missing teeth are
there marker hypoplasia
and label abrasion are there so lip
so lipids is a very important key point
here so what is the syndrome that you
can think of so what is the syndrome
associated with the lipids
vanderwood syndrome
okay so the syndrome which is associated
with the lipids the pits that is seen in
the lower lip especially is nothing but
a vanderwood syndrome that's all okay so
i think it is now you are getting more
adapted and you are able to think now
right so next is a 16 year old boy he
says discoloration of the teeth and
family reveals that there's presentation
of the teeth which are discolored
i mean other
means in the family also there were some
other people who had the similar
discoloration so here you have seen
yellowish discoloration and radiograph
so now the radiograph is showing a very
important key point
that is picket fence appearance so this
line that is picked friend's appearance
is from your white and pharaoh it is not
from your oral path so this picket
friend's appearance
is seen from your white and pharaoh so
now what can you think of so now let's
go for the question so pick it friends
appearance yellow is discoloration of
the teeth other two important and also
the family history are the important key
points for us to think of now now let's
see for the options so based on the
clinical and radiographic findings what
will you think of dentinogenesis
imperfecta no there will be obliteration
of the pulp chambers they will not we
have never heard of this pickered
friend's appearance dentin dysplasia
rootless teeth no so the other two
so it's hypo maturation and hypoplastic
type of amylogenesis imperfecta so it is
a case of amylogenesis imperfecta
yellows discoloration you see so what
among these two what it could be
so in hyper maturation type you see snow
cappity
okay
so you see snow capped teeth in hypo
maturation type radiographically here
this is a case of hypoplastic type
because the anomalous laws or enamel is
not there or it's very thin because of
which there will be loss of contacts
between the teeth and especially if the
anterior teeth if you see a radiograph
you get that picket fence appearance
okay so radiographic finding
is a very important thing for us to
think of the diagnosis so here you have
seen that there is no contact so there
is less enamel so this is a hypoplastic
type of amylogenesis imperfecta if snow
capper teeth is there then you can go
for hypo maturation type okay so this is
from your radiology point of view good
now coming to the next question so here
is a 34 year female the pain and
swelling in the floor of the mouth in
the right side
so here the swelling is hard tender and
more evident on eating and
they this decrease has salivation okay
so there is a decrease in the salivation
also so there's a swelling here
okay
and the swelling is heart tender so it
is something related to salivary glands
that we can think of
okay so what is a probable diagnosis so
here it is just a swelling and on eating
it is different so it is simple case of
silo lithius
okay so it's a simple case of silo
lithius at times you can clearly
appreciate the stone in the picture also
okay so this is a case of cello lithius
now coming to the next question here is
a 45 year old male chief complaint of
difficulty in opening the mouth so this
is a like client with why why there is a
difficulty
and he has smoking and alcohol habit
diff clinical findings is diffuse white
lesions as you can see in the buccal
mucosa little borders of the tongue and
the label mucosa and decrease ballooning
of the cheek so the patient is not able
able to balloon so there is some
fibrosis there obviously is having some
habits difficulty in opening so there is
something that has occurred or some
condition which can decrease that uh
decrease i mean this is not able to blow
and decrease mouth opening is there so
these are the key points that you have
to put in your mind now think of the
answers smokers melanosis
melanosis means it will cause the dark
pigmentation but such type of complete
rigidity and ballooning absency or the
rigidity and opening will not be there
on the lateral border of the tongue so
obviously because of fibrosis oral
mucosal fibrosis is the case it is
blanching of the oral mucosa there's
whiteness there's blanching and the
patient is not able to open the mouth
not able to blow and if the further
features like shrunken uvula rigid
tongue all these are nothing but the
case of
oral submucosal fibrosis that's all okay
so this is a case of of course a patient
in the history personal history good cut
showing or that arikana chewing is not
given but still you can definitely think
of this because of the
nice
creatures that has been presented the
blanching of the oral mucosa and the
clinical findings among the options
given definitely you can go for oral
submucosal fibrosis okay yes
now next question
severe is 11 year old male kid is a kid
and severe pain in the throat and fever
since five days so you can see a
clinical picture some something and he
didn't take any antibiotics and there's
mild swelling of the neck that's an
important point and there's a thick
adherence pseudomembrane
okay so thick catherine membrane fever a
kid and swelling of the neck so these
are the four key points here
so what is the condition
so tetanus it will have a lock jaw no
hepangina is a vascular pullers it's
viral it will have vesicles in the
posterior turn not a membrane it will
have small vesicles or ulcers in the
posterior part of the palate which will
not show an adherent membrane no herplex
simply is definitely no so obviously it
is a case of diphtheria so it is caused
by corny bacterium diphtheria
okay what are the important features
bull's neck
thick
adherent
pseudo membrane okay thick adherent
pseudo pseudomembrane so all there is a
thick adherent
so it's very painful the membrane can't
be removed it's very painful
okay so corny bacterium diphtheria and
pseudomembrane the bull's neck are very
important features of corny bacterium
diphtheria so here the answer is
diphtheria okay yeah
next a 21 year old male multiple missing
teeth what are the clinical findings
that is given multiple missing teeth are
there scalp hair is less sparse eyebrows
as you can see in prairie oral
pigmentation so now think of the
question and the options so what are the
findings
missing teeth hair is sparse so
hypotrichosis hypodermicia two important
points and periodical pigmentation also
but these two are the key points
hypertrichosis hypodontia conical shaped
teeth so not in romberg not in peri
robin p robin is a triad we know so it
is simple case of ectodermal dysplasia
hypertrichosis hypodensia okay and also
note
dry skin all that are the very important
findings of ectodermal dysplasia so here
you can see question says that is scalp
hair is less eyebrows are less you know
and obviously the cone shaped central
incisors are missing teeth hypodensia
all these are nothing but ectodermal
dysplasia that's all so this is a simple
case of ectodermal displacion
next
question so we are at almost to the last
so this is 11 year old girl swelling in
the right side of the face and she has
said that there's a scratch by the cat
okay so it's you can think now so
swelling is there here as you can see
and also right eyelid also there is
swelling so the catch must have
scratched like this so it's a simple
case of what now
first think of that so there is a
swelling of the glands and the ocular
region so it is a case of a cat scratch
disease that's all okay so it is also
called as oculoglandus syndrome of
paranoid and obviously it is caused by
bonding henselae so it is both bians
it's a bacterial disease caused by
botanila henselae and ocular glandular
so if the scratches is you can see the
swelling of the eyelid and the glands so
ocular glandular syndrome of the
paranoid okay so this is our
case
okay so like this you have to think and
answer so you have to go for nice
detailing what all is given in the
patient box you have to see for the
clinical and the radiographic picture or
what all findings is given and then you
have to go for the question and you have
to answer if there is a straightforward
thing you can directly arrive at the
answer if there is a confusion you can
eliminate and go okay so this is how you
have to get adapted to the patient box
for your imbde okay thank you
