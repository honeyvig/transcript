this field then make sure to check out
the link in the pin comment and
description box below to find the data
analytics program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest now
without further delay let's get started
now powerbi can import data in three
different modes the first one is import
mode where you can just directly connect
to the source and import the data in
batch mode and another mode is the
direct query mode where the data the
real time data is already connected to
the powerbi dashboard and by just
refreshing the powerbi or the data
source you can get the real time
insights on the data and the third one
is the mix and match of both import and
directquery mode you can also call it as
a dual mode or also as a composite mode
so if you want to know a little bit more
detail in these three modes you can just
let us know in the comment section below
and we will have a complete tutorial
covered for that right now we will get
started with the types of data importing
using PBI so you can import data in
different ways it may be from files it
may be from an Excel document it may be
from a website it may be from SQL or any
other database or it can also maybe from
cloud Etc right so we will be dealing
with all of those here and uh let's get
started so here we are on my PBI window
now they can be instances
where you might have to load data from
one or more sources and you might have
to club that data together now let's say
I have um continuous data from four to
five different years and we have a
separate workbook or Excel workbook for
different years right and in that
situation let's say you have a
requirement where you have to completely
segregate all those four five years of
data into one single file and import all
that into your pobi and create your
insights based on year on-ear
performance or month-on-month
performance right so in a few situations
you might have your data in an Excel
source and another set of data in maybe
your database maybe in a website or
maybe in a different Source correct so
in those situations you might have to
collect all your data dump it into
powerbi and use data transfer
and data modeling in powerbi and create
one clean data set for you to perform
your analysis and extract some valuable
insights so that's a different tutorial
for a different day but to help you with
the fundamentals of data transformation
and data modeling we already have in
detail data transformation and data
modeling tutorials in powerbi but if you
want that all to be segregated into one
single tutorial you can let us know in
the comment section below and we will
have that done as well now let's proceed
with our data loading into powerbi the
first type we will go with importing
data from file right so you can just go
to the get data option over here and you
already have a lot of varieties but in
case if you are not getting the one
you're looking for you can just click on
more and you will have a set of options
readily available on your screen like
this one now here you can see some more
options so here I have a file option
over here you can just click on file or
a folder over here and now it will
directly navigate you to the file system
of your computer just double click on
that and here you will have the browse
option just click on browse and remember
where you have your file so I have it in
my downloads and here I have Excel and
just press okay and now your data has
been successfully loaded onto your PBI
window now here you can you can just
click on load to load data or in case
you find it so here we have four
different years just as we discussed in
the beginning the data of sales from the
last four years 2020 2021 2022 and 2023
so in such situations you can just click
on transform data and transform your
data and model your data into one single
Excel workbook and start your analysis
so if you just click on load you can
directly load the data onto your powerbi
window and this is one way of doing it
and uh see your data yes there you go
the data has got successfully loaded can
just directly select the data that you
want that you are working with and you
can have it here and now let's proceed
with the second way of loading data so
I'll lo you know I name this file as I
need this workbook as file load data
from
file right and now let's create a new
page or new uh workbook where we will
load data from an Excel
file right so here you can just click on
Excel workbook option directly over here
or you can also go with the same get
data option we'll go with Excel workbook
you can see it has directly redirect me
to the place where I have my Excel files
so you can just click on Excel data that
we working on and press open and shortly
you can see the Excel files getting
loaded over here and now you can have
the option of choosing what table you
want to load right there are
possibilities where one Excel workbook
might have multiple sheets but for now
our Excel data has only one sheet which
is named as data you can just click on
it and have a brilliant preview of your
data can check for any of the errors let
me remind you if in case if you have
some data cleaning to be done on your
data powerbi will automatically open
power query window for you where you can
run all your data cleaning operations
and each and every step you are
investing or you are making while
creating the data cleaning process or
while you're going through the data
cleaning process
and you can manual you can eliminate the
manual task and you can save all the
steps and you can automate your data
cleaning process and powerbi will
automate that process and clean every
single cell of your data set and your
data will be ready for extracting
insights now this is another way of you
know importing or loading data into a
powerbi window from Excel files you can
just directly load or in case if you
want to transform you can just click on
transform data and the powerbi window
will get redirected to a power query
window where you can you know clean your
data and load it so this is the second
way of doing or loading your data is a
problem you can just view and clear
those errors manually that's one way of
doing it and I'll just close it for now
and let's focus on loading data from a
different source so now we have so far
loaded data from a file loaded data from
an Excel file now another way is load
data
from a
website so before we move ahead let's
have a look on the website that we are
selecting for
today so uh we are selecting the world
population website you can see this
particular website is running real time
so it's giving us the calculations in
real time right so you can also load the
realtime streaming data onto powerbi so
all you have to do is just just select
the or you to copy the URL over here
this is present right here and uh just
go back to powerbi window and here you
have the options so take the option of
web and now it will ask for the URL you
can just you paste the URL and just you
select the basic or if you have some
advanced settings you can also have the
advanced parameters mentioned for PBI so
I'll go with the basic ones here and if
you in case if you want to also explore
the advanced settings please do let us
know so that we can create an exclusive
tutorial for loading data from website
using advanced settings so it's a longer
tutorial so you do let us know so that
we can create an exclusive tutorial for
that now just press okay and your data
should be loaded just Connect Now a
preview of the data will be loaded onto
your screen you can just select the
table that you want right so we have
multiple if we just go back to the
website so you have multiple tables here
so the first table it will recognize
this particular part of data as a table
and apart from that here it has top 20
largest countries by population like as
a table and uh any other tabular data
present on the website see this one it
will also be considered as the table so
you can select any one of the tables you
want and load that data onto cover Pi
now let's select anyone I think you
might have a preview here it's still
loading so there you go so we have
multiple tables here so you can just
select the table and have a preview and
see if that's the table that you wanted
to import and if you find the table that
you're looking for you can just click on
the load or transform data in case if
you want to do any data cleaning you can
just click the option of data transform
and do that and if you are happy with
the data that you have on your preview
then you can just select the option of
load the data so I think this is the
table I'm looking for you can just click
on load data and that will be directly
loaded onto your P platform and it will
be ready for your analysis and
extraction of insights might take a
little while but that's okay there was
some error it was not found let's
discard and try to get that once
again now we have the preview of the
data now let's directly load it there
you go there we have our table number 12
directly loaded so here you can see
correct this is how you can load data
from a website and now let's explore
another one where we can load data from
either a cloud or a database correct now
here we t
load
data from
database so there are multiple databases
available you can load data from a SQL
Server you can load data from a MySQL
workbench you can load data from PHP my
admin which is propos SQL you can load
the data from Microsoft SQL server and
data was and also from the cloud sources
all you have to do is just add the
server ID and any credentials like the
username password Etc and the data will
be loaded now let's try to load data
from a MySQL workbench or mySQL database
so you can just click on more and here
you can
type my
SQL database there you go and just
connect if you are connecting uh you
know now uh for the first time it will
ask for the server ID and dpas so we
will go with the Local Host over here so
the address for Local Host is
127.0 do0 do okay let's quickly check
our port number from the my secret
workbench so my port number is
3308 and 3306 let's work with
3308 1
3308 don't forget the double colon over
here this one it's very important and uh
if we just dive deep into this
particular database we have different
databases SLP system well if you just
click on SLP we have so many tables so
let's go with SLP I type on SLP and
press on okay so it might also add ask
for uh user ID and password so my user
ID and password are root and uh just PBI
at the rate 1 to3 so everyone could have
their own passwords correct so you might
have a username dedicated username and
dedicated uh password just use that so
I've already logged in here so it just
gave me direct approval to navigator in
case if you're using this for the first
time you will just have um user name and
password request on your screen you can
just type it down and press okay so here
we have uh book selection table and few
other things book owner order employee
details employee register so I'll just
go with employee details this is the one
just load a transform data if you are
happy with the data preview you have
just load the direct data directly and
um yeah it should be loaded shortly
there you go so since simply learn
employee details this is just a simple
small data set that I have personally
created and you can load it onto thebi
and start your analysis so um in case if
you're working with Cloud the same you
just have to enter the details from
cloud and that's how we can do it and in
case if you're looking for an exclusive
tutorial on how to load data from Cloud
to PBI please do let us know and we'll
have it done for you and with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to load data from different sources
to PBI so far we have looked for how to
load data from different files how to
load data from an Excel document how to
load data from a database or Cloud how
to load data from a website and if there
