hi guys hope you're doing good okay so
this is Dr srikanth from Team MDS
conquer so now in this video I'm going
to talk about your plan for the subject
Dental histology from 2024 batch point
of view
so hope most of you have started the
journey recently or about to start your
journey with this subject as the first
so let's talk Dental histology
in detail from examination point of view
the first thing I want to add to the
histology is histology is a closed
subject
it's a closed subject closed subject
means
the mode of preparation in the round one
or in the round two are probably in the
next rounds that is three and four
before you go for the final exam will be
almost same means nothing new added okay
for example what your seniors has
prepared you are going to prepare the
same pattern what I have prepared during
my preparation
is almost the same that you have to
prepare because histology doesn't have
major modifications or major changes
such subjects which doesn't have so much
of modifications are so much of updated
content or so much of things which may
be clinically correlated I categorize
such subjects as close subjects so such
close subjects from my point of view
I'll be listing General Anatomy I'll be
listing oral Anatomy I'll be listing uh
oral histology that is nothing but
called as generally astonishing so these
subjects are closed subjects where how
many times you read the mode of
preparation will be almost same maybe
first time you will take some more uh
some you will have a some lengthy
preparations but as you progress to the
second round and third round you are
going to smash the subject hardly in one
or two days
if you can handle these subjects in one
or two days in the next upcoming rounds
then only you can handle or give time
for other subjects which really requires
time
which are mostly clinically correlated
so such subject is called as your
histology which is a closed subject so
coming to the blueprints okay so if you
talk about neat
neet MDS okay Dental histology Dental
Anatomy together is going to carry 14
marks and I want to keep histology seven
to nine marks okay seven marks according
to the blueprint but histology can be
correlated to many other subjects like
for example you take uh conservatives
okay you take conservative so
conservative in conservative Dentistry
okay we basically talk about enamel we
basically talk about Dentin
okay we basically talk about enamel and
Dentin and if you jump into Endodontics
okay we'll we'll talk about pulp in
detail we will be talking about each and
every histological aspect of the pulp
also coming to jumping into perio we'll
talk about all the paradon shim which
includes your arular bone which includes
your gingiva which includes your
cementum which includes your PDL and all
these including Adler mucosa has also
been discussed there okay so all these
are going to be getting printed so my
content is like uh your your dental
histology will get integrated to these
subjects that is conservative industry
Endodontics and period so keeping that
in mind your score will ranges from
seven to ten so all the basics of
conservative endo and perio may be
correlated to dental histology in most
of the scenarios
so the score is going to be 7 to 8 and
uh I'm coming to ini CET okay so i n i c
e t
core varies okay sometimes we have five
seven five to seven questions sometimes
we have seven to nine sometimes less
than five are also seen related to
dental histology exclusively
so the mode of preparation has to be
given a decent time because it has a
decent waitress in your need examination
the next important thing what I want to
focus on uh is how to handle this
subject okay so I have given a schedule
so uh before going deep into the
schedule okay so just give a brief class
I mean like uh we want to prepare a
checklist and I'll tell you in which
sequence you have to proceed with the
checklist okay right so this is a this
is a rough a rough plan for your dental
astrology okay right so coming to uh I
mean like 31st and January 1st I want
you to cover development of teeth okay
so I'll be telling what to be done
everything don't worry so followed by I
want you to finish enamel okay on on
second and third Jan I want you to go
ahead with the Dentin and Pulp okay and
followed by fourth I want you to focus
more on periodontal aspects that is your
cementum periodontal ligament and fifth
adult bone and maxillary sinus Max is a
sinus yes of course uh in your general
Anatomy again your maxillary sinus will
be covered coming to 6th Jan I want you
to focus on salivary glands oral mucosa
again salivary glands will be covered in
general Anatomy to maxillary sinus in
general an automator Tempo mandibular
joint in general and automator and most
of the pathological aspects of these
temporary blood joint maxillary sinus
and celery glands are related to your
oral pathan oral medicine and the
treatment aspects will be discussed in
your general I mean in your general as
well as in your oral surgery so as of
now we'll be dealing more inclined
towards the histology part because most
of you are taking this as a first
subject in proceeding your preparations
then 7th January it will be tooth
eruption and shedding and followed by
eighth we'll be talking about
histological stains the different types
of stains methodology how these
specimens will be done by Oral
Pathologists and everything this
particular topic is being ignored in
many many standard McQ books I don't
know why but recently in the last few
years paper centers are so so interested
like for example you see the latest
question paper neet 2022 you have one or
two questions on this particular area
very short Zone area of very less
importance area not being focused but it
is important for example if you take a
person oral pathologist into
consideration what an oral pathologist
is going to do is this
is this it's not the outcome it is the
process by which they are going to fix
the slides what are the materials they
are going to use what are the cleaning
material they are going to use what are
the fixing materials they're going to
use so definitely it's a very very
important area and you are having
questions on these areas okay but my
point is standard McQ books which most
of the students are reading are missing
this area this is important so go back I
want you to have a quick glance so I'll
provide you the content and I want you
to solve similarly I want you to focus
more on slides okay so many standard McQ
Books Okay what most of us are being
exposed they are not color books Point
number one they are not color books so
they don't give much diagrams okay and
coming to histology what is the word of
histology
histological specimens histological
things means whatever you read in
histology will be or should be
correlated to a diagram for example you
talk about development and growth of a
teeth
in which you have stages everyone knows
we used to draw those stages during our
initial phases of the BDS in the in the
D eadh Labs right
that you have to read and correlate with
the diagrams because they can ask you
diagram based questions and of course
diagram based questions on histology
both in inict as well as need a very
very common and familiar okay so what
books are missing you have to focus you
have to read them and you have to be fit
in the preparation
followed by her given two days for the
revision and followed by 11th you are
going to give an examination on Dental
Histology for 120 marks
so let's try to keep things simple okay
think simple and easy in the initial
phases of preparation so once we attend
speed then we will try to go ahead with
a higher speed okay so don't don't don't
be too aggressive in the preparation in
the initial phase because you are still
in the initial phase so initial phase
you have to start slow then you have to
slowly increase the pace then once you
feel like you are on track and you are
on track with the preparation then I
want YouTube aggressive because in the
last few years I have seen many many
students particularly the Young
Generation who are very very aggressive
in the preparation the initial phase one
two months so aggressive covering the
things but after which they take a break
so I don't want that to happen to you
start slow understand the process what
is happening try to interact with the
mentor try to open up with your doubts
confusions and the mode of preparation
cementers are going to help you out in
in reading the content exactly so there
is something called as uh process of
reading the content means how you read
how you approach uh approach or how you
start reading an McQ based content is
totally different like how you handle
your theory exams until now so the drift
of theory based exams to an McQ based
exam is totally different because an MC
a theory based exam is something they
are going to ask you a question okay
write about uh I mean write up write
about the histology or astrology of your
enamel or write about a particular
Junctions the types of enamels with the
drawer diagram so in this type of
question you can write whatever you want
related to that particular content but
the problem here is when an McQ is asked
in the same area and you will have an
options like a b c d here and you need
to pick your right option a b means you
have to pick only B then only you will
get plus 4 in need if you by mistake has
hit D just slightly confused in the
examination instead of getting plus four
you'll get minus one so accuracy like uh
you should be very very clear with what
you are reading and you should revise
that n number of times now here you no
need to break your head to uh recap the
re recap the content what you are going
to read on a on a white paper like for
example you no need to write anything on
a white paper a blank white pepper no
need to draw any diagrams here you need
to identify a diagram among the four
options here you need to identify the
right answer among the four options
there you have to write multiple things
okay that is easy
but problem is you should have so much
of memory here memory is required but
accuracy in the memory is more required
so the drift is very important so
understand this process of drifting from
your theory based preparation to an McQ
based preparation similarly uh Theory
based when I'm talking about Theory
based exam okay Theory based exam
doesn't require a long-term memory means
tomorrow is your dental histology exam
what you do today or two days you are
going to read vigorously cover the
syllabus try to understand everything
try to remember the headings and you are
going to go and clear the exam
but an McQ based exam will have all the
subjects that's the most difficult
aspect in mcqs exam da Theory based
means only d a d h Theory based only DH
but coming to McQ based exam you will
have all 25 subjects from the first BDS
to that are the final BDS so here what
is going to happen there is something
called a short term memory
and something called as long term memory
so you need to convert your short-term
memory to long-term memory for example
you're reading your topic development of
teeth today you are going to read so
that will be that will be in the short
term memory so again after few days
again after few days within five days
you have to revise development of teeth
again the revision has to be done that
is the reason why I dropped some time
for revision so once you revise that
short term memory will be converted to a
long term memory and this process is
very very required for an entrance
examinations where you need to handle
multiple subjects and multiple topics so
this is not the same scenario as we are
dealing with the theory exams until now
for example tomorrow you have a DH Viva
today you read something one or two
hours ago exp go just just try to recap
what you have done to the external but
this is not today you are reading DH
I may keep one more examination probably
after one month or two months from now
on DH in combination with some other
subject so you should have a habit of
converting this short-term memory to
long-term memory so that this memory is
going to stay for a longer duration of
time in your little brain
okay right I hope like you're converting
the short term to long term okay we will
discuss this particular topic which is
very very important in in the upcoming
classes
so next one I want I want you to prepare
a checklist okay this is an open okay so
this is an open conquer has entered uh
uh entered into the Ninth Batch so
you're the ninth bad students of MDS
conquer so we have a checklist okay a
pre-formulated checklist will be given
and I'll try to monitor you okay the
PDFs uh uh of how to Mark these
checklists and how to proceed how to
prepare your own checklist will be
posted on your respective groups okay so
take a printout please try to stick on
to the checklist and make sure once
you're done with everything on the
checklist keep a tick mark and please
try to save this particular uh print on
on your respect to uh books or maybe on
your on your McQ book or anywhere but
make sure that this space has to be
retrieved once you are dealing with the
same subject second time so I'll be
talking more about checklist
so I'm not going to break your heads
okay so uh textbook reading is mandatory
for DH my answer is no I don't want you
to read textbook I want you to refer
textbook reading is a different word
and referring is a different word okay
so whenever you have a doubt whenever
you are not clear I want you to go back
and refer refer I want you to go back
and refer refer the textbook okay I
don't want you to read the textbook
reading textbook is is I mean like it
may be important as most of the mentors
they may stress but you are an MDS
Congress student if you are an MDS
Congress student reading textbook
properly is already done by the Menders
over here so I don't want you to read
okay because I'm already I'm already
done with the reading phase because I'll
tell you what is important from the
examination point of view and what is
important from an McQ point of view and
I'll force you to read okay but I don't
want you to read and waste time I'm
going to read I'm going to help you and
make you the stuff simple for you so
referring is important not reading and
for example if you are referring also
make sure you try to stick on to only
one textbook okay so there are two
standard textbooks for this particular
subject one is orbance
and second one is 10 kids okay so I mean
like uh I don't want to fight which is
more standard here my logic is very
simple like I feel like most of you have
red orbons in your round one okay during
your BDS level and I hope like most of
you have the textbook so I strongly
recommend to go with the textbook what
you have referred when you have done
your dental histology at a BDS level so
refer that book first book is what book
you have read okay so okay or
your wish any of these two books can be
any of the books can be done okay that
is completely your wish either organs or
tenicates please referring this is only
for referring not for reading only for
referring not for reading so coming to
the reference book for DH you can keep
any of these books but coming to the
content based okay so I'll be talking
about the content based so I want you to
have a proper reading of synopsis so
before you start any any topic okay so
any topic the first thing you have to do
is you have to see the smart video
so smart videos of every topic will be
available on your website okay Smart
Video so first thing before you start
any topic please try to finish the smart
video and please try to add a small
notes add a small notes because this is
your initial phase means adapt to face I
don't want you to write big big notices
or maybe in the in the latter half of
the preparation I don't want you to
write notices it's okay not required but
as your initial phase because you
require a focused based reading you
require a preparation where your short
term memory has to be converted to long
term memory so this process require
preparation of notices in the initial
phase so now start preparing notes
there's nothing wrong please do prepare
notices because your initial phase I
have given so much of so much of time
and so many so many hours of preparation
for dental histology because logically
from my point of view a good student can
Complete Dental histology in just three
days because this is a minor subject
this is a closed subject but I have
given you so much of time because I am
allowing you through the process of
understanding the preparation of reading
reading the content from an McQ point of
view so first I want you to cover smart
video for every topic for every day
start with Smart Video second important
thing I want to stress you is synopsis
synopsis so this synopsis I want you to
pick either Power Play Books you have
power play books right so either power
Playbook synopsis
okay or any McQ book synopsis okay most
of you may read Dental pulse or dentist
okay any McQ based like for example
you're reading Dental pulse so if you
don't have PP books with you because few
people they have started the preparation
okay if you don't have PP books with you
you can start with dental pulse synopsis
of that particular topic of that
particular day if you have both read PP
books first followed by Dental pulse you
read it so if I mean like the main main
problem main main thing you have to
analyze over here is once you're done
with a smart video and you know a
concept if the concept is repeated in
the pp books try to skip it read
understand move fast if you know
something move us for example you're
traveling on the same road from past
five years for example you're going to
college from the past five years interns
okay you go to college from the past
four years and now as an internality
you're going in the same road on your
two wheeler so how you because once you
are coming to a new place so you'll take
some time but once your travel on the
same road from past five years we'll go
fast because we know where the Turning
is we know where the traffic signal is
we know where the crowd will be more we
know where the road is bad and we have
to be very very careful we know
everything okay so we can go fast
similarly once you find a similar Topic
in the smart video that is being
repeated in your power play books or
your your dental pulse make sure make
sure you try to move fast
topics which are unknown go slow
understand topics which are known go
fast
right so followed by once you're done
with that I want you to move to the
number three that is your solving mcqs
solving mcqs okay so problem here is
there are few people reading mcqs
synopsis reading has to be done McQ
solving has to be done okay so once you
have an McQ don't read McQ keep on okay
which of the following is character
related to this particular uh pathology
option
answer is c ah explanation is this this
is called as reading
solving means understanding the question
trying to come out with the answer and
knowing the right answer if you are
going for a wrong answer know the right
answer and know where you are going
wrong in thinking that is called as
solving solving is different reading is
different okay see I want to tell in a
simple way doing a clinical case is
different seeing a clinical case is
different means for example your uh Indo
I mean like for your end up easy is
doing an anterior root canal
you are an assistant and you are seeing
what he is doing
that is called as reading
coming to solving an McQ is you yourself
doing a case is called as solving an McQ
so there is a very drastic difference
right doing a root canal therapy is is
is so much different from watching a
root canal therapy that is being done by
someone okay so please try to understand
the difference between these two things
so please solve the mcqs
don't read the mcqs read the explanation
read the synopsis understand the solving
of mcqs so that is more important
followed by
step 4 I want you to attend the evening
activity so evening activity is is a
landmark that we have started in in the
field of Dentistry throughout the
country first time we have started this
activities okay and uh we don't want to
leave the basics at any Court like what
where we have started we don't want to
live okay so uh every day we will take
an activity of 40 minutes just to
activate you motivate you and we'll read
we'll we'll most probably meet in the
evening at 6 6 30 and we'll we'll be
talking to each other for uh like half
an hour or 40 minutes on the on the
respect to apps or I mean like on the
respect to Whatsapp okay so we'll be
having some activity okay so evening
activity please try to attend if
something new is being discussed if some
diagram based questions are being
discussed or if uh some subject is being
discussed which is unknown to you please
try to shift to that your notices and
followed by the next after next two days
means means for example development of
teeth exam has to be given on the third
day not on the same day don't give exams
on the same day because if you are
giving exams on the same day hundred
percent sure that you will go for a
right answer so I don't want you to give
exams on the same day I want you to give
exams on the third day
so exam has to be given on the third day
so every topic what I have listed here
will have an exam means Dental
Denton will have an exam pulp will have
an exam cementum will have an exam
periodontal ligament will have an exam
so please try to give those exams on the
next next day so that you will know
where you are lagging in the memory
based things where you are lagging in
the concepts and you can come out
Rectify them add to your notices and
this is how you have to progress deep
deep into the preparation so this is a
rough outline okay so of your
preparation checklists of your
preparation schedule and the few
Concepts like how to transfer yourself
in this mode of reading will be done on
a daily basis and how to convert your
short-term memory to long term memory
which is required for an McQ solving or
which is required for an entrance
examinations like neet MDS or inictmds
will be discussed on a daily basis okay
stay positive to stay blessed and start
the preparation with the positive note
you are always open free to talk with
the mentors because the mode of
preparation can be moved from one level
to other level by increasing your
confidence and hoping for more success
this is going to happen only once you
talk with the mentor this is guided
based preparation means you are going to
have a mentor you are going to have a
mentor who is going to respond talk with
you okay and probably this is going to
be handled by group of two or three
mentors of course you have a
subject-specific mentor but the
Integrity of preparation okay the
integrity means the border line of the
preparation the finishing and polishing
of your preparation will be done by core
two to three mentors only means the rest
of the mentors they come they build
their increment so each Mentor is going
to come the build they give the concepts
and build the increment so those those
are called as incremental building of
your registrative material but the
Integrity within the cavity or polishing
finishing and polishing and all these
are done by the core Mentor so I am Dr
srikanth okay the lead founder and
the head of MDS conquer who is going to
be with you 24 into 7 all 365 days in
your upcoming preparation phase so most
of you are going to give examination on
2024 March so we have a decent time of
almost like 14 months which is very very
great time to do some Magics in your
life of Dentistry okay stay positive
