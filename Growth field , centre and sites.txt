Dias concur online basic finish line
course this is for the first time near
students for the paper one I myself dr.
Satoshi history consultant orthodontist
team MDS conquer today going to discuss
about growth fields growth center and
growth sites going to the growth fields
this is nothing but the bones which are
forming are enveloped in the soft tissue
like a mosaic pattern it is a the bone
bony cells are sandwiched between the
tissues and the potential for the bone
growth lies in the tissues that are the
soft tissues which are present like
nerves blood vessels connective tissue
brain etc it is inherently describing
the functional matrix hypothesis so the
growth fields are very large and they
are responsible for the formation of
error or the entire naso maxillary
complex and mandible so if you see here
the growth fields are present in the
form of a blue area so the outside
structures these are the outside
structures and these are the inside
structures lying on the mandible area so
these between these soft tissues the
bony structures maxilla and mandible are
present so the blood vessels nose glands
and their tongue muscular tissues
etcetera are all inherently contain the
information required for the formation
of the bone and regarding the growth
center and growth side this growth
center and growth side mainly present in
individual bones so if you see the
growth center they are the particular
growth center for the maxilla particular
growth center for the mandible will be
present and the entire maxilla is formed
by the growth center so in order to form
an individual bone like maxilla mandible
a growth center is required whereas the
growth side a part of a bone is formed
because of a growth site because of the
growth in the pavan part of the bone
there may be displacement or dislocation
displacement of the particular bone
primary displacement or secondary dis
mint is also based on this concept only
so the growth center is nothing but a
special area which controls overall
growth of the bond whereas the growth
site is merely a location in the bone
itself really where the growth occurs so
the example of the growth center lies
the epiphyseal plates plates of long
bones and also the synchondrosis of the
bones which are present whereas the
growth sites here the condyle mandibular
condyle and maxillary tuberosity is
responsible for the bone growth that is
either resorption or deposition takes
place and they move the bone in one
direction so this is the growth site
showing the the condylar position of the
mandible it is also present in the
growth field and it may be a part of a
growth center but it cannot be the
growth center whereas the growth center
can be a growth side also here is the
growth center it is a location
independently present and it is the
responsible for overall formation of the
mandible here is a small table which is
present in a in your profit table 20.1
profit textbook and you have to mention
this table as a part of a 7 MUX question
then it will be very good information
regarding the growth site and the growth
centre various growth sites and centers
present in your maxilla and mandible
