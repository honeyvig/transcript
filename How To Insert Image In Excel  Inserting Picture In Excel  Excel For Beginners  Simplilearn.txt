hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel in today's session we
will be learning how to insert image in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
technically continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to insert image in
excel
now let's get back to the practical mode
now we are on our excel spreadsheet and
here i'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and company brand names so
since we already have the brand name so
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do i add such kind of
an image into an excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image or files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your excel
spreadsheets it's completely simple so
click anywhere on the excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the add-ins
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures button click on that
and
select from this device or if you have
an online stock image you can take that
or you can also check out from online
pictures for now i'll select the device
this device and here i have some images
the images what we need are simply learn
and simply go to logos press ok
or insert so here you have them
now
you can also adjust the size of the
image using the small buttons here
as it over here
and done
so you might be wondering is it all done
is there anything more to do
or just adding an image is done no
most of the times when you create or you
work with excel spreadsheet you will not
just you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you'll add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
dashboard and sometimes you might not
have enough place to
display your entire dashboard during
those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to
hide this particular row let us imagine
that you wanted to show only uh two uh
charts and
there is no space for your
third chart in such scenarios you might
want to hide or remove that third chart
okay so let's try to hide it and see if
gets if it gets hidden or not when you
try to hide it you can see the column a
has no data and the row number four has
been hidden so we have three and five
but what about the image it is still
present right so if you want to make
sure that the row also hides the image
then you might have to do a little
formatting with it so select the image
go to picture format
or you can also right click and directly
navigate to picture format this opens up
a set of options and here you might want
to go to the
uh
third one which is picture format third
and select the properties and here
select the option of move and size with
cells so when you select this when you
try to hide this it will also i mean the
graph for the image will also hide along
with the row
so that's how you do it so with that we
have come to the end of this session on
how to insert image in excel and how to
you know make some picture formats to
your excel and if you have any queries
