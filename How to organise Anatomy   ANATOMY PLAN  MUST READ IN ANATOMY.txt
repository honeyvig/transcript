hi winners
this is dr srikhan from team mds conquer
now i'm here to discuss about the brief
glance of
general anatomy and this video is
exclusively for the students who are
preparing for
inicit mds as well as neet mds
okay so if you're reading
or if your scheduling is eight hours per
day an average of eight hours per day
you need to spend a minimum quality of
seven to eight days
for an automate or if you are hitting 10
or 12 hours per day
so you can crack an autumn in six to
seven days or if you are reading more
than this you can finish
anatomy as fast as possible the
advantage of anatomy
is same as that of your oral anatomy we
have discussed means
you have a particular limitation for
your subject
means the question out of the box will
be very very less for example if you're
talking about general
medicine medicine you can they can give
any depth oriented question like for
example they are giving a question on
covet 19.
the kovite 19 can be they can give a
question on the initial phase of covid19
or initial drugs which are used or they
can talk about
the the mucoro mycosis or the black
fungus which is going around the globe
they can ask questions so there isn't
it's it's not a depth or any question
the question can
go out of box also but anatomy the
question will be within the box and your
areas to be stressed or areas to be
covered will be limited
and you can be more focused so you can
finish anatomy as fast as possible
if you spend a quality of time with the
book and the content
okay so anatomy uh i can i want to
broadly split them into the following
categories
so first category i want to add in the
red zone okay so these categories of
topics are first one is your osteology
so where you need to focus on all the
bones mandible maxilla
exposure all the bones including your
cervical vertebra
and your foramens what nerves are going
to
with each foramen and everything has to
be covered that is about your osteology
both diagram based as well as the
theoretical based questions can be asked
over this area they can show a foramen
ask you identify the foramen or they can
ask you like which nerve or which artery
is going through this particular foramen
they can ask you they can
they can ask you like they can simply
give drawing a line from anterior to the
posterior
side of the skull in a particular view
and they can ask you
arrange the following form and such
questions were already given in the
previous examination so you should have
a strong command over the diagram
as well as the contents which are
related to the diagram which were
perfectly covered
in a short video of 20 25 minutes which
is available
on your website one so the second uh
thing that i want to add in your red
category zone is thyroid gland
okay so thyroid gland is important
from all aspects important from your
general medicine important from your
general surgery
important from your oral medicine
everywhere it is important similarly
anatomy of thyroid gland should not be
skipped or
neglected the third one i want to add
this in john
in this zone is salivary glands okay of
course we have done our best with
salivary glands and dental histology
part where we have learned the nerve
artery uh all the lymph node dryness and
everything but make sure
salivary gland anatomy you have to be
very very perfect you should be at most
perfect with salivary gland anatomy of
course these are a part of your mouth
okay so i can add tongue also
development of tongue
okay lymph node supply of tongue nerve
supply of tongue
muscles of tongue and everything has to
be covered top to bottom
of course these are this comes under the
part of your
mouth they call it together as mouth
contents in the mouth
the next one i want to add to the list
red list is your
fairings and larynx okay so fairings and
larynx has to be
done top to bottom okay so this is a one
combination
uh which you have to spend a quality of
time okay you need to spend a minimum
15 days of your time means you should
allocate
at least like two to three days of your
quality time with these contents
two to three days you need to spend like
two to three days
two to three days each of eight to ten
hours some minimum time has to be spent
to finish these content
so coming to the second combination i
want to stress on to the second
combination
so second combination should be your
vascular supply
of head and neck the next one is
muzzles of head and neck
muscles of head and neck the third one
is
no supply of head and neck nerves of
head and neck
the next one is the lymph nodes
of head and neck so this combination
is is is like is like interlinked
combination so all these are related to
the head and neck so they are
interlinked
you need to spend one to two quality
days to understand
top to bottom diagrams and everything
each of eight to ten hours
so this is again a completely
interlinked content one to other
okay so the third combination i want to
stress on
is uh is of less importance
for a dental student from a dental
student point of view it is less
important
but has to be covered ear
eye eye and ear nose
then you need to focus on brain
and spinal cord okay
so of course these are of less
importance but has to be done properly
because they are
included in the syllabus according to
the dca
and according to the nb questions uh
related to the eye ear nose are a bit
less
when compared to the brain and spinal
cord so brain and spinal cord
basics they're asking questions they're
not asking a depth oriented questions
uh like similar to the medical friends
but they're asking some basic questions
which you have to
be familiar with okay so the next last
combination
that is part of general anatomy but not
included in the textbook of general
anatomy
that is your general
histology and your
general embryology so these are the
topics that you have to focus on
and the last combination you should
spend a quality
of time of again like two to three days
right so at most important in these list
is
i can i can stress on brain and spinal
cord
basics general histology at your best
and general embryology at your best
so these are the topics that you have to
cover apart from this there may be other
miscellaneous topics here and there
which has to be done i will be covering
them
on your regular uh offline as well as
online discussion part we'll try to
cover them
so this is the brief glance of the
contents what you need to do
now i'll just elaborate where to be done
how to be done
and how to handle the revision
so first of all i'll be uh stressing on
uh
the books that you need to uh
take them as a reference okay first is
uh the third and fourth
volumes of eighth edition of chavrasiya
if you have that
because recent eighth edition has
splitted
uh your brain and neuroanatomy has a
separate separate volume
previously it is used to be in
combination with the third volume but
now it is splitted to the fourth volume
good if you have this book if not you
can follow the regular book or regular
edition whatever you have
ciaoras here sounds to be a very good
source of
reference only make sure if you need a
proper reference go to this book
okay or else like the video content
which is there on the website of
mds conquer is more than sufficient to
crack
any question because the videos were
prepared under
proper guidance okay so most of the
content was properly
organizedly covered okay so that is more
than sufficient
the second one because if you can see
the recent ini cd there were one or two
questions
on uh like on the images which are taken
from
gans anatomy it's a bit difficult
because like the sectional based images
like
uh the images of your dead body the
converter based images were given
i feel like don't you don't need to
waste much of your time
in in in in reading these contents
but some some important areas like your
muzzles of mastication
uh images of your of your
character-based images or your
lateral wall of the neck some see
there's some basic common
common sense or common things that they
regularly ask
in our vivo during our first year so the
questions will be in the similar way you
can easily handle
even if you see an animation based
diagram but
i don't want you to worry about that
okay so just try to be focused
you can stick stick on to the content
that is provided by the team that is
more than sufficient to crack any
difficult question so for embryology you
can stick on to intra piercing
and for histology you can still contain
the appearance astrology based
diagram based histology questions are
again frequently asked nowadays in the
examination so you should be familiar
with
everything will be covered on the group
okay so this is about the books that you
need to follow
the second thing i want to elaborate is
the content okay how to prepare a proper
notes no need to prepare
any notes for this okay so there were
like 10 to 15 pages
of general anatomy synopsis that is
present in your basic mcq book whatever
you're following
it has the 10 to 15 pages sound
good synopsis of general anatomy okay so
that you can you can take as a base
you can add five or six more white pages
of a4 sheet to that particular
14 to 15 pages here and there wherever
required your stick nodes and everything
prepare properly and you can add them
and wherever you want you can add them
at that particular zone and you can
start building your nodes you can take
that
12 to 15 pages as a basic notes
and wherever you require you add them
don't start rewriting the notes again
again and again okay so what to be done
for individual topics
like uh coming to the video content of
the website
okay so i want to stress on the video
content so you'll have a video content
of osteology thyroid gland
tongue pharynx and larynx
salivary glands you'll have a video
content so you will have a video content
of
almost all the topics no need to break
your heads maybe i
ear knows all these synopsis content was
not
well covered so wherever you require
synopsis content you can prepare
from the videos of mds conquer
right so right the next important aspect
coming to the osteology
so make sure you try to do osteology
smart video
that is present on the website along
with the
synopsis content of the mcq books
don't write it first see the smart video
then go back to the synopsis
and just have a glance over the synopsis
then if you feel anything has to be
converted
convert them into nodes and add them to
the synopsis
right so that is one so once you're done
with this evening we'll have
a small activity on the group followed
by you can check the
topic specific exam and you can practice
these examinations
you can practice these examinations on
the
i mean like you can practice the mcqs
right so you have to do smart video
in combination with the synopsis then
followed by you need to solve the
uh mcqs and followed by anything in the
evening activity so this is
almost is going to be same for almost
all the uh
all the topics so thyroid gland uh the
synopsis was not properly covered okay
so you can stick on to the
smart video salivary glands you can
stick on to the smart video
tongue you can stick on to the smart
video with the synopsis larynx fairing
smart video so you can
stick on to the smart video in
combination with the synopsis for the
most of the
contents right most of the contents and
once you are done with the proper
understanding of the anatomy and all the
important contents
with with a good proper organized
synopsis plus notes
make sure you try to get exposed to as
number of mcqs as possible
most of you are following two mcq basic
mcq books like your dental pulse and
dentist
so whichever is feasible whichever is
accessible try to finish that mcqs
mcqs from that particular book and and
my personal suggestion either
once you're done with these any of these
books at least one
you can just and end the book and the
website content like the website content
of your
uh topic specific questions
make sure you try to get exposed to
either across
or either vivek j that is your phibia
the books are
across or
phibia any of these books you can stick
on to these
topics only head and neck you should
stick on to mostly you should stick on
to the
head and neck topics okay right so that
is important aspect
concerned with all almost all the topics
so
all the topics coming to the eye and
nose i want you guys to stick on only to
the smart videos
only to the smart videos followed by the
topic specific topic specific exam
brain also you can stick on to the smart
video plus your
your pulse synopsis and followed by the
topic specific
uh stuff and coming to the uh
general history and general embryo so
these are the
uh subtopics which were most frequently
ignored by majority of the paper
shuttles as well as the book authors but
nowadays you can
we are seeing more familiar questions on
this area so where the diagram based
questions has to be stressed well
okay and coming to the embryology we
have
i i'll try to provide one or one video
is already there
like i will try to provide one to two or
two to three videos on
embryology covering as much stuff as
possible so that please try to stick on
to the smart videos and try to get
exposed to
as number of mcqs as possible and do
make a note when you're doing embryology
try to stick on to the embryology of
head and neck mostly so embryology from
it can be from the reproductive system
it can be from the kidney it can be from
the liver and everywhere
but try to stick on to the contents like
uh like development of
phase development of tongue development
of nose development of palette
development of thyroid gland so you
stick on to the basic embryology which
is going to be like the union of your
sperm and ovum leading to the embryo and
all the stages pre-embryonic post
embryonic and everything
and followed by development of
individual organ mostly you have to
stick on to the
head and neck zone only don't don't go
to the all medical related stuff
and coming to the embryology embryology
you have to focus more on the cell
cell organelles again these are
discussed in your biochemistry
everywhere these are cell organelles are
being discussed in your microbiology
also
so you need to focus more on the cell
cell organelle
different types of cell junctions okay
and different types of epitheliums their
diagrams
their examples diagram based questions
are very familiar
and very peculiar cells in each type of
organ like this type of glands are seen
in which
which are gone or these types of cells
are seen in which organ
and most of these stuff singular and
everything along with the diagrams will
be discussed
on the group itself so this is what the
rough content that you have to
do for the anatomy and make a note uh
when you're about to start anatomy
arrange your argumentarium in proper
organized
scheduling makes make sure you write
everything whatever i have discussed
on a paper and stick on stick onto your
wall stick onto your study area
and make sure you try to get all the
contents like
if if possible you have you have your
character make sure
it get it should be it should be ready
in front of you uh
whatever mcq book you're solving proper
notes
uh your colors colors are more important
because anatomy is more of
color differentiation so make sure get
ready with
all your argumentarium now like if you
if you need something
again you should not go back and waste
your time everything should be ready on
your table
okay you should focus on the video
content and spend quality time on the
video content and try to finish the
syllabus as fast as possible
and one more personal suggestion from my
side you can take it or not
whenever when when you're doing anatomy
it is better you combine with any other
clinical subject because
anatomy on a peak level may
eat away yours may eat away your energy
levels
and may lead to saturation so whenever
you're saturated
add a comfortable clinical subject
comfortable
clinical subjects comfortability varies
from student to student
whatever comfortable like you can add
like two hours of clinical subject any
of the clinical subject
which you feel comfortable along with
anatomy whenever you feel bored whenever
you feel frustrated
drop a clinical subject one hour and
come back to anatomy again
this is how you how to handle anatomy in
the best way
and make yourself best in this
make you known this is a subject of a
limited content
means you cannot the paper sector in
95 percentage of cases cannot give a
question
out of box he can give a difficult
question but cannot give a question out
of box so this has to be done
as fast as possible and this has to be
revised
in a limited time for example in the
last 15 20 days
if i'm asking you to revise anatomy it
should not take more than half a day
because subjects which are going out of
box has to be allocated a decent time
rather than subjects which are in the
box like i can
i can add a few subjects in this list
your biochemistry
for sure will be within the box your
dental anatomy will be within the box
your dental histology will be within the
box your dental materials excluding the
recent updates in the dental metals
within the box
and such subject is your general anatomy
okay questions out of box are very very
less familiar
okay so this is all from my side uh stay
positive
stay safe at home and try to be more
focused
okay so done for now signing off dr
srikan from team
mds concur
