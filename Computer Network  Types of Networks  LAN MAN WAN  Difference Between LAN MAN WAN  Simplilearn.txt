computer networks are often
differentiated based on the mode of
connection like wired or wireless
they are categorized into different
types depending upon the requirement of
the network channel for example
on the basis of geographical location
and the data to be transmitted
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching

now without further ado let's take a
look at the agenda for this session
to begin with we will look at what is
computer networks
moving forward with different types of
computer networks available in a network
channel
then we will look into one of the most
used network channel that is lan network
then man network
as for the end we will look into van
network let's move forward with the
first heading that is what is a computer
network
a computer network refers to a group of
networking devices for example computer
system switch router or hubs connected
to each other through a central unit to
share hardware resources and information
services
the mode to connect different devices in
a computer network
can be based on wired or wireless medium
it depends upon the requirement of the
user
and the availability of network channels
now let's move forward with the next
heading that is different types of
computer networks available in a network
channel
there are different types of computer
networks available to choose from which
also depends upon the need of the user
or the network channel
on this basis we can differentiate into
four different types where the first is
personal area network that is pan
which as the name suggests is used in
personal area to connect devices like
mobile phones personal computers etc
the next type of network is local area
network also known as lan
this area network is used to connect
multiple devices across different
buildings
on multiple devices in a single building
and the next
computer network is metropolitan area
network also known as man which connects
multiple land networks within it
as for the last network we have wide
area network also known as van
which covers locations that are not
easily available through wired medium
for example different parts of states
are connected to each other using wide
area network in this session we will
look into local area network
metropolitan area network and wide area
network
let's move forward with the first that
is local area network
the local area network or lan is used to
connect devices that are available
in a limited range
or small geographical location
as it does not cover large locations
because of hardware limitation
the devices that are connected in this
computer channel
use multiple protocols for proper and
efficient exchange of data and internet
services
the data exchange occurs from a server
device that acts as a central unit
and is passed on to the devices that are
connected in the network channel
let's take a look at some of the
features of local area network
the data transmitted
in the network that is lan network is
relatively higher in comparison to other
network types
man and when
because it covers a small geographical
distance
so the speed of data transmission is
very high
lan uses private network addresses for
network connectivity
as the exchange of data and services
takes place in a closely lit channel
which decreases the error occurring rate
and also provides much better security
let's take a look at some of the
advantages and disadvantages of applying
lan network
for advantages we have
it has a single control unit
which is used to store data
and information and can be used anytime
transferring of data information becomes
much easier and much faster in line
networks
as for disadvantages we have
data security is compromised if the lan
admin decides to steal data and
information
as for the other disadvantages
it requires constant administration for
continuing data services and
distributing hardware resources in a lan
network
with this we have completed the lan
network bar let's move on to the next
that is man network
the metropolitan area network or man is
a network type that encompasses network
connection of an entire city or
connection of a small area in a country
the area covered is less in comparison
to van
and faces moderate network traffic due
to the large location it covers
the exchange of data occurs from one lan
network to the other lan network
and this case
is looped
let's take a look at some of the
features for metropolitan area network
the metropolitan area network covers a
large geographical area and is also used
as an internet service provider by many
of the local services
because it provides high data
transmission rate
it also applies many network devices for
smooth data services and is connected
through telephone lines using wired
medium to provide high internet services
let's move on to the advantages and
disadvantages of using man
it applies
fiber optic cable for higher
transmission and much better security in
comparison to lan network
it also uses full duplex method for data
transmission that is data exchange
occurs simultaneously
as for disadvantages we have
it needs a good quality hardware
resources and the cost of installation
is very high
it also needs an experienced technician
to maintain
and provide much efficient data services
in case of man network
now let's move on to the next heading
that is van network
the wide area network or van is designed
to connect devices over large distances
like a global network that is the
internet
because the wide area network covers a
very large geographical area
for example
connection between different states
or even between countries
it uses wireless media as a connection
mode
for example network tasks and satellites
it also can be termed as the connection
of multiple lands or multiple mans
let's take a look at some of the
features of wide area network
wide area network uses satellite medium
as we already saw
the satellite medium is used to connect
multiple network tires which in turns
provide high speed data connection
for the devices in a network channel
whereas the data transmission rate of a
wide area network is in comparison to
lan and man very low because it uses
wireless medium in most of the cases
so the speed of data transmission is low
and it also covers a larger distance so
it often faces
data errors and loss of information
now let's take a look at the advantages
and disadvantages of applying one
network
van network uses multiple network towers
to connect numerous devices
to be interconnected with the internet
it also covers a very large area to
establish multiple connection between
different parts of a country
and also connect different countries as
well
let's take a look at the disadvantages
of applying van network
the chances of an error occurring in a
van network is very high due to the
availability of different types
of network channels
network devices
and different modes of connection medium
the initial cost of setting up a van
network is very high as it needs
very experienced technician to work on
and requires hardware resources
satellites
network tasks which are very costly to
set up
with this we are completed with a
session on different types of computer
networks
