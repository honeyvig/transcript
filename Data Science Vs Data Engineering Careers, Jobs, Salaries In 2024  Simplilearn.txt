data is the driving force behind today's
Global landscape whether it's sparking
Innovations or enhancing decision-making
processes the potential of data is
immense and can unlock success across
Industries our world has undergone a
radical transformation due to data
moreover functioning without the
insights what data provides has become
nearly impossible in any domain the
growing impact of data has led to the
proliferation of various data related
job roles and opportunities worldwide
according to an industry report data
science is projected to increase by 28%
of All Digital jobs by
2025 these roles are particularly
lucrative due to the rapid generation of
data and the increasing need to derive
meaningful insights from it however the
same report emphasizes a significant
shortage of talent in this field and the
primary reason for this Talent Gap is
the lack of clarity regarding the
specific skills required for each role
companies are seeking candidates with
Niche and specialized skill sets rather
than generalist to avoid being labeled
as a generalist it is crucial to
understand the distinctions between the
two prominent data roles data scientist
and data engineer hello everyone my name
is abar and welcome to this fantastic
video on the data scientist versus data
engineer in this video we will delve
into what a data scientist and data
engineer is the data scientist versus
data engineer skill set data scientist
versus data engineer salary and
understanding roles and responsibilities
of DS and D roles and before starting
just a quick info for you if you want to
become data scientist with our courses
from prestigious universities it's just
a piece of cake supercharge your data
science career with a postgraduation in
data science by puru and IBM in
collaboration with simply learn gain ml

find the course Link in the description
box below and from the comment box so
take action upskill get ahead so without
any further Ado let's get started so
without any further Ado let's get
started and the first topic is who is a
data scientist so data scientist employs
Advanced Data techniques such as
clustering neural networks decision
trees and the like for driving business
insights in this role you will be the
senior most in a team and Should have
deep expertise in machine learning
statistics and data handling you will be
responsible for developing accable
business insights after the get inputs
from data analyst and data Engineers you
should have the skill set of both data
analyst and data engineer so this was
about the data scientist now moving to
who is a data engineer so data Engineers
are the intermediary between data
analyst and data scientist as a data
engineer you will be responsible for the
pairing and preparation of data for
operational or analytical purposes a
loot of experience in the construction
development and maintainance of the data
architecture will be demanded from you
in this role usually in this role you
will get to work on Big Data compile
reports on it and send it to data
scientist for analysis and now moving to
data scientist and data engineer skill
set so coding skills are Central to each
of these job roles data scientist need
to have Mastery or programming languages
like Java python SQL R SAS to name a few
additional you need a working knowledge
of Big Data Frameworks like Hardo spark
and pi and understanding the basics of
Technology such as deep learning machine
learning and the like also can Propel
your career in this role and the role of
a data engineer requires you to have a
deep understanding of programming
languages such as Java SQL SAS Python
and the like you should also be adapt at
handling Frameworks such as Hadoop map
reduce Pig Hive Apache spark no SQL and
data streaming at naming a few now
moving to the data scientist and data
engineers salary comparison you can earn
as much as
$137,000 a year as a data scientist at
the other end of the spectrum data
Engineers can command a salary upwards
of
$116,000 a year now move to the roles
and responsibilities for data scientist
and data engineer so coming up with data
scientist the responsibilities you have
to shoulder as a data scientist includes
manage mind and clean unstructured data
to prepare it for practical use then
develop models that can operate on big
data and then you should have
understanding and interpreting Big Data
analysis and then you should deliver
results that have an impact on business
outcomes so these are the roles and
responsibilities for data scientist now
mov to role and responsibilities of data
engineer so your responsibilities in
this role will be data mining for
getting insights from data conversion of
erroneous data into usable form for data
analysis writing queries on data
maintenance of the data design and
architecture and regardless of which
data science career path you choose may
be data scientist data engineer data
roles are highly lucrative and only
stand to gain from the impact of
emerging Technologies like Ai and
machine learning in the future and with
that we have come to the end of this
video if you have any queries please
