without further delay let's get back to
the Practical mode so I have opened my
data set on Microsoft Excel now here we
will understand what exactly pivot
tables are and how to create them let's
say you wanted one single dashboard on
your data set about which company or
which d
had made how many number of orders and
price of each order sales total number
of Sales Country Etc all the details in
one single table which is dynamic just
one click or just one change or just one
new entry or you remove an entry
whatever you make changes to your data
set and it reflects on real time so that
can be made with the help of pivot
tables so pivot tables is just a single
or process which can be done in few
clicks and you have that so the process
is really simple just select all the
data you have on your data set go to the
insert option and there you have the
pivot charts and pivot table so pivot
chart is something which will give you
the visual representation of the data
and the pivot table is something which
will also give you the visual
representation but it is regarding only
numbers but pivot chart on the other
hand is vectorial representation now we
are discussing about the pivot table now
so
let's try to insert a pivot table from
the range here itself now we will create
a new worksheet for the pivot table or
you can also have it in the same place
so now let's have dealer in the filters
and uh what are the columns you want
let's say I want sales column I want uh
country
column and I want price of each sale or
product line or let's say I want orders
number of orders now in the row
I want okay I want dealer in rows not in
filters we can have uh filters later you
can filter out the required you know
details now let's have sales and values
as well so we will have some of sales
and if you add country to filters you
can filter based on the country you're
looking at great right so here you have
all the required data now if I give
country as
let's say I want USC press okay and you
want dealers for luxury motus there you
go right with a sing and you want to to
check in Japan and not in USA just click
okay and there you go so there are no
sales in Japan so
similarly if you want uh in
Australia that's you get the real time
and if you wanted multiple or all just
select all and there you go so that's
how you use pivot tables in Excel and if
