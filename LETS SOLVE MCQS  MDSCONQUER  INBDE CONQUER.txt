yeah hi winners uh hope you're doing
great
so this is dr srikan from team mds
conquer
so let's have some
quick recap of few important things
let's start
so i hope you are familiar with this
question so the question number one in
front of you is
in millennium developmental goals how
many goals are health related okay so
we have eight goals okay so out of which
three are health related so the answer
is c
so let's have a glance over these eight
goals
so coming to the goal number one which
is uh
eradication of extreme poverty and
hunger so it is related to the foot
goal 2 is
the primary education and goal three is
gender equality and domain empowerment
so goal fourth is very important so
which is health related that reducing
the child mortality rate goal fifth is
important again health related that is
improving the maternal health goals six
is again important that is the health
related goal uh which talk about the
diseases of hiv and malaria and other
diseases goal seven is environment
related and goal eight is global
partnership for the universal
development okay so out of which goal
number four
five six are health related so you have
eight goals of which
three are health related i hope the
question is clear so then next jumping
into the question number two that is
modula on microscopic examination
contains how many cells in it okay so
this is a basic question that is related
to
embryology so if you jump into
embryology okay so zygote which is
formed by the union of
sperm and ovum so leads to the formation
of a zygote which is a single cell so
further
zygote
by the process of mitosis is going to
divide into
two cells okay followed by two cells
they're going to divide it into four
four they're going to divide it into
eight and eight it's going to divide it
into 16. so this 16 cell structure is
called as moral so this contains 16 cell
so morella on further differentiation
it's going to form
blast resist this this sequence was once
asked for the medical students uh in the
examination so that is zygote followed
by marula followed by blastocyst okay so
do make a note of it so jumping into the
next question that is related to the
prosthetics
a 55 year old male patient
having bilateral undercuts
confirmed as bony undercuts on cbct so
you do make a note cbct is one of the
important diagnostic kit
in dentistry now okay so they can ask
you about the bone or for example for
endo fracture line transfer or number of
canals and most of the stuff can be
easily identified by cbct and of course
you are familiar with that
so the best option for this particular
case is
so coming into the
i mean like a brief idea so you can see
this is called as tuberosity okay
uh so tuberosity will be
like if it is normal the tuberosity has
many advantages
but sometimes the tumorosity can contain
a flabby tissue
soft issue or sometimes can be a heart
issue
so if you take this maxillary
tuberosities the tuberosities can be
either
soft
or can be either hard
soft tissue can be again either
bilateral or unilateral
and heart tissue can be bilateral or
unilateral
okay so in most of the cases these
tuberosities are going to hinder the
retention
of the
denture
so what happens here for example if it
is a bilateral
you have to remove one tuberosity and
you can keep the other tuberosity
because other tuberosity will acts in
retention
it acts in retention
and coming to the unilateral unilateral
you can keep the unilateral because
unilateral will act as a retention
bilaterally you have to remove one and
keep the second one which acts for the
retention
because if it is bilateral it is very
difficult for the insertion of the
denture coming to the heart issue heart
issue
tuberosities or tuberosities with
undercuts it's very difficult to
difficult to insert so whether it is
unilateral or bilateral you have to
remove them
okay right so i hope you are familiar
with this now if you check out the
question they are telling a bilateral
bony bilateral bony or unilateral bony
it has to be removed okay
so the answer is remove both the
undercuts
for example if it is unilateral
soft tissue if it is unilateral soft
tissue undercut
no need to do anything because that
helps in retention process if it is
bilateral soft tissue one side has to be
removed and second side will help in the
retention process
okay jumping into this so this question
was very familiar
all of these three were repeated in the
examination
for the medical students as of now and
one question was repeated for the dental
and most of these are related to a
particular organism that is called as
anthrax
okay so
so this is a bacterial infection okay so
in the first pick which we are very very
familiar so that is the best
differentiating future which helps in
differentiating this
anthrax okay that is called as
string of
pearls you can see the string of pearls
here so if you just observe each string
okay each parallel and if you magnify
them parallel it looks like this means
the outline is something like it looks
like a medusa head appearance okay so
it's a medusa head appearance so they
can ask you medusa like head appearance
is seen in the culture of
the answer is
bacillus anthrax the second one is
string of pearls
string of pearls is a very important
feature that you've seen the answer is
same and one more thing okay so this is
uh
most commonly seen you can see this uh
this gesture which has been uh filled
with gelatin so in this also you can see
something like an inverted inverted
christmas tree or inverted phi tree
appearance you can call as
inverted
christmas tree or inverted
file tree appearance is seen again in
the same so these three diagrams are
very very important related to this
particular microorganism from
microbiology point of view okay right
so
as of now i'm done with this particular
short video so just have a glance over
these contents
all the best have a great day stay
positive
