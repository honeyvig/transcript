hello everyone welcome to this tutorial
on css responsive design by simply learn
in this tutorial we are going to discuss
what is this concept design and how we
can achieve this using the css media
queries
so
let's get started making a website with
an adaptable layout is called a
responsive web design and css media quiz
are one of the most important part of
responsive design
in the past building a website was much
simpler today a website layout should
adapt itself not only to computers but
also to tablet mobile devices and even
tvs
so
let's see how we can create a responsive
web layout using css media keys within
help of an example so here we are
sublime text writer we have us our
standard wallet ready so let's create
something
so let's start by creating the four days
here
we'll give it a class name box
with an id box one
we'll name this windows
just copy it four times
let's rename this id to box to and here
we'll type type macos
for the box 3 will have
linux and the box 4
will have android
let's add some styling over here
so just open the style tag
i will text align the text key we'll
send the text align to center
uh we'll set the background color
let's select some color
so we'll go to this left html color
good color
we'll set the text color to white
and we'll set the font size to say
something different
and just save the file let's go back and
refresh the page
let's figure it out
okay so first valid
so now if you refresh you see we have
our lives with windows mac os linux and
android and with this background color
so
to design the responsive web pages use
the media queries
so what are media queries let's first
discuss this
so a media phrase are used when you want
to customize the website's presentation
according to the user's screen size with
the help of the media queries you can
display different markups based on the
device's general type mobile desktop sub
tablets you name it
a media code is a logical operation
whenever a media query becomes true then
the related css is applied to the target
element
so
to start the media query just type at
the rate
and media now here we will mention the
max width
to save 400 pixels
and inside this media query we write the
css code that should
take an effect when this condition is
satisfied
so here
we'll set the box 1
to display block
now
if you go back to the page and you
refresh
you see nothing happens because we have
not made this display to none so first
go back to the css code
and set hit display to none
now you can see we don't have any
display here so let's inspect the page
first
so you will see we have our contents
here
now you can see this is the
layout we are currently using the
current weight is 685 pixels into high
255 pixels
now we are setting the max bit to 400
pixels this means if this bit decreases
to less than 400 pixels how this css
code will kick in so let's decrease the
width here
so as you decrease
this width
you see as soon as you get less than 400
pixels our css kicks in so we have our
windows displayed here which is
the box id1 so this is how the media
query works
let's add some more media queries to
understand it better so just copy this
code down
so now let's set this minimum width
to
401 pixels
and maximum to say 600 pixels
now when this condition is true let's
say we want our box to
to display block with color
green
so let's set the background color here
to let's
say green
now
we will add one more media query
so just copy this code
[Music]
paste it here
so when the bit is from 601 pixels to
say
800 pixels
so we'll set the box 3 display
to block and color
to
shipping
so
just save this and let's understand it
on the page
so
let's
change the width of the screen
so see as soon as the width goes less
than 400 pixels we have our windows on
display
now when we increase the width size and
it goes more than 401 pixels we have the
mac os display
keep on increasing it
now see the width is more than 600
pixels and we have linux on display so
this is how we create the responsive web
design for the different devices so
that's how you can easily include
different media queries depending upon
your requirement note that we have used
the and operator to combine the two
queries to be true you can also use
other operators such as not only or
comma so this is all for this tutorial i
hope you have got the basic knowledge of
media queries in css
feel free to ask the queries in the
query section thank you
