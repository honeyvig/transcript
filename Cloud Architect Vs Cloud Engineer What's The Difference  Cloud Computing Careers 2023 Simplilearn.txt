so let's move on to Cloud engineers
Cloud engineer is a professional
responsible for Designing implementing
and managing clouds Computing Solutions
and infrastructures for organizations
they work with Cloud Technologies and
platform to enable businesses to
leverage the benefit of cloud computing
such as scalability flexibility cost
efficiency and accessibility to
resources and services
so let's dive into the rules and
responsibilities of a cloud engineer the
first is cloud architecture Cloud
Engineers design the architecture of
cloud-based systems deciding how
resources and services will be organized
and integrated within a cloud
environment
they choose the appropriate cloud
service providers like Amazon web
services Microsoft Azure or Google cloud
and design solutions that align within
organization's goals and requirements
infrastructure as code they often use
infrastructure as code tools and
practices to automate the provisioning
configuration and management of cloud
resources this approach ensures
consistency repeatability and Version
Control of infrastructure components
Cloud migration Cloud Engineers
assistant migrating existing on-premises
applications and workloads to the cloud
this involves assessing current systems
planning the migration strategy and
executing the migration process to
ensure minimal disruption security and
compliance ensuring the security and
compliance of a cloud environment is a
Paramount concern for cloud and genius
they Implement security measures
configure access controls and monitor
for potential security threats and
vulnerabilities
performance optimization Cloud Engineers
continuously Monitor and optimize Cloud
resources to maintain Optimal
Performance while controlling costs this
includes adjusting resource allocations
optimizing database configurations and
implementing caching strategies
Automation and devops they collaborate
with devops teams to automate deployment
processes integrate continuous
integration and continuous delivery
pipelines and streamline the software
development life cycle in the cloud
troubleshooting and support Cloud
Engineers are responsible for diagnosing
and resolving issues in the cloud
environment such as network problems
service disruptions or performance
bottlenecks
so Cloud Engineers also need a deep
understanding of certain skills which
include Cloud platform knowledge
familiarity with one or more major Cloud
platforms such as AWS Azure gcp or
others is crucial each platform has its
own set of services tools and features
so understanding how to use them is
essential for a cloud engine
Cloud architecture understanding Cloud
architecture principles including how to
design scalable resilient and cost
effective Solutions is fundamental you
should be able to create architectural
diagrams and decide which cloud services
to use for different scenarios
networking a solid understanding of
networking Concepts including virtual
networks subnets security groups load
balancing and DNS is crucial for
configuring and securing Cloud
environments security
Cloud security is a top priority a cloud
engineer should be well versed with
identity and access management
encryption firewall configurations and
security best practices to protect Cloud
resources and data operating systems
Proficiency in various operating systems
like Linux and windows is important
because Cloud instances often run these
operating systems knowing how to manage
and troubleshoot them in a cloud
environment is valuable scripting and
coding skills and scripting languages
like python bash or Powershell are
beneficial for automating tasks and
writing custom scripts to interact with
Cloud API so there you have it the
skills required for a cloud engineer so
let's quickly go through the key
differences between these two rules
the first is rules
Cloud Architects primarily focus on
designing the overall Cloud
infrastructure and developing long-term
Cloud strategies Cloud Engineers on the
other hand are professionals responsible
for implementing managing and
maintaining Cloud environments
responsibilities responsibilities of a
cloud architect include solution design
Cloud strategy security and compliance
and cost optimization Cloud Engineers on
the other hand are responsible for
infrastructure deployment automation
troubleshooting scaling and monitoring
skills a cloud architect should possess
skills like Cloud expertise architecture
design security knowledge communication
and business acumen a cloud engineer on
the other hand should possess skills
like Cloud platforms scripting devops
tools networking and problem solving
last but not the least the salaries
according to class 2 the average salary
of a cloud architect in India is around
22 lakhs per annum and the same Cloud
architect working in the United States
earns around 218 000 annually with
additional cash benefits on the other
hand the average salary of a cloud
engineer in India is around 7.5 lakh
rupees per annum and the same Cloud
engineer working in the United States
earns around 141
000 annually with additional cash
benefits so there you have it choosing
between a career as a cloud architect or
a cloud engineer is a decision that
ultimately depends on your interests and
skill sets both professions offer a
promising future with a strong job
