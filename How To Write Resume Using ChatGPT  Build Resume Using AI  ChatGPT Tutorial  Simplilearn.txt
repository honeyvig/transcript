have been having some aspirations on
different job roues like business
analyst State analyst but you might not
know how to build a resume that is ATC
friendly that is application tracking
system friendly and get you a job most
of you just go through through the job
description provided on LinkedIn indd
Notre or any other job portals and you
just copy paste the uh job rules and
responsibilities and expect the at
system to crack it or if not the ATA
system the hiring manager or the HR to
click on your Receiver right that might
not work in all the cases so we have our
AI friend Chad GPT to help us build the
resume according to the job description
and the ATS friendly nature of your
resuming should help you landar your
drink job now let's take an example
let's open one of the job portal
platforms like
Linkin okay so here I'll be looking for
data analyst and here are my search
results I have seor data analyst data
analyst see in your product data analyst
let's go with this one which is about
data analyst and here is your existing
resume so let's say this is your
existing resume and you have a a lot of
things to add in here you have your
educational qualifications here you have
your you know maybe the cover letter and
you have your skills which are inlisted
bottom in the bottom section of the
resume right so it talks a lot let's say
uh these are not the ones which the uh
ATS system or uh the hiring manager is
looking for how do you make it a little
more interesting do is I would use chat
GPD I would go to the job description
here job and job description I'll simply
copy the job description job roles and
responsibilities and everything right
now I'll go back to chat GPT and write a
promp just tell chat GPT hi chat
GPT imagine you are a 20 year old or
let's say 15 year old
[Music]
professional reum
writer
now I need you to check on the job
description for a data
analyst and help me with the cover
letter resume
it
so it should be a two-way communication
most of you end up doing some mistakes
wherein you try to extract all the
information just in one prompt so I
would uh recommend you to keep it in a
two-way communication let chat gbt know
what you're up to let chat GPT know its
role and responsibility right it should
understand what you are expecting from
it so I'm trying to convince it that it
is a professional resume writer and and
I'm telling it to check out a job
description which I'll be sending it in
a minut and then I need its help to
create me a cover letter and resume
right now let it know about the job
description okay I'll give you a job
description you need to
understand the
key the key points of this job
and
critical
expectations from the
candidate here are critical expectations
from the candidate here is
the
JD now is given me some of the critical
roles and responsibilities that this
particular job role demands from the
candidates now uh you have all this
right so you need a cover letter first
so give me a cover
letter covering the top
three responsibilities
or highlighting instead of covering you
can write it as
highlighting in my according okay so
give me a cover letter highlighting the
top three
responsibilities keep the cover
letter under 200
words
so here you have your cover letter dear
hiring manager I writing to express my
Keen interest in data anal position at
your esteemed
organization and uh I bring expertise in
three pivotal rules some of the uh
corporate languages that chat gbt helps
you with is the one key factor which
will help you crack your uh you know uh
the initial stages of the interview you
can just get uh a clickbait from the
hiring manager and it's the best chance
to get your resume selected now let us
proceed with the resume
right build me
resume using the job
description so this is what you actually
do but uh I would recommend you to go a
step further right now you can use this
template it will give you professional
summary key skills required professional
experience correct and education so this
is not everything so what you need to do
is take the key responsibilities right
so you can take the professional summary
as is given by chat gbd or you can
enhance it based on your own words and
you can give your basic deta dets about
your name address ZIP code email address
phone number LinkedIn profile Etc you
can go with the same professional
summary or you can enhance it in your
own words and coming back to key skills
you can add your key skills here based
on the profile you're adding and uh here
you have professional experience and
here you just have plain English plain
statements right so what I would
recommend is the plain English points
will not help you you can take the
entire template as a test and when it it
comes to your uh uh professional
experience I would suggest a few
modifications here so these are the few
modifications which will help you and
your resume to stand up from the others
correct so here you can add your
educational qualifications your
certifications and professional
membership so in case if you have any
professional certifications from
authorized organizations you can also
take them and attach them to this
particular resum and references will be
available upon request now coming back
to the critical modification that I has
been suggesting testing you so when it
comes to professional experience let's
say I have this particular professional
experience on my resumer right so what I
could do is uh tell chat
gbd uh or you can also use the same uh
detail that it gave you you can copy
this
and ask Chad to quantify
this can you
please
FY my experience
you can
use terms
like 15% organic
growth
10% reduction in
expenses for
advertisement
is
in increased Revenue per
lead lead by 12% so you can just add on
some numbers right so it will when you
quantify your experience when you
quantify your pointers it will help the
potential recruiter to understand your
potential in a much better way and your
resume will also be shortlisted there
you go you have your new resume here and
again giving you some key notes on this
particular area so what you can do is
you can also modify or enhance these uh
professional experience based on the top
problems faced by the company or top key
critical roles and responsibilities that
you need to fill right to solve those
problems in that particular company and
take those positions and secure the
company right that's the overall point
of it so ensure that these particular
professional experience fall in line
with these key skills at least the top
three right and that will be
self-explanatory for your recruiter and
the rest of the part is as usual so the
chart gbt resume always follows the ads
format and the only major different what
it makes is right the only uh difference
what your regime and the rest of the
people's reum make is the difference in
the way you are quantifying your
achievements the way you are measuring
your cap abilities and adding them on to
your resume to catch the eye of the
recruiter are the few things that matter
and with that we have come to an end of
this session on how to create an ATS
friendly resume using chat gbd and if
