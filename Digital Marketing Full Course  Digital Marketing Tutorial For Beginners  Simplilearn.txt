in the beauty industry glossier
wonderfully use the power of digital
marketing to grow their business so in
this video on what is digital marketing
we will be covering the basics of
digital marketing starting with an
introduction to what it is how it is
different from traditional marketing we
will explore how digital marketing Works
breaking down the steps in easy to
understand terms you will also learn
about effective strategies you can use
to make the most out of digital
marketing for your business all right so
let's understand what is digital
marketing so digital marketing is the
art of using the internet to promote
products or services to people who might
be interested in them instead of relying
solely on traditional methods like
newspaper ads or Flyers digital
marketing takes advantage of online
platforms like website social media
emails and search engines did you know
that a whooping 89% of Americans go
online every day and about 31% are
online nearly all the time this means
it's super important to be online too by
having ads and stuff online you can make
your brand known give customers a great
experience and even get more more people
interested in what you offer by using
digital channels like social media
paperclick ads search engine
optimization and email marketing to
connect with existing customers and then
you can measure your success in numbers
tracking websites visits and social
media engagement email open rates and
more are also used in this this data
helps you understand what's working and
what's not allowing you to adjust your
strategy to maximize the results all
right so this was about digital
marketing now let's understand
understand how is digital marketing
different from traditional marketing so
digital marketing and traditional
marketing are like two sides of a coin
they both aim to promote products or
services but they do it in different
ways here's how it works first
traditional marketing traditional
marketing is like shouting across the
crowded playground to get everyone's
attention so in traditional marketing
let's say tv ads and billboards think
commercial and giant posters trying to
reach a lot of people at once second
example would be newspapers and flight
spreading messages through printed
materials delivered to homes or handed
out to streets and now let's talk about
the digital marketing aspect so digital
marketing however is like Whispering
directly in the ear of a person who
wants a particular product so let's say
online ads placing ads on websites or
search engines that people who are
already interested in your steps will
see next is social media connecting with
people on platforms like Facebook and
Instagram where you can show them why
your product is the best then another
example would be targeted emails sending
messages directly to people who might be
interested like offering a discount on
their first product purchase is another
benefit of digital marketing so
basically digital marketing is kind of
more specific and targeted marketing all
right now let's understand how it
actually works so how digital marketing
Works digital marketing works by
leveraging the power of the internet and
Technology to connect with the potential
customers this involves using online
tools to reach and engage with their
audience where they spend most of their
time that is the internet so let's have
a look at some first on the list is Su
so this helps your website show up in
higher search engine results making it
more likely for people to find you when
they search for something you offer for
example when someone in your area
searches for a freshly baked pastries
SEO ensures that your bakery's website
appears at the top of the search results
this increases the chance of local
customer finding your bakery online when
they're looking for big Goods all right
so this was about the SEO now coming to
the next one which is content marketing
so this involves creating useful and
interesting content like blogs videos
and social media posts can attract and
retain customers for example you could
create engaging content such as blog
post about the history of pastries
tutorial videos on cake decoration or
photos of your latest Creations on
social media this content not only
showcases your expertise but also keeps
your audience engaged and interested in
what you offer next on the list is
social media marketing so this social
media marketing involves using platforms
like Facebook Instagram and Twitter to
connect with your audience and share
content that encourages them to interact
with your brand for example you can use
delicious images of your bakery Goods
interact with customers by responding to
comments and messages and even run
contest or promotions to attract more
people to your store that is the bakery
all right coming to the next one which
is email marketing so email marketing is
like having a personal connection with
your customers it involves using email
to connect with potential and existing
customers it's essentially sending
commercial messages but with a
permission based approach people who
sign up for your email list are
essentially giving you the green light
to send them information for example you
can collect email address from your
customers who visits the bakery and you
can send them regular updates about new
pasty flavors special promotions or
upcoming events at your bakery this
personalized communication keeps your
brand top of mind and encourages to
repeat the business next is payer click
that is PPC advertising so payper click
or PPC advertising is an online
advertising model where advertisers pay
a fee each time their ad is clicked so
it's a way of buying visits to your
website rather than attempting to earn
those visits organically PPC ads
typically appear alongside search engine
results or on social media platforms and
advertisers bed on keyword to display
their ads to the relevant audiences so
example for this you could create ads
that appear when people search for terms
like best bakery in your town or Target
social media users based on their
interest in baking or deserts with PPC
you only pay when someone clicks on your
ad making it cost effective way to
attract potential customers to your
Baker's website or social media profiles
now that we have discussed the types of
digital marketing strategies let us
understand how you can Implement each of
these strategies so first identify your
audience the first step is understanding
who you want to reach imagine them as
people who might be interested in your
product or services this is like
picturing the people who would love your
bakery are they busy professionals
looking for for a quick breakfast pastry
or maybe families with Sweet Tooth
understanding your ideal customers help
your tailor your marketing efforts the
next is choose your channels next you
pick the online platforms where your
target audience hangs out think of these
as virtual stomping grounds like social
media sites or search engines think of
online platforms as virtual
neighborhoods if your target audience is
young families Instagram might be the
great place to Showcase your colorful
cupcake all right next one is creating
engaging content once you know where
your audience is you can create content
that will grab your attention this could
be informative blog post eye-catching
videos or even fun social media post
this is like taking mouthwatering
pictures of your cupcakes and bread you
can even film short videos of your
frosting a cake or decorating cookies to
show your skills similar to what all the
foodie channels are doing nowadays on
YouTube and Instagram then next is
spreading the word so now that you have
a great content you need to get it seen
right you can use various strategies
like online advertising social media
promotion or even influencer marketing
that is partnering with people your
audience trust for example you can put a
post like mention someone who will give
you a pasty treat and you can even run a
contest or giveaways like this post and
tag a friend who loves cake for a chance
to win a free slice and you can also do
collaboration with some foodie channels
that are famous next is tracking and
analyzing digital marketing tyes on

your campaign are performing and adjust
your strategy based on the data for

digital marketing works and now let's

imagine you have a fantastic shop in a
busy street but no one seems to notice
it because it's strucked away in a
corner SEO or search engine optimization
is like putting up bright signs and
arrows that guide people people straight
to your shop it helps your website stand
out in the vast online world making it
more likely for people to find and visit
it so SEO is like the friendly guide
that ensures your website gets the
attention it deserves bringing in more
visitors and potential
customers and for doing so a tool is
very crucial and one of the best tool
out there is SEO pow suit so SEO pow
suit stand out as the best solution for
all your SEO and digital marketing
requirements it offers four powerful
tools like rank tracker website auditor
SEO spy glass and Link assistant
providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use Su power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back links and L
building and first we'll have to focus
on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as
has a comprehensive solution to enhance
your understanding of keyword and
overall market dynamics so first of all
we'll have to create a project over here
so over here we'll have to type the URL
of this website and so I will just type
here
b.com it's an e-commerce site all right
so now we'll click on next then again
we'll connect on next and here you can
enter the keywords if you want and if
you don't want then you can proceed by
clicking on
next here you can add more search
engines Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean
it's your choice if you want to add it
or not I just don't want to add all
these Google and Yahoo are sufficient
then we'll click on finish all right so
our project is getting ready all right
so it is loaded so first of all we'll
start by understanding the menu bar so
the menu bar is like the control center
like of rank tracker offering a set of
drop- down menus that help you manage
your projects and preferences so let's
understand first so this is file so this
menu handles basic commands relating to
your project such as opening closing and
saving files it's your goto for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
trailing rank tracker to suit your needs
then there is window so window this menu
provides a list of supported hot Keys
like keyboard shortcuts and allows you
to quickly switch between different
modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation and action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the
assistance all right then here comes the
project as you can see project this menu
is like a project management Hub it
displays a drop- down list of all the
projects currently open in rank tracker
allowing you to easily switch between
them so only one project is there so it
is showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and the open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
projects with this command you can do
that then close this option allows you
to exit then as we can see check all so
check all rankings in all the open
projects simultaneously with this
command it steam lines the process of
gathering information across your
various projects then you can also login
like found in the SEO power Cloud login
area this this is where you log to
access Cloud related features all right
so this was about the menu bar now
coming to the sidebar so quickly let's
understand this one so first of all
there is the dashboard as you can see
project dashboard this is your project
Central Hub it provides a visual summary
of key statistics related to your
organic traffic ranking progress and how
well your competitors are doing it
serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this model you will find
a list of keywords you're targeting it
shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as you can see next is keyword
research so here it is so here you can
explore new keyword ideas using over 20
different tools like it is in there the
module allows you to analyze and
categorize new keywords into groups and
move them to Target keyword section all
right so as we can see these are that 20
different tools the tools that we are
talking about then there is surp
analysis that is SCP analysis this is
for in-depth keyword analysis it
provides you detailed analytical report
on websites competing with you for the
same queries then competitors research
this module enables you to research on
competitors based on domain or topic
domain strength it offers overall report
on your website's SEO strength showing
how it evolves over time then there is
reports this module is for generating
and you know delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research you click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as we can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the so
store let's say
all right now I'll click on
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profiles all right so this
is what it is this is the result and as
we can see keywords and this is organic
traffic this is URL of the sold store
and these are the keywords as we can see
so these are basically the keywords for
which the competitors are ranking and
access their performance we can you can
have the option to investigate any
competitor of your choice or rely on
rank tracker to recommend the most
relevant ones within your specific Niche
now after this you can explore keywords
with various keyword research methods
like keyword Gap search console Keyword
Planner autocomplete tools related
searches keyword Comin Etc so as you can
see all these are over here you can have
a look at these and explore these
meanwhile we can explore this keyword
sandbox as you can see keyword sandbox
with the help of this we can filter our
keywords which is the next step all
right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
factors such as search volume as we can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficulties is also
mention so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice
you can either select or stop like track
like we can see so it's your choice you
can filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
dragged now your keywords will appear
also in the tracked keyword so like I
have tracked this one and this one so in
track keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type
the website that is
bof.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as you can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all we'll
explore similarly that we explored in
the previous one so this is the menu bar
and I think we have explored this and
this is the sidebar it is bit different
from that so let's explore explore the
Side Bar so site structure we have as
you can see this section organizes all
the elements of a website including its
pages and resources it provides like a
visual map of the site along with an
audit dashboard that accesses various Su
factors so as you can see page audit
over here now the page audit will do the
page level analysis so this was the
function of page audit then domain
strength is there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with a little demo so first we have to
create a project that we already created
and wait till the tool crawls and
collects all the pages on your website
so that we have done already now we'll
go to site audit so as you can see here
under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit we'll address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendation to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool all
right so next we can do is visualization
as we can see over here under site audit
we click on that now to ensure
visualization basically is used to
ensure your site is well structured the
tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly Sport and address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections read directs broken links and
more so this is what it is used for on
the right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click depth as we can see
click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if you switch to internal
page link as you can see we'll click on
that you can see how the internal link
are spreaded like it is bit different
sorting by Page views if should
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we're not able to figure it out as
of now for that I think we'll be needing
a Google analytics account and we'll
need to log in with that all right so
after reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in rant
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say I want to
write joggers
watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts
sliders
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket who
these
shs all right I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have rote the keywords over here now
we'll click on create map now the
program will take few moments to harvest
all data for the keywords and the tool
automatically identifies the pages most
relevant to your keyword group or
specific keyword so this is showing only
one it should at least show five because
website auditor will suggest the top
five most fitting Pages for each keyword
of group
so we must add more keywords I
believe we can add manually or we can
just have a look at rank tracker also
like hell Club shirt we can
see can add
that all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just hover
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it is
all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map now with the ready
keyword map ensure your landing page is
optimized for Target keywords now we'll
go to content audit first so here we can
adjust the target settings set the
default search engine for competitor
page and assign a specific one for the
current page so as you can see they are
showing the errors
and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and as we just showing make your page
meta description approximately 22 word
long so it is showing how to fix also
basically and if we talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as we can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go
you can easily you know edit this site
also and properly write an SEO optimized
title so as you can see 33.2%
optimization rate is there it is showing
and other than that we can click on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description
tags and you can see how those fit into
the intersections the recommended number
of characters based on the best SEO
practices so as you can see 311 160
you can easily edit that and make it SEO
friendly also all your target keywords
will show up in the mapped keywords as
you can see the map keyword H is
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as we can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keywords this
section will list the keywords that have
been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so now let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking backlinks it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type bof.com
all right now we'll click on
next Su power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say We'll click on we so these were the
number of back links so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while s spy glass
collects backlink statistical data and
builds up the project okay
so these are the number of backlinks
that this site has
130,000 domains
9,622 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the
data so search engines prioritize
websites that have backlinks from
reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spamy sites
can negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on any
efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the back links already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SEO
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find the pages linking
to your site for that to gather all the
backlinks directed to your site you need
to initiate a new project in SEO spy
class that we already did and now we can
navigate to backlink
profile we click on back
links all right so the tool will examine
its index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful metrics
essential for further
analysis so as we can see backlink page
domain in link rank linked page links
back so all the backlink pages are there
it is also showing
130k backlinks all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one like
do.
in.org
g.net like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary widget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of pack links you can also see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over uh any cell in the
back links domains columns you'll see
the icon of expanding the list of URLs
to look through so as you can see these
are the backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referal
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referal traffic module this is
the referral driv modu until back rink
profile this is backr profile if you
want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click
the update traffic Button as we can see
over here update traffic
stats or this also will work no this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google Analytics for the back links in
the project after the task finishes
you'll see the results in the workspace
you can then switch between views
linking domains and backlink pages so
the linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to
summary So within this module examine a
summary you can like including key
metrics to identify both the strengths
and weaknesses of your site now we can
peek at your competitors's backlink
profile also now is the moment to access
your backlink profile in comparison to
your competitors achieving Superior SEO
performance is crucial for securing a
higher ranking than your competitors to
do that go to domain comparison first of
all as you can see
now this is our domain now here we'll
type the competitors's domain let's like
this so the sold
store all right the spelling is wrong
the sold store
is all right you click then there is
Snitch
..in all
right and one more is there let's
write
mantra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
you'll see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors's domains as we can
see
b.com the sold store snitch.com
now you can easily compare on the basis
of different metrics there are various
metrics over here and as you can see
there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
pof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics
all right now coming to the next step
which is spot the dangerous links before
progressing to actual link building
phase it's crucial to address one final
task identify and remove potential and
harmful backlinks so for that we will go
to backlink profile then the penalty
risk so backlink profile this then we'll
go to penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing z% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisable to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
post minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on a particular link as
you can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will task updated
backlink page data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy class now let's do the link
building with link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assists in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and backlink and Target
settings all right so as we can see uh

the web address select your desired
Target country so Target country over
here and the language also you can
select from this and other than this the

preferences Additionally you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is the
app will analyze the backlink profiles
of potential prospects and eliminate
those containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on
create all right so this is the layout
now so first bu default this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as

your audience keyword research is like a
guide helping you know where your

making sure your website is easy to find

the significance of research lies in its
ability to line your online presence
with the actual language your audience
uses it ensures that your content
resonates with their queries attracting
a relevant audience interest in your
offerings essentially keyword research
is a strategic tool that not only who
search engine rankings but also
establishes a connection between your
content and specific terms your audience
employs making your online presence both
accessible and meaningful all right so
this was about what is keyword research
and why is it important now let's
understand how to do a keyword research
using chat GPT for that let's go to
google.com so as you can see we have
opened Google Now all we have to do is
to write first of all we'll write
aipm AI PRM all right so AI PRM or AI
PRM for chat gbt you can type now let's
open the first link we'll click on the
first link so this is basically an
extension it is a Marketplace of prompts
they provide you prompts that you don't
have to type the whole prompt they have
pre-made prompts that you can use all
right now we can click on this add to
Chrome button over here ADD extension
right so as you can see this is a whole
new outlook of this chat gbt this is
aipm prompt extension so basically they
give you pre-made prompts as you can see
this you used SE optimized content
writer fully SE optimized article
including so there are numerous as we
can see four five80 prompts so you can
choose accordingly whichever prompt you
want and and you can also search over
here and this is topic activity sort by
you can also sort and prompts SP page
you can customize it according to
yourself so as you can see here is the
topic uh we can go to topic and we can
select so we want to basically do uh
keyword research we'll go to SEO we'll
click on SEO after that in activity we
can select this uh keywords all right
now as we can see there are numerous
prompts according to what we have
selected that you YouTube SEO keyword
generator SEO optimize your Google
business profile Etc so we can select as
per our choice so what I have figured
out which is best is this one keyword
analysis I repeat keyword analysis so as
we can see find the table of best
keywords with search volume CPC paid
difficulty Su difficulty so for those
who don't know about uh CPC so uh CPC or
cost per click is a measure in online
advert iing that represents the amount
you pay when someone clicks on your ad
it's essentially the cost of each
interaction with your advertisement
higher the CPC values often indicate
more competitive keywords or advertising
spaces and as you can see pay difficulty
is also written so pay difficulty refers
to how challenging it is to compete for
a particular keyword in paid advertising
a higher paid difficulty score means
that it might be more expensive or
compet ative to bid for that keyword in
paid search campaigns so now there is SE
difficulty so SEO difficulty basically
is a measure of how hard it is to rank
organically for a specific keyword in
search engine results a higher SE
difficulty suggests that it might be
more challenging to optimize your
content to appear higher in unpaid
organic search results for that keyword
it takes into account factors like
competition and the existing strength of
other Pages ranking for the same keyword
so these are the meanings of these
things as we can see so we have already
clicked on this now as you can see seed
keyword that you search for so let's say
uh I'm searching for cloud computing
let's
say cloud computing and let's click on
this so as we can see they are creating
all these now let's explore keywords
related to cloud computing along with
the respective search volume all right
so as we can see keyword these are
keywords that we got and these are the
search volumes so we all know what
search volume is the number of searches
and the CPC as we already discussed what
is CPC again if somebody wants to know
about it CPC or cost by click is a
measure in online advertising that
represents the amount you pay when
someone clicks on your ad so these are
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on these ads all right so paid
difficulty again it refers to how
challenging it is to compete for a
particular keyword in paid advertising
so this is paid difficulty of each of
these keywords then SEO difficulty SEO
difficulty is a measure of how hard it
is to rank organically for a specific
keyword in search engine results so
these are the uh Su difficulty so we can
select accordingly and the table index
is a mix of 100 keywords including
longtail LSI so longtail keywords are
also there as you can see we'll discuss
longtail keywords also after this so
this is how you can do keyword research
using chat GPT we'll do one or two more
demos regarding this so let's do another
example so we are going to select
keyword analysis and then we'll have to
put seed keyword remember to select SEO
first of all here we can see SEO and
then in activity you have to select
keywords because we are doing the
keyword research all right now after
selecting this keyword analysis we want
basic we basically want all these things
like search volume CPC pay difficulty s
difficulty so that we can choose the
right keywords accordingly so let's see
here we have to put the seed keyword so
let's say the seed keyword is let's say
devops all right now let's click on
this so they are giving us the keywords
a lot of keywords they usually give
let's explore the keyword analysis for
devops so as you can see high search
volume very high search volume high so
these search volumes regarding these
keywords are shown and the CPC is also
showing and paid difficulty SEO
difficulty as well so we basically want
the SEO difficulty to minimum like
minimum or like medium so we can search
or extract those keywords accordingly so
they have written this table includes a
mix of 100 relevant longtail keywords
LSI keywords and FAQ related to devops
it provides insights into search volume
CPC cost click P difficulty and SEO
difficulty to help optimize your content
and reach the target audience
effectively so through this you can
select these keywords and I think if
we'll click on continue it'll keep on
going for more keywords so as you can
see longtail keywords now it is showing
so these are LSI keywords so we will
discuss these uh terms longtail longtail
keywords LSI keywords after some time
later in this I repeat later in this
video so this is how you can simply do a
keyword research using chat GPT again
this keyword research is completely free
you have you don't have to pay a single
Buck regarding this now let's try
another method of doing a keyword
research for that all you have to do is
to go to Google and we'll
type
keywords
everywhere all right so here's the first
link let's click on this this is another
extension install for Chrome we'll click
on install for Chrome now let it open
and now we can click on add to Chrome to
just add this extension in our Chrome
browser as you can see ADD extension so
I think it is added now now all we have
to do is to pin this one all right so
now uh let's go to Chad GPT or let's
open a new
one so as you can see this is keywords
everywhere icon please continue
as you can see clarify explain rewrite
so for that to use this extensions
powers or functionality all we have to
do is to click on this template button
all right now here the thing is first of
all we'll select choose a category
similarly that we have done previously
choose a category so as you can see
copyrighting marketing SEO social media
productivity professionals we'll select
SEO because we want to do keyword
research then in subcategory we can
select keyword research and because we
want to do keyword research then there's
a template so here we can see first is
keyword strategy so you can click on
keyword strategy if you want to do
basically a strategize the keyword so
basically I'll tell you what keyword
strategy is keyword strategy involves
planning like how to use specific words
or phrases in your content to achieve
specific goals like it's about selecting
and targeting keywords that align with
your overall objectives whether it's to
boost website traffic increase
conversion or enhance your online
visibility then there is get search
intent for keywords so it help I repeat
so it itself tells what it is like
intent understanding search intent for
keywords means grasping the reason
behind someone online search it involves
figuring out what a person is looking
for when they type a particular keyword
into a search engine aligning your
content with users intent ensures that
your information meets their needs
improving the relevance of your content
then then here is related keyword
generator so a related keyword generator
is a term or phrase closely connected to
the main keyword your targeting
including related keywords in your
content help search engines understand
the content and relevance of your page
it's a way to capture a broader range of
search queries related to your main
topic then there is longtail keyword so
basically a longtail keyword is a more
specific and detailed phrase usually
consisting of three or more words while
these phrases may have lower search
volumes individually they often attract
a more targeted audience longtail
keywords can be valuable for Niche
topics are generally easier to rank for
than broader more competitive terms so
these are all these things so let's say
first of all I want to search for
related keyword generator and so first
of all as you can see category SEO
subcategory keyword research templates
select accordingly whichever you want
I've explained all these related keyword
generator I want basically when we'll
select related keyword generator this
will come up language is English we want
in English only here is the seed keyword
we'll have to write this is total
keywords how many keywords do we want we
can select accordingly basically I want
40 itself so this is a prompt template
that automatically gets created whenever
you select a particular template so
let's say if I want to select keyword
strategy so it will create itself a
different kind of prompt so if I'll
select long tail then a different kind
of prompt will be generated so this is a
self-made itself it'll create a prompt
all you have to do is to write a seed
keyword over here so let's say as I said

create a table regarding these keywords
after that they will basically list of

all right so we'll see whenever we are
doing this editing here also it is
getting edited so let's type 60 then it
will get 60 and whenever we'll type
devops this will also get edited as you
can see so this is a prompt now we'll

Google ads is a must in today's
competitive leral landscape yeah the
journey goes beyond the basics so we're

and it gives you fantastic in insights
to engage effectively with your uh your

groundwork and how and look at how you
register your business on the Google ads
platform
so let's kick off our journey by
registering your business on the Google
ads platform so simply go to Google or
the ads. goole.com log in with your
Google account and initiate a process of
connecting your business with this
extensive online audience but before
that let me quickly show you this ads.
goole.com page it gives you lots of

Google ads platform it can show you what
you can do with it how you can use it to
achieve your goals yeah you get you see
a voucher that you can get if you spend

goole.com and you get to this website
which is kind of the entrance to Google
ads and on this website you find lots of
information about the Google ads
platform you even see here on the top
right that they give you a foucher for
400 in the UK yeah where you can if you
spend 400 pounds on uh on Advertising so
you'll see they do that across the world
so you should be able to get those uh
those ad vouchers as well so it gives
you lots of suggestions on the goals
that you can achieve the power of Google
advertising for your business and it
gives you some case studies as well and
what I really like about the Google ads
program that you can actually get freeof
charge personalized support yep and by
scheduling a meet meeting with a Google
ads expert and I would highly um sort of
uh recommend you use that surface
because they can really help you with
setting up your first Google ads
campaign so let's go into this system we
can click Start now yeah or you can sign
in if you have an existing account so if
you click Start now it'll probably
immediately log in to my existing
account but what it will do it will
actually give you an overview of the
Google ads accounts that you already
have yeah or can create a new Google ads
account so this step forms the backbone
for your online identity and it gets you
with an an seamless integration between
your business and the Google ads um
environment as it were so very practical
steps to get you started on the Google
ads platform effectively so let's go on
to create a new Google ads account
so create a new
account and here it goes into the
process of creating a new Google ads
account so you need to add business
information you can then go straight
into creating your ads and set up your
budget now you can case go straight into
your first campaign and in the process
you will actually fill in your data to
sign up but what I advise you do here is
to skip the campaign creation that
you're not ready and then you will go in
a proper setup for your Google
ads so there's different elements that
you can do here so you give your billing
country you give your time zone your
curency if you want personalized
campaign guidance I would certainly
advise you take that as I mentioned
earlier yeah you fill that data in and
then you click submit
and then yes to continue I'll I'll
select no for now so click submit and
then you're basically all done and then
uh The Next Step what's going to happen
is actually you need to go through the
verification process now a few more
steps here the details are very
important if you go through the entire
process like your business name your
physical location your contact
information
it's not about getting the data but it's
about crafting your digital presence
yeah so it goes beyond checkboxes make
sure that you add every step yeah that
you fill in every step in the
process okay so the next step is that
you will go through the verification
process when you've done that process it
is very important that you are going to
f verify your account so how do you
verify your account you go back to your
main Google ads dashboard and I will
explain this dashboard a little later
and you click here on the billing and
here you see Advertiser
verification yes so here is where you go
into
verification
to make sure that Google recognizes your
account and understand that you are the
actual business owner of this account so
that gives you an extra level of
security and integrity on your Google
ads account and once you verify it yes
so B Google has then reviewed your
business details and you can ensure your
accuracy but it can also give you a good
foundation for this for your advertising
experience so it's more than Security
checks it's about making sure that your
data is correct and you have a solid
basis to start your journey in the
Google
advertising entering the ads

to look at the structure of your Google

Google ads campaign is to in it's
threefold there is the campaign level
there is the ad group and within the ad
group sits the um s the ads and the ads
they inherit the setting of the ad group
and the ad group they inherit the
setting of The campaigns on campaign
level you talk about the objectives of
your campaign you look at the um the the
bidding strategy that you have for your
campaign in the the price that you the
budget that you want to assign in the ad
groups you can look at your keywords and
you can specify your ads as well so very
important that you think think about
that structure and that will really help
you into organizing your campaign in a
structured
manner okay having gone through this
dashboard now let's jump into the Google
ads Basics and create a campaign and
picking the right keywords so to create
a campaign you just go to the campaign
step and you click here the plus to
start or I can click here on the
campaign step I'm getting an overview of
my
campaigns and um but in this case I just
click on the campaign tab on the plus
button and that will take me to the sort
of the starting screen of my um Google
ads setup so I can decide my campaign
goal I can set a budget and I can pick a
bidding strategy so this is the
beginning of your ad game here you state
what you want do you want more clicks do
you want leads do you want brand
awareness how much do you want to spend
what is your bidding strategy do you
want to set it or do you want Google to
handle it yeah do you want more clicks
more
conversions and when you start this
process you're on the way to create your
first ads plan so here you
see the
different types of campaign objectives
that you can select and each objective
will kind of pre-select the digital
narrative within Google ads so they
serve different purposes whether it is
driving sales or driving website traffic
um or whether it is capturing leads
whether it is promoting your app app
whether it is a local store visit
whether it is sales or a product and
brand consideration or you can also
decide to create a campaign without
selecting any of these and that is for
the more experienced people who can who
know exactly what to specify but if you
click one of these then Google will
automatically prepopulate kind of the
settings for you in the uh in the Google
ads screens that will follow so aligning
these types with your goals is very
important and they ensure that you get a
very impactful digital marketing
approach to your customers so let's
click on one of them yes so let's click
for instance on the uh we want website
traffic so here you see what type of
conver versions that you want yes so
that could be page views that could
submit lead forms it could subscribe so
you can specify these conversions and
you just click here you click on
continue and here you select the
campaign sort of type that you want to
select want to to to run do you want a
search campaign do you want a display
campaign do you want Google to sort of
Select it for you yeah do you want a
shopping campaign a video campaign
campaign or do you want a demand gen
where you run ads on Youtube Gmail and
various other channels so let's say
we're going to create a um let's start
with a search campaign yeah so you put
in your website your website address
which in my case would be this website
you're going to give your campaign a
name and you click continue I'm going to
start a new campaign and here it's very
important important that you specify the
bidding strategy that you set as you
know Google ADS works with an auction
system you put in a bid for when what
you will pay uh when people click on
your ad and then Google in the auction
when people have actually put in one of
your keywords Google will then use
different methods for making sure that
the um the the best bit in combination
of various other factors wins as it were
and shows up at the top of the uh the
advertising listings on Google ads now
the the highest bidder doesn't
necessarily be at automatically be at
the number one spot there is also a
quality score of your ad that is
impacting whether or not you would show
at the top so your Financial uh core
rest on the budget and the bidding
strategy so determine your daily budget
yeah align it with your advertising
objectives and uh it's very
important how you want to set this do
you want to run it for conversions do
you want to run it for clicks yep so you
can set a maximum cost per click or you
can let Google set that automatically
for you yep and when you're happy with
how you set it you click next and then
you specify where you want to show your
ads yep so here you see you can specify
the for the Google search campaign you
can specify the search Network you can
also show search ads on the Display
Network you can look at the network the
locations the languages you can spe
specify specific audiences or you can
also do some keyword matching for your
search campaigns there's various
location options they work very powerful
yeah so you can spe specify by language
you can select audience segments so for
instance I would just do an
advertisement on a specific
sector so I can say give me just people
that are interested in travel
and they will then be added to uh they
will then be targeted with your your
ads yep and then here you're going to
specify your uh the type of keyword
match that you want
so uh so that is very important and as
you can see in the Google search ads the
keywords are very important but I'll
come back to that in a minute what I
first want to do is go through the more
settings where you will sort of open up
additional functionality that will make
you use um give you a more advanced use
of the Google ads like how do you want
to rotate your ads is there a start and
an end date for your campaign do you
have a specific ad schedule do you have
campaign URL options that is where you
want to um to track your Campa aigns or
Are there specific brand restrictions
that you do not want to associate with
your ads and the placement of your ads
so particularly on the ad schedule my
recommendation would be to select all
day when you start your ads let Google
decide what is the best timings for your
ads that gives the best response what
you will see when you set up your ads
that you set up multiple ads and Google
will mix and match the ads and will
select the best combination of the ads
that will give you the best performance
and will also select the best timings so
the first couple of days that your
advertising campaign is running Google
will be in what we say learning mode and
it will do all the tests it will run the
various options of your ads and it will
sort of slowly calibrate your ad
campaign to the best format the best
settings and the best
structure so this type of
control yeah is not about just Reaching
Your Right audience but it also does it
at the most opportune moments the best
times so it maximizes the effectiveness
of your uh your ads so very important
part of this is your keywords as I just
mentioned so for search campaigns here
is where you can specify your keywords
so what you can do you can get
suggestions from Google by entering your
website address and then Google will and
will sort of select the best keywords
for you and you can use those for your
search ads which means that every time
somebody types in any of these keywords
your ad will show to the to those people
depending on your bidding strategy or
you can add your own keywords based on
your keyword research and the tool that
I showed you earlier the Google Keyword
Planner is a fantastic tool that can
help you in building those um those
those keyword lists for you now I'm not
going to go into the details here of
keyword uh research that may be the
topic for a future uh campaign so it's
very very important that you align your
keywords with your business and that the
keywords resonate with your target
audience and make sure that you use the
key Google Keyword Planner to find the
right keywords or any other tools that
uh that are available in the market the
keyword is fundamental for your search
campaign it's not about what you say in
your ad but it is also how do those key
key words resonate with your
audience good that concludes the basic
setup of your ads on a campaign level
and on an ad group
level we're now going to look at our
next demo where we're going to look at
targeting and also where we're going to
look at how to create an ad
so as we shift Focus the spotlight turns
now to defining and refining your target
audience and particularly this will be
important when you set up a display
campaign and when you go into the
campaign settings for the display and
you follow the menu down here you get to
the targeting option and that is the
first place where you can specify your
the which people you target with your
display ads so this is where you can
identify demographics interests and
behaviors that resonate with your brand
so this ensures if you set that that
your ads are displayed to those people
that are most likely to engage with your
Brands so navigating through these
audience setting is not about casting a
wiet it is about Precision about
reaching the right people at the right
time so let's click on the targeting and
you see here that you hone in on various
areas you can hone in on audience
segments demographics keywords topics
and placement and here while you're
going through these targeting options
you can keep track of your um estimated
number of Impressions and your estimated
performance for your ads so exploring
this array of audio targeting options
audience targeting options is about
tailoring your message to different
personalities different audiences so
look at audience
segments that is where you can select
audiences who are particularly
interested in travel or lifestyle and
hobbies and there is literally hundreds
of segments that people can um can
select yeah you can search for any
segment you can let's say here let's do
um train
enthusiasts just taking a random topic
yeah let's see what comes up and here is
train
information train hobby traveling by
train um yeah so everything to do with
trains that you can pick here you can
even probably take miniature trains so
you can Target those people very
specifically that ensures that your ad
is not visible but also relevant to
specific segments of your target
audience so that is through the audience
segments and again if you pick one so
say um train information then here you
see how your weekly estimates are um are
changing yeah so you can go by selecting
you put them in your Target and then you
see how your um advertising campaign is
likely to perform so let's stay away
from the train let's go to um Adventure
travel for instance and now you get all
those people that are interested in
adventure
vacations activity
holidays Wildlife trips et Etc and again
you see how your performance is changing
so that is the audience segments we then
going go to the next level that is
demographics we're targeting male let's
say um
between 25 and 44 years with a slightly
higher higher household income let's say
the top um 21 so we're going for the the
top
tier and again your estimates are being
adjusted and then you can go to the next
one you can add targeting so you can
Target keywords so this is for instance
I am targeting those people that have a
specific interest in Kilimanjaro for
instance and um key Lian jaro yep and I
can add that as a keyword if I want and
Morocco and you see how my weekly
estimates are becoming more and more
specific I can add keyword ideas through
from my website as well so let's say
that is done and then we can go to the
the
final uh targeting which was by topics
yeah or you can even Target by
placements so if we want ADV Venture
magazines yeah so Adventure magazines
you can then select those magazines or
those online Publications where your ads
will show so you can ask by default ask
Google to select this for you but if
you're very experienced in your industry
you know specific magazines where you
want to place your ad then very likely
you will find them in the list here it
takes a little while to go through this
list of thousands if not hundreds of
thousands of online Publications but
then you can really Target very specific
by magazine while it is doing this let's
go to the optimized targeting which is
on which means Google will actually help
you get more viewable Impressions yeah
find people beyond your targeting
signals so that is what Google will help
you to fine tune your um uh you're
targeting and um give you even better
results for your campaign yes so we
targeted the adventure channels
Adventure magazine so here are 253
websites there are YouTube channels that
you can Target YouTube videos apps and
app categories where your ad can show so
this is a very good section where you
can make your ads reach the right people
so that is one area where you can
feature um where you can be very
specific in the targeting of your ad
that is within the display campaign
settings you can also Target People
based on
behavior and one very important
behavior is um what they have done on
your website in the past
yeah and that is what we're going to
look at next as part of this audience
segmentation and audience targeting
we're going to look at how can I
leverage activities from people behavior
of people for instance visiting my
website or buying a product how can I
how can I capitalize on those um on
those people and maybe put them in a sep
seate audience that I can then Target
with my ads this is what we call
retargeting and I can Target people with
an ad once they vised my website for a
particular product P page for instance
and I'm sure you've experienced that
yourself that you were visiting an ad
and that you or that you were visiting a
product on a website and then you put a
product in the basket but you decide not
to buy that product and then the next
time you you go on Facebook or on
YouTube you actually see a product for
that ad so that is the next section that
we will be looking
at a new feature in Google ads are
conversion goals conversion goals help
you organize your conversion actions so
that you can more move more easily
towards achieving your advertising
objectives so actions that you want your
customers to take or conversion actions
are grouped together based on related
categories to form these conversion
goals so how do you get there you go
here to goals you click on
conversions and here you have a summary
of your conversion goals for example the
purchase conversion or the Subscribe
conversion goal would automatically
contain all conversion actions from
people to subscribe to a particular form
and this simplifies your conversion
management and it improves your campaign
performance so very powerful new aspect
within Google ads to manage your
conversions in one central place so how
do you set up a conversion you set it up
here in the new conversion
action so you can set up a conversion
action for your website for your apps or
for phone calls or you can import data
from Google or from Salesforce or other
um tools but the most important one
again is getting conversion tracking set
up for your website so when you click on
that you can then put in your website
domain you can click
scan and it will then scan the website
if it's already set up to measure
conversions which basically means have
you already setup conversion tags on
your
website so Google ads can track those
web pages so you can it has been set up
so you can actually create specific
conversion actions you can do that from
website events you can also create
conversion actions manually by using
specific code so if you use transaction
specific values transaction ideas yeah
so then you can use this option but the
easiest one is to use the create
conversion action from website event so
you can actually accept suggestion for
setting up a conversion goal you can
also add a conversion goal so you can
select a category for
instance um a subscribe the event type
could be a page load on this website and
then then you just click
add the URL is required for that would
be the about us yeah and then I click
add and then the the code has been the
conversion goal has been created I click
save and
continue and then it sets up this
conversion
action where of course I need to make
sure I set it up properly with a Google
tag through Google tag manager now this
section is not about teaching you how to
use Google tech manager we have a
separate video for that but I just want
to make you aware of the process of how
to do that you can also email the
instructions to your Web Master yep so
let's say if we want to email the
instruction then we'll just put in the
email address and then it's uh sent or
you can also set it up yourself and then
what you do is you get a piece of
code where you that you basically need
to copy and that you need to paste in
the Google tag manager so you can use
the Google tag manager that's where you
use this particular piece of code you
can also install manually and here is
the piece of code that you need to
install on every page of the website so
then Google can see that that is a tag
for those specifical specific conversion
goals that um Google that can then start
tracking good you can test the
installation as well but I'll just want
to make you aware where you go to set
that
up okay so those are the conversion
goals in
Google the last topic of this
demo the last topic of this demo is ADD
placements and the networks the ad
networks and the actual creation of ads
this is very important it is like
choosing the stage for your performance
and exploring the various options
including the Google search Network the
Display Network and YouTube is vital to
align your uh your ads with your
advertising of network your advertising
objectives so the different
add options that you have they start
with the Google search Network the
Google search Network places your ads in
search engine results that gives you
visibility for your ads when users
actively search for related content the
next area is the Display Network that
showcases your ad across a multitude of
websites and apps thereby having a big
reach of your uh your ads YouTube as a
video platform or offers a very
extensive advertising platform with lots
of advertising opportunities and
different um different versions of ads
and tailoring your approach to each
platform will amplify the effectiveness
of your ad strategy to make sure that
you get maximum impact on your ads now
let's go to the fun part of Google ads
and that is the actual creation of your
ads so we'll have add to over to the ads
we go to the campaigns click a campaign
here is the campaign we're going to
first create a search ads which is let's
say for website
traffic we go to continue and here is
the search ad that we're going to create
We'll add our
website and we'll click
continue and we'll start a new campaign
and where we're going to is the keywords
and the ads so we have already set up
the keywords we're going now straight to
the actual ads and this is a very
important section where you are able to
set up your Google search ads they are
based on um
the a combination of headlines up to 15
and
descriptions up to
four and a number of extensions like
sight links or call outs and different
other
extensions okay you can set that all up
and then Google will mix and m match
those different elements of your ads to
come up with the ad with the best
performance and what's really nice here
is they show you a pre review of what
the ad will look like with the different
headlines and the different
descriptions and here you see your
campaign optimization score with the
weekly estimates of how many conversions
and how many what your weekly cost is
here you see your ad strength and here
you see at the moment it is poor because
I need to make the description more more
unique so you can get ideas and you'll
see that this area will become more and
more advanced and more and more driven
by artificial intelligence in the future
yeah to make sure that you get the best
ads possible for your
market so again this is a short demo I'm
not going to go into every little detail
yeah but this is where you create your
search ads so that is the first
area the second area where you create
your ads is of course for the display
campaigns so if I go back to Google
ads and I am going to create a new
campaign but now I'm going to create a
brand awareness campaign for display ads
again here I say
russia.com I click continue I'm going to
go start
new and here I can of course we've been
through all these settings remember the
campaign settings the budget and the
bidding and the targeting and here we go
to the
ads and here you can
specify the URL your business name you
can add up to 15 images so where you
upload an image let's say we're going to
use the image of this room and you see
here in different formats and we're
going to add this images as well so
we're going to click
save and then you can add a text you
could even add a video you can add a
headline and here you will see what the
ad will looks look
like now make sure that you have
switched off your ad blocker if you have
set up an ad blocker and because when
you have an ad blocker then this the the
the preview of the ad will not show so I
need to add the final URL I need to add
the https for
this yep so here is the final URL with
the business name and now in a bit the
ad should show up we should have the
business name two images One headline so
we'll add um welcome to riat
Russia and a
description book
your
adventure holiday
now okay and then here you see how the
ad would look
like very simple very straightforward
but it is all about of course the
quality of the images the headlines that
you're using the description that you're
using but at least this gives you an
idea of what an ad looks like and how
you would create that within the display
um ad
category so here is a few
tips yes so uh add copy is very
important yeah relevant visuals and
formulate clear call to actions they are
the fundamental elements of your in of
your ads compelling ad copy is about
Clarity and enticement and about having
a concise message and be different so
the integration of the relevant visuals
that enhances the overall appeal now

desired next steps and that will drive
conversions so keep that in mind and

advertising behaviors remember if you
like this video click the like button
below and subscribe to our um our
Network so you get access to other
videos that we will be publishing in the
near future what social media marketing
actually means what is it yeah and we
got to put this in the context of the
definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the basic concept has not
changed if you look at the definition of
marketing it's the activity of creating
communicating delivering and exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your
customers so two very important aspects
here there is value and there is
customer and that is what we capture in
the marketing concept you put the
customer at the core of what you do yeah
because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
marketing in that context then the
second part of the social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content they
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the um the
currency of social media if you have
really good content that you can share
on the internet yeah using various
multip multiple social media channels
like Facebook like YouTube or like video
or like Instagram or blogging you name
it
yeah people will engage with your
content and then when people start
engaging with your content they may come
back for more content that you supply
and they will then become part of your
community so Community is a very
important aspect of your social media
definition with really good content you
can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running
campaigns yeah and a campaign makes it
relevant for
businesses because when you run a
campaign you have a goal for your
campaign you have an objective you have
a star date you have an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting cont
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that with a
customer at in the core of what you
do yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media
marketing is very basic it says the use
of social media to develop a company's
brand increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most important aspect
here is that you need to have an outcome
you need to have a result which is
customer
related and that is where the sales
element comes in you do this to get the
customer to do something and in the end
that is buying your product or your
service
yeah so social media marketing is not
the
Tactical combination of your social
media networks yeah to um to reach as
many people there needs to be a goal to
it and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your your social media marketing so
keep that in mind everything you do with
your social media marketing in the end
comes down to reaching your goals or
achieving your objectives of developing
your company's brand increasing website
traffic or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is
data is
intelligence is
knowledge in the early days of marketing
the biggest problem has always been how
to measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and they write about me
in a new newpaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I Ran So in the early pre-
interet days yeah we the only way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through loyalty card or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to relate that to
your marketing then the internet emerged
and all of a sudden I could track
traffic to my
website yeah I could see how many people
visit my website are these people that
visit my website for the first time are
they returning visitors what are the
most popular pages that they see how
long do they stay on my website and are
they actually buying my product
yeah so that was a major advancement of
marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure
engagement how many people are having
conversations with us I could even
measure sentiments are people positive
about my brand are they negative about
my Brands I could track the
effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the
effectiveness of my advertising
campaigns that I ran online so today's
reality is that we can measure
everything we can measure clicks we can
measure transactions we can measure
engagements we can measure return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people May respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running so it's a very
important aspect of your digital uh your
social media
marketing so as I mentioned earlier
social media is a completely new way for
businesses to engage with their
customers yeah you can no longer go
without it it's a new channel to Market
it is a new channel for engagement with
your customers it is a new channel to
learn it's a new channel to listen to
find out what's happening in the market
so it's now it's it's it's there in
every aspect of your business and not
only for the marketing department it's
there for the sales department it's
there for Logistics it's there for the
customer service department it's there
for the HR department using social media
for your recruitment is a very important
element of social media marketing yes so
keep that in mind that social media
marketing is no not a fat it is there
and it's there to stay and it touches
every aspect of your
business now to summarize this there are
three areas where social media has
changed the way businesses operate first
of all there is the connection social
media is a new way to connect with your
stakeholders yeah and stakeholders in
this case can be customers they can be
prospects influencers your own employees
using social media for
internal and not only on a local scale
this happens nowadays on a global scale
the internet allows you to sell locally
to a global audience if you want to yeah
so you can you
can cover the world you can talk Market
specific audiences wherever they are so
the connection aspect the targeting
aspect yeah the the market where you
want to sell your product is opened up
through social media and that is a big
benefit for business the second area
where social media has changed
businesses fundamentally is in the
interaction site it's not just about
connec ING with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their terms on
their preferred platform and remember in
social media land the customer is in the
driving seat if you're not interacting
with them on their terms you're going to
miss the train it's not about you don't
liking Facebook or
LinkedIn yeah as as long as your
customers are on Facebook you better be
on Facebook otherwise you're going to
miss the
boat yeah because if you don't interact
with them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
with
them yep so it's the connection aspect
it's the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this yeah what we talked about
can be done and you can track every
aspect of your social media marketing at
a customer level and it gives you the
key performance indicators like
conversion ratios sales ratios customer
satisfaction ratios and ultimately
return on
investment and there are tools nowaday
that let you manage and track all these
areas in one conglomerated system yeah
HubSpot is for instance a tool that you
can use for that and they integrate all
your marketing and customer data and
campaigns in one system that um you can
use for
that all right so without further Ado
let's start with the first strategy
which is Select platform before diving
into the diverse landscape of social
media it's crucial to carefully consider
your business schools target audience
and the content strategy choosing the
right social media platforms can
significantly impact your Brand's online
presence and overall success Begin by
utilizing single platform and as you
gain Proficiency in managing campaigns
gradually expand to incorporate
additional
platforms so first we can say Facebook
as the most popular social media
platform Facebook remains a smart choice
for almost any business it allows you to
boost brand awareness gain followers
generate leads and engage with their
audience the next we have is Instagram
so Instagram known for its visual appeal
Instagram is excellent for showcasing
products lifestyle content and behind
the scenes glimpses it's particularly
effective for businesses in Fashion
Beauty travel and lifestyle all right
then there is Twitter so with its
realtime updates and concise format
Twitter is ideal for quick interactions
news sharing and customer service then
next is LinkedIn so if you are in the
B2B space LinkedIn is essential it's a
professional networking platform form
where you can connect with industry
peers share through leadership content
and build business relationships so it's
a very effective app all right now next
is YouTube video content continues to
dominate and YouTube is the go-to
platform for sharing video tutorials
product demos and brand storytelling so
it is again one of the most important
tool all right now coming to the next
one which is Tik Tok especially popular
among younger audiences Tik Tok offers
short form video content and creative
challenges so once you have selected
your platform then you can proceed to
knowing your audience so understanding
your audience involves grasping what you
are trying to connect with and tailoring
your content accordingly for instance if
your target audience is techy
individuals in coorporate content
related to the latest gadgets and Tech
Trends would be relevant on the other
hand if you're reaching out to the
fitness Enthusiast content on workout
healthy recipes and lifestyle tips would
resonate by recognizing these details
you can effectively engage with diverse
groups it's like to speaking the
language of your audience whether it's
through fashion or environmental
concerns or entertainment preferences
fostering a stronger connection all
right now this was about knowing your
audience all right now next we have is

discuss the social media media marketing
road map the first thing is to identify
a marketing problem so guys identifying
Market problem is a foundational step in
devising an effective social media
marketing strategy it involves a
comprehensive evaluation of various
aspects that may hinder your business
growth addressing these issues
strategically can pave the way for
successful social media campaigns
firstly consider the challenge of
inadequate brand awareness and publicity
if your target audience is not familiar
with your brand it's crucial to focus
efforts on increasingly visibility
through engaging content and targeted
campaigns next is the declining sales
from traditional Channel signals that
need shift in marketing approach Embrace
social media platforms to reach a wider
audience and explore new avenues for
sales if I talk about the third one a
decline in fresh leads also demands a
reassessment of lead generation
strategies so that you have to utilize
social media expansive reach to attract
and convert potential customers if
Rising operating costs are affecting
profitability social media can offer
cost-effective Marketing Solutions
leveraging these platforms can optimize
resource allocation and enhance overall
efficiency customers defection due to
poor service also highlights the
importance of using social media as a
customer service tool address concerns
promptly and showcase positive
experiences to build loyalty lastly if
your content isn't generating desired
engagement refine your strategy analyze
audience preferences experiment with
content formats and encourage
interaction to increase shares and
engagement by pinpointing these
challenges you can tailor your social
media efforts to address specific needs
ensuring a more targeted and impactful
marketing
strategy now let us move on to our next
one which is setting up social media
marketing objectives or goals in the
realm of social media marketing setting
clear goals defining objectives and
establishing measurable metrics are
crucial components of a strategic
approach let's delve into each aspect
the first one that is coming into my
mind is goals goals are Broad and
overachieving statements that articulate
when you aim to achieve through your
social media efforts for example
increasing brand awareness online this
go provides a general direction
indicating a desire to enhance the
visibility and recognition of your brand
within the online space it sets the tone
for your social media strategy but lacks
the specificity needed for direct
measurement now let us move on to the
next one which is objectives objectives
are specific measurable and time bound
Milestone desire to achieve a broader
goal for example increase the number of
new fans on social media platforms by
20% Within the next quarter or boast
post engagement by 15% over the next 6
months or achieve a 25% growth in the
web traffic from social media channels
in the next year these were the certain
examples which showcases what are your
objectives objectives break down the
broader goal into actionable and
measurable components they provide a
road map for achieving the over
achieving goal of increase brand
awareness offering clear targets and
timelines the next and the most
important one is metrics metrics are
quantifiable parameters used to measure
the performance and success of your
social media efforts for example the
number of new fans or followers what is
the post engagement rate or growth
percentage in the web traffic metrics
are specific data points that help
assess progress towards objectives they
provide tangible numerical evidence of a
social media performance for the goal of
increasing brand awareness the choosen
should align with the defined objectives
such as tracking the increase in
followers engagement rates and website
traffic originating from social
platforms by aligning goals objectives
and metrics businesses create a
structured framework that not only
guides their social media activities but
also enables a systematic evaluation of
success or areas that may need
adjustment this disciplined approach
enhances the effectiveness of social
media marketing efforts and contributes
to the overall success of the digital
strategy now let us move on to our next
one which is very very important that is
conducting social media audit and
Analysis once you have established your
social media marketing destination it's
imperative to assess your current
position again to determine your
standing point before embarking on a
journey this evaluation process often is
concurrent with setting objectives is
analogous to recognizing that attempting
to reach the moon is futile if your
flying machine can even take off so what
are the areas where you can perform
audit and
Analysis so guys let us discuss each one
of them one by one the first one is
evaluating your current social media
presence assess the strength weaknesses
opportunities and threats which is SWAT
of your existing social media engagement
understand the current state of your
online presence to identify areas for
improvement
next is analyzing competitor strategies
investigate social media tactics and
performance of your competitors identify
potential gaps or weaknesses in their
approach so that you can capitalize on
the third one is understanding your
audience and the journeys study your
customers exploring demographics
psychographics online behaviors and
historical preferences map out customer
Journeys through stages like awareness
interest consideration purchase
retention and and advocacy an essential
aspect of this phase involves keyword
research a critical exercise to discern
what your customers are actively
searching for utilize tools like Google
AdWords Keyword Planner which
facilitates this process aiding in
identifying the key terms and phrases
that align with your audience interests
and online Behavior this is a
comprehensive evaluation which not only
informs your social media strategy but
also positions you to leverage
opportunities and add weaknesses
effectively the next one is develop a
social Brand Story like every other
facet of online promotion the initiation
of social media marketing commences with
narrating your brand stale in the
digital era social branding involves
crafting a unique value proposition and

on the business Suite okay so let's get
going The Meta business Suite used to be
known as the Facebook business manager
in fact Facebook business manager is
still available um and I'll come back to
that in a minute the differences between
the meta business suite and the meta
business manager but as launched in 2014
team it now is a all encompassing tool
for advertisers marketers business
owners um agencies to manage the

I'm going to walk you through setting up
your business account and then we're

access to your advertising your Pages
your teams how you can post Etc so if
you go on Facebook there are two places
there is the Facebook business manager
and there is the meta business suite and
that is a bit confusing yeah so let's
talk about the difference between the
two so the Facebook business manager and
The Meta business suite are two
different applications and they serve
different purposes
yeah though the Facebook business
manager is designed for businesses that
rely on Facebook for their marketing and
advertising efforts while the meta
business Suite is designed for
businesses that want to manage their
total online presence yeah the meta
business manager is free and it helps
you manage your Facebook page the
advertising and all your assets in one
place once you have a Facebook P bu
business page it is essential to have
met a business B manager as further
development of your Facebook and your
Instagram so the business manager allows
you to create and track your ad
campaigns that you are managing it helps
you access and control billing settings
and create custom audiences for your ads
and you have the the option to allocate
specific tasks across your team but it's
very much focused on um on Facebook and
the core functionality of managing your
Facebook page but the business um also
by the way the business manager gives
you the ability to manage your metap
pixels or your Facebook pixels that you
can use for retargeting so everything
you want to do with your Facebook page
you can do within the Facebook business
manager but Facebook learned or meta
learned that people wanted more people
wanted to manage their Instagram do
their posting do their content calendar
so they needed more fun functionality
and that's where Facebook came out with
the meta business Suite that is a
centralized area to manage your Facebook
your Instagram your messaging in one
place so you can save time to manage
your business and to manage your
connections and develop relationships
with more people so cross functionality
is one of the business suite's most
appealing features so the ability to VI
all your social activities at a glance
in One dashboard manage multiple
Facebook inboxes and making your
Community Management very simple to do
you can also create and schedule posts
and stories on both Facebook and
Instagram through the meta business uh
the business suite and it's also a great
tool for managing and tracking your page
insights and managing tracking trends
that can help you better understand your
audiences so in summary meta business
Suite is an application that should be
used if you are looking for an easier
way to post engage with your communities
across Facebook and your Instagram
business accounts where the meta
business manager is a site to be used if

where you can specify the settings in
using your meta business

dig in there and let's go into a bit
more details there's dedicated areas for
ad iing and for your

tools I show that there is dedicated
areas for advertising on an ad level or
even on an ad manager level yeah and
it's very important that you understand
how you work with this so click on these
buttons explore them it's where the
advertising magic happens so it gives
you kind of the backpass entrance to all
your ads when you want to check on your
ads want to tweak them or see how
they're performing this is the place
where you want to go so it is a must to
understand how to use these ads yeah and
and how to use the ads manager we'll go
later this is a series of three videos
in the third video we're going to get
more details on accessing the ads
manager and the ads yeah there's also
the section on the pages these are like
the shop window of Facebook and
Instagram presents manage them well yeah
is very important if you go to the page
settings yeah so it allows you to set

it sets the Privacy for your pages it
sets the cations you can link accounts
videos branded content lots of elements
that you can set here for your pages so
go through that make sure that you
understand how to manage this
okay so it opened a new window so I can
just close that window to go back to my
business manager to my business Suite I
have to say Okay so most important thing
here this dashboard gives you access to
all the functionality of your meta
business suite and a very important
button to close this section with is on
the settings and in the settings you can
set up your language billing ad account
settings and you may have seen this
earlier when we've set up the um the
account in the business manager yeah so
if you want to revisit that if you want
to make changes then you can do that
here in the settings
area now that you understand the
dashboard let's dig a bit deeper into a
very important section in the metab
business suets which are your meta
insights that is not just another tool
it is the data Hub of your Facebook and
Instagram presence where you can get
information about your audience about
how your pages are doing and whether
your advertising is achieving its
objectives it gives you kind of a cheat
cheet for making decisions you want to
know about who your audience is you want
to know where they are in insides gives
you the data you're in curious about
your face Facebook page performance
check it out on the inside in on the
insid you want to know how your ads are
performing meta insights will give you
the detail so this is basically where
you go to become a strategic
thinker armed with real time information
about your Facebook and your Instagram
presence so let's have a look at this
let's go to the insights
yeah so heading over to the meta page so
let's go to the old
tools yep and there's two different ways
of going there you can access that
through your page or you can access it
here through your
insights and this is where you're going
to get a gold mine of
information about your presence on
Facebook yes so and it sorts it neatly
into sections like page views followers
engagement and um your content you want
to know how many views you got here you
can see how many you got you want to
know how your ads are running here you
can see how they are doing you want to
know your audience you want to know more
about your followers about your
Instagram followers here is where you
can find all that information and all
that knowledge now these aren't not just
numbers on the screen these numbers they
tell you what is happening and they can
help you refining your Facebook strategy
it helps you to tweak your Instagram and
your Facebook strategy and it can helps
you in checking how your audience is
responding yeah it is really good
information so take for instance
information about your audience yeah it
gives you the followers it gives you on
Facebook and Instagram you it also gives
you detail about age and gender of your
followers it gives them where are they
coming
from yeah the top cities or the top
countries so you can Benchmark this data
with
competitors yeah you can also look at
your content so the content is a very
important one this is probably in my
opinion one of the most important TAPS
in the uh meta insights section so this
dissects your posts and it shows you how
each of your post is
doing when it comes to number of people
reached number of people that have seen
the post number of people that have seen
the video you can watch uh split it by
post and by stories you can spit it by
let's just do photo posts no photo post
mostly we we video posts yep and you can
specify the columns here as well so I
want to see the type of
post yeah so I can then apply and it
gives you lots of information here you
see on the videos how many minutes
people viewed the post how many
Impressions that you got the reach of
the post and the most important one is
the engagement on the post and that is
this button is the reactions likes
comments and share this is a critical
column in your Facebook in uh your
Facebook insights yeah if I order this
from top
down yeah so here then I see those posts
with the highest and engagement over the
last 28 days and this is where you can
learn what posts work and what posts do
not work and that is golden information
because if you know this post works then
why not make more of those posts so
people can um so you can get in similar
engagement level and overall it can help
you in driving your engagement levels
so very useful reports you can see what
posts are stealing the shows what posts
need a bit of
tweaking and it can help you in making
sure that you hit the right content with
the right the right people with the
right content so think about this tab
the content tab as checking what posts
work and what though posts don't work
and you can use that to optimize your
posts for um in the future so there's a
lot more in here you can get audience
information here as well and we'll talk
about that in a um in a later demo on
how to develop audiences in your
Facebook your your meta
insights right let's move on let's go to
the fourth and final demo of this video
which is about collaboration and Team
Management let's go back to the meta
business Suite in this demo we'll dive
into the world of collaboration and Team
Management within your meta business
Suite So Meta business Suite is not just
an act for you it's not a solo act it is
about getting your whole marketing team
on Facebook on the meta business Suite
yep and that can help you in kind of
supercharging your uh your management of
your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's break down how you can add team
members because teamwork is like the
secret source that can really make your
better meta business Suite come to life
so it is very useful to get your team
online so it helps you keep people in
the loop you can assign specific
roles yeah so everybody knows what
they're doing what they're supposed to
be doing when they get on the on the
meta business Suite and very important
even if your page is across or if your
team is across multiple locations you
can still work as a team in managing
your um your Facebook and your Instagram
so let's go down to the basics the first
of this is building your team so what
you're going to do you're going to move
to the business settings and here you
see
people yeah already you here see an
overview of the people that
are available on this business
account that can use and there's
currently one that is me and I've done
another one which is me on another email
and the invite has been sent but I
haven't accepted it but let's go and
click an invite let's first look here on
the people button that is basically that
leads you to this scream if I click here
on invite
people you can then go through a number
of
steps yeah so in this section you can
select
people once you've select those people
you can assign their access you can
assign business assets to those people
you can review the invitation and then
you can send it out so let's go through
this process so we're going to enter the
email again we're going to do just
myself
[Music]
uh yep and I can get temporary access or
for the advanced option I can remove but
I'm just doing it yeah so this is
actually quite useful temporary access
for instance if you want like an agency
you want them to have a quick look at
your Facebook insights for instance you
can just give them temporary access for
the day and then you want to switch it
off yeah on uh that particular uh that
particular time frame we're not going to
do that I'm just going to click
next and then here you can specify the
access that you want to give to this
person yeah so you can give the person
partial access or you can give the
person full control so partial access is
the K they can only work on the tasks
and the business assets assigned to them
basic access yeah which was formerly the
employee role is the default access that
everyone gets when they are added okay
so that is what you can set you can
integrate with um with apps and
different in Integrations like the
Facebook pixel that people can view them
and manage them I'm not going to do this
in this case or you can give somebody
full control which is like an admin role
yeah so that would be the business admin
role and they can manage everything
including settings people tools business
asset they can delete a business account
yeah so does not include the advanced
options so you need to be careful with
this but once you give somebody full
control yep then um they are basically
an admin for that so click shared then
there you can also look at the financial
information like transactions invoices
account spend and payment method so that
could be for your finance manager for
instance so I am just going to be full
control yeah so I'm happy with that no
no let's not do this I am actually none
I'm just going to be a basic control and
I click next I can then assign business
assets so there is the Facebook page
there is the ad account I can assign
products I can assign the Instagram
account the Commerce account I can
assign pixels data sets so lots of stuff
that I can assign here okay so the
Facebook page and the Instagram account
that's what I want this person to be
assigned I can then review business
assets not assigned sign business assets
I then here need probably to specify can
manage the content yeah so insights ads
oh select a business asset so the r for
Russia page yep I can then assign
content Community activity ads insights
and leads okay all that's all I want to
get and then I'll click next and then
I'm going to send an
invitation to Mark markm man.com and as
soon as I accept the
invitation I will then show up on this
list as we saw here yeah and accepted
and I am then part of the team that
manages the um that manage the Facebook
or The Meta business suite for this
particular page right so that's a wrap
an introduction to The Meta business
Suite let me summarize yeah the meta

details let's talk about the pivotal
role of the meta business weed it's
serves as the central control hub for
businesses using Facebook and Instagram
and it's more than just a tool it
manages their entire digital presence on
Facebook and on Instagram it

matters that work for you best now in
the previous video we talked about how
to set up an account on the metab
business read and how to navigate the
dashboard and how to collaborate by
setting up other users in your account
in today's video we're going to look at
another topic and that is the topic of
how to use the meta business Suite to
create and plan your posts and your
stories so in the demo we're going to
cover the following topics we're going
to look at how do you create a post on
Facebook and on
Instagram how do you plan your content
and how do you use the content
calendar what are the
notifications uh that you need to work
on and that you can set up and where do
you set them up in the meta business
Suite we'll look at the inbox the
messages and comments and how you can
ultimate responses and then finally
we'll dig a bit deeper into the stories
how can you create stories using the
meta business
Suite there are many social media
posting and planning tools like hot suet
like Soho social buffer Sprout social
they all work really well and they allow
you to schedule and manage posts on your
social media channels on Facebook on X
on Instagram and many other platforms
however there are various reasons why
you want to choose the meta business
suite for your posting over other
platforms first of all meta business
Suite is developed by meta ensuring a
seamless integration with Facebook and
Instagram and making sure that you can
leverage all the functionality in
Facebook and Instagram within your
posting in The Meta business Suite also
content published through the meta
business Suite may have a slight
advantage in the algorithmic reach on
Facebook and Instagram basically
Facebook will reward you for using metab
business s to post your content by
giving you a wider reach for your post
it ALS also gives you access to new
features and updates within Facebook
yeah and Instagram faster than other
tools like
HootSuite they offer better security
measures and compliance with platform
policies within the meta business suite
and direct access to support is
available within the meta business Suite
as well so that will expedite your
issues
resolution so Facebook the publishing
facilities within the meta business
manager they are designed specifically
for Facebook and Instagram so that makes
it much friendlier easier for you to use
than some of the other
platforms good so let's delve into the
posting and Publishing on Facebook and
Instagram let me go to the real life
dashboard so here you see the
dashboard and let me first show you how
to um create a post there are various
roots that you can use to create a post
there is here the create Post Yeah you
can also go through the planner you can
go through the content so there are
various ways that you can get into
but let me show you the create post uh
the simple approach I'm clicking here
create post and I'm then getting to the
basic screen for creating a post yep so
here you see all the elements that you
need to do yep so first of all you're
going to specify the platform that you
want to post and I've selected here
Facebook and Instagram I can then add
the photo I can use a template and here
I can use specific text then here I see
the scheduling options I can set my
privacy settings and here you see the
preview either in the Facebook feed or
in the Instagram feed so I'm going to
add a photo and can actually upload from
the desktop or add from the file manager
we'll look into the file manager in a
bit but I'm clicking upload from desktop
and then here I can go to let's say for
Russia picking this photo the photo is
now being uploaded and here I see what
the post is going to look like then here
I can add a text and I can say
winter
promotion yeah in Riad for Russia I see
here how the text is being added yes so
I can completely see how the post is
being set up I can add all the stuff
that I can add on Facebook as well yep I
see the Facebook feed preview I can go
for the Instagram feed
preview I can look at the desktop and
the mobile version so it's a fully
featured um posting platform within the
meta business P yeah so now a few uh
things of course before finalizing the
post take advantage of this previe
feature in the business Suite yeah so
make sure that your visuals and your
caption displays as intended and that
there are no formatting issues so making
sure that the post looks exactly like
you want it to look and then when you're
happy with the post you click either
publish or you can say finish later
so I can also schedule the post yes so
I'm clicking here publish and then the
post will be published this may take a
moment or you can set here your
scheduling
options yeah so you see now that the
post is
published so but I actually I'm going to
delete it in a minute because I don't
want this post to go live yeah so if I
again want to create that post I can
also say the scheduling options and I
can set a date and a time for my post
okay so that gives it to you in a
nutshell and what we're going to do now
is let's look at this file manager in a
bit more detail the file manager is a
tool that meta business Suite um has put
together to allow you to add and
organize your assets for your business
account y have assets like your photos
like your ads like videos Etc so with
file manager you can collaborate on
files and folders you can assign access
to creative assets and you can plan your
content more efficiently so you can
manage your image and video files for
use in your posts or your stories or
your videos you can upload multiple
assets at the same time for later use
you can create albums to organize and
access your creative assets and you can
share your assets with other people in
your team so how do you access the um
file manager you can go here to all
tools and then within the all tools you
see here file manager so click on that
and that takes you to your file manager
where you can create folders and where
you can add of creatives in your folder
so if I go to this folder and I can uh
check the folder and here you see one of
the um the assets that I've added into
this file manager clicking here I can
straightly bring it into my creative
posts yep so I can use it to create a
story or I can delete it I can look at
my folder setting yeah here you can see
which people have access access to the
folders I can assign Partners to the
folders I can edit these folder
permissions so very useful tool and
particularly if you have lots of assets
for your products then this can be a
very helpful tool in managing those
assets so that that takes me then a step
deeper to the content Tab In The Meta
business Suite as well yeah that is
where you can find all your published
and drafts and scheduled posts including
your reals your video posts your stories
your photos and your live videos you can
see what is published what is scheduled
what is draft what is expiring what is
expired yeah you can add your reels you
can even export the data and still still
access to your create post or your
create real here you can see the date
published of the post you can see the
status of the post if it has been
boosted or not yeah if it what's the
distribution for the Post how many you
see then some some some statistics on
the posts as well and we'll dive deeper
into the insights later in the third
video but here you can already see The
Impressions the reach the players and
very important the reactions the engage
ment that you had on the different posts
so very useful tool yes so you can
within this tool you can manage your
post you can create posts as well and
there's also access here to your ab
tests if you want to test posts on their
uh their effectiveness you can also
within the content and I like that you
can see your feed and your grd yeah so
here you see your Facebook feed this one
is that I've just published although
I've deleted it as well but um yeah and
here you see your Instagram feed you can
see your mentions and your tags so it's
almost like managing your feed as well
and here you see your collections within
your file manager like Facebook photos
playlists and series that you've can
create
it very useful tool that um you can use
to manage your content together with the
file
manager right so that concludes the
posting element yeah let's now go into
the next level of managing your posts
and that is through the planner the
planner can be accessed by clicking the
planner button here on the menu in the
metab business suedes dashboard so if I
click on the planner yeah you can access
your kind of your content dashboard and
within this dashboard you can have a
total overview of what you have posted
and what you're going to
post and you can see some basic
information about your different posts
as well yeah and it's a very useful
visual tool to plan your content and to
plan ahead of your content so you click
on the planner tab as I mentioned yeah
it also features this calendar that
helps you plan schedule and visualize
what count content you want to share and
when you want to share it you can also
use this calendar to coordinate your
content with holidays and special events
what is going on and you can also use it
to manage your creative access your
creative assets
yep so here you see the goals that you
can specify you can add goals yeah so
here for instance I want to increase
reach you can specify that for a
specific period and then here you see
how you fair against reaching the
objective of the goal that you've set
there's also the moments now
unfortunately moments does not work in
most of the markets currently it's only
working in the US so here you will see
what sort of events are coming up like
holidays National events or you can
specify your own events and that's
always good with your posting of your
content because you can then relate your
content to the events that are relevant
in your
market so you can look at your content
type yeah so you can have all your
content showing in your calendar or you
can look at your stories your reals or
your ads and here you can specify set it
by week or by
month and it gives you as I said earlier
a fantastic overview of what you have
done and what you're going to do it also
and that's what I really like about it
gives you a um gives you kind of a a
library of the posts that you have done
in the
past so the content calendar yeah is
very important it's also called an
editorial color calendar it's used by
the marketing team to plan and schedule
your content across your Facebook and
your Instagram so it serves as a road
map for your social media marketing
strategy and it makes sure that you will
be consistent and
cohesive with your posting
yeah and it's a very important tool that
marketing teams are using some key
elements of your calendar yeah it
outlines the type of content you plan to
share that's number one yeah it helps
you scheduling it includes the specific
dates and times for when your posts will
be or for when your content will be
published yeah so you can schedule it
forward as well
what are the posts that you are planning
in the coming
months good content calendars have an
integration of your different social
media
channels yep so that is very useful
because then you can select and show the
post for each sort of um channel that
you're using the calendar often includes
themes or topics for postings yeah so
you have a d diverse range of content
that you're scheduling there's also
alignment with your campaigns in your
content calendar so it aligns with your
broader marketing campaigns or events so
your social media efforts they're really
contributing to it to sort of achieving
your marketing objectives good content
calendars they have collaboration
features so multiple team members can
contribute or review so you can
coordinate your efforts across your
posting and by pling planning and
scheduling your content in advance yeah
it's just a matter of efficiency it
helps streamline your content creation
and your posting process and finally a
good content calendar helps with the
communication within your marketing team
so everybody is aware of what is being
scheduled what posts are coming and they
can plan their tasks AC
accordingly now that we looked at the
publishing and planning side of your
content and your posts let's look at the
notifications a very important part of
your Facebook and Instagram presence
unfortunately metab business Suite
allows you to receive
notifications related to your Facebook
and your Instagram business accounts
whether you get those on messaging or
whether you get them on your email so
what are notifications they are kind of
alerts or messages that inform
people yeah and it's mainly you of
course and your marketing team that are
working on the meta business Suite as
well about specific activities updates
or interactions with the meta business
weed platform so what are the features
of the notifications in the meta
business Suite so here we go into the
notifications button that we can access
through the meta business Suite menu so
click on
notifications yeah so first of all you
can customize your
notifications yeah so you can customize
the notification preferences based on
your settings and your priori
you can receive realtime updates on
relevant activities so that keeps you in
the loop and you can explore the
advanced notification settings and in
the advanced notification settings you
can tailor your notifications based on
specific activities so you getting
prompt sort of um messages about events
that are critical to your
business so here's the over you yes so
here there's no new notifications here
are the other notifications that are
coming in these are notifications from
within your um within your Facebook or
your Instagram here you can filter your
notifications yeah so you can have uh
set for Action needed message reminders
comments
recommendations notifications only for
Faceook Facebook or Instagram or your
business account here you can set Market
read and here you have the settings of
your notification and here you can
specify what notifications you want to
have and most notifications that will go
within your team your marketing team
will go through
email yeah so you can set notifications
for Facebook for um yeah for your page
for messages for comments for
announcements for
suggestions other Communications like
tag likees shares and here are you can
set your business email notifications
for business permissions roles ad
accounts pixels and more yeah so that
goes um quite
deep so let me dig a bit deeper in the
type of notifications you can get via
your email
that could be activity alerts yeah so
they include alerts about activities on
your business Pages like new likes
comments or shares they can be page
insights so users may receive
notifications about insights and
analytics related to the performance of
the business page there could be alerts
on messenger
interactions yeah so if you use the
messenger for customer communication you
you may receive notifications about new
uh customer messages could be um alerts
or notifications around ad campaign
updates so information about your ad
performance the budget charges or budget
changes or other AD campaign related
events there could be page management
alerts you important actions or changes
related to the management of your
business page there could be plat form
announcements from
meta yeah they may use the notifications
to in uh communicate important platform
announcements updates or
changes there could be notifications
related to security and finally
notifications around events and
reminders so very useful tool to use
important to make sure that you set the
right
preferences and make sure that you check
it regularly yeah what the notifications
are that you are getting
in besides the
notifications another important area is
your
inbox and within your inbox you have
your messages you have your comments and
your automated
responses so you can access that by
clicking on the inbox in your menu
yeah and meta business Suite they offer
several
features related to this communication
and engagement within your inbox they
enable your your business to effectively
manage your communication and your
engagement on Facebook and on Instagram
so a centralized inbox is very handy
that you can have that because it
streamlines your responses and it makes
sure and you sort of you respond timely
and
consistently with your
audience so if you look at the menu your
centralized Hub as it were this is where
you can manage your entire inbox you can
look at just the messages messenger
Instagram yeah on WhatsApp Facebook
comments Instagram
comments yep so here you see all the
messages whether it's red if it needs
follow up you can label it here is the
filters that you can specify here you
see the people that communicate with you
then here you see the community or the
sort of the communication that is being
done so really useful if I go here to
myself yeah what you see for the users
as well that have enabled that you can
see their profile details as well
and you can set a label could be like a
new customer or a prospect you can add
labels yeah so that can be like a mini
sort of CRM system to manage the
communication with your prospects for
instance yes so that is the um the
inbox
so and that is sort of the um the the
dashboard that you have for your inbook
box so again we'll look at your
messenger yeah so that's all the private
messages that you receiv received within
your Facebook and Instagram business
account the
comments yeah they focus on comments
that you get within your Facebook or
your Instagram business page so this is
where you can efficiently Monitor and
respond to comments so that can really
help you with developing your engagement
with your
audience so what I really like about the
inbox is that you can also set up
automations so you can set up automated
responses to messages messages that you
received within your um within your
inbox so they can be customized and
triggered based on specific keywords
based on Greetings or specific questions
that you get and they are very useful to
provide instant replies and managing
manage your customer inquiries
efficiently so they can be
configured yeah to acknowledge a receipt
of a message or provide basic
information or guide users to relevant
sources Sant relevant resources so let's
have a look if I click on the
automations yeah then here you see there
is basically a um a library of
automations that you can set
up yeah and some here you can see the
ones that you have already set up and
that you have activated so for instance
I have already activated an instant
reply or I've activated identify
unanswered
messages yeah my away message is not on
or I can create an Automation and then
here you see the library of kind of
templates that you can choose from you
can greet people yeah share information
organize messages send a confirmation or
follow
up yes
so you start with templates so it is not
a huge library of templates that you
have but at least it allows you to to
use to look at specific um sort of
common
sort of scenarios that you can can face
and you can set sort of alterations for
those right let's go back and let's go
to the final demo in this video and that
is take a bit of a deeper look into
creating
stories So Stories offer a very Dynamic
and engaging format for content sharing
yeah because of their temporary nature
and their interactive features and Prime
placement don't forget that yeah it
makes them a very valuable tool for
businesses that want to enhance the
engagement on their social media
presence and connect with their
audiences and make the content more
authentic and
immediate stories also help increasing
the visibilities because appear at the
top of a user's feed so that provides
Prime real estate for visibility and it
makes it more likely that users will see
your content and engage with your
content yes so and there are lots of
Engagement opportunities as stories are
designed to be interactive with features
like polls questions quizzes swipe up um
links yeah and it connects with your
audience in a much more engaging
way
so let's have a look at the stories how
you create
them yeah so here we say create
story yeah what I like about stories is
that they provide the opportunity to
share kind of raw unfiltered content to
your users so you can give your your
followers a behind the scenes look at
your business or the personal life and
makes your posts a lot of a lot more
authentic yeah so you can build stronger
relations with your uh with your
audience there's also a thing like fomo
as we call it it's the fear of missing
out because of the temporary nature of
stories they typically last for 24 hours
it creates a sent of
urgencies yeah so you encourage users to
check your stories regularly because
they feel I don't want to miss anything
that you are um that you are posting in
your
stories it's kind of known that people
for instance on Instagram will spend
more time in the stories than in the
news
feeds yep and businesses use that they
businesses know that stories yeah their
algorithm they often prioritize stories
making them more likely to appear on the
users uh feed so and another big feature
of stories by the way is the high
highlights feature particularly on
Instagram so you can create story
highlights which are collections of past
stories that you can feature on your
profile permanently so that is a
fantastic way to Showcase important
information or key aspects of your brand
I always say it's like the menu of your
website yeah you can actually have that
in the highlights on your
Instagram so and finally the power of
stories is also that they offer
advertising opportunities both in
Facebook and in Instagram so businesses
can use that to reach a broader audience
and promote products or
Services of course it's not as user
friendly as on the mobile but at least
you have some functionality on the um
that you can have on the mobile as well
so add photo video we're going to go in
the same photo here open
yep so here you see the photo and here
you see how the story is being
uploaded yep so you can then add your
text as well so you can click
edit yep so here you can see I can crop
I can text or I can add stickers so
let's add text so the text will be um
I'm going to put it here yeah
so uh winter
promotion yeah put that
here and then we have text is blue or
text is red let's make it
yellow here we go font I can
choose yep and then I can say let's
stick with that and here I can say I'm
going to add a sticker as well
yes so you have a whole library of
stickers it is again not as advanced as
you have on the mobile but at least you
can do a bit on the yeah so then I can
click apply I can add my multiple um
media of
course I can schedule it I can share it
straight away or I can schedule it and I
can set my privacy settings as well so
really good functionality within the
meta business sweet so create the
stories here or create them on Facebook
or Instagram itself on the mobile but at
least you have some functionality on
that here as well to Leverage The Power
of the
stories there are two additional items
in the old tools that you need to be
aware of that can help you with your
content creation and your content
planning if I click here on all tools
then in the menu you will see here sound
collection sound collection is a
fantastic tool to enhance your video and
audio content which with free music or
sound effects that you can use in your
posts and it's a hidden sort of Secret
In The Meta business Suite but it gives
you a great collection of hundreds of
sound files that you can add to your
videos or your um your photos or your
your stories and you can sort by genre
by Mood by duration by vocals by tempos
you can add it to favorites there is as
you can see here over 10,
13,28 to soundtracks in there that you
can can use and they're all free of
charge so there's tracks there's sound
effects and it is very very handy little
tool that you have in the meta business
manager so the other one that I want you
to be aware of if I go back home and
back into the old tools is the
collaboration Center so here in the
manage you see your collaboration Center
and that is where you can sort of
structure your Partnerships with Brands
and with
influencers so you can sort of of assign
uh Brands and partners that you want to
collaborate with on your posts and with
the whole growth in the influencer
marketing uh area this is a very useful
part that you can um can you can set up
to manage those relationships we're
going to talk about the meta business
weed Commerce the advertising and the
insights that you can get out of it
we're going to talk about what it is how

details let's talk about the pivotal
role of the meta business Suite the
suite serves as the central control hub
for businesses that use Facebook and
Instagram and it's more than just a tool
it manages your entire digital presence
on Facebook and Instagram no more need
to use other tools yeah you can now do
it all within the Facebook and Instagram
world it's essential for efficiency it
consolidates all the elements of your in
your Facebook and Instagram presence
into one unified desk dashboard it
simplifies the account management of
your ad accounts your pages and the team
collaboration so that only it does not
only save you time but it also reduces
the complexity allowing you to focus on
what really matters for you and that is
your business so it's a collaborative
workspace where you can enable your
colleagues to work with you as well on
your Facebook and your Instagram and
thereby why it ensures that everybody is
aligned contributing collectively to
achieving your business goals so it's a
suite of tool with lots of valuable
insights like audience management
audience engagement metrics like ad
performance yeah and it is a One-Stop
shop to manage everything you need to do
uh in managing your Facebook and your
Instagram now we've been through various
um areas of it like we looked at the
dashboard we looked at the um posting
scheduling managing your content we
found a treasure of tools and
functionalities and in today's session
we're going to look at three specific
areas we're going to dive into the
Commerce manager and we're going to be
talking about some very important
changes that meta has announced in 2023
about managing your shop we're going to
look at Facebook and Instagram ads I'm
going to show you the process of
creating an ad and how to manage your
your audiences and then we're going to
conclude the video
with a demo about the Facebook and meta
insights that you can
get right let's kick off demo one the
Commerce
manager now it's important to understand
that meta has made some very important
announcements in managing your Facebook
shop in response to the current economic
downturn meta is investing heavily in Ai
and automation tool to boost campaign
performance through shop advertising and
The Meta Advantage Suite of ads and
we'll come back to that in a little bit
yeah what that uh that means but it
means that shops
are scaling down in
functionality but promoting your
products through advertising is kind of
scaling up in um in Facebook and
Instagram so the shop ads are going to
be Consolidated Under The Meta
advantage and they facilitate easier
shop setup with inapp checkout
yeah so particularly for the markets
where you already have checkout
functionality within the Facebook app
yeah this is a very important
announcement that although the shop is
going to sort of deep be defocused the
advertising of your products is going to
get more center stage and thereby you
can promote more of your products to
your target
audiences Now new shop tools that are
coming out like ratings reviews they're
being tested and support for shops
without checkout and that's very
important to understand if you haven't
got a checkout functionality in your
shop yeah and that will be in most of
the countries except in the US and I
believe in India they support for the
shops will be
discontinued with a focus on helping the
US businesses in adding the checkouts to
their existing shops basically what meta
is doing is to optimize the whole
shopping experience in the US market and
then rolling that out across other
markets which means that some of the
shop functionality and opening up a new
shop in Facebook in other markets like
Europe and like Asia is going to be
limited so this strategic change aims to
optimize the shopping experiences
support businesses and learn from the
experiences in the US before a global
roll out so remember as I said
discontinued support for shops without
checkouts in various markets like Europe
and Asia and um for those markets you
you can start focusing and focus
increase your focus on personalized ads
reels and messaging and in the US the
emphasis is on aiding businesses in imp
implementing the checkout with support
for shops linking to a website until
sort of first quarter of 2024 so now
this is clear let's start with looking
at the metac Commerce manager yeah the
Commerce manager is the essential core
of your online store and simplifies all
your store tasks with a userfriendly
interface so it enables you to manage a
products to process your orders and
deliver excellent customer service to
your customers who buy your products Now
by centralizing all e-commerce
activities meta business Commerce
manager helps you to focus on selling
your product through Facebook and
Instagram and that is of course a
fantastic opportunity that you have to
add an additional sales channel to your
um your current sales operation so let's
get into the
demo so here we see the meta business
Suite portal and to get into the
Commerce manager we go to um down here
we look at all the
tools and then we see here down here the
Commerce button we click on there and
this takes you to the Commerce manager
interface and here is your
dashboard yeah so here you see the
overview but it gives you access to
activities like adding products to your
catalogue like customizing your shop or
publishing your shop it gives you shop
insights it gives you things to do on
your catalog your shops offers that you
have it gives you your top product so it
gives you some basic insights it gives
you your top taged content and there may
be some questions you have that you can
get answers from through the
FAQ so here you see the
important elements of managing your shop
there is your catalog that's where you
start of course yeah there is the
different shops you may have and you can
manage your shops here you can run
promotions you can promote your product
through ads you can get insights you may
have a to-do list with things to
optimize your shop and here you go to
the
settings yeah of course always important
to start with the settings and you can
have a look at the detail of your shop
there's the general settings of your
shop yeah like your account info like
your email there is your localization of
your shop but you can specify the
currency the language the product
details the shipping information you
have the settings for your catalog for
your business assets for your checkout
mid method permissions very important
you can assign permissions to different
us users colleagues in your organization
or your agency yeah what they can do
within the Commerce manager and then
there is your customer support where you
can uh manage your claims your um charge
back email address details shop contact
information and what have you right so
that's important to understand all the
different items that you can go through
within your con Conta your Commerce
manager so let's go and have a let's add
a product yeah so first you're going to
do here to your back to your home to
your overview yeah and there are various
ways that you can start adding products
to your catalog yes so you can here add
products to your catalog directly
here yep and then there is the catalog
menu here where you can set items have
product sets the data sources where are
your products coming from yeah and then
there's the um the events as well that
you can
specify okay so let's go quickly here at
one item is very important that is the
data sources basically where are your
products coming from
yeah now here you get from your current
product catalog you see here what the
status is of your catalog yeah and
particularly when products come in from
a to a Commerce site like Shopify there
may be issues with various products that
you need to have a look at but here we
can click on add an item or add an item
here yes so I'm just going to click here
in general
add an item and here you see the
different ways that you can add a
product it can be done through a data
feed it can be done manually or it can
be done through a
pixel yeah that you can bring it in
through a pixel from another
website so look at the
manual yeah so if I'm just going to
click here on manual then here you see
the
manual let's have a look here you see
the
manual process for adding a
product yep so you can just click a new
item well here is an item you can add an
image for your item you can add a title
the description a website link the price
for your product you can add a sales
price a Facebook product category
condition of the product availability
the status yeah so lots of stuff that
you can add here for your product and
once you've done that yeah you then just
click upload
items so back in your dashboard you can
then click here on manage your catalog
and this is where you can see all the
products in your catalog and the status
and what the stock availability and the
price and of course if you have hundreds
of of products you may want to set some
filters yeah check on attributes for
your
products yep so that is how you can ma
add products to your catalog and how you
can manage your catalog as well so
another way to upload your items is
through a data feed and that's a very
important one yeah so you can actually
just enter a Google Sheets yep and you
can downloaded a template of the format
for the uh the Google Sheets that you
want to upload with your product
information but you can also enter a URL
from a server or a hosting website and
this URL is very important when you want
to work with external e-commerce stores
like for instance
Shopify the process there is that you
would um download kind of a a Facebook
app with within your Shopify account and
that sets the connection with uh between
Shopify and the Facebook uh Commerce the
Facebook shop or there may be other
e-commerce platforms where they will
actually give you a
URL and that's where you can add that
URL and that sets a link and the good
thing often about these Sol uh these
these Solutions is that there will be a
live link between your e-commerce
platform and your Facebook shop that
means when there is changes in your
product catalog in your e-commerce
platform it will automatically be
uploaded in your Facebook Commerce data
source or your Facebook Commerce catalog
right back to the overview
so let's look at how you can edit your
shop now remember the recent store
changes yeah so in most markets you can
no longer create a new shop but you can
edit an existing
shop and in some markets where there is
the inapp checkout functionality like in
the US you will still be able to create
new shops and manage your shops so let's
click here on shops and here you see the
shop that I have yep and it's um here I
can see the live
shop so here you see how the Sho the
shop looks like y so um I can look at
the
products and I can look at the
categories I can search within the shop
here you see a version
history yep or I can close this and I
can here I can edit my shop
I can edit the layout of the shop and I
can edit the settings of the
shop so here you see the homepage I can
look at collections I can optimize the
layout I can add banners for offers I
can add a carousel of um of products or
collections to the Carousel and here I
can have suggestions for you yeah or a
dynamic product and that serves the
product that is relevant for the
customer yep but remember this is going
to scale down in the future yeah you
will no longer be able to see a shop and
actually on most sort of Facebook pages
you already see that many Facebook pages
have already removed the shop because of
the limited functionalities that you
have these days
okay so that is the shop that you can um
edit in the layout and here in the
settings you can addit the visibility
the inventory the website content the
categories yep and um again lots of
stuff that you can uh can manage
here the final thing we want to do in
the Facebook Commerce is to to see how
we can do a promotion yep and if we go
back to the Commerce manager and the um
the dashboard of the Commerce manager we
can click here on
promotions and here you see
offers and this is where we can create
offers and we can see an overview of our
active offers our scheduled offers and
offers that expired so let's have a look
at the create
offer functionality click on this and
here you can see your offer category so
I can have an amount of I can do a sale
I can do a free shipping I can do a buy
product X and get product y here's the
name of your offer and here you can see
the different if you want to use a promo
code if you don't want to use a promo
code then you take this or you can get a
CO a code that people have to enter and
here you see the summary of the offer so
we're going to give the name of the
offer is uh spring
promotion yeah no other changes it's an
automatic yes so no other details up
here to enter here we do the type are we
doing a percentage of or a flat amount
so let's say we're doing a
20% discount uh here you can select your
products we can say apply to the entire
shop or or select some specific products
I'm going to do it for the entire shop
and then I can do include products that
already have a sales price or I cannot
include them the offer applies only once
per item or I can say let's do it per
order here you see what the offer would
look like yep and here you can set the
start date and the end date of your
offer if I'm happy with all these
settings I can then click here create
offer and then the offer will be live on
my
shop okay here is the summer uh sorry
here's the um the summary so the offer
is being created it gives you some some
tips so you can feature the offer in the
shop there's to offer
details yeah the discount ID the
visibility the start date we haven't
specified an end date yeah for all the
customers we can look at the customers
the product and then we see it's for all
products and then if we're happy with
this we'll just click cancel yeah so
that concludes the um the the promotion
and you see how simple it is to add a
promotion so now let's look at the last
section I want to cover in the Commerce
manager and that is the advertising that
you can schedule in the Commerce manager
now let's talk about Advantage Plus you
may have heard me talking about that
earlier in this video where it talks
about the um uh the changes that
Facebook announced in 2023 in the
Commerce manager so what are Advantage
Plus catalog ads they have been launched
on August the 15th in 2023 for
e-commerce and real retail advertisers
really helping them enhance the ad
efficiency so the Advantage Plus ads
they use a and machine learning where
they automatically sort of create up to
150 creative combinations of the ads so
it eliminates manual steps in the ad
creation allowing advertisers to learn
much more efficiently how which ads work
and which ads don't work and how to
maximize their budget efficiently so the
roll out of Advantage Plus provides
advertisers with new and innovative ways
to optimize campaigns and thereby you
can get fantastic new insights that can
help in developing your advertising
strategies small businesses will also be
able to use Advantage Plus creative and
Advantage Plus audience to create ads
through their Facebook page so it's not
just through the Commerce manager but
small businesses can take advantage of
it as well so it's about creating a
personalized audience based on your page
detail and automatically adjust over
time to help you reach more and relevant
customers for your um for your ads so
here you can see the what you can do so
if you want to get started with
Advantage catalog ads so you can add
your product you can set up tracking
through a pixel and then you can create
your ad and if I click on create create
ad you want to know which ad account you
would like to advertise with and then
you select the in this case the Riad for
Russia and then that takes you to your
advertising setup and this basically is
a um a subset of the uh the Facebook or
The Meta advertising platform that we
will go through in a minute once we've
concluded the Commerce manager section
yep so that's um what I want say about
the ads and then finally let's look at
the insights so here in the insights you
can get dat details knowledge
information about your catalog your
performance your audiences your tagged
content you can get in details about
awareness and there is the helicopter
overview of your shop performance as
well well we had very little activity in
our shop because yeah we have have a
very basically no real shop in this
Facebook account but here again you will
get all the details about your shop if
you have a full operating shop within
the Commerce
manager right that concludes the
Commerce manager so now let's look at
the advertising on Instagram and
Facebook that you can manage through the
meta business suite and and we'll go
there by various ways you can go into
the advertising yeah so Facebook and or
meta is very keen to get you to
advertise and so you see in your feeds
you see posts that you can boost um here
on the um the the basic menu you go into
advertising here if you click on the all
tools you can go to ads and these are
all subsection of what you can do in the
advertising if you really want to go to
the full advertising platform of meta
you click here on ads
manager this is the dashboard of your um
account in The Meta business Suite when
it comes to advertising you can see if
there are problems with your advertising
account there is the payment method that
you can can set you can even create a
Facebook page from here you can verify
your email address and um here you have
access to the ads manager menu as well
and this is where you can have an
overview of your campaigns there is your
ads reporting very important section is
the audiences that you can create within
your ads manager and Target various
audiences with your ads there is in b
and payments and your ad account setting
and here is an overview to all the tools
in the ad manager yeah business settings
SC um the integration with the Commerce
Center and lots of other stuff when it
comes to your your ads in Facebook and
Instagram so let's go to the
campaigns yeah what we want to do is to
show you the powerful features in this
demo of the ads manager when it comes to
creating an ad in Facebook and in
Instagram yeah in this video to take you
through the entire ads manager that
would be um too long we'll do a separate
video on that but here I just want to
give you a quick highlight on how easy
it is to create a new campaign so here
you see the current campaigns that I
have yep so now I'm not running any
campaigns they're all in draft mode but
here you see the typical structure for a
payperclick advertising campaign you
have campaigns under campaigns you have
ad sets and under ad sets you have ads
and the ads they inherit the settings of
the adsets and the adsets inherit the
settings of the campaign so in the
campaigns you would set your budget in
the adsets you would set your targeting
and here are the specific ads so it's
all the related to each other but it's a
multi-dimensional approach in updating
and managing your advertising campaigns
in um in meta so let's create a new
campaign and then you'll see how it
develops so we want first to look at the
campaign objective yeah so based on what
the objective is for your campaign meta
will come back to to you with the ideal
settings for that particular objective
so it could be lead generation it could
be engagement it could be driving
traffic like sending people to a
destination like your website or an app
or your Instagram profile great for
getting link clicks landing page views
Etc so let's click on traffic and here
I'm going to continue so now it's going
to ask me a number of
questions yes so and I just have to go
through those questions when it comes
for the campaign when it comes to the ad
set and when it comes to the ad yeah so
we have the campaign name we have the
special ad categories if you want to do
yeah so there are special categories
that Facebook or meta wants to know
about whether it's related to credit
employment social issues elections yeah
because there may be different
requirements this was sort of set up
after the um I think it would a 2018
elections in the US and the brexit um El
sort of um uh poll uh on how advertising
was kind of abused to reach audiences
with kind of false information so now
when you do advertise for social issues
and elections or politics then there are
very specific requirement Els yeah but
we say they're not applicable here we go
to the campaign
details yeah I can addit this the buying
type is an auction so the highest bidder
with the best quality ad will get the
best position for the ad you can do you
can change this as well uh you can do by
auction or by reservation but that is
where you will have to pay more yep and
then here's the campaign objective that
we've set at the beginning of the
process which is objective of traffic
yeah you can then set do you want to do
testing for your
ad yep and you will let Facebook create
different versions of your ad and then
it will run the different versions and
it will look at what ad will give the
best performance and do you want to make
it an advanced campaign budget yeah so
it will distribute your budget across
current currently delivering adsets to
get more results
yeah but I'm going to leave that off and
I'm going to click to next so that's my
campaign settings we're then going to
the ad set and in the ad set you're
going to look at your conversion
location would that be your website or a
landing page an app on messenger or your
Instagram profile so let's send traffic
to my
website yep and then here you see your
estimated daily result results how many
people you will reach and how many link
clicks I'm going to set the performance
goal I want to maximize the number of
clicks yeah what would I want to do yeah
to spend what do I want to spend
basically I can say I'm going to spend
let's say um
one dollar or one pound in this case per
result call I can have more options here
I can say different bit strategies that
I can have yeah I can say what is the
maximum spend or what is the cost per
result call what am I prepared to spend
per kind of um click as it were yeah I'm
going to leave that that and here you
have Dynamic
creative yeah I can also leave this
blank by the way because I have my
budget setting further down below so
Dynamic creative I just provide creative
elements such as images and headlines
and then meta will automatically
generate the perfect ads for you a very
interesting um process um I'm going to
leave it off for now because I want to
show you how an ad may look like and how
you can develop that so my daily budget
I'm setting it at 20s a day yeah here's
the start date and I can set an end date
yeah so I'm going to set the start date
a bit further yeah because I don't want
it to start and send a t date don't need
to send an end date yep and here is the
budget and scheduling you can now
schedule budget and greases on certain
days I'm not going to do that at the
start of the campaign because I want
Facebook or meta in this case decide
what works best for me yep so and then
ad scheduling I can specify but again
I'm going to run all the ads at at the
same time and then here you have your
audience controls so this is set
criteria for where ADS can be delivered
so this is we have sort of location we
have age we can look at existing custom
audiences that we have created over time
I can look at audience
suggestions yep so um so that is part of
the Advantage Plus audience that I
create that I discussed with you earlier
yep and here you have your placements
and there is let meta decide for you
where your ad is going to be shown or
you can decide for manual
placement yep and then is the more
placement you select the better it is
yeah but we let the Advance Plus yeah
show more options here there's brand
safety and suitability pro for instance
prevent your ads from appearing content
that's not conducive to your brand for
instance if you are a holiday
destination and you advertise on
Facebook you don't want to be shown um
next to an article or a post about um
about an airline disaster yes so we're
going to hide these options manual
placements are also want you to be aware
where you can select which platforms do
you want to advertise on Facebook
Facebook's Audience Network on Instagram
or on messenger shop is no longer
available we talked about that yep and
here you go then in your ads so this is
the placement of the ads where do you
want to show your ads in the feeds in
the stories in stream ads the search
results in messages but again we'll let
Facebook or meta decide on all of this
okay so I'm going back to Advantage Plus
placement where you use Facebook's
artificial intelligence and machine
learning to give you the best placements
based on meta's understanding of your um
your audience so click next yep and then
is um we're going to go to the ad yeah
so Facebook suggest make a carousel ad
yeah so here we go into the um the ad
creation so the face Facebook page that
we're going to base this on is let me
have a look real for
usia yeah we're going to manually upload
creatives or we can get it from the
catalog yeah and here you see your
preview these are the products for my
catalog yeah so I'm just going to leave
it for this product for now yes so
you're going to look at the format I
wanted a carousel
now I have two products in my Carousel
so they should probably come up now yeah
so um so here is the second product no
so but that's how it would look like or
you can do a collection you can do
multi- Advertiser ads so and I can um
have the catalog for the ad creative as
I said could be a product set I have
multiple products I can make Carousel
cards as well well yeah I can turn it in
a slideshow lots and lots of
opportunities and here you have your
headline and your description yeah so
the headline is carpet I can take that
out I can say um spring
promotion sort of Atlas Mountains
carpet yeah so that should now be added
here under the um the ad and here you
see shop now button I can add to
description that will show up at the uh
the top describe your link which would
be
fantastic handmade
carpets for from the
berbers in the Atlas
Mountains let's
see yeah on bigger ads you see that that
would show up here at the um the front
so yep and then you are um basically
having your primary text let me have a
look I think that is actually the text
that I wanted up
here let me have a look at
that there it is yeah so that is a text
that I wanted there and here the call to
action that would be shop now but I have
a whole range of call to actions yeah so
keep that as shop now then where do I
drive people to I drive them to my shop
and that is the websit do I want to
build a URL par parameter so I can track
my campaign in the uh in in
analytics yeah I'm not going to set it
up I can choose an app if I want to so
lots of stuff that I can do here I can
set up the tracking through the re pixel
I can select the pixel I'm not going to
go into those details and here is the
URL parameter that I want to build for
the tracking but here is the basic
version of my ad yep and now it's a
matter of pressing publish and then the
next thing that will happen that
Facebook will look at the ad they will
evaluate the ad and once they approve
the ad yeah then the campaign will go
live yep so here's the business location
and currency I'm just clicking next
that's the payment information they
still need my credit card details I
don't want to do that yeah so I'm not
going to give them the details so I want
to skip that so I'm not going to publish
this campaign for now but at least it
gives you an overview of how to create a
campaign in the flow of campaign ad set
and ads there's a lot more to it
obviously but at least this gives you a
high level overview so if that is on the
campaign setting there are two more
important areas that is your audience
creation so you can create separate
audiences that you can then add
as an audience for your ad campaign yes
so if you click create you can create a
custom audiences a lookalike audience or
what we say a saved audience yeah if I
click on Saved audience what you're
going to do you can specify the audience
with the name yeah and by the location
but you can then do a detailed targeting
based on demographics interests or
behaviors so I can just click here let's
say somebody who is excited about travel
yeah so could be frequent
Travelers yeah and there's a whole range
of uh things that you can add here and
in your um your audience and you will
see that it will sort of impact your
audience size as well so you can do by
Behavior yeah or by uh by interest so um
and there's a whole sort of let's say I
want to do
California yeah so I can California
place people who are either interested
there yeah so I can Target by location
as well if I want so this is the really
powerful um aspect of payperclick
campaigns on meta and also on Google
yeah on the targeting so I'm going to to
cancel this I can also create an
audience lob we say a custom audience
and this is uh these are audiences based
on people who have done a specific
behavior like visiting your website and
this is what we call the retargeting so
Facebook allows you to Target people who
have visited your website a particular
page which means the next day they could
get an advert or of your Facebook ad of
the the product that they saw on your
website so this all to do with the
retargeting and the pixel marketing now
I'm not going to go into that because
that's beyond the scope of this video
but this is where you would set it all
up okay and then of course within your
advertising you have your ads reporting
section as
well where you can look at the account
name yeah for the um yeah you can look
at reach Impressions frequency amount
spent and attribution setting now I
haven't got any campaigns running so I
don't see any details here yeah also
because the period is but let's say if
we can
select um let me have a look let's say
no I haven't run any Facebook campaigns
on this campaign so I can't show you any
data but this is where you can create
your advertising reports where you can
select all these breakdowns and bring
them into your
report good that's it on the Facebook
and Instagram
ads and what we're going to do now is
move to the next demo the final demo of
this series which is everything to do
with the meta insights to access the

within uh The Meta business Suite so
very important here and that is the most

reports in your uh Insight which is your

reports and see what we get if I look at

most engaging post when it comes to
reactions in the last 28 days I can say

most popular post over the last 90 days

a lead is just someone who has shown
interest in your business in simple
terms anyone who has shared their
contact details with you for example to
join a webinar get a free guide or
subscribe to a newsletter is considered
as a lead this is because they have
interacted with your business website
and allowed you to reach out to them now
lead generation is the process of
attracting and collecting information
from potential customers who have shown
interest in your products or Services it
involves strategies and activities to
capture the attention of individuals who
may be interested in what your business
offers the goal is to turn these
interested individuals or leads to
customers by nuturing the relationship
and guiding through the sales funnel
lead generation methods can include
various marketing efforts the aim is to
build a pool of potential customers that
can be further engaged and converted
into loyal clients for your business so
this was about lead generation now let's
understand the process of lead
generation so lead generation involves
multiple steps this process guides
potential customers from initial
interest to becoming a valuable leads
for business growth first one is
research before attempting to gather
leads it's crucial to gather as much
information about your target audience
understand not only who they are but
also their location priorities and
especially their immediate challenges
next one is creating your personal
personas creating customer personas can
be helpful outlining typical customer
details like demographics budget and
requirements consider factors like
social habits professional background
Etc after identifying your target
audience pinpoint where they usually
engage do they use Facebook actively or
are they more responsive to email
communication
what sets apart your product or service
from theirs and importantly what makes
your Superior so these all things you'll
have to take care about next one is
create great content yes at this point
you should be aware of the problems your
product solves for potential customers
utilize the knowledge to make content
that addresses those issues consider the
platform you're using as it impacts the
type of content you can share for
instance videos are effective on social
media but you cannot include directly
them into the mail so if your audience
is on Twitter keep in mind that long
blogs might need to be linked or
shortened always prioritize providing
value ensuring each piece of content
serves a particular purpose all right
now the next one is lead generation
database you might have the best
potential customers but it won't help
unless you manage them properly it's
essential to set up a database to keep
track of and analyze sort and group your
potential customers consider using an
automated CRM system to make this
process much easier these systems often
let you categorize leads by type and the
level of Interest this helps your sales
team go through their list more

strategy so make your ads better by

some someone just looks at it quickly
try different versions of your ad to see

how do you plan on generating traffic so
let's just click on YouTube first all
right select all of the ClickBank tools

say email marketing tool okay how did

further you can also and make sure to
read the requirements and the commission
you'll get from each and every company
or a product now let's talk about the
platforms to promote affiliate links so
the platforms where you can effectively
promote your affiliate products social
media platforms like Instagram Facebook
and Twitter are great for reaching a
broad audience additionally content
platforms such as YouTube and blogging
sites allow you to create valuable
content and drive traffic to your
affiliate links don't forget about
forums like ca where you can engage with
potential customers and provide helpful
recommendations so now let's navigate to
Google and let's type
Q now we'll click on
this all right continue with
Google all right so here it is
Cura so here you can also promote the
affiliate links because there's a
traffic over here as well so all you
have to do is to just select the
category which you want to promote let
just say let's just say we are promoting
a v protein brand you are promoting a w
routine brand so we'll click on this and
we can also type here best W routine
Etc and you'll get the questions
similarly like what is the best way
protein brands in India what is the best
way protein brand for building muscles
etc etc so you can answer these
questions by clicking on this and by
answering these questions you can also
attach a link and make sure that the
information you share in CA will be like
proper information and you have used
that product personally then only you
can recommend because then only you'll
be your audience will be attached with
you because it's a relationship that you
will build then only they'll trust you
so you can do that like that like
multiple questions are there you can
answer each and every questions and
attach the affiliate link of that
particular product this is also a way as
you can see if you click on questions
and the these are the questions some
people have used us as well I think and
they have
mentioned so this is a great way for
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing you can do like this as well a
lot of people do like this another way
is through YouTube whether you're
building a website YouTube channel or
any other platform it's crucial to
acknowledge that you must reveal the use
of affiliate links the Federal Trade
Commission that is FTC mandates
transparency when earning income through
endorsements emphasizing the importance
of openly disclosing such affiliations
so as I said YouTube is a great way of
promoting or doing affiliate marketing
so let's take the same example again
best way protein we'll be taking this
example only so as you can see there are
multiple influencers out there and let's
just select this video so you can
promote or like do affiliate marketing
in videos in your own videos because a
lot of traffic after Google comes to
YouTube and the traffic you can navigate
that
yeah so you can navigate that traffic to
your affiliate link so as you can see
this guy has attached an affiliate link
and also get up to 40% on this protein
powder so you can click on this and he
can get a commission out of it
and make sure that the product you are
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing is the right product and then
only you can build a relationship with
your
audiences so as you can see this guy has
done that so you can do that and this
guy has like three lak 40,000 views and
let's say if he's getting 2,000 or 3,000
clicks on this protein by suggesting
them so you'll get the commission a lot
of commission from that so this is a
nice way of promoting or doing the
affiliate marketing and this is how this
is a great way in fact this is the best
way I would say to do the affiliate
marketing because it is quite easy so
he's basically navigating that views or
that traffic to the affiliate link so
this is the another best way to promote
your or do the affiliate marketing did
you know that 75% of product launches
fail due to poor Market planning a great
product is only the beginning without a
solid go-to Market strategy even the

the end of this video you will
understand key GTM strategies how to
define your market and execute your plan
like a pro so let us first start by
understanding what is a goto Market
strategy framework in simple terms it's
a step-by-step process for bringing a
product or service to Market it answers
key questions like who we are selling to
how do we reach them and how do we stand
out from competitors for example let's
say you're launching a new project
management tool your GTM framework would
help you ID identify your target market
maybe small business or startups figure
out how to communicate the benefits of
your tool and decide whether you'll
focus on inbound marketing or outbound
sales to get the word out we will
understand inbound marketing and
outbound sales in the upcoming topic the
GTM framework aligns everyone on your
team and gives you a clear plan to
follow from start to finish now first we
have to understand how to define your
Market this is all about figuring out
who you are selling to a common mistake
businesses make is trying to sell to
everyone but in reality you need to
narrow down your target market let's say
you have developed a new fitness app
instead of targeting all Fitness
enthusiasts you could Define your Market
as busy professionals who want quick
effective workouts this helps you focus
your marketing efforts and craft more
tailored message the more specific you
get the better you can Target your
audience and and connect with their
needs so now the next step is to Define
your why your value proposition is
essentially why people should choose you
it's the unique benefit your product
offers that your competitors can't match
let's go back to the fitness app example
your value proposition might be we help
busy professionals squeeze in a
15-minute workout that's just as
effective as a full hour in the gym
you're not just offering Fitness but
also offering convenience and time saing
which speaks directly to your audience a
well-defined value proposition makes it
clear why your product matters and why
your audience should care let's go back
to the fitness app example your value
proposition might be we have busy
Professionals squeez in a 15minute
workout that's just as effective as a
full hour in the gym you're not just
offering Fitness but also convenience
and timesaving which speaks directly to
your audience a well- defined value
proposition makes it clear why your
product matters and why your audience
should care the next step is positioning
positioning is all about figuring out
where your product fits in in the market
and how you will differentiate from the
competition let's say you're launching a
premium skincare line your positioning
might focus on the high-end natural
ingredients you use which differentiate
you from the mass market products your
positioning helps set the stage for your
pricing branding and overall Market
strategy so what are the five goto
Market strategies when it comes to
launching a product or entering a new
market there are five primary goto
Market strategies which businesses
typically use the strategy allows you to
choose which depends on your product
target market and overall business goals
let's break down each strategy with
examples so that you can see how they
play out in real life the first is
inbound marketing so this marketing
attracts customers by creating valuable
content that addresses their needs and
pain points over time potential
customers find your content organically
through search engines or social media
for example HubSpot mastered inbound
marketing by providing free resources
like blogs and webinars their content is
optimized for search engines leading
small businesses to their site where
they eventually convert to customers
this marketing is best for companies
which is investing in long-term content
creation and SEO to attract organic
leads the second is outbound sales
outbound sales involve directly reaching
out to prospects through cold calls
emails and demos this approach is more
direct and aggressive targeting high
value clients for example Salesforce
uses outbound sales by targeting
decision makers at large Enterprises
with personalized Outreach scheduling
demos and closing deals to direct
interaction this type of marketing is
best for B2B company which Target
Enterprise clients that require
personalized engagement the third is
product Le growth in product Le growth
the product itself drives growth a
premium model lets users try the product
for free with upgrades to premium
features based on the product's value
example slack which offers a free
version of its platform allowing teams
to experience its benefits before
upgrading to a paid version for more
features so this type of marketing is
best for soft Ware as a service
companies which is focused on user
experience and selfs serve onboarding
the fourth is channel sales Channel
sales rely on third-party Partners
resellers Distributors to sell your
product which allows you to reach Market
you couldn't through direct sales alone
for example Microsoft partners with
resellers to sell products like Office
365 bundling their software with other
services to reach more customers so this
type of marketing is best for companies
which is looking to scale quickly
through thirdparty networks fifth is
account-based marketing account-based
marketing focuses on targeting high
value accounts with personalized
marketing and sales efforts it is
tailored approach designed to build deep
relationship with key clients example
snowflake targets large Enterprises like
finance and Healthcare companies
crafting personalized content and
Outreach to address their specific needs
this type of marketing is best for B2B
company companies which targets large
Enterprises where personalization is key
to closing deals now that we have
discussed the top five marketing
strategies let's not talk about
important step which is understanding
the competition knowing your competition
is crucial to understand the successful
goto Market strategy you need to ask who
else is solving the same problem and how
they're doing it once you understand
your competition you can figure out how
to differentiate yourself for example if
you're selling a new project management
tool you might find that the competitors
offer more features but they are too
complicated for small businesses so your
strategy could be offering more simpler
userfriendly tool specifically designed
for startups and small businesses the
next step is messaging your messaging is
how you communicate your value to your
audience it's important to keep your
message clear and consistent across all
the channels think of messaging as the
story you tell about your product what
makes your product special
how will it improve your customers's
life this messaging needs to come across
in your website email ads and even in
sale conversations for example if your
value proposition is about saving time
your messaging might say get fit in just
15 minutes a day no gym required this
directly speaks to your audience pain
point of not having enough time for long
workouts next step is execution now it's
time to put everything into action you
have defined your Market crafted your
messaging and figured out how to stand
out from the competition your execution
could involve inbound marketing like
content social media and SEO outbound
sales through cold Outreach or email
campaigns Partnerships with other
businesses that reach your target
audience for example if you're using
inbound marketing you might create
helpful blog posts or videos that
address your audien's pinpoints and lead
them to your product if you're using
outbound you'll want a highly targeted
email campaign that resonates with
potential customers today we are diving
into Wix an incredibly userfriendly
platform that allows you to create a
professional website without needing any
coding skills whether you starting a new
business or bringing an existing one
online Wix provides all the tools you
need to build a site that perfectly
represents your brand in this video
we'll be using the example of an online
clothing store to walk you through the
entire entire process from starting a
new website and selecting the perfect
template to customizing your design
adding essential features like logos and
contact forms and connecting your custom
domain we'll also show you how to
preview your website on Bo desktop and
mobile to ensure it looks great
everywhere and finally we'll guide you
through the process of publishing your
site live so by the end of this demo
you'll see just how easy it is to bring
your online store to life with w
no coding required first head over to
the Wix website and log into your
account so you can press get started and
either you can sign up with Google press
continue so first they will ask you a
few questions like who are you creating
a website for so just answer those and
press continue so here I'm creating for
myself so initially Wix will first ask
you if you want to use AI to help set up
your website but today we are planning
to do everything manually so let's
select set up without chat and now they
will ask about what type of website you
want to create so I want to create an
online clothing store so let's type that
in yeah and then you can type the name
of your business let's just give XYZ
collections for now XYZ Fashions or
collections Let It Be
Collections and then they will ask what
your goal is like is it to sell products
get booked online is it to host an event
so as as as an online store it's to sell
products
again they will ask many questions so
just you know answer those okay
finish so this is basically a dashboard
so we'll discuss about this later so now
first our goal is to find a template to
pick a suitable template for our website
so let's go to design site and again
here you have two options you can either
generate a design with AI or you can
customize a template so for now we are
customizing a template so let's choose
pick a template see as you can see there
are variety of templates available so
scroll through and select one that
matches your brand
style so let's see so let's choose this
template let's go to
edit so you should choose a template
that not only looks good but it should
also fit the structure you need for your
online store so keep that in mind so now
we are in the Wix editor the main
interface where you will customize your
website so as you can see here on the
left side you have the main menu which
lets you manage your site's design add
elements and configure settings now at
the top you'll find the toolbar for
quick access like saving your design and
previewing it so the first thing you
have to do is you have to go through the
website you know you must familiarize
yourself with the interface so that it
will make the editing process much
smoother and easier for you so that's
the first thing you have to do just get
familiar with the website options so now
let's get into design designing so as
you can see this is the template and the
template is divided into sections right
so here you have the header section here
you have the main body section here you
have the gallery section and then you
have the footer so each section is fully
customizable okay you even though this
is a template you can change each and
everything of it like the images you
know the text everything so this allows
you to make the site of your own so
let's start with the header first let's
just zoom in a bit yeah so here you can
go to Quick edit to edit the header so
here you can change the background color
adjust the layout you can adjust a
layout and you can edit the menu so
let's just check how we can edit you can
even select images like these kind of
images for the background or you can
keep it plain according to your wish and
according to your creativity basically
okay this so this is how you can change
colors of the header now you'll also
want to manage your site pages so what
you can do is you can go to page and
menu
page and menu from the left hand menu to
add delete or reorder pages okay so
currently in this template this is the
order of the template so first we have
the homepage then we have new
collections then we have collections for
women men right so if you want you can
reorder like suppose if you want the
men's section before women section what
you can do is you can just you know
slide it you can just drag it this is
all drag and drop method you can just
drag it it's that easy it's that simple
okay and even if you want you can add
items also also so for example basically
you try to keep your menu simple but
again you must have like some of the
must have categories are shop about us
and contact right so here we have shop
here we have about us but at you can see
there's no contact so what you can do is
if you want to add contact just add menu
item you can create a new page or you
can create a new section you know you
can create Dynamic pages so right now I
want to create a section now they'll ask
what do you want to link to so is it a
web address is it a document so right
now we want like if you want email for
contact you need email and phone number
right so here you can write in your
email here you can write in your phone
number and press done now next let's add
your stoes logo so as you know logo is
very important for the brand so now
let's see how you can upload your logo
so you can delete this section if you
don't want just do um just a second yeah
press
delete now let's add elements here you
can search like here's a search bar you
can search logo custom logo yeah so
either you can upload your own logo like
if you have created a logo already you
can upload the images from your file or
else which also helps us to create logos
so let's add the logo first adjust it
let's see if the logo is here just a
second yes now let's go to logo design
design my logo okay now again they will
ask you questions about your business so
this is an
online clothing store yes next now they
will just ask you what vibe do you want
for your logo you know what it wants to
represent should it be modern should it
be fun should it be creative so I want
it to be creative basically and it
should be a fresh one yeah you can
choose multiple options give next and
again they'll ask you what text you want
in your logo so basically I I just want
XYZ collection so I just want XYZ so
let's type that in and then you can give
your tagline if you want to or else if
you don't want to you can skip this part
now let's see what Wick suggests the
logos Wick suggests so these are the
logos that big suggests so you can you
know select whichever appeals to you
okay for example right now we just
select
this let's go to customize now here
again even though they have suggested
you a logo you can again you know work
on it and make it better you can change
the color if you didn't like the color
you can change the color if you want to
you can add text to this if you want to
okay you can add shapes you can add
symbols right and even you can upload
images like inside this if you want more
images you can upload images from your
file also so for now let's just so for
now let's just save this okay yes our
logo is created of course you can make
it much better yeah so I've just told
you you can make much better logo with
this like I have just showed you the
options so go through it use your
creativity and make a better logo
because logo is very important like a
well-designed logo is key to your brand
identity so you must ensure that it's
clear and looks great on all devices now
let's customize the hero section
background so here you can again go to
Quick edit you can change the background
color I prefer to keep it plain color
which is better so let's keep it black
now this area must be very well edited
because this is a great place to
Showcase your latest product or
promotions so make sure that you use
high quality images that align with your
Brand's athetics to make a strong first
impression so you can change these
images for that you can go to manage
media so these are the images from the
template so what you can do is you can
actually delete it you know you can
select this particular image you can
delete it right so accordingly you can
delete these images and you can add a
new image from media so if you go to add
media you can you know add the your
product images from your side you can go
to upload media and from your file or
you can drag and drop from your computer
so that's how you upload your image to
the website right now it's time to edit
the text so click on the text box we'll
just see an example click on the text
box choose edit text and we can just
update it with something like you know
summer collection out
now
[Music]
summer collection
out now you can res it to bring it to a
single line yeah now you can change the
font sorry we had to select it I think
this is cool and again you can make it
bold you can make it italics you can
underline it you can change the color
okay let's keep it let's keep it red so
this is how you edit the text
accordingly you can edit texts so your
text should be cleared and consign so be
careful with the you know text color
choose the text font you choose and also
the size of the text you choose because
your text will always contain a strong
call to action so it must really appeal
and also you know draw the attention of
the customers going through your website
so please keep that in mind so now let's
add new sections to the homepage so go
to add section from the left menu and
choose from options like product Gallery
testimonials or newsletter signup so
here let's just go to testimonials for
example now you can just just drag and
drop so these are the templates you can
choose from a drag and drop so you can
just drag and drop it I want it at the
end just before the fotter yeah so it's
done now again as I have already told
you how to you know chain the images and
also work on the text you can use those
and customize your testimonial section
so now let's customize the page footer
so here you can add your stores contact
information social media links and
important legal links like terms of
services and privacy policy so you must
make sure your fooo contains all the
essential links and information
customers might need including return
policies and customer service details
also so now let's see how to add contact
form so customer interaction is crucial
so let's add a contact form for that you
have to go to elements add elements you
can select contact form you can just
search
here contact strips and again you can
drag it to your choosen section so
customize the fields according to your
needs such as name email and message so
adding a contact from ensures that
customers you know can easily reach to
you with questions or feedback so
consider setting up an automatic
response to acknowledge inquiries
promptly so this is how you can edit
your website in Wix website now before
going live so like now our next step is
going live so before going live you'll
want to connect a custom domain to your
site right so for that you can go to
settings and select connect domain so
you can either purchase a new domain
through Wix or connect one you already
have so having a custom domain adds
professionalism and make it easier for
customers to find you online right so
while choosing a domain choose a domain
name that reflects your brand and which
is easy to remember mostly avoid using
numbers of hyph if possible so after
connecting your domain you'll be taken
to the vix dashboard so this is your
command center where you can manage
orders track inventory and you can also
access analytics so from here you can
also update your site manage a SE and
settings and send marketing emails so
you must regularly check your dashboard
to stay on top of orders and site
performance so you can use the Analytics
tool to refine your marketing strategies
so before we publish it's essential to
preview your website right so click
preview button which is at the top right
to see how your site looks on both
desktop and mobile so this is how your
site looks on desktop you can also click
here to see how it looks in a mobile see
this is how it looks in a mobile so you
can slide
pretty cool right so you must ensure
that everything is working perfectly
from navigation links to the checkout
process so test every link and form to
make sure your site functions flawlessly

before your customers do so now once

we'll click on add to Chrome

allow and it is integrated I
believe
yes so as you can see it is also showing
a quick start tutorial select a prom
template enter the WordPress or more
send
message so
you'll click on get if you want to view
tutorials you can click on this
otherwise you can get started with aibm
so as you can see the whole layout the
whole interface is changed there are lot
of things over here let me explain to
you guys what all these things are all
right so there are various Options under
public and own from which you can filter
prompts by uh topic as you can see or
activity and then uh prompts can be
sorted by a top which videos trending as
you can
see and uh there are actually 4892
prompts available and uh you can see the
first 12 on this page as you can
see and some examples of prompts here is
like you can say us SE optimized content
writer human written 100% unique SE
optimized article so these are the
examples of prompt now first of all
we'll ask Chad gbt to write a blog post
for us on let's say Fitness
all right so we'll ask J
gbt Fitness in
everyday
lifestyle all right uh let's click on
this so we haven't used any prompt till
yet so let's just first put this input
and let's see what CH gbt gives us
all
right so as you can see this is the
topic name importance of everyday
Fitness simple strategies to incorporate
Fitness and we can see subtopics are
also
there all
right and here's the conclusion all
right so this is basically our blog post
so now let's say we want to optimize
this blog post and we want to do SEO on
this one sh so let's first just copy
this
we'll copy this and paste in
our
document all right so this is our
document and we have pasted this all
right now let's go back over here and
let's say we want to write it in a more
familiar or you can say friendly tone
and in a more explanatory tone you can
also use so let's just write this
don't worry about the spelling guys uh
chat you take care of this all right so
let's see what are the changes in both
of these blog
post let's just wait to finish
it and here's the conclusion so this is
the second block post so let's
understand the difference uh in between
these these two first we'll first check
out for this one start small begin with
manageable changes all
right as you can see here it is begin
with manageable changes take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destinations or stand and stretch
during work breaks these small efforts
can add up over time all right let's
just see what is written over here in
the second block Post in the second
block post it is written
begin with manageable changes that fit
seamlessly into your daily routine for
example or for instance choose to take
the stairs instead of elevator walk or
bike to nearby destination instead of
driving or stand and stretch during work
breaks these small efforts can
accumulate over time and contribute to
your overall Fitness so if you want to
take the second one which is a few
changes it is more bit
explanatory uh compared to the first one
we can just copy past this this one as
well so you can uh write a second prompt
as well in which if you want to write in
a friendly tone or in a formal tone you
can write like that all you have to do
is to just write the prompt in chat gbt
let's just copy paste it we replace it
with the First with the second
one all right so now we are back in chat
gbt so now basically we have the blog
post content basically we have the
content of it now we want to polish it
we want to select the best title out of
it and many more things so for that
let's just make use of prompts instead
of writing all these prompts by yourself
you can make use of the prompts that is
that comes with aipm chat gbt prompts
all right so let's just say we want to
write about the title we want to select
a perfect title for this blog post so
what we can do is we'll go over here and
first of all we'll select in topics
we'll go and we'll select copyrighting
because we want to write about the as
optimized title we want the best title
we'll select
copyrighting
confirm all right now after this you can
just go
for prompts what whichever you
like I'm going to go for this one blog
post title generator as you can see also
if you didn't get what you wanted then
you can go for the search engine over
here you can just type let just say if
you want to uh want to if you're writing
a script basically and you want a
perfect title for it then you can write
a script generator or something like
that over here automatically whichever
prompts that are relevant to it will
come all right so uh we have selected
this one blog post title generator
because we have to create a title for
our blog post we'll click on this and
now all we have to do is to write the
name of our blog post the name of our
blog post is we'll select everyday
Lifestyle Fitness in everyday lifestyle
let's just select this
one all right now as you can see you can
select the titles to write it is five
let's just select 10 all right now the
language you can select English and many
more languages are there we'll keep it
in English itself tone emotional or
default let's just be default itself
poetic default default itself we'll keep
it like this all right
now click on this let's just
see so according to chat gbta PRM prompt
these are the 10 best title that we can
Implement in our block post now what we
want to do is select one best title out
of it all right so these are 10 we have
to select one out of it so for that
we'll go to Google Keyword Planner
so this is Google Keyword Planner we'll
click on this find your campaign
keywords we'll click on this visit
Keyword Planner now you guys might be
thinking what is Google Keyword Planner
so let me explain to you
guys so this Google Keyword Planner is a
free tool that helps you find keywords
for your online content it shows you how
often people search for certain words
and phrases and how much competition
there is to rank for those keywords
this way you can choose the best
keywords to Target in your ads or blog
post or website to attract more visitors
and potential customers so it'll give
you the numbers basically which are
mostly ranking and having the
competition all right so we'll click on
discover new
keywords and let's select where it is
we'll select the first
10 go to Google Keyword Planner and now
here we will paste it so all 10 of them
are pasted now what we'll do is we'll
click on get results so after clicking
on get results as you can
see so this is average monthly searches
this is competition the we want the
maximum monthly searches Fitness healthy
lifestyle and low in competition so
according to your preference you can
select from here and whichsoever this is
100 to 1 million and many more more
topics you can select from here which
has low competition so as you can see
this treadmill has more uh average view
100K to 1 million but the competition is
also high so we should keep the
competition low as well so we should
keep in mind so we can select our best
title from it so whichever
suits all right after selecting the best
title we can go
to our what we call this blog post
to change the title so this is the new
title let's keep it like
this all right so now our title is done
now let's go back to chat
GPT and here is a chat
gbt and now let's go to
the it's layout now here we want to
write the content regarding that
regarding that title so what we'll do is
basically we'll go over here and we'll
select
SEO and once we have selected it we'll
go we'll select this prompt human
written 100% used SE optimized article
now based on that title that we have
generated we'll write a complete content
on it we'll use the help of this prompt
so as you can see G gbt 3.5 turbo gbt 4
gbt 4 we'll select
this and paste our typ title this is our
title transform your life how everyday
Fitness can boost your health so now
this prom will generate the content
based on this title all right now let's
see as you can see transform your life
how every day fitness can boost your
health this is the content
outline the article outline you can
say so this is is the introduction what
is everyday Fitness then physical
fitness
benefits and it keeps on
writing I believe it will it will be a
long article or
blog so you don't have to write too many
prompts for this you can just do this
and the whole thing will take care of it
all as you can see fqs are also being
generated by this prompt otherwise we
would have wrote another prompt for the
FAQ and many things are there that
should be in there in the article or
blog so yeah now we can select our
article or blog we can
say so we have the title we don't want
the outline let's
say we'll take it from here from the
introduction it's a long article I
believe as you can see this last
question is not completed but you can
click on continue generating and it'll
complete that we don't want the last
question I think three questions or four
questions are sufficient for us so now
as we have copied it first of all we
need to make sure that our content is
unique it is not plagarized because we
can't publish or use the plagarized
content so we have to be sure that we
are using the unique content for that
we'll have to go to this site known
as duply
Checker we'll click on this first link
and now as you can see here we can copy
and paste it paste we can just exclude
this last question as I told
you all right now our content our
article is pasted now we will check the
plagarism
all right first of all we'll have to
tell them that we are not a robot and
then we have to click on check
plug all right so it is showing maximum
th000 words allowed per search all right
so let's just do one
thing we'll do it because if you want to
do thousand words you'll have to go for
their pro version or the premium version
so we now have
to use some part of it not the complete
part it's actually a long article so
from the rule we'll take
as you can see number of words is 5
not5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
12% uni all right so plagarism is uh 3%
I think that can be that can we can
neglect it and now let's check for the
rest of this
one all right
all right here we'll copy and paste
it check
lism as you can see number of words 67
one 0% plagarism 12% unique so I don't
think it will be a problem so it is good
to go I believe and now we just copy and
paste
it so
let's take it from here
all right so this is our content now so
content was not plagarized but let's
just say if it is plagarized and is not
unique so what should we do then we can
simply put a prompt in chat gbt that
make it non- plagarized or make it
unique or rephrase it but let's say uh
that plagerized Checker the duply
Checker mentions the particular lines or
where there is plagarism so you can
select that line put into chat GPD and
ask them to rephrase or make it
plagarism free by doing this you can
make the complete content plagarism free
it is very easy or else you can use a
prompt from aibm as I told you all you
have to do is to just type plagarism
free content writer and a particular
prompt will come you can just put your
content in that prompt and the rest
check will take care of all right now to
boost your SEO strategy you must focus
on eat that is expertise authora
liveness and trustworthiness and keep
that human element strong use CH gity to
improve your content with interesting
verified facts and relevant examples
create a FAQ section to answer common
questions and look for any missing
information to fill in these steps will
help you make high quality content that
connects with your audience and ranks
better in search engines so for that
we'll write a prompt to uh chat GPT to
include the what we call FAQs and the uh
statistics if you want to uh make use of
statistics and fqs and include it in our
content so how should we do that let's
just understand it let's come to our
chat GPT again now here what we'll do is
we'll write a simple prompt
saying no no no first we go to the new
topic now here because otherwise it will
keep on writing in that prompt itself
all right we'll write
please add two what we call
stats or you can write
statistics and one
analogy and uh F AQ
section with
answers to
this
content draft to
increase
engagement all right now you want to uh
if you want to paste a particular
section of your content you can also do
that or else you can face the entire
content it's as per your choice so let
me just paste a particular
section let's just paste this one
and all right let's
see all right so as you can see
statistics studies show that engaging in
just 30 minutes of moderate physical
activity each day can reduce the risk of
chronic disease like heart disease so
these are the statistics and these are
the analogies and this is the FAQ
section that you can include in your
content or a particular section of the
content usually these statistics are
included in the introduction part to
make it more interesting so you can make
use of it and do that all right moving
forward let's understand the chat GT
prompts for meta titles and descriptions
so crafting meta titles and descriptions
is essential for drawing readers
attention so it is necessary that we
should use that all right so uh now
we'll be writing a particular prompt for
it for
that for the content part I'll be
leaving the
space content here

create a meta description
and title for this content here this

can you have to use the entire content
but I'm just showing showing you so you
can use this one itself it will be more
than enough don't have to worry about

know what keyword research is let's dive
into why it's so important picture this
you are hosting a party would you invite
random people who might not even be
interested or would you carefully choose
guests who are excited to attend so
keyword research helps you do the latter
by attracting the right guests to your
website when you know the exact keywords
your audience is searching for you can
tailor your content to meet their needs
this increases your chances of not only
driving more traffic but also engaging
visitors who are genuinely interested in
what you have to offer the better you
understand your audience search Behavior
the more effective your content will be
remember it's not just about quantity
getting the right kind of traffic is key
to conversions and overall success
moving on let's talk about the different
types of keywords you'll encounter in
your research this is important because
not all keywords are created equal and
understanding the distin itions can
greatly impact your strategy so short
tail keywords are Broad and usually
consist of one or two words like SEO or
marketing now these keywords have high
search volumes which means lots of
people are searching for them however
they're also highly competitive making
it tough to rank for them unless you
have a very authorative website next
comes longtail keywords Now longtail
keywords on the other hand are most
specific phrases like how to do do
keyword research for SEO now while they
have lower search volumes they tend to
be less competitive and more targeted
attracting visitors who are further
along in their buyo Journey for instance
someone searches for best budget laptops
for students is likely closer to make a
purchase than someone just searching for
laptops now next type of keyword is LSI
which is Latin semantic indexing
keywords now these are related terms
that search engines consider relevant to
your main keyword now for example if
your main keyword is digital marketing
then LSI keywords could be online
marketing SEO strategies or social media
advertising now even in this example if
you have given best leather shoes the
lsis would be official and Casual Wear
best food wear Brand orgin leather shoes
Etc so using LSI keywords helps you
create more contextually relevant
content with search engines favor Now by
balancing these types of keywords you
can create content that appeals to both
Broad and Niche audiences giving your
website a better chance to rank well
across different searches so all right
now that we have covered the types of
keywords let's explore some of the tools
that can help you find them so keyword
research tools are like treasure maps
they guide you to the keywords that can
drive the most traffic to your website
number one is Google Keyword Planner so
Google Keyword Planner is a fantastic
starting point especially for beginners
it's free and provides a wealth of
information including search volumes and
competition levels for various keywords
you can also discover new keyword ideas
based on what people are already
searching for next is ahrs ahrs is a
more advanced paid tool that offers
in-depth analysis it doesn't just give
you keyword data it also provides
insights into how difficult it is to
rank for a particular keyword as well as
click through rates CTR and related
keyword ideas so ASR is particularly
useful for competitor analysis helping
you see which keywords for your
competitors are ranking for and
identifying gaps in their cont content
that you can exploit now next comes sem
rush now sem Rush is another powerful
tool that goes beyond keyword research
it offers comprehensive data on keywords
including Trends over time and allows
you to conduct competitive analysis
track keyword performance and more semm
Rush is a go tool for many SEO
professionals because of its all in-one
capabilities so these tools simplify the
process of keyword research allowing you
to focus on creating content that will
resonate with your audience and perform
well in search engine results so with so
many tools at your disposal the next
step is figuring out how to actually
find the best keywords for your content
so here's a step-by-step approach number
one start with a brainstorming session
so you can list down potential keywords
related to your topic think about what
your audience might search for and
consider different variations of those
phrases so use the keyword research
tools we just discussed to analyze these
keywords pay close attention to search
volume competition and user intent the
goal is to find keywords that have a
good search volume but aren't too
competitive and next consider user
intent this is crucial ask yourself what
is a Searcher hoping to find if someone
is searching for best travel laptops in
2024 they're probably looking for
product reviews or recommendations tell
your content to meet that specific
intent and you'll have a much better
chance of converting those visitors into
customers so by following these steps
you you can pinpoint the keywords that
will not only drive traffic but also
ensure that the traffic is relevant and
likely to convert now one of the most
effective ways to find high quality
keywords is by analyzing your
competitors this might sound like a spy
mission but it's completely above board
and Incredibly valuable so tools like
semrush allow you to see which keywords
your competitors are ranking for so this
gives you insight into what's working
for them and more importantly it
highlights gaps in their strategy that
you can exploit for instance if you
notice that a competitor is ranking well
for a keyword like affordable SEO tools
but the content is outdated or lacking
in detail you can create a more
comprehensive and upto-date piece to
outrank them so by leveraging competitor
insights you can stay ahead in the SEO
game ensuring that your content is
always relevant and competitive now
finding the right keywords is only half
the battle the next challenge is using
them effectively in your content so
here's how you can do that number one
place your primary keywords in strategic
locations such as title meta description
headers and throughout the content this
signals to search engines that your
content is about helping you rank for
that keyword number two avoid keyword
stuffing this old school tactic doesn't
work anymore and can actually hurt your
rankings instead focus on naturally
integrating keywords and using
variations for example if your primary
keyword is digital marketing strategy
you could also use online marketing
strategy or effective digital marketing
tactics to make your cont content more
readable and engaging now the third one
is using LSI keywords to add depth and
context to your content this not only
improves readability but also helps
search engines understand the broader
topic of your content which can
positively impact your rankings remember
the goal is to create content that's
both optimized for search engines and
enjoyable for your readers lastly
keyword research is not a set it and
forgeted process it requires regular
monitoring and adjustment Su is a
constantly evolving field and what works
today might not work tomorrow so make it
a habit to regularly check how your
keywords are performing use tools like
Google analytics to track your rankings
and see which keywords are driving the
most traffic if you notice that certain
keywords are underperforming consider
tweaking your content or trying out new
keywords so by staying on top of your
keyword strategy you can ensure that
your content continues to perform well
and adapt to changes in search Trends
and there you have it a comprehensive
guide to keyword research I hope you
found this tutorial helpful and that you

keywords for your content remember

Power of content plan first determine
the niche you're passionate about
whether it's technology Fitness travel
or any other topic once you have
identified your Niche it's it's time to
leverage chart GPT so as you can see we
have log in our chart GPT and you can
simply ask chart GPT to suggest blog
post ideas for your chosen topic for
example you could type uh suggest blog
post ideas for a tech blog so I'll just
simply type here
and I'll just press enter so as you can
see chat GPT has given some blog post
ideas and these are the topics we can
look into so these ideas aren't just
random suggestions they are the building
blocks of your content calendar with
these topics in hand you can plan out
your blog post for the upcoming months
ensuring that your content creation is
consistent and targeted the approach not
only keeps your blog organized but also
helps you stay focused on delivering
value to your audience regularly so now
that we have our content planned in
place it's time to move on to the next
crucial part of the blogging process
this step will ensure that your blog
post will not only reach your audience
but also rank highly on search engine so
you can pick any topic you want from
here suppose suppose my topic is cyber
security threats in 2024 all right now
the next step is keyword research in the
world of blogging keywords are like GPS
for your content they guide your readers
straight to your blog so the next step
is conducting keyword research keywords
are essential for search engine
optimization which is SEO because they
help your blog rank higher in search
engine result making it easier for your
target audience to find your content
with chat GPT the process becomes
incredibly efficient you can start by
asking chat GPT to generate a list of
potential keywords for your blog for
example uh let's type here give me short
tail and longtail keywords give me short
tail and long tail keywords for the
particular topic which you have chosen
for example I've chosen this topic which
is cyber security threats in
2024 so I'll just press enter so as you
can see chat GPT will give a list of
short tail keywords and longtail
keywords as well it's important to
validate these keywords using an SEO
tool like Google key planner so you can
validate these keywords using Google
Keyword Planner so let me show you a
quick demo on how we can search using
Google Keyword Planner so I'll just type
here Google Keyword Planner so as you
can see I'll just simply sign in here so
here this is the interface of Google
Keyword Planner you just have to click
on discover new keywords and you can uh
type anything for example uh the topic
name is cyber
security security that's it and the
language you have selected is English
and we will click on get results so as
you can see that Google has given us a
list of all the keywords related to this
topic the broad level keywords we have
total 658 keywords ideas available you
can also add filter here and uh suppose
low range high range or exclude keywords
in my account anything you want to alter
and suppose I click your brand or
non-brand keywords suppose you want
keywords for your platform like corera
code Udi UD anything so you can just
untick the other brands and then it will
give you the keywords related to that
particular platform and yes these are
the monthly searches and the
competition status everything you can
just simply see from here so these are
the keywords which are having monthly
searches of around 100K to 1 million all
right so you can pick any keyword from
here suppose this is cyber security I'll
just copy paste you can also download
your keywords so this is how you can
search your keywords using keyword
Google Keyword Planner so we'll go back
to chat GPT as you can see these tools
will provide you the valuable data such
as search volume keyword difficulty and
competition level this ensures that your
target in the right keywords that can
bring substantial traffic to your blog
so by combining the power of char GPT
with reliable SEO tools you are setting
the foundation for a well optimized blog
that can rank well and attract the right
audience now let's move on to our next
step which is analyzing content gaps now
that we have understood the content plan
and how do we do the keyword research
it's time to gain a Competitive Edge by
analyzing content Gap so content gaps
are opportunities where your competitors
might be missing out and you can step in
to provide valuable content that fills
those voids so chat GPT can assist you
in this process by helping you to
analyze what top ranking blogs are doing
and how they might be lacking so we can
just simply type a prompt here which is
analyze the content gaps suppose
analyze the
content
gaps and you can just mention the
competitor's blog post so we can simply
uh search for that keyword which we have
chosen cyber security and you can see
the first blog post which is from Cisco
what is cyber security so we'll just uh
copy this domain I mean the web address
and here we'll just copy paste and just
simply click enter so as you can see the
chat GB was enabl to analyze the content
Gap so we will just again we will give

improve or expand your content to offer
something unique and comprehensive by

that others might have overlooked giving
you a distinct advantage in the crowded
blogging landscape so uh this strategy
not only enhances your content but also
position you as an authority in your
Niche attracting more readers and high
ranking on search engines so as you can

truly establish your blog as an
authorative source in your nishe it's
important to create topic clusters so
topic clusters are groups of relateded
blog post that revolve around a central
theme this strategy not only helps with

ebook in many ways so in this video
Let's understand how to create ebook for
that let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat GPT so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the interest you have the
passion and you good at it for example
let's say somebody's good at the
knowledge regarding cars or regarding
bikes or regarding anything he must he
or she must have the value to provide to
the audiences that content he should
write the ebook on for example so let's
take an example like I'm writing an
ebook on how to make money online right
so what should I write so I'll start
with writing the prompt just a second
there we go
go write
an ebook
for
titled how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated images for each
chapter this ebook
book will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there titled how to
make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed charity to create
eight pages divided into six chapters
each chapter will be explained in
humanlike Manner and long paragraphs it
should be long paragraphs also use AI
generated images in between the chapter
for the better explanation so let's see
what the result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products
online affiliate marketing online
tutoring and courses so six chapters are
there all right so Chad GPT has given us
all the chapters that we have asked chat
GPT for now we want it the images also
like AI generated images also so let's
write a prompt for it as we are not able
to see the
images so I'm writing where are the AA
generated images
that I asked
for I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us chapter
wise images all right so it is giving us
chapter wise images here is the air
generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
our a generated images that we asked for
and now we can use each of these images
in between the ebooks selling products
online affiliate products and online
tutoring and courses the images what I
think the images is pretty well that I
expected
now you rebook how to make online
includes aent images for each chapter
all right so what we asked for chat gbt
it gave us sometimes it happens that
what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now the thing is
we want all these images to be inside
this one in this doc not this doc but
this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include in between can you include these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that that let's just use this also this
only we'll
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write
compile the
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document
file all
right I think chat gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just just add another prompt let's just
stop it and just copy paste this one and
we'll be adding another prompt so that
we can tell chat gbt that use this
format instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into gpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see chj has
given the answer I have compiled the
document with converted JP Fage properly
integrated you can download the ebook
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that chat
gbd has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own CH GT helped us in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is how to make
money online so now we can also make the
changes in between the profit of writing
the document in Word is that only we can
always convert this document into PDF by
going to various sites but let's just
create first in the document file so
that you can also do editing and changes
and if you want to add something then
also you can easily do that so that's
why we have created into the document
format so as we can see freelancing then
there is the image as we can see we can
also resize it all right as you can see
we have resized it so this way you can
also edit it and whatever you like I
mean it's up to you it's it's very
subjective to people what they want to
do for their ebook so it's up to them if
they want to add something in more
detail or they can also Showcase with
the help of an example then they can
definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well and another thing is let's say uh I
want to change it a bit like let's say
online service and market research is
there then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what will I do is
we simply copy paste it or you can use
from chat gbt also we have copied it and
now we'll go to chat GPT all right now
I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand
H now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want chgb to more explain explain
it in an elaborated way so here it is
blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your Niche setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that jgb
has didn't and now what I'll do is I'll
just simply copy it let's say I've
copied it now I'll go back to the doc
this is the doc and I'm just showing the
example right I'll just paste it now
let's
see all right online
service and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added and
basically we got the format basically
all these things are done so we don't
need to worry about that even we want to
make any changes it is very easy to do
that as we have just saw now the next
thing that we want to focus on is the
mockup or the cover photo or the mockup
photos for that basically we want to
Market this digital product this ebook
we want to Market it so what we'll do is
we'll have to create a cover or mockup
so there are many ways to do that and as
we told you that we will be creating
this free of cost how to do all these
thing in free so we'll go to canva all
right now we'll write a prompt uh what
prompt should we write we write create a
AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster image
for ebook that I can use as a cover for
it all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give give
me the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over here
create few
more only create image and not the
background just creating some more
images let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the last
photo so basically you have to
manipulate chat G2 to give you the exact
thing that you are asking for so for
that you have to write multiple times
The Prompt sometime it happens so it's
pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert this
by mistake I wrot something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the image
sorry this is the
image and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpreter session expired I
believe we'll have to create another
one so let's say we want to download
this
have to make sure it is in the JP
format so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one and let's see save mockup
so this is how you can create a mockup
for your digital product your dial ebook
and then you can easily download it so
once you have downloaded it you can put
it into use now the next thing is how
you can Market it that is the next
challenge for that you have to go to the
free websites that can that lets you to
upload all the your ebooks and sell it
there are many websites some are paid
and some are free also but before moving
there let me tell you guys the version
of Chad GPT that I'm using is chat gp4
you can also do the same thing with chat
gbt 3.5 also but it doesn't give you the
feature of downloading all these images
or whatsoever you want so for that you
don't have to worry all you have to go
is to go on
canva and we click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
now the first thing you'll do is you
have to get the ebook template so you'll
search for ebook and you can select the
ebook template whatsoever you want you
can select as per your choice for
example let's see this one this one is
free so you can customize this template
and then you can copy paste from chat
gbt as chat gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the
feature to download all these things so
all you have to do is just copy all
these the all the content that we uh
previously done and just paste it over
here and you can also add page or
something like that so it is very easy
you can you know edit this so it'll be
easy for you and then you can download
it so you don't have to worry if you
don't have the paid version of Chad gbt
you can easily do that in with the help
of canva so you don't have to worry
about that now coming to the part where
we were explaining how to Market it how
to sell it and where to sell it
basically so for that we'll go to a site
instam Mojo So it allows you to you know
create your own digital product and sell
it free of cost so for that we'll log in
it's pretty simple and so once we have
logged in so we have to fill up the
details so basic detail it is very easy
you can easily fill up the details as it
is showing payment collection is not
enabled on your account so I'm showing
you the demo of it so that's why I've
not done that but it is very easy on and
it's free of course so it is very easy
for you guys as well so once you have
done the sign up and all as you can see
shortcuts add a product digital file
even ticket manage store categories
there are many things not only ebooks
you can Market over here there are many
things you can do right so for that what
we'll do is we'll go to add a product
digital file so our digital product is
our ebook for that we have created a
mockup that we have downloaded it from
canva this one so now we have the this
option of adding a product so you can
see I'm a coffee like this you can do
you can set the price and you can put in
the account details so people who are
interested in can easily buy the product
from you so it is very easy and it is
also sh physical product digital file
even tickets others so as we know in
digital file it is showing ebooks
digital art software or any file that
can be downloadable we'll click on this
and then you can easily upload the file
so so once we have uploaded then we can
here add the image product image that is
the our mockup that we have
curated all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional and the number of downloads per
buyer so you can easily do all these
things it is very easy you don't have to
worry about that and all these features
are there then in the end you can just
Market it so using chat gbt you can
easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of chat gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
gbt also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can't download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
down download it from there and I have
also shown you how to create mockups and
all so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
and do what you want to do first
question that you might be asking an
interview is differentiate between do
follows and no follows okay so if youve
taken or listen to my SEO courses on
YouTube for SEO we we talked a lot about
do follows and no follows and and simp
put I mean do follows are just signals
to the search engines to follow the link
so there's a link on site a pointing to
site B we're going to basically tell
Google Bing and some of these other
search engines hey go ahead and follow
that link now I know follow is just the
opposite so no follow link doesn't allow
the search engine crawlers to follow it
so if we have a link on our site s site
a pointing to site B we can put a no
follow tag in there and what that's
going to do it's going to to signal to
the Crawlers hey don't follow this link
so in the end if the Crawlers don't
follow the link then there's not going
to be any link juice past and so Google
is not going to give you credit or give
that site credit for having a link
pointing to it or pointing to another
site or from another site and so it's
all about linking so we can control if
there's links on our site whether we
want the Crawlers to recognize those or
not simply with no follow Texs so just a
reminder link use is the reputation or
Equity pass from one website to another
so if you have a link on another website
and that website is of high quality
meaning their page Authority their
domain Authority is high they have a lot
of content you know they're not spammy
they're really rich and they're relevant
then you may want to make sure that the
link pointing from that site to your
site is a no follow so that way that
Google can recognize the link from that
site to your site and basically that
reputation is going to be passed on to
you okay so that's a do follow versus a
no follow and why would we do a no
follow well it just depends it really
depends a lot of social media platforms
like Facebook have no follows if you
have a lot of content you may not want
to be pushing out a lot of du follows it
could actually look bad from an external
linking standpoint and so a lot of sites
are really particular about who they
want to pass link ju some to and give
credit for the link so it's a business
decision at the end of the day there's
really no hard fast rule here except
from an SEO perspective if I have a site
and I have a lot of external links
pointing outward to other sites I'm
going to be particular about who I allow
the search engine to follow and what
links I allow not to follow okay so
here's an example of what they look like
so do follow is simply just the hre
notice the no follow has the the tag
pended to it the hre tag with a no
follow so if the search engines crawling
your site and they see that no follow
there they're not going to follow that
link and vice versa if there's a link on
another site pointing to yours and
there's a no follow there you're not
going to get credit the search engines
are I'm going to pick up that link okay
so question two what is 301 redirect and
how is it different from a 302 redirect
so 301 redirects tell users in the
search engine specifically that an
original page has has been moved and
this is the keyw here permanently so
permanently moved we're going to explain
that in a minute so it's just moved from
one page to another and so if we don't
have a page anymore but we have a new
page let's just say you built a new
website with new URLs you want to make
sure the old page is pointing to the new
page with a 301 redirect so if a 301
redirect is permanent then a 302 is
temporary so we want the search engines
to recognize that we have 301 permanent
redirects in place why because if we
have temporary then it might alert
Google to not keep that page in its
search engine rankings because it's
temporary so why would Google want to
keep a temporary page or even a page
that is pointing to another page on a
temporary basis so they may remove both
pages from its index okay but if we have
something permanent in place Google may
say okay this page is permanently
linking to another page or redirecting
to another page therefore it's stable
it's permanent we're going to keep that
new page in the index and eventually
remove the old page so really something
permanent is more stable in the eyes of
the search engine something temporary
may not be as stable in the eyes of say
Google and if they don't see it as
stable then they may remove both pages
from the index okay so the ideas we want
to be found in Google search index and
we get it sometimes Pages go away for a
variety of reasons and if it does go
away just make sure you have a new page
for it and that new page is a 301
permanent redirect okay so question
three why are backlinks important in SEO
well we kind of hinted on that a bit
with the no follow because if we have a
link from another website pointing to
ours and that link from that other
website is really relevant and and it
has a high page and domain Authority
then it's going to benefit us and so
backlinks are important because if we
have backlinks from high quality sites
it's going to improve the credibility of
our site especially if it's a do follow
tag so the search engines are going to
recognize the relationship between the
site that has a link pointing to us okay
so it's just going to build our
credibility it's going to increase
increase our domain Authority and then
the net effect of that is if we're
credible and we have high domain
Authority
then that's going to increase the
rankings of our pages and when the pages
increase in ranking then we're going to
get more of a Lion Share of the traffic
for certain keywords that our pages are
found for and if our pages are found and
getting traffic then because we have
increased rankings we're likely going to
have increased traffic and then it's
just a snowball effect so more traffic
leads to more engagement and conversions
so the whole idea for SEO is remember
you have an onpay page strategy and an
off-page strategy building external
links is part of an off-page SEO
strategy and we want to make sure that
you know we are relevant in the form of
a link or in the form of content on
other high quality sites being on a high
quality site only benefits us because
again increases our D domain Authority
Google sees this is more relevant
therefore pages are going to benefit by
ranking higher and therefore when we
rank higher we get more traffic so it's
a Snowball Effect so having backlinks is
important because it snowballs all the
way through to conversions okay so what
are the best practices to rank your
videos on YouTube this is a great
question really great question given the
importance of videos especially with SEO
cuz videos are found YouTube in itself
is a search engine so if we have a video
how are we going to get it to rank on
YouTube well first things first you
never want to put a video out there and
want it to rank if it's not engaging or
formative so make sure you go ahead and
follow the best practices of having
engaging in informative content in your
video now once you have that video in
place you want to optimize it and then
some of the key factors for optimizing
the video are you want to choose a title
that has high search volume and low
difficulty just as you would keyword for
example for web page you want to choose
a title with a keyword in it that has
high volume and low difficulty I.E low
competition okay so you want a nice
ratio there and you know when you want
to choose a title it's going to get
people to watch the video too so it's
not all about just choosing a title just
for the sake of high volume you also
have to choose something that's relevant
that's going to be catchy as well and
then with that title goes the
description so you want a description
that's very relevant to your title okay
because most people aren't going to
click on a video just for the sake of
the title they're going to want to
probably get a sneak peek via the
description what it is so again you want
to optimize that description but make
sure the description is is just as
snazzy as the title okay you also want
to use accurate and relevant video tags
just as you would on Twitter or Facebook
tag these videos okay so make sure your
title tag length doesn't exceed 100
characters because it will get chopped
off so again that goes back to just
writing something really short and to
the point that's going to grab
somebody's attention okay you also want
to upload a captivating thumbnail
something that's relevant then that's
going to grab somebody's attention and
then again we set it similar to the
video tags we want to use relevant
hashtags again just as you would with
Twitter and Facebook go ahead and throw
some hashtags in there that people could
see because people search via
hashtagging and then this goes about
saying you did all the work created a
really great video it's engaging it's
informative you optimized it feel free
to promote your video on other social
media platforms okay don't just stick
with YouTube per se so the benefit here
is if you post it on Facebook or
LinkedIn or whatever platform of your
choice and it gets engagement people
click on the link go to YouTube they're
going to like it and then other people
are going to see that engagement they're
going to see how many people liked it or
how many subscribers you have so promote
your videos to help you with the ranking
of the video on YouTube so that does
does play into it so go ahead and
promote it so other people can watch it
like it comment Etc and that's going to
engage other people to want to do the
same so what is mobile first indexing
this is a really important and timely
question mobile first indexing means
Google's just using mobile friendly
content for indexing and ranking
websites so in other words Google for
example has two Bots they have the
traditional desktop bot and they have
have a smartphone bot and eventually
everybody that has a website is going to
be migrated over to the smartphone bot
and so if that smartphone bot goes to
your website and starts crawling what do
you think they're looking for they're
smartphone bot they're looking for
mobile friendly content if it's not
mobile friendly meaning the page isn't
designed for a smartphone browser or
let's just say the images are way too
large or you have to expand the text
just to read it you know a lot of these
these issues that somebody would have
just simply trying to read something on
a web page on their mobile device
Google's not going to grab that content
so you want to make sure it's mobile
friendly so it gets indexed and so if
your website has a responsive design
Google will rank your website based on
its performance on mobile devices okay
so you want to make sure that your
website is mobile friendly and if you're
in an interview and somebody asked you
this question you can even take it a
step further and say look I'm going to
measure how friendly my my website is
for mobile devices in Google search
console because Google search console
has a report that will show you what
pages on your website are not mobile
friendly and it's not a guarantee but I
could tell you if I'm Google and I'm
crawling your site with my smartphone
bot and that page or one of my pages is
not mobile friendly I'm probably not
going to index it or rank it so you want
to leverage that report in Google sear
search console to see what pages are
mobile friendly so that's a little bonus
for you to really impress the
interviewer who asks you this question
because how you going to know if one of
your pages is mobile friendly or not if
you don't look at a report so keep an
eye on Google search consoles mo mobile
usability report okay number six list
down the most important local SEO
ranking factors okay so organic local
ranking is just as important as anything
else in organic search because if you
have a local business you want to use
the likes of say Google my business to
show up when somebody types in you know
looking for a florist or you looking for
a coffee shop so what you want to do is
you want to create a web page for every
product and service and you also want to
opt for your business listings on Google
my business and and there are plenty of
other local business directories out
there like Yelp for example or Bing even
has one so go ahead and also make sure
you have a business listing as well but
since Google in the United States as a
huge market share you want to start with
Google first you want to update your nap
citations on your website maintain
consistency of your nap okay so nap is
name address phone number so you want to
make sure that that's current and
consistent so if you have a number on
your website make sure it's the same
number on Google my business okay you
can embed a Google map on your website
you could certainly optimize the
metatags and content not only on your
web pages but within your Google my
business directory so you can add your
business to other local directories like
I mentioned yel and then also just as
important op for reviews and ratings
okay so the more reviews the H you have
the better off you are okay so I always
say this with or with local search three
of the main factors
and showing up for local search on say
Google is obviously the keyword the
second is the proximity of where that
person is and then third is the reviews
so you can't really control the
proximity but you can control the
keyword and you can control the reviews
to some degree so work hard at getting
reviews for your business but at the
same time you can certainly work in some
keywords let's just say for your product
and service pages on your website but
also you can translate that over to
Google my business okay so working in
those keywords making sure your your
number your address your name they're
all consistent and and really just
spreading your the the business out on
other directories that's really all
these are really key factors for local
SEO okay so question number seven how to
avoid duplicate content getting
penalized for duplicate content so for
example if you have two different
versions of a web page you may result in
a duplicate content issue so it's just
SEO 101 you never want to have two two
or more pages with the same content so
what do we do well we can avoid this in
having Google penalize us by again
setting up a 301 redirect remember 301's
are permanent we can also use what they
call a canonical tag and a canonical tag
basically alerts the search engines as
to which page is the original okay so if
we have an or origal page we want to
point to that page with our canonical
tag and then the third option is opt for
preferred domain in Google search
console okay so if you have multiple no
names make sure you set up a primary one
in search console so those are ways to
work around it of this three I would
always go with the canonical tags
because that's just a tag that's going
to sit on the page it's going to alert
Google as to what the original is just
in case they get their hands on the
duplicate so all the pages that have the
same content are are going to have the
same canonical tag pointing to one page
so again three ones are permanent you
can simply just redirect one to the
other if you end up having duplication
or you can just tell the search engines
hey this is the original page or you can
go through search console okay number
eight what are the tactics to increase a
web page speed okay so what are some of
the tactics well when you build the site
especially for mobile you want to keep
it as simple as possible what I mean by
simple as possible really I mean hey use
a simple website design don't get overly
creative if you will most websites all
websites have images you're not going to
be able to get around that but just make
sure you optimize your images in other
words don't have such a large image size
if you don't need something very large
don't have it okay you want to improve
server response time and what do we mean
by that well your site's sitting on a
server somewhere you can own that server
or you can be renting it out from say
Amazon web services or let's just say
GoDaddy as your register they also have
web hosting well if you have it on say
God daddy server you may be sharing that
server with other businesses and at
certain times of the day other
businesses may get a lot of traffic and
suck up a lot of bandwidth what is that
going to do that's going to reduce the
server response time for your site and
so you want to make sure you have a an
idea of you know what server your web
page your website is on and you to be
able to can have some control over that
because if your server response is slow
that's going to slow down everything
else in terms of loading in the browser
and that's not going to be good for SEO
okay optimize your code what we mean by
optim minifying when we see minifying we
mean get rid of some of the Redundant
code if you have CSS you know get rid of
chop some of the get rid of the
JavaScript you're not using so that's
what we mean by optimizing code reduce
redirects okay ideally just want to have
one redirect in place you don't want to
create a daisy chain so to speak of
redirecting and redirecting after that
that's never going to bode well and it's
going to slow things down as well enable
browser caching so if you enable browser
caching basically if somebody comes back
to the page they've been on say two days
ago they're probably going to see a cash
version of that page and then opt for
the content delivery Network as well so
these are some of the ways to reduce
page speed now if you're curious about
the page speed of your website you can
always go to Google's page speed
insights tool and all you have to do is
just Google page speed insights or even
just something generic like Google page
speed and you're going to get this tool
P speit insights and all you need to do
is just plug in a URL when you plug in
the URL Google's going to analyze the
URL for both mobile and desktop and so
here we could see Google gives a score
so we could see the score for mobile
mobile and we could see the score for
desktop just by clicking on desktop and
so here I can see some of the issues
that the site may be having in terms of
page low time for their desktop if I
flip over to mobile you know here I can
see some other issues for example they
have a server static assets with
efficient cash policy now if you're not
sure what the heck that means you can
always just click on it and you can see
some specifics here and or you can just
always Google it as well uh here you got
the reduce the impact of third party
code okay so that's another thing uh
reduce JavaScript execution time so
again going back to a lot of some of the
comments we made about coding okay so
sometimes too much codee or code not
functioning as well as it should will
tend to slow down the site okay so you
can use PP insights you can always get a
glimpse of how pages are loading simply
by also going to for example Google
Analytics under Behavior okay you can go
to site speed and if you click on
overview okay Google what Google does is
they do a sampling of pages over time
and in this case based on 89 Page views
they have an average page load time and
so you can get a sense of how quick
specific Pages load your site overall
simply by looking at the site speed
overview report in Google analytics to
get a sense of how quick your pages are
loading now there's certain factors that
do affect load time so obviously the way
the page is built with the code the
images Etc but also the browser each
browser loads differently okay so you
want to take a look at it by browser
also by country every country has a
different network you can be in the
United States and have worse network
service than you do say in you know co
uh Ivory Coast in Africa Okay so really
depends on the network you're on so and
also the page every page is built
differently so you want to get a sense
of what pages are loading quicker and
which pages are not you can simply just
go to page timings in Google analytics
and you get a sense of what pages do not
load fast which ones do and maybe hone
in on the pages that aren't loading fast
and address those pages first okay so
you have two tools at your disposal one
Google analytics and one page insights
okay so let's look at question number
nine here so when should an individual
Target short tail and longtail keywords
okay so remember short tail are usually
one to two keywords very Broad in nature
longtail keywords or maybe three four
keywords in a query or maybe an entire
sentence those are considered longtail
keywords so usually short tail keywords
have higher volume but also higher
competition longer tail keywords usually
have lower uh volume but also lower
competition but the great thing about
longtail keywords the conversion rate
will tend to be a little bit higher than
say a short tail because it's less vague
and more specific so you can use short
tail keywords if you're trying to drive
a lot of visitors because those keywords
are going to be vague or Broad in nature
longtail keywords are used for targeted
Pages such as product pages and articles
so if you have a specific product with a
long name you can certainly optimize
that page for that product name again
the product name may have low volume but
if somebody types in exactly that
product name you show up the chance of
you them converting are going to be very
high so you don't have to always be that
specific the product name but try and be
as specific as you possibly can in order
to get somebody to click on your link in
the search engine results and get them
over to your site to convert okay so
those are really the big differences
short tail very broad very vague a lot
of volume but also a lot of competition
but hey if you're ranking for short tail
keyword you're probably going to get a
lot of traffic the conversion rates may
not be as high as something say longtail
where hey maybe you're just toned in on
a few set number of products and you're
not care you don't care of a lot about
the traffic you just care about getting
the relevant traffic to your site to
convert okay number 10 what are the
important elements to f Focus while
developing a website so we're talking in
terms of SEO okay so if somebody asked
me this question in an interview what am
I going to focus on while developing a
website well the answers are right here
yes we talked about mobile mobile is so
important because a lot of websites are
going to be indexed with Google
smartphone bod so mobile usability is
very important so we need to make sure
our website is responsive for mobile
just some basic practices when it comes
to site AR architecture navigation we
want to have a simple URL structure okay
no overly cumbersome the navigation
should simply be clean and eat okay if
you have five products okay maybe you
have uh in your navigation you have
something called products with all five
listed or you have all five products in
the main navigation the key is you just
want to make it clean and neat and easy
for somebody to find the the rule of
thumb is if it's good for the end user
probably going to be good for Google but
if complicated for the end User it's
probably going to be compc ated for
Google you always want to create a
sitemap now what is that sitemap a
sitemap is simply just a formatted file
with to that's includes all your URLs
and assets your images and your videos
they're going to be sitting on your
server as well so you want Google or
these these Bots to be able to find your
pages and assets and by the way you want
to take it a step further and make sure
you upload that site map which is
sitting in the root directory meaning
domain.com
sitemap.xml okay you want to take that
sitemap and make sure you input that
sitap location in Google search console
that way Google search console has a
oneway ticket to grab the elements in
the sitemap another important element to
focus on while developing a WIP side is
having a robot's text file and all A
robot's text file is it's like a lock I
always say to a house so if you lock a
door in your house nobody's going to be
able to get in that door so it's all a
robot text file is you're telling Google
and these other Bots that are coming ACR
your site what's locked and what's not
locked meaning what they have access to
what they don't have access to so you
want to be able to make sure you have a
robot's text file if you're trying to
not index specific pages of your website
because if you tell Google don't crawl
these Pages or this directory they're
not going to get crawled if they don't
get crawled they're not going to get
indexed so robots text file is an
important element to focus on while
you're developing your website and while
you're developing your website it could
be on a you know in a directory just
called new website so you probably want
to have new website as the directory in
the robots text file and just to let
Google know don't go into this directory
because it's my new website I'm not
ready to go live yet so you don't want
it indexed so there are a lot of reasons
to have robots text files that's the
main reason sitap you want Google to get
these pages and assets quickly okay you
want to make sure that your site
architecture navigation is in order you
want to make sure your site is mobile
friendly and you also want to make sure
you have content on your website that's
the key because that's what's going to
keep people on the website and engaged
and when I say content I don't
necessarily just mean words I also mean
videos I also mean images you know
something interactive okay you want to
keep people engaged that's the key
behind it trust me if if if an end user
finds your side engaging Google is
likely going to find your side engaging
okay so those are good brownie points to
bring up if somebody asks you this
question in an interview so just a recap
here it's important to have a better
site structure so the Bots can easily
access and IND content okay with a
responsive design helps to make your
website mobile friendly and user
friendly would also increase the amount
of time and user spends on your website
which may improve your site's ranking
sitemap is simply just a file that helps
search engine Bots to understand the
structure of the website okay how many
pages are are on your website and where
they located along with the videos and
images okay and then the robots text
just instructs the search engine
crawlers to understand what pages should
not be indexed okay this is simply just
a text file and it's added to the root
directory again think like a door think
of a lock okay you can tell you can lock
whatever doors you want in your house
then give it that way okay so those are
our questions for SEO can if you have
any additional questions or if there are
other questions maybe you've been asked
in an SEO interview then go ahead and
add them to the comment section below
we'd love to hear from you now we're
going to turn our attention to search
engine marketing so let's turn our full
attention to search engine marketing so
we're moving away from SEO and over to
payperclick and so you're really have to
know your stuff here you really do uh so
a lot of the questions we're going to
ask going to be be centered around
Google ads formerly known as Google ads
words and so if you're familiar with
Google ads the platform then you should
have no problems whatsoever answering
these questions but that's why we're
here and that's why you're watching so
there's anything you want to add to any
of these questions as a reminder feel
free to comment under the video and so
right out of the gate question 11 what
is AD scheduling so ad scheduling is a
feature in Google ads and really all it
does is allow you the advertiser to set
up certain hours or days you want your
ads to show it's as simple as that so if
you have a customer that you're running
ads for on Google Search and let's just
say they have a restaurant and they're
closed During certain hours of the week
then you can go into the ad scheduler
and schedule your ads to not show when
they're closed as an example okay
because if somebody calls and they're
not there to answer the phone then it's
not going to be good for the restaurant
or you the advertiser and so that's why
they have the ad scheduling so it
ensures your ads are not running when
they're performing poorly let's just say
you know you're running a business and
you just don't get that much traffic
during the weekends well you can go in
and adjust accordingly it also is there
to make sure you can serve your
customers when you do have limited
client service hours so let's just say
you have a customer service team that's
going to answer phones for a couple
hours a day well again you can schedule
your ads to show during those couple of
hours a day and then really what it
comes down to is you're making sure you
can satisfy customer demand and supply
and so that means showing your ads when
you you can best fulfill the customer's
needs okay and so that's really what
it's all about uh and that's what ad
scheduling is so take advantage of AD
scheduling schedule it according to the
business hour schedule according to how
they can best serve the customer
schedule the ads when it's performing
best and don't schedule the ads when you
know you're going to have poor
performance okay so next question what
are the different ad formats available
on Google ads it's a trick question
because it really does come down to what
network you're advertising on so Google
has two networks the search Network and
the Display Network okay so on the
search Network there's only one ad
format and that's text okay so Google
recently changed the format of the text
ads now they're called expanded text ads
so here you could see you can have up to
three headlines and two description
lines and then you can also have ADD
extensions and so you can see here
underneath the ad you have what they
call site links so shop by category in
here headphones on here headphones those
are all site links to specific pages on
the site so text ads are available only
on the search network but they're also
available on the Display Network as well
then you have responsive display ads now
responsive responsive display ads are
only on Google's Display Network okay so
here you could see some samples of
responsive display ads and these ads
adjust their size and format depending
on the space available so again you can
have text ads or you can have display
ads Now display ads again come in
different sizes so you can create ads
you for a variet iety of different sizes
for example 250X 250 or 468 by 60 so
those are some of the different ad types
there's there's an a plethora of
different ad sizes you can choose
however your ad's not going to show on a
website if they don't have that
particular size available so it's always
best practice to create different ads
but create ads in different sizes as
well okay and then have a backup text ad
as well just in case the site doesn't
even display a display ad for you or
serve up a display ad so you can have a
text ad as a backup okay so lots of
different ad sizes but this is the
second ad format that's responsive
display and again the responsive part is
Google will automatically show the ad
that's best performing based on a series
of headlines descriptions and images
that you you provide Google and so the
responsive part is hey if this
combination of headline description and
image work best meaning it has the best
click the rate then Google's going to
serve up that ad so that's why they call
it responsive so obviously you can have
just an image ad that's not responsive
again across different ad sizes you know
they could be again 250X 250 300 by 300
468 x 68 there a number of different
sizes Google can provide you that
information but the one thing to note
here is that when you do create an image
ad it could be jpeg it could be
interactive or it could be static so
different types of image ad formats like
PNG for example or it could be a static
or it could be interactive so definitely
take advantage of the different
opportunities uh meaning a static ad
versus an interactive ad you may want to
have two variations of that so you could
see what which one works best okay
there's also app promotion ads so these
ads are used to drive app download so
you're going to have to set up a
campaign accordingly okay but here you
can see this is what it looks like with
a call to action so it allows you to go
ahead and click and install that app so
that's an app promotion again if you
have an app and you want to promote it
you can use this type of AD format to
align with a campaign that's driving
traffic to download your app okay and of
course you have video ads well Google
owns YouTube and so if you have videos
you have the opportunity to advertise on
YouTube okay so these ads can be
Standalone or inserted into other
streaming video content and so To Me
video ads work well with specific
strategies and what's one strategy you
would use a video ad for brand awareness
or education explainer videos and so
YouTube allows you the advertiser the
opportunity to get your ad your service
your product in front of a lot of
eyeballs so that's the beauty of video
ads they attract a lot of eyeballs and
definitely help with the strategy of say
brand awareness okay another ad format
going back to the search network is
shopping ads so if you sell shoes then
you may want to think about having a
campaign for shopping so shopping ads
work with Google Merchant so Google
Merchant is another Google product and
basically Google Merchant allows you to
manage your inventory so if you have a
hundred different types of shoes that
you're selling you can upload your
inventory to Google Merchant connects
and talks to Google ads so basically
what you're doing you're setting up your
your campaign in Google ads and
connecting your inventory from Google
Merchant to Google ads and so the great
thing about the shopping campaign is it
puts your product front and center it
puts the price it puts any promotion
that you have and it puts the brand all
front and center so when somebody does
type in let's just say lime green
sneakers or women's sneakers and this
particular shoe shows up here the third
one from the left then somebody's going
to see it's from the United Colors of
beniton it's a woman's shoe it's on
Amazon and it costs $45 so the great
thing about shopping ads is if
somebody's interested they're going to
click okay if somebody's not interested
say well you know it's a little bit more
expensive I can get something similar
another shoe on Amazon for Less okay
they're probably going to click on that
particular ad so again the great thing
about shopping ads put your product
front and center with any promotion the
price the brand so if somebody clicks on
it then they're probably serious buyers
okay so that's the beauty of shopping
ads it allows you to get your product
out there and on the search Network it's
a cost per click so you're only paying
for the click so if somebody looks at it
but doesn't click you're not paying for
that so that's the beauty of shopping
ads and so you can showcase your
shopping ads so these ads have an image
and a description that expand when
clicked so you can provide more
information more product and store
information as well you also have callon
ads okay so call only ads are enabled to
users to connect with your business
directly using the phone number provided
okay so it allows somebody on a mobile
phone who in this example is searching
for drywall repair well if you're in the
business of drywall repair you can have
your ad show up on mobile with the phone
number and somebody can easily click on
that phone number and just call you
directly now the way call only ads work
is you're still getting charged for the
click okay so anytime somebody clicks
and calls you're going to get charged
and you're going to get charged just as
you would if somebody clicked on your ad
so it's works the same way so it's a
cost per click again this is on search
so search is cost per click and the
beauty about call only is again you can
track the calls runting Google ads so
you can have Google ads track how many
people click on the number and you can
even count those calls as conversions if
they meet a certain criteria for example
the criteria is somebody talks to you
for a minimum of 60 seconds or 1 minute
then Google will count that as a
conversion so you can monitor calls
right in Google gole ads and it's a cost
per click model so you can actually see
what the average cost per click is so
moving on question 13 okay what is rlsa
and how does it work well
rlsa stands for remarketing list for
search ads so if you're familiar with
remarketing on display it's similar they
just call it rlsa okay so it enables you
the advertiser to customize your ads for
people who have visited your site just
like a typical remarketing campaign okay
so you could tailor your bids and ads to
these visitors when they're searching on
Google and search partner sites okay so
they're two basic strategies for using
rlsa okay so you can optimize bids for
existing keywords for visitors or you
can bid on keywords that you don't
normally bid on Just for people who
recently visited your site or converted
on your site key here is you're the one
that's picking the customer you're the
one that's enabling the list if you're
trying to Target people who went to your
site and didn't convert well you could
certainly optimize your bids for
existing keywords for people who went to
your site and didn't convert or you
could set up a whole new campaign for
rlsa and have a different set of
keywords with a different ad because you
know who you're talking to you're
talking to somebody who's already been
to your site they know your brand they
just didn't purchase and so this all
happens on the search Network and that's
the beauty of remarketing is one you
know who your audience is because you're
the one establishing that audience and
to you're the one creating the ad so you
can talk directly to that audience when
they see your ad again in this case on
search so that's rlsa remarketing list
for search ads I recommend pretty much
any industry any client any customer run
remarketing list for search advertising
and remarketing for display so those are
two key campaigns you should always
recommend running to a client because
one again you're defining the audience
two you're the one that that's talking
directly to the audence because you know
who the audience is and three if they
see the ad and they click on it again
because it's cost per click then the
chances of converting are going to be
higher because they've already been to
your website they know who you are and
so if they click on your at again then
they must be interested so those are all
the benefits of running an rlsa campaign
okay so number 14 what types of
audiences can be used in gdn Google's
Display Network so a lot of different
audiences here okay so let's go through
them so you have Affinity audiences so
basically Affinity audiences are
basically what are people's interest and
habits what do they have an affinity for
are there food sites travel sites
shopping sites fashion okay so that's
what Affinity really relates to okay
then you have in Market custom intent
life events these are what they are
researching or planning for so again it
could be travel it could be Finance Etc
okay you have remarketing we just went
over that with the remarketing list for
search advertising rlsa and so when
remarketing it's an audience that has
interacted with your website so they
either came from mobile or came from
mobile and didn't convert or female came
from mobile and didn't convert so you're
the one defining the audience there you
also have a similar audience so this is
what Google creates on your behalf so
these are users with a similar interest
to your site visitor so Google is
monitoring the type of traffic that's
coming to your site and based on that
traffic they're going to create a
similar audience and then you have a
custom match so what you know about your
customers activities basically so these
are all the different audience types and
you can see the different types of ads
available okay so notice the far right
column video ads so video ads are
available to every one of these audience
types why because YouTube so Google
knows what people's interests and habits
are based on the videos they watch they
know what they're looking for okay they
you know that they've been to your
website cuz they're cookie so you can
remarket them okay so video ads are very
powerful tool for any one of these
audience types so next question what are
the types of keyword matching available
in Google ads okay so this is a good
question very important if you're going
to manage a Google ads account and a
campaign you have to be aware of the
different match types you can't just go
broad match that's a sign of somebody
who doesn't know what they're doing is
by bidding on a one keyword phrase
that's a short tail keyword if you think
back to SEO we have our long tail and
our short tail keywords the worst thing
you could do is bid on a keyword short
tail keyword that's broad match because
what is Broad match basically broad
match or keywords that appear when a
user searches any word in the phrase now
you can Define specifically what you
want your ads to appear for in terms of
keyw and when I say specifically you can
use a phrase match so phrase match are
ads that appear only when a user
searches for that exact keyword phrase
in the precise order but with some
additional words in the beginning or at
the end of the query okay so usually
these are sentences so you could be you
know bidding on red Adidas running shoes
and somebody could type been looking for
red Adidas running shoes in Portland
Oregon okay as an example okay so as
long as red Adidas running shoes are in
order in that keyword phrase then your
ad's going to appear because it's a
phrase match and then you can get really
specific by doing an exact match so
exact match are keywords that are
triggered only when that keyword and
exactly that keyword phrase is queried
so if you do an exact match for red
Adidas running shoes and somebody types
in only red Adidas running shoes then
that's an exact match and your ads going
to appear so let's take a look at these
again so you got broad match okay we got
a term cheap smartphone so if somebody
types in smartphone cheap phone smart
mobile phone cheep any one of those
combinations your ad's going to appear
now there's one thing you can do for
broad match and it's called broad match
modifier so you can put a plus sign in
front of the keyw for example let's just
say you really want to emphasize the
word cheap okay you're selling really
inexpensive smartphones okay not just
any smartphone but an inexpensive
smartphone so you can put a plus sign in
front of cheap and so somebody puts in
you know just smartphone or smart mobile
your ad's not going to show up because
the word the keyword query has to
contain sheep so anytime you put a plus
in front of the keyword query you're
bidding on then that means that keyword
has to be part of the keyword phrase so
that's a a broad match modifier if you
will and that prevents you from getting
unwanted Impressions so we got phrase
match again blue smartphone so somebody
could type in smartphone and blue color
cheap blue smartphone notice though the
second one where it says smartphone and
blue color your ads not necessar going
to show up because guess what blue
smartphone is the keyword query and
you're at you're the query here is not
in that order so remember in order for
you to show up for phrase match the
keyword has to be in that order so I'm
looking for a blue
smartphone that is less than $100 okay
that could be somebody's query blue
smartphone was in that query in that
order so if somebody says looking for a
smartphone that happens to be blue less
than $100 then your ad is not going to
show up so remember it has to be in that
ex precise order one thing I want us go
back to on the phrase match notice that
there's quotes around the keyword
anytime you see quotes around the
keyword that signifies as a phrase match
because if we look at exact match notice
there are brackets around the keyword
red shoe that signifies as an exact
match so if you put brackets around a
keyword then you're signify signaling to
Google that this is an exact match and I
only want to show up for the keyword red
shoe well the only option that will work
here is the second one red shoes okay so
because that's an exact match okay so
disregard the first and the third one
because shoe and red color is not going
to work and Footwear that's red is not
going to work CU this is an exact match
so you're saying I only want to show up
for the keyword red shoe and Google
recognizes plurals and singulars
together so if somebody did type in Red
Shoes then your ad is going to show up
okay so moving on what are some of the
reasons as to why your ads could have
been rejected it happens to the best of
us and and if you're writing ads and
they get rejected it could be for a
number of reasons so at the end of the
day you're violating Google's
advertising policies so some of the
policies that could have been violated
are and just some of the many we're just
listing some here prohibited content
prohibited practices restricted content
or editor and Technical so when you look
at prohibited content I will say this
you're not going to be able to sell
drugs even if you're selling in
pharmaceutical products that's
considered drugs and that's going to be
prohibited or prohibited practices like
selling drugs online that's illegal in
the state so you're going to definitely
get flagged for that okay so there are a
lot of different ways in which your ads
can be disapproved okay but if you do
see restricted content then that means
you can advertise but with limitations
and usually those limitations are
restricted to say only Google search and
not Google search Partners or to a
specific geography so usually the key
here is if somebody asks this question
okay there are a lot of different
reasons Google's usually going to
provide the specific or the reason why
it got disapproved and they're usually
going to include a link that you can
refer to okay so at least Google does
that much they're not going to leave you
in the dark and tell your ad just been
disapproved they're going to tell you
why and include a link that you can go
to figure out how you can best resolve
the disapproved ad so what are the
different kinds of bidding available in
Google ads so we already covered part of
this earlier on so remember Google
search network is only cost per click
CPC when we talk about Google's Display
Network you have three options cost per
click cost per view and cost per
impression and CPM is cost per 1,000
impression so you're paying per 1,000
Impressions impression is when somebody
actually sees your ad cost per viw is
actually somebody looking at your ad for
at least 30 seconds or the entirety of
the ad so if the ad video ad only runs
15 seconds and somebody watched the
entirety then you're going to pay per
cost per view so if your video is 2
minutes long and somebody watched 30
seconds you're going to pay cost per
view okay so again let's go through
these cost per click it just enables you
to set up a maximum price on the cost of
somebody clicking on your advertisement
you only pay when somebody clicks on
your ad okay cost preview again this is
the default method to set the price
you'll pay for your video ads okay you
only pay when a viewer watches your
video advertisement for at least 30
seconds and then cost per 1,000
Impressions so this is the amount you
pay each time your ad is displayed in
the search Network and you pay for
Impressions that are and generated for
your ad and you're paying for every
1,000 Impressions so the m is actually
the nor more uh Roman numeral for 1,000
so that's where the M part comes in so
you're paying for 1,000 Impressions so
every 1,000 eyeballs you're going to pay
a price and so cost per impression is
good for brand awareness if you're
trying to generate a lot of eyeballs
onto your brand then you'd want to go
with a CPM model okay so question 18
what are some Auto automatic bidding
strategies so let's define automatic
bidding strategy automatic bidding
allows Google take over okay not you
Google's taking over and they're the one
setting the bid amounts automatically
and it's going to be based on criteria
and some of and that criteria is going
to be centered around conversions so if
Google bids on your behalf automatically
basically what they're doing is they're
collecting data on the behavior of your
ads and so if your ad is likely to get
the click or conversion then Google is
going to set the bid amount so you can
win that auction in order to get the
click or the conversion so there are
different types of bidding strategy but
remember you have to align a bidding
strategy with the strategy of the
campaign so for example if your goal of
the campaign is to increase site
visitors you just want people to click
on your ad and go to your website then
you're going to have an automated
bidding strategy of maximize clicks that
aligns with your campaign strategy so
this strategy automatically sets your
bids to help to get as many clicks as
possible within your budget so Google's
going to do its best based on historical
performance of The Campaign to generate
traffic to your site that's the goal
that's the biz strategy okay let's take
a look at some others so hey the goal of
our strategy campaign is to increase
visibility so that's an easy one
remember cost per Impressions hey we
want to maximize how many people look at
our ads okay so Target impression share
so this bidding strategy allows your
bids to show at the top of the page okay
so you're getting the impression so
people are able to look at your ad okay
so you're telling Google hey I want to
be shown at least 50% of the time when
somebody types in a keyword that I'm
bidding on so they're going to make sure
that they meet your target impression
share of 50% so they're going to set
your bids automatically to make sure
your ad shows of the top of the page so
it's seen at least 50% of the time
that's the goal of the campaign that's
the bidding strategy goal we set up a
campaign to drive conversions so there
are a couple bidding strategies against
conversions so Target CPA so this
strategy sets a search or display bid to
get as many conversions as possible but
there's a caveat here cost per
acquisition is what CPA stands for so
we're trying to get as many conversions
as possible but at a certain cost for
example if I'm selling T-shirts for $10
do I want to pay $20 CPA for every sale
do I want to pay Google $20 no I'd be
losing money I'd be out of business okay
so if I'm selling T-shirts for $10 on my
website I'm probably going to put the
CPA about $2 or $3 again depending on my
cost of goods so if I factor my cost of
goods I'm trying to make a profit then
I'm going to tell Google look I'm trying
to get some sales but I don't want to
lose money getting to sales so so you're
going to put in a threshold and that
threshold is your target CPA and so
Google is going to automatically Bid and
Win the auction for keywords when they
feel those keywords can get you a Target
CPA that you put in for example $2 okay
so the goal of our campaign is to meet a
Target return on ad spend meaning return
on Advertising spend meaning we're
getting more Revenue than we're spending
that ratio needs to be positive so
Google's going to help us again adjust
our bids to make sure that our return on
Advertising spend meets our criteria so
we could put a roas at 100% 200% Etc and
Google's going to adjust our bids
accordingly based on the keyword that
they think will meet that criteria of
100% or 200% so that's Target return on
Advertising spend and that's there to
see if Google can help you generate a
profit so we have another campaign set
up we're trying to get more conversions
we have a budget we want to spend the
budget but we don't we want to get
conversions so this is a gimme the
bidding strategy here would be maximize
conversions so this strategy sets bids
like all the others it automatically is
going to adjust your bid that is Google
it's going to adjust the bid to help you
win the auction based on historical
performance so if a key word in
historically has performed in terms of
conversions you better believe Google's
going to try and win the auction on your
behalf to get the click to get that
conversion and that's maximize
conversions okay moving on question 19
and this is probably the most important
question that you're going to get if an
interview asks you this question this is
what Google ads is all about quality
score so what is quality score so simply
put quality score is a score between 1
and 10 given to every keyword you've
been on and basically between 1 and 10
it's Bas Google's giving you the score
the quality score of that keyword and so
how does Google come up with that score
between 1 and 10 well there's three main
factors here one is expected click
theough rate the second is AD relevance
and the third is landing page experience
so obviously a higher quality score the
better off you are okay a low quality
score it's not going to bode well for
you and so if you have a low quality
score Google actually will tell you
which of these three components you're
not scoring very well on so you're
either going to get a below average
average or above average for each of
these three components that make up
quality score and I will tell you this
if I were to divide them up into 2/3
clickthrough rate expected clickr rate
is more important than the other two so
that's about 2/3 of quality score an
expected click the rate is basically
Google saying look other advertisers
have been on this keyword and their
click the rate has been historically
around say for example Le 3% so if you
can't get 3% then your quality score is
going to suffer ad relevance is simply
does the ad or is the ad relevant to the
keyword you're bidding on likewise for
the landing page but the landing page
experience a little bit more subjective
because the landing page has to load
well fast no popups no a lot of external
links nothing spammy no ads being served
up so a lot of factors in landing page
experience Google wants to make sure
somebody clicks on your ad that they're
going to have a good experience when
they land on that page and so quality
score is so key here it is very key
because if you don't have a good quality
score the repercussion means you're
going to have to bid higher because
quality score times bid equals ad rank
so for every auction Whoever has the
highest ad rank is going to be at the
top of Google search results so if you
have a low quality score let's just say
one and you're bidding $4 on that
keyword then your ad rank is four 1 * 4
is four so you got to keep that in mind
because other advertisers could have a
higher ad rank or better quality scores
for that keyword so again expected click
array this just shows How likely it is
that your ads will get clicked when
shown for a particular keyword Google
expects a certain number here you should
always try to achieve the highest click
the rate possible and click the rate is
simply how many times you're was seen
versus how many times it was clicked
that's all click the rate is clicks
divided by Impressions so you should
always try to achieve the highest click
there rate possible that will avoid
getting a low quality score add
relevance so add relevance simply means
how relevant is your keyword to the ad
okay so if you're bidding on Reddit deis
running shoes then make sure your ad
discusses and mentions multiple times
naturally redid is running shoes okay
and remember with those text ads you
have three headlines you have two
description lines of up to 90 characters
you have side extensions okay you have
path one and path two that meaning you
can add additional keyword to the end of
a URL so you have lots of opportunities
to make sure the ad is relevant to the
keyword and then landing page experience
again this is a little subjective but
hey Google's going to use landing page
experience to estimate how relevant and
useful your website landing page will be
to people who not only click on your we
but land on that page so does that page
load fast does it have any unnecessary
popups does it does it have some quirky
external links that look spammy okay you
got to take all these things into
consideration and think about the end
user here then last question for search
engine marketing so what are the
Hallmarks of a good PPC landing page so
going back to landing page experience
this is a good segue so you always want
to make sure you're having attractive
and Powerful headline on the page
remember it's got to be a nice flow
you're bidding on a keyword somebody
types in the keyword they see your
attractive ad they click on that
attractive ad which has the keyword in
it they click on the ad they go to
landing page they want to be able to see
something very similar to what they
typed in the ad they saw they want to be
able to see it seamlessly on the landing
page and so that attractive and Powerful
headline should include that key word
should also have persuasive copy that
can convince prospects to convert to me
bullet points always work here simple
bullet points easy to read easy to
understand easy to just convey the
positives about what you're trying to
sell or convert have engaging media like
videos videos always help because
they're interactive it keeps people
engaged longer or have some really good
images don't just go stock photography
you know complement the video with some
images and then your landing pages
should have enough white space to draw
attention specific ments on the page and
meaning don't cram the page together
because remember users are also coming
to these Pages Via Mobile so you got to
take that in consideration as well so
cramming your pages full of content
videos and images is probably not going
to bode well so make sure there's
breathing room for people to read
understand and react and those are
Hallmarks of a good PPC landing page
some other factors here adding trust
indicators like you some statistical
evidence meaning how many people
downloaded your app you can always have
testimonials you know third party sales
of approval like Better Business Bureau
you know privacy policy links help okay
so you want to add some things in there
that's going to you know give you
credibility having a properly designed
lead capture form to collect visitors
information is always helpful if you're
trying to get that conversion then have
a lead form make it simple don't have a
lead form with 20 forms or Fields you
know have a simple name email address
make the phone number optional and have
one fi that they can type in specific
information and then last but certainly
not least have a good call to action so
make sure that call to action aligns
with what you're trying to do again
selling those red Adidas running shoes
if they're on sale then you know make
sure the call to action aligns with that
sale you can always say you know 20% off
for the next two days or you know $10
off if you purchase today so have some
good strong call to action thanks for
