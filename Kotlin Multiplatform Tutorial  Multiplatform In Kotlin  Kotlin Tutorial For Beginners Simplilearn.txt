everyone welcome back to another video
session by simply learn
in this tutorial we will be learning
about kotlin multi-platform
the kotlin multi-platform is a software
development kit which is designed to
simplify the development process of
cross-platform mobile applications
now before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
so let's go ahead and understand what we
will be covering today
so we'll start with what is kotlin
multi-platform
then we'll understand how kotlin
multi-platform works
then we'll understand coleman kotlin
code and after that we'll have a look at
benefits of kotlin multi-platform and at
last we'll understand some applications
that are built using kotlin
multi-platform
so without further ado
let's get started
so first is what is kotlin
multi-platform
the kotlin multi-platform is a feature
released in 2017 with kotlin 1.2 version
this feature allows us to write the same
code on multiple platforms directly
it focuses on cross-platform app
development
it is based on the idea of write one's
run anywhere approach
but it takes the concept of write once
run anywhere to a much higher level
in which we can write the code once and
target multiple platforms
the kotlin multi-platform
allows you to include other platforms
like linux windows and the web
while its subset that is kotlin
multi-platform mobile
allows the developer to write business
logic code for ios and android from a
single code base
now as we have understood what is caught
in multi-platform now let's understand
how kotlin multi-platform works
so let's take android and ios
the shared business logic code for
android gets converted to java byte code
that can be executed in jvm
and android has the virtual machine
so it can easily run it
but in case of ios there is no virtual
machine
so the code is converted to the native
code that can be executed on ios
now in kotlin compiler there is a front
end which converts the code into
intermediate representation known as ir
and the back end converts that
intermediate representation to machine
executable code
so in case of android it converts it
into java byte code and for ios it
converts it into ios native machine code
so as we have understood how kotlin
multi-platform works now let's
understand
common portland code
to make common core clean code run
kotlin provides platform specific
compilers
to convert
the code according to different
platforms it provides different
compilers
these platform-specific versions include
kotlin slash jvm
kotlin slash javascript
and kotlin slash native
these versions contain
the platform-specific tools and
libraries and also the extension
to kotlin language
of each platform-specific version
include various platforms for example
jvm includes java 8
java 6 and android then the javascript
includes browser and node
the native includes ios mac windows
linux etc
multi-platform libraries helps in
developing shared parts of the project
at one area by providing apis for common
cortland code and later share it with
all of the target platforms
the versions of platform-specific
libraries provide the libraries that can
be used to increase the
platform-specific capabilities of the
platforms that are targeted
now
let's understand
the benefits of kotlin multiprogramming
so let's start with the first one which
is
quick and clean code
in cortland multi-platform
we don't have to recreate and rewrite
the code for different platforms
we can simply share the common code
between platforms which saves a huge
amount of time features like
interoperability makes things very easy
and quick as well
also there is no lagging behind the
native platforms and because of that the
developers don't have to wait until the
new features are added for the support
next is
fast development
so as we have already discussed that
code sharing saves a lot of time and
helps in making the development process
much faster and easier
its features including null safety ide
support and interoperability with java
makes it less complex and fast
next is
one language for close platform and
native apps
most crows platform app development
tools
don't allows you to use the capabilities
of native to ios and android devices
in kotlin we don't need to introduce any
new programming language to the code
base
it is easy to make our android app work
on ios devices without changing much in
code
the major advantage of using kotlin
multi-platform is that we can write the
code once and use it on both mobile
platforms that are android and ios
next is support and community
kotlin is pretty famous in many
companies and organizations
also after google statement of kotlin as
an official language for android
many companies are opting this language
and a huge amount of users
started working on this language
which means there is a huge community
support for the kotlin language
the developers who are already familiar
with java can easily switch to kotlin as
it is fully interoperable with it and
easy to learn
so the java community also adds up to
the kotlins community
now let's have a look at some
applications that are built using kotlin
multi-platform
this includes netflix autodesk vmware
trello
philips
ice rock
so let's start with netflix
netflix the popular ott platform
has rebuilt the current user interface
player in the netflix android
application using kotlin
next is autodesk
autodesk is a multinational software
corporation
kotlin works well with ios and android
without any java native interface
which is a major reason for the company
to opt kotlin multi-platform
next is vmware
vmware is an american cloud computing
and virtualization technology company
the vmware development team
wanted a cross platform strategy for
mobile applications
then the quarter multi-platform was
selected
and now it is the default go to
framework of choice for vmware
next is trello
trello is a project management
application
the android application of trello is
built using kotlin
reload uses scotland because of its
interoperability with java
next is philips
philips is a popular multinational
corporation and we all have heard about
this company
in philips kotlin multi-platform proved
to be a faster at implementing the new
features and also to get more
interaction in the team between android
and ios developers
the last one is ice rock
its lock is an outsourced company that
provides mobile and backend solutions
for various industries and market
segments
it uses kotlin multi-platform mobile to
create applications for its clients
apart from these there are some more
applications and companies that have
opted the kotlin multi-platform
and with that we have come to the end of
