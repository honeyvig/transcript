hi everyone this is dr. Srikant
from Team MDS conquer now I'm going to
explain a short topic that is called as
emergency trach modules and we know that
there is emergency trach kit that is
available in every department in the
dentistry and this drug kit is divided
into four modules that is module 1 which
includes the basic emergency kit that
includes the critical drugs as well as
the equipment that are necessary module
2 indicates the non-critical drugs and
equipment whereas the module 3 indicates
the advanced cardiac life support and
the module 4 does the last one which
includes the anti dental drugs okay this
is an important area where I have seen
multiple questions nowadays in various
entrance examinations please make a note
of this thank you all
we'll be coming with one more short
