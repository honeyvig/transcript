in this field then make sure to check
out the link in the pin comment and
description box below to find the data
analytics program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest now
without further delay let's get started
with the topic which is how to use
Microsoft power query so imagine you
have a lot of data it can be an Excel
file it can be a PDF SQL database cloud
or anything if it is Data it's your data
right so you have a lot of data now you
have the source of the data after that
I'm absolutely sure that the data is not
clean enough to perform some analysis so
you go through another step where you
have to clean your data from unwanted
rows and columns which doesn't make
sense or might have some invalid data
right so you need to make sure that your
data is completely accurate and has some
standards for your analysis right so
that's the next step which is clean and
transform after the clean and transform
step you have the next step which is
load that particular data to your
platform it could be Excel it could be
some data visualization tool like TBL
Loop bi Etc right after that you
generate some meaningful information of
that you create some pivot tables pivot
charts and uh line graphs Etc right so
which makes the some sense of that data
you will understand what what exactly is
happening with your business how many
leads or how many traffic orders what
right and which is the best performing
product which is the worst performing
product and you need to take some
decisions on your business which can
make some impact on your overall profit
or Revenue right so imagine if you want
to do this for an year if you get one
year's data and you do it in a day or
two it's fine and if it's on a monthly
basis you get month on month data and
you want to do it okay it could not be
worse you can spend one or two days and
it's fine but if what if it's weak on
week you start to think right what if
it's a daily task it's a mundane task
right you have to do all these Steps
step by step repetitively and it it
doesn't make any you interested anymore
in that particular type of job and uh
the major point of this is you end up
spending more time on cleaning data
transforming loading it and the worst
part you don't get proper time specific
time which you want to actually dedicate
to plan out something and bring up
strategies to improve your business
right so what if you could automate this
right what if there is someone who could
perform all these steps for you in the
way you want and you can actually have
some time to produce some pivot tables
pivot charts and then understand what
exactly is happening with your business
and find out some critical points where
you can improvise and bring up some good
Revenue what if there was someone who
can perform all these steps for you
clean your data transform it the way you
want load it to your platform and help
you create your prer charts and piver
tables and actually save you a lot of
time where you can spend all that time
understanding your critical points where
you need attention you can fix them and
plan some strategies out to bring out
some good Revenue right that exact
someone who can do all these steps for
you and automate your data cleaning data
transformation and loading tasks for you
is exactly the Microsoft power query so
you can use Microsoft power query either
in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft power PI
right now let's um kind of generate some
data so uh this data will be generated
using chat GPD and we will not generate
data like which is not small like for a
week on WE analysis or a day-by-day
analysis we will create data for years
so we will take five consecutive years
starting from 2020 to 2024 and we will
have some uh data generated using chat
GPD and we will automate that data and
try to get some analysis done right
let's jump on to chat GPD so before we
go to chat GPD I have a prompt written
here so this particular prompt will
guide or explain chat jpd what exactly
you want right so you're giving some uh
like the Excel data right over here we
have AUD date order ID shift mode and
customer name customer ID everything
right so we have the sales quantity
discount profit Etc so in the same
format or a similar format if not the
same format we are explaining chgb that
we need these columns the order ID order
date delivery date Etc and we want all
these files in a downloadable Excel file
links right so you can also specify this
column should have certain certain
things and this column can have certain
certain things right so we will copy
this prompt and head back to chat GPD
and you can just paste the prompt and
hit enter there you go now your request
has been analyzed and shortly you should
be receiving some download aable Excel
files or some recommendations from chat
GPD I've already performed this process
and we have already downloaded some data
so there you you go you have the data
from 2020 to 2024 you can just click on
this to download the file so I've
already uh done this job and U I've
downloaded the files so those files are
exactly in my downloads here so if you
go to downloads here we have arst data
for 2021 2022 2023 3 and 2024 so this
orders data has just one file which is
orders 2020 so we will perform the data
cleaning so first we will specify the
source of the data then we will perform
the data cleaning and transformation
process then we load this particular
Excel 2020 data into Excel and then we
load this Excel data into the
visualization tool we'll use Excel for
this and then generate some pivot tables
and pivot charts we will only do this
for one file which is 2020 right now
what's the surprising part is this
particular file will also get data
continuously for the next year 2021 for
the next year 2022 for the next year
2023 and the current year 2024 right
when we just copy paste or cut copy
paste these files into this particular
folder the same transformation steps the
same data cleaning steps and the same
data loading steps and also including
the analysis will be done for you in the
Excel pivot table right the process has
been just automated right so you can see
that happening for that let's open a new
Excel file so I have the Excel folder
right over here so a new blank Excel
workbook will be opened and if you go to
data here you have get data as we said
it can be a file it can be an ex file
XML Json PDF it can be from cloud it can
be from a SQL database any any other
source if it's data you can work from it
so we will give a file here right so
just uh uh okay so so we will give a
file here so select file and go to the
last option which reads as from folder
right so go to downloads and select that
a data yeah go to downloads and select
that a data remember this particular
folder should have only one file
according to us which is 2020 data the
first years data right select the folder
and open and this should include the
data of only one file which is or Is
2020 right so if you have multiple files
you can either combine transform and
load if you have just one file you can
just go with the transformation option
over here or you can load if you are
comfortable able with what you have so I
feel there are some minor changes which
I would like to make to my data so I
would go with the transform option now
the power query window will shortly open
now with the power query window opened
you can select the orders 2022 Excel
folder and it will be loaded now let's
try to click on the content button over
here which should load our data now you
can go with the first file so here's the
preview as we expected we have the order
date delivery date Etc just press on
okay so the data has been successfully
loaded right now we have the First
Column as Source name which we will not
be needing anymore and you can just
remove that order ID is fine a date is
fine is it no right so you can just
select both the columns and change the
data type right so here you have the
option of change the data type where you
will change the data type from whole
number to date so that you get a date
right so you have that the First
Transformation step changing data type
has been recorded here so this is like
uh V uh XL vbx or macro which will save
all the steps and will apply uh to all
the uh upcoming files right you have to
change the type of delivery date as well
so we will be finding uh the how many
days it took to deliver or if if the
delivery got delayed right so we can
test that and here if you see uh yes we
requested customer ID and customer name
so we got customer ID along with the
name so we don't want that we want that
in two separate columns we can do that
so you can just select the entire column
go to the split column option over here
select by D limiter so I think it all
automatically recognize that for us but
there is one loophole we have a space d
limiter space option so just press okay
and they should be helping us with the
customer ID so let's rename the customer
ID to just customer ID and this to a
customer name space name right and
that's done here we have product which
is fine quantity is fine traffic is fine
leads is fine orders and here comes the
money part so we have Revenue cost to
comp compy so we don't know the profit
yet right so to calculate the profit
what you need to do is substract revenue
from cost of the company and
automatically you will get your profit
so in some instances you might get a
negative value don't worry about that
because uh that can be a discount offer
or some 50% off 75% off that you
regularly sell out your products which
are selling in less num so that you can
just you know uh move out the products
from the store so that can be done and
order status so we have order status as
delivered in transit not delivered yet
or order cancelled right so we might
have to rule out some uh status here
right so we are calculating profit here
so we don't want the profit for
cancelled orders or not deliver
okay maybe okay okay not delivered
orders uh this might be considered as
the cost of company and revenue because
uh it takes some delay to refund the
amount to the customers so we can just
add a filter to this particular column
and uh we will unselect not delivered
products and Order cancel products so
not delivered happens when the vendor is
not available to deliver the product to
the delivery agencies so in that case uh
the order gets automatically cancelled
and uh the order will be the money will
be refunded to the customer so we will
rule out these now the data is clean now
uh as we thought to calculate the profit
select these two columns first Revenue
then cost to company because we are
subtracting cost to company from revenue
right so we will go to add to column and
standard and here we have some options
so we will subtract that so we will get
the profit here so now you can name it
as profit done so we just move that
column to the money part of this
particular data set so profit cost to
company and revenue are the money parts
so we will change data type from just
values to currency right so then that
should be converted into the dollars
format now the first one we don't need
this Source name so you can just rule
out this you can just uh remove this
column and there you go now you have a
clean data you have the order ID order
date delivery date yeah we forgot uh the
another part of this particular data set
transformation where we wanted to find
out the number of days it took to
deliver the product okay I think we
changed uh other ID so we don't want
this so the first okay let's change this
to the to the whole number as it was
okay so order ready fine now we wanted
to find out the number of days it took
to deliver the product so we will select
the delivery date first and then the
order date second go to add column and
uh we will select subtract in days and
we should have that now let's change the
uh subtract subtraction name to days to
dat and and you can move this column
right select the whole column and hold
it drag it and you can move this colum
along with the dates part of this data
set we have the ordered date and
delivered date right right over here and
you will find how many days it took to
deliver a certain product now um let's
recheck once order ID order date
delivery date dat to deliver customer ID
customer name what product did he or she
order
and what quantity and uh the traffic
which we received to the website the
traffic which we received to the website
the number of leads we got out of those
traffic numbers the number of orders we
got out of those uh uh leads and what's
the revenue we got out of those orders
and what was the cost of the company and
what is the profit that we made out of
that order right and we also have the
order status remember we only considered
remember we only considered two types
right uh we considered in transit and
delivered statuses only we ruled out
cancelled orders and not delivered
orders so that we have accurate results
of our profit made and revenue made out
of this right now I'm completely
satisfied with my transformation and
cleaning of my dat set now let's go to
home and here we have the option of
close close and load so we will go with
that and this particular data set should
be loaded to the data visualization
where we have selected Excel right uh so
we have the orders data for
20 20 correct okay let's not add date
here because after all we will have some
more data for 2021 2 three and four
right so let it be the way it is and if
you just check the filter here we have
only one year and and if you just check
the filter here you will have only one
year and if you just check the filter
here you will have only one year 2020
and if you go to the delivery date which
let's say if you have an order placed on
December 31st and it got delivered on
January 5th or something so you'll have
a little bit of a part of 2021 data
which is completely all right not to be
worried about so the main important
thing is audit date so we want the audit
dates of 20 20 so that is loaded here
right now you can just select the whole
data set over here and uh uh you can add
or insert some pivot tables here right
from the selected range and uh let's go
with the default option which creates a
new sheet everything in a new location
right here you have it now let's say you
wanted to make out some um insights from
this uh data set let's delete the other
sheet which we don't want on and let's
name it as
pivot now the products will be loaded to
the columns and uh profit will be loaded
to values so you have a data set over
here sum of profit from beds chairs
cupboards sofa tort so here you have the
pivot table which has sum of profit bed
chair cupboard sofa T and grand total
some of profits made from these these
these and these
now select this entire data and go to
the uht option here go to the pivot
chart and uh here automatically here you
can see that it is you know suggesting
or recommending us to go for the bar
chart which is a lot more better just
select okay and you have your PIV chart
here right and see the grand total here
22
4811
4.15 now this is only for one years of
data now what we will do is go back to
the downloads folder select the
remaining years which is 2021 2 3 and 4
add that to the file location so let's
quickly go to our folder here and go to
downloads select the folders I'm going
to cut them from here go to a data and
paste them here right now our job is
done if we go back to the data here go
to home and
data okay let's so now that we have
added the data to our folder go to the a
data and here select the data segment
and just select refresh all so
everything is refreshed now let's check
the audit date filter and we will have
all the 5 Years From 2020 to one 2 3 and
four and let's press okay for that and
if you go to the pivot table you can
also see the changes here just press
refresh all and there you go you have
the updated data right over here now
that's saved a lot of time for you and
now that time can be utilized to plan a
strategy and focus on the lower parts of
your business and improvise them and
bring a big change to the revenue and
