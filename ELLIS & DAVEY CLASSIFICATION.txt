this presentation is about Elias and
David's classification of tooth
structure which is an important topic in
the examination point of view
so in this and Davis classification is
divided into nine classes from one to
nine so having two class one any
structure it is fracture of only enamel
without involving the engine and pulp
press clash - there is involvement of
both and I mean an engine without
involvement of so in both these classes
we have to do the composite restoration
whereas in class three there is a
fracture involving all the three that is
a mammal dental and Punk
where you have to go with different
right will help therapies according to
the time so if it is only a just 0.5
exposure or MMX but you have to go with
that capping or else if you have a
exposure larger than 1mm you have to go
with pulpotomy well see if the patient
comes after a long time to the clinic
you have to go with the root canal
treatment so class for it is a non wait
and do there is no way to - shown in the
diagram is the disposition of the entire
booth there is classified is complete
discouragement of the tooth from the
socket is called as emulsion also called
as X articulation so storage media and
the time by which by the time the
patient comes to the clinic important is
important a lot in this aspect but as
classics is a root fracture with or
without involving crown function as you
can see in the radiograph here there's a
horizontal root fracture as class 7 is a
displacement without any involvement of
fraction of the crop there is disclosed
displacement of the entire crown here
that is unlike mass 7 of Vegas this
class 8 is complete fracture of chrome
that is also called as crown in mass and
class 9 is regarding the traumatic
injuries of primary - that is based eh -
so any fractures in class - subscribe
