M and welcome to Simply learn today
we'll take you through a hands-off lab
demo of how you can detect hate speech
using machine learning before we start I
hope the screen is clearly visible and
the audio is fine if yes please type in
yes if there are are any issues to let
us know in the chat section so that we
can resolve them I'm repeating again
before we start I hope the screen is
clearly visible and the audio is fine if
yes just type in yes if there are any
issues to let us know in the chat
section so that we can resolve
them let's wait for some more minutes to

learn I think we can get started so in
today's session we will go through what
hate speech is after that a hands off L
demo of how to to detect hate speech
using machine learning we will perform
different function and different python
libraries before we move on to the
programming part let's discuss hate
speech and proceed further for the same
so what is hate speech any speech that
dispar a group of people because of
their race religion nationality national
origin sexual orientation or gender
identity is considered as hate speech
hate speech is frequently used to
promote
boty and hatred additionally it can be
applied to threaten and intimidate
others people may experience liness
anxiety and fear as a result hate crimes
may also result from it additionally
hate speech can harm between various
racial and ethnic groups it is crucial
to identify hate speech using since
doing so can assist in stopping these
negative impacts dear Learners if you

question for you I will give you exactly
one minute for this you can comment or
you can give your answer in the chat
section so I I can see if your answer is
given by you are right or wrong so the
question is all keywords in Python are
capitalized

so I'm starting the timer of 1 minute
okay the time start now to let me know
your answers
please just type your answer in the
comment section or in the chat
section all python keywords are
in capitalized lower case uppercase
none let us know your answer in the
comment section
below 30 seconds remaining all keywords
in Python are capitalized lower case
upper case or
none seconds
more all keywords in Python are
capitalized lower case upper case and
none let us know your answer in the
comment section below
please 5 Seconds
more after the lotted time has passed
Those Who provided the currect response
will receive a response and those Who
provided the incorrect response will
receive one so now let's move to our
programming part first we will open
command prom to write a command to open
jupyter notebook so here we will write
jupyter
notebook
Center this is the landing page of
jupyter notebook and here you have to go
new
python this is the how the Jupiter
kernel look lies so
here first we will import some major
libraries of python which will help in
analyzing the data so here I will write
import
Hondas s PD
Port
numai as
NP then
from
Escalon
section or
text counter vector
then one more
from let's
learn model
selection
testore split
then from
Escalon
three
import okay
then
I okay counter
vectorizer C vectorizer it
is so napai is a python Library used for
working with array it also has a
function for working with the domain of
linear algebra and matrices it is an
open source project and you can use it
freely numai stand for numerical
Python and pandas pandas is a software
Library written for the Python
programming language for data
manipulation and Analysis in particular
it offers data structure and operation
for manipulating numerical tables and
time
series this count vectorizer a fantastic
utility offered by the python psychic
learn module is count vectorizer it is
used to convert a given text into a
vector based on the number of times like
count that each word appears across the
full text train test
split so our data is separated into
train and testing data using the train
test split Technique we must first
separate our data into features X and
label y divided into X train X Tex y
train and Y test the data frame is the
model is strained and fitted using X
train and Y TR okay then decision tree a
supervised machine learning algorithm
called decision tree uses a set of
principles to make judgments much like
how people do okay forward let's simp
import some more
libraries so here I will write
import R then
import uh
nltk then
from ntk
dot
okay I will write here
stemmer equals to NLT
TK
snowball
St in
English from nltk
purpose
upwards okay then we'll write
import
string and I will assign the stop
word was to set
words and
English okay
nltk
okay the function in the module allow
you to determine whether a given text
fills a given regular expression which
is known as a regular expression or re
or if a regular expression matches a
particular string which comes down to
the same thing nltk the nltk toolkit was
created for python users to deal with
NLP it offers us numerous test data test
data set and different text processing
libraries using nltk a range of
activities can be carried out including
tokenizing and visualizing par trees
Snowball stemmer the stemming algorithm
also refers to as pter 2 stemming
algorithm is an improv version of
portter stammer because some of its
shortcomings have been addressed okay so
stop word a stop word is frequently used
term that a search engine has been
considered both while indexing items for
searching and when retrieving them as a
result of search
query then import a string it is used to
determine whether or not substring is
part of the main string it gives back a
pointer to the first instance of S2 in
S1 I hope you guys understand till here
okay if you have any queries any
question regarding this please comment
down below so after importing libraries
let's import our data set so I will
write here DF equals to PD do
data set name
Twitter
data
okay so
print so this is the Twitter data set
you can download it from the description
box below and if you want to see the
last five rows instead of top five rows
you can use tail instead of head
okay moving forward I will add a new
column to this data set as labels which
will contain the values as hate speech
detected offensive language detected or
no hait no offensive language detected
okay for that I have to write here
dfal to
DF map
DET thir one is
okay column so here I will add DF dot
head
can see we have added
labels okay offensive
language moving forward now I will only
select the tweet and the label column
for the rest of the task obtaining a h
spech detection model okay so here I
will write dfal to DF
have to write
tweet I guess yeah you can see here
tweet comma
labels right here DF do
head there you can
see it okay so moving now I will create
a function to clean the text in the
Tweet column like
this that at theate and this
exclamation this type of
words here I will add DF
clean next
WR
text equals to
Str text equals
to read do
substring das this do r question
mark
Thena and I will write here text equals
to R do
substring https
plus
then W
ww
plus okay
comma
text okay here I will write
text to AR
dot
sub not
start Plus
here then let
me here I will write text equals
to R do substring
do punctuation
here again text equals
to read.
substring
then for the next line comma
no
D all
x equals
to not in St
x equal
to done
here I will write TF then column name
tweet DF
we have
print everything will be clean like
this let me run
it okay so I hope you guys understand
till here if you have any question or
any query regarding any code so please
comment down below so everything is
sorted now everything is clear green
okay so moving forward now let's split
the data set into training and test set
and train a machine learning model for
the task of H page okay so here I will
write x equals
top do
array then
DF dot array
then
dfer here I will write x equals to cv.
fit go transform
X
okay here I will write xcore
train
test
inore test
X comma y
comma
size
to state will be
5 equals
to BC
I will write classifier dot
fit okay let me run
it okay d f
the season 3 classifier sorry my
bad here input contains
an okay there is one
empty it's
working so
moving forward now let's test this
machine learning model to see if it is
detecting ha speech or not okay so here
I will write
test
underscore okay so I will give one
sentence here like
uh
I and DF equals to
transform T underscore
data
three then here I write
print class
as you can see H spe is detected because
I will kill you there is something hate
on that so let me write another sentence
here like
you me run
it so here you can see no hate and
offensive speech you are awesome
so try with another
one like
you okay press enter so here you can see
it is not ha speech but offensive
language okay I hope you guys must have
understand how you can detect ha using
machine learning if you have any queries
you can ask in the comment section below
our team will respond as soon as
possible don't forget to check the
course link from the description box
below and don't forget to download the
data set from the description box and if
you want to this full code just comment
