hey guys mobile and web applications are
something that we practically can't live
without from ordering food to booking
flight tickets to making important bank
transactions
these apps have made our lives easier
to cope with the changing demands with
respect to user experience and security
web development needs to take a robust
and efficient approach
this video tells you what the future of
web development will look like
hey guys welcome to this short video on
future of web development
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already then
hit the subscribe button and the bell
icon to never miss an update
so let's begin by understanding what web
development is
a web development involves building and
maintaining website and other web
applications
a web developer is expected to convert a
web design into a website
they are responsible for how a website
or web application looks and functions
from its user interface and page layout
to back-end systems for gathering data
so a lot goes into building a website
there are several tools frameworks and
packages that help create web
applications
html css javascript are the basic
languages required to develop a website
javascript offers
several frameworks and libraries like
react angular and view
javascript and its environment like
node.js
and express shares
node is an open source clock cross
platform runtime environment that allows
developers to create server-side tools
and javascript applications
knowledge of the basic command line like
npm
node package manager is essential
but i'm sure you're aware of all this
so what's going to be new
well according to experts there are four
major future trends in web development
so let's start and decode them one by
one
first up is typescript
typescript is a superset of javascript
and is an object oriented programming
language
in simple terms it is just javascript
with other impressive additional
features
typescript supports all javascript
libraries and frameworks with an
increase in code complexity javascript
had to fulfill the requirements of oop
hence that lead to the introduction of
typestrip
typescript helps with quicker code
development thus improving performance
there are a few improvements with
typescript that give it an upper hand
over javascript
only at the time of development does
typescript bring out compilation issues
this reduces the chances of mistakes
occurring at runtime
a property of typescript is that it is
strongly typed or enables static typing
static typing allows type correctness to
be checked at compilation time
in javascript this isn't
possible
typescript is nothing but javascript and
some additional features
ie es6 features
some of these features are interfaces
generics namespaces null checking and
access modifiers
typescript supports intellisense which
provides active hints as the code is
added
so considering all these advantages
typescript is something that will be
widely adopted by teams across the globe
next up is webassembly
webassembly is a new way to run on the
web
web assembly or wasm is the second
universal programming language that all
web browsers can understand and run
however you're not going to be writing
scripts in webassembly yourself
it's a low level assembly language
designed to be very close to compiled
machine code and very close to native
performance
what this means is practice
is that javascript is no longer the only
language you can run on the web
web browsers can run any language now if
that language has a web assembly
compiler
even traditional desktop languages like
c plus plus and rust can be compiled
down to wasm with relative ease
wasm currently runs in 94 of users
browsers with ie uc browser and oprah
mini support being the main things
holding it back as per usual
however it's backed by developers from
mozilla microsoft google and apple
and support in modern browsers is fast
moving
next up we have package managers
packages
a package manager or package management
system is a collection of software tools
that automates the process of installing
upgrading configuring and removing
software packages for a computer's
operating system in a consistent manner
it typically maintains a database of
software dependencies and version
information to prevent software
mismatches and missing prerequisites
npm is the package manager for the node
javascript platform it puts modules in
place so that node can find them and
manages dependency conflicts
intelligently
it is extremely configurable to support
a wide variety of use cases
yarn is another package manager that
replaces the existing workflow for the
npm client or other package managers
while remaining compatible with the npm
registry
it has the same feature said as exciting
workflows
operating faster more securely and more
reliably
lastly we have javascript dialects
compiler to javascript there are many
javascript dialects like coffee strip
darn
babel
typescript
and svelte that offers better features
that javascript and ultimately compile
to javascript
it is likely that these languages will
be the future
there are several other predictions like
better appreciation for web standard
less client works
and more focus on personal projects and
the need to know more languages
regardless the future of web development
looks more promising than ever if you
wish to make a career as a web developer
start now
so where do you think the future of web
development is headed
