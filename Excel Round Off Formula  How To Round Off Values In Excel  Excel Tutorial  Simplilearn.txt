hello everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this tutorial we will
learn the excel roundoff formula
before we begin make sure that you have

now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is round off formula in excel
now for this particular tutorial we will
be using the student data set
now let's get back to the practical mode
and start our microsoft excel
now we are in the microsoft excel and as
you can see on my sheet okay let me
expand this
so as you can see on my screen we have
the data set belonging to students so we
have 10 students and every one of them
has name roll number class blood group
and marks etc and at the end we have the
person page and as you can see we have
the percentage in terms of float values
and we have a lot of decimal values like
8 and above so what if you wanted to
just have one or two digits after
the actual percentage like 80.6 or 80.66
right it would be a little bit more or
good to read right so that's what a
round off actually means so now let's
work on having rounded off values for
the percentage now let's create a new
column
let's name it as a
round
off
percentage
great
so to actually perform the round off
formula we do have a predefined method
for that
for that you just have to type in
equals to
round
and there you go we have round up and
around down so both of them perform the
same operation let's select a round up
and
this is the m column and the row number
is 3
so we'll have to press m 3 and the
number of values after the decimal point
for now let's select
1
and there you go press enter and the
value should be rounded off now 80.66 is
being rounded off to 80.7
now when you drag the cell
to the all the rows then you can see all
the values will be rounded off
here you can see
75.16 has been rounded off to
75.2 and 82.33 has been rounded off to
82.4 so we end up with having rounded
off values
so with that we have come to an end of
this round of formula in excel and if
