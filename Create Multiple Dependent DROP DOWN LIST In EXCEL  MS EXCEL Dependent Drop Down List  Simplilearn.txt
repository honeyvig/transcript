without further delay let's get started
with demonstration for today's session
which is based on creating a dependent
drop down list in Excel so now we landed
onto our Excel spreadsheet so what
exactly are you trying to do you ask so
I am trying to get this straight okay
now we have Team employee name and count
right let's say you wanted to add the
team details in the First Column
employee name in the second column right
so I have three teams so te
aam
D and uh te
Ops right so this is how beginners do
right and uh if you want to automate
this we can do this using data
validation similarly let's say I am
adding details of te developer and
employee name is let's say
IV okay uh so I want to add something
like this into this particular data set
or table so let's uh erase the column B
let's try to figure out column a first
so quickly go to yeah select the cell
first quickly go to data validation go
to the data options and here you can see
data tools select this particular data
validation option and here go to list
and the source so select this particular
Source this is a source of our list so
press
okay and there you go Excel has
automatically fixed the data for us
now the operation has been automated and
I can directly select whatever the team
I want and let's try to expand this to
all the sets that we have in our table
so whichever you select whichever the
cell you select and you can have the
options there just select
now let's say I select team testing
right and now here I want a similar data
validation option which will give me the
list of employees from the testing team
right let's say you give me a solution
which tells me to create a new data
validation option uh that suggests me to
take the list from this particular cell
or column okay now let's say all of a
sudden I change the cell let's say um
Chris ctis let's say I add a Chris ctis
to employee name here and he is not
attending the team meeting now or let's
say he got a better opportunity and he
left the organization is with a
different organization now I want to
eliminate this particular cell and all
of a sudden I get team developer in the
first row now does ctis belong to this
particular selection development right
no he doesn't belong to team development
he used to belong to testing right so
similarly if I swap the rules if not
eliminate an employee if I swap the
rules then I should be getting this
particular options not from testing So
based on this particular cell my data
validation which is present in the
column B should change so that is
exactly the meaning of dependent
drop-down menu in Excel so that is what
we're going to do here today now for
that you might want to use something
called as an offset so before you create
a data validation formula for this let's
go to the here so here you will be
choosing list so instead of just giving
a routine list we will give a formula
over here which will select the list
based on the offset or based on the cell
which is present over here so we will be
using the help of offset function over
here so equals to offset
so the reference this is the reference
of the table of the end you know the
entire data table which has the teams
options the employee options right so
this is the offset reference or the
beginning cell which I will be giving to
my offset formula let's fix that uh cell
by using the function code function key
f4 on the menu uh keyboard so we have
fixed it now the rules now you want to
extract cells from one Ru I mean you
will be giving one option over here so
give one and now the columns so so far
so good we don't know from which column
do we select the data right we have
three columns over here so we don't know
from which column do we have to select
the data so for that you might remember
the index match function which is one of
our tutorials in the Excel playlist so
you will be using the part of that index
match function that is the match
function to recognize which uh column we
have to select so type in match and
press T to select the function and now
is your lookup value So based on this
particular selection which is over the
A2 right whichever uh data is present
here whichever team is present here
based on that lookup value you will be
selecting the column from these sections
right if I give Ops you should be
selecting this column if I give testing
should be selecting this particular
column right now fix that um column and
cell using the function key F4 you can
fix the column but the row number might
change let's say A2 A3 A4 So based on
the uh position of the cell and the
column you can change you know you can
select it so look up values there now
the lookup array so this is your lookup
array let's fix it using function key F4
comma you need the exact match it's done
so before getting on to the columns and
how and width Etc you need to understand
offset takes things differently so index
match and look up they will count the
columns as s 1 2 3 but in case of offset
function it will you know uh count num
starting from zero so team devops or
team Dev it counts as column number zero
team Ops as column number one and team
testing as column number three so you
need to subtract one value from the
number which match function gives you
let's say the match function gives you 1
then 1 - 1 0 so the offset function will
understand I need to select the column
zero which is team de right now the next
part of the formula height and width so
what do you mean by height
basically uh F column 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so
here we are we have we are having 15
number of employees in the developer
team and uh 1 2 3 4 18 number of
employees in Ops Team and 12 number of
employes in testing team so basically
the height of the uh column is nothing
but the number of employees which are
present in that particular column right
so you can see we have um colored a few
cells in orange color which means that
those positions are vacant or that
particular team is populated with only
limited number of employees now let's
say I give the height of 15 here in the
formula then the employees from Ops Team
Sean Susan and Mick are not going to be
present when I select the Ops right so
in those scenarios what you want to do
is you might you know just add U the
whole uh you know the height of the uh
largest column the highest number of
columns right so I have 19 as the
highest right so I'll give 9 19 here and
uh how many number of what's the width
you want to select so I want to select
one cell so my input for that particular
cell will be one but now this creates a
chaotic experience to us what is that
let's see now before we enter the cell
let's select all cut and we have the
formula in our hand now go to select the
cell first now go to data validation
tools and here you will be selecting
list and here you'll be pasting the
formula and press okay now okay let's
not drag the formula at once we have a
few more modifications to do so now here
we have developer team developer so we
have the list from developers right we
have Aaron LS etc etc and when you go to
the last one we have Tob as the last one
but wait a minute we have another
selection an empty
which is these we don't want this right
so let's say you wanted to select Toby
and by mistake you end up selecting the
Mt cell and now you don't have data
right that is not supposed to be
happening so how do you change it now
basically what you're trying to do is
you want to count the number of uh
employees present in that particular
department and you want to give that
particular exact count to the position
where you have the column height so that
your formula doesn't make a mistake
right so that's exactly the thing what
we want to do let's say we use count a
function over
here and select this and what you get is
15 and let's say I use another count
equals
to count a and I count the Ops steam
members and it will give me 18 and now
another
count and count the number of employees
in testing that that will give me 12 so
these are the numbers which I want to
pass onto my offset function and that
particular number should be present in
the height so I can't uh you know do it
every single time it's again a manual
task I want to automate it so how do I
do it simple integrate the count a
function along with the offset function
that we just created so the offset
function will tell the count function
which team am I pointing to and how many
number of employees are there in that
particular column will be counted by the
count function so that's what we are
basically trying to do now so uh let's
go back to the data validation okay
Escape let's go back to the data
validation menu over here edit your data
validation formula copy
it
equals
to count a paste the formula you have
now close the
function remember copy the formula only
until C don't copy equals to else you'll
be finding an error Now erase it
completely now go back to your data
validation
menu and here where where you have the
19 which indicates the uh colum height
paste that formula you just copyed and
now it's
okay right now when you uh when you are
on uh data team developer and press on
data validation option over here you can
see the last Toby is the last one and
you don't have any more blank cells so
that's how you create cre uh dependent
data validation or dependent drop down
list in Excel now the main task is to
copy so uh remember you just dragged the
formula or data validation and there you
have it right so U will the same thing
apply for this particular formula no it
will
not okay it did but anyways uh let's say
we don't have a team developer over here
then how do you do do
it so you can select the formula press
copy and now select a new cell in the
same colum
B just expand that selection to all the
cells now right click go to paste
special and now here select the
validation and press okay so you have
that validation selected over here now I
have the people from developer let's say
I'll select Kelly Kelly here and in this
particular option I'll select Ops now
here in my drop-down I can see team
members from Ops Thomas Mark Ivan right
so all the employees
from the Ops Team and here let's say I
select testing team and uh I will have
employees from the testing column Kathy
Michael Tim Bobby Chris right so that's
how you basically create the dependent
drop- down menu in Excel and with that
we have come to an end of this session

menu in Excel and if you have any
