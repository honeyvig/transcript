hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about creating a pivot table
using multiple sheets in excel
so usually we create pivot tables using
one single sheet but we had a query is
it possible to create pivot table using
multiple sheets today we're going to try
the same
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simplyturn now here we have four
different sheets of the sales
so the first sheet is the west zone
next is south zone east zone and central
zone so all this data belongs to one
single sheet that is super store dataset
so i have categorized or i have taken a
part of the data which belongs to
central region south region west region
and east region now we are going to use
all these four sheets and create one
single sheet which is the pivot table of
all the four sheets
now without further ado let's start the
process now for that we might want to
use the shortcut key that is alt d
now press p
now this starts the pivot chart wizard
now here we have to choose the option
multiple consolidation ranges
then click on next
and here you can see the pivot table is
clicked by default
now we'll go to next
now here click i will create page fields
or the pivot chart wizard will
automatically create if you want that to
create for you
now click on next now here let's select
the range
now i'll be selecting the range
add it
now next we'll select east
followed by that we have south
and finally we have best
now we will name these according to the
regions
so the first one will be west
next one will be south
next one will be east
and the last one will be central
click on next and here select new
worksheet and finish and there you go
you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the summation value
so click anywhere on the pivot table and
change it from count
to
[Music]
sum so that you have the summation of
the total number of sales sub category
sales and grand total of sales etc
now
here you can see all option now let's
select central and you'll get the
details of the central region
the grand total and the sales happening
quantity of sales etc now here you can
see the furniture office supplies
technology and the grand total all in
one single sheet now let's get back to
the original sheet so as you can see
this is the original sheet and in the
original sheet you can see various more
categories
which is
the
which is the shipment mode customer
customer segment country city state
and you also have
product name sub category etc so if you
had added all these into this sheet you
can also create a separate option of
adding my new details to your pivot
table
so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets so if you
have any queries regarding any of the
topics covered in this session or if you
need the data set that we have used in
this session then please feel free to
