yeah hi winners uh this is dr srikanth
from team mds conquer now i'll be
talking about
uh the first and foremost important
topic in your oral surgery okay
that is your exudancia and in detail
about
impaction okay so i'll be focusing more
on the contents of the topics where the
neet
and inactivity is focusing and
i'll i'll provide you as much references
as possible and i'll include as much
diagram based stuff as possible
in this session so coming to the
contents like i don't want to discuss
all the basic stuff of like definition
and everything well
you're well familiar with and the most
important area where the questions are
being thrown
is the contraindications of extraction
so if you go to the contra indications
of extraction it is basically of two
types that is absolute contraindications
and relative contraindications
so absolute contraindications are the
conditions where
you should never attempt or you should
never do any sort of extraction at any
cost
whereas relative contraindications are
the conditions where you can think of
by doing some precautions you take some
precautions and you can proceed with the
treatment of extraction so what's one
such absolute contraindication
is hemangioma or hematoma so any sort of
hemangioma or hematoma if if you are
suspecting
in the in the patient at that particular
area where you are planning to
go ahead with the extraction you should
avoid it because
there will be loss of heavy blood and it
may lead to
syncope and shock next one of course
uncontrolled bleeding in the case of
like your haemophilias
where the bleeding cannot be controlled
okay so such conditions are absolute
contraindications
or your av malformations like your av
stimulus uh in such conditions it is
absolutely contraindicated so coming to
the related contraindications the things
that you have to make a notice
uh it is in the case of your acute
cellulitis or in the case of anag
or in the case of uncontrolled diabetes
or in the case of
hypertension in the case of bleeding
disorders in the case of cardiovascular
disorders in the case of
liver diseases and in the case of long
term
steroid therapies and patient who is
undergoing radiation therapy all these
are
related contraindications so make make a
note they can ask you a question like
which of the following is absolute
contraindication which of the following
is
relative contraindication among the four
is a regularly asked question for you
so the next goes is of course the fabric
topic for most of you that is transalvar
extraction so other name for trans salad
or extraction is
it's also called as open extraction or
it is called
as surgical extraction okay so coming to
this
open extraction and surgical extraction
where is normal extraction done where is
open extraction or surgical extraction
is done and i hope like most of you are
familiar with your normal extraction
uh in your under graduation level so we
need to learn like
what are the conditions where you have
to go for this trans cellular or
this open extraction the first important
condition is
whenever the tooth is showing
lots of resistance to extraction
you try it but you are not in a position
to extract that in such condition it is
go for
it's better to go for a trans-salad or
extraction next is
uh endodontically treated teeth so we
can discuss about that
what are the changes that occurs in
endodontically treated tits so
endodontically treated
there will be loss of nine percentage of
moist in it so okay
regularly teeth has moist in it okay so
whenever
it is whenever the pulp is removed
during the endodontic procedure
your moist will be lost that's nine
percentage of moist is again a very very
important
question for you in hindu point of view
so whenever the moist is lost the teeth
is going to become brittle and it is
more prone for fracture so whenever you
are extracting
and enlarge you should be very careful
because the teeth is very brittle and
second thing it's better to go for an
open extraction
the second one the next is whenever you
have malformations like uh
like dilaceration or like a germination
or fusion
which is like which is different from
your regular
structure of it because every two uh
the movements of extraction were made in
such a way that is related to the
anatomy of fatigue
okay so whenever you have abnormality in
the anatomy or deviation in
your anatomy during your developmental
stage that is during your morphogenesis
okay
so morphological difference occurs in
the morphogenesis during the growth
period
so such teeth uh are are very
i mean like you should be very uh
caution about extracting such tree that
has die laceration
germination fusion and everything and
the next course is the
sclerosis of bone okay the sclerosis of
underlining bone in such conditions
it's better to go for open extraction
and the teeth with pathologies which
includes like periapical cysts or
periapical granulomas or the cyst
or the teeth which are associated with
the tumors all these things
you need to be very very careful and you
need to be very caution
during the extraction and it's better to
go for open extraction or
trans cellular or the surgical
extraction so these are all the
indications of
uh the extraction and of course
when you have an ankylosis
okay when you have ankylosis so this is
a radiograph where you can see so what
is abnormal in the radiograph they can
question you okay
you can see the teeth was not up to the
occlusion level okay this is occlusion
level
but the teeth was not brought up
occlusion level by seeing your
periodontal ligament space loss of
periodontal ligament space
you can clearly see that ankylos is the
very peculiar feature of ankylosis on
radiographies
there is no pdl space i i hope like most
of you are familiar with the pdl space
okay
so you can see all these this this is
pdl space okay
so whereas in the ankles teeth you don't
have you don't have that
particular pdl okay so there is a direct
bond between the
teeth and the bone that is called as
ankylosis so during ankylos is also
it is better to go for the open
extraction
and next important they can ask you what
is the mode of treatment or what is the
pathology that you can see
in this arrow weight okay you can see
this is hypercementosis
okay this is you can see this is this is
basically the outline
but you have excess cementosis this is
called as
hyper cementosis so even in
hypercementosis case
it is better to go for open
extraction okay
or translator extraction they can ask a
pathology related
diagram also they can simply give you
the diagram by keeping an arrow they can
ask you the diagnosis or they can ask
you the
treatment plan of the case
uh the next comes is okay so before we
go over trans cellular extraction it is
mandatory that you have to take
radiographs and these radiographs are
going to help you out
in coming with few conclusions okay so
that is called
as pre-extraction radiographic
analysis or p extraction radiographic
evaluation
so what are the things that you have to
see in the pre-extraction radiograph
the first and foremost important thing
is its
relationship means the tooth to be
extracted
its relationship to the vital structures
so how it is related to the vital
structures because when you are
extracting the teeth
it may cause damage to the adjacent
vital structure such peculiar adjacent
vital structure
in the case of your maxillarity when you
are extracting the maxillary teeth is
maxillary sinus so how far it is from
maxillary sinus
whereas when you are extracting
mandibular molars or mandible or
posterior teeth
inferior alloy canal how how far it is
is it very close or not this is a
question that is given in the
neet 20 20. this question was given in
the
neat 2020. uh how how
like what are the modifications that
occurs in the root on an iopa
of mandible or third molar when it is
very close or when it is overlapped with
the
inferior arolar canal or inferior arrow
now or a bundle this is a question that
is given in the recent neet
2020 and the next one is when you're
talking about the mandibular premolars
okay you need to talk about the mental
foramen
or the mental now because it is closely
approximating and it is present between
the
two mandibler premolars and uh
how far the adjacent tool structures
okay but the main consent when you are
extracting
is these three vital structures that is
the maxillary sinus
which is close to the maxillary first
molar
inferior velar canal which is close to
the mandible earth
mandible or third molars and mandibular
molars and mental foramen which is close
to the mandibular premolars okay
so these are the main concent of the
vital structures that you have to make a
note
and you have to see the configuration of
the
you have to see the configuration of the
root also in the pre radiographic
analysis
how the roots are one is you need to
talk about the number of roots
which is useful for both your endo as
well as your surgery
the second one is about the size of the
roots third one is there any curvature
is there any divergence is there any
convergence whether roots are thin
tapered any abnormality in the root
structure like your torodontism
you have some abnormalities which we
will be discussing in oral path
and if there is any hypersymmetrisis for
example this case is hypercementosis
case
if there is any ankylosis or if it is
root canally treated so all these
analysis
should be done from radiographic
evaluation before you proceed to the
extraction that is basically more often
a trans cellular extraction whatever
extraction is a simple extraction
or a complicated or a translator
extraction is mandatory that you have to
do some radiographic
evaluation analysis before you proceed
to the next step
in the oral surgery department the next
comes is
of course like i have discussed about
the hypersymmetries and this is how
the overlapping okay this these are the
mandibular molars okay all these are
mandibular molars
and their relationship to the inferior
allular
canal now or cannot so whenever
this roots are merging on this okay
you will see some deviation in the
anatomy of the canal
okay so that is what the question that
is given in the
neat 22 which is a repeat of neet two
zero one two the same question
with a different uh uh concept was given
in uh
neat two zero one two and the same
question was repeated in the
neat twenty twenty okay so there are
different types of
different types of anatomies like
whenever it measures whenever it is very
close
whenever it is overlaps whenever like
sometimes in the case of your
molars mandible or molars you will you
will see the apical notch
something called as epical notch means a
notch which is present at the
epical one-third of the mandibular roots
okay you can see some epical not some
deviation
in the in the configuration of the root
outline that is called as epical notch
so whenever you have an apical notch it
is better to go for split technique of
extraction means for example if you see
this
i'm quite bad at diagrams
you can see this
you can consider this as a mandible or
third molar and
you can see some some
some disturbance something like this
some notch like this
at one point so you can you can predict
on the radiograph
that the inferior alloy or no canal is
going through this
so what you have to do if you if you
blindly extract the teeth what is going
to happen
your inferior alveolar now or the nerve
is going to come out
okay such conditions i may feel you have
encountered in your ug life okay may you
or your friend may extract one teeth and
the patient is complaining of
numbness after two or three days and it
doesn't goes
okay that can be something like that
okay
so what you have to do in such cases you
have to go for an open technique you
have to split the teeth
so you have to remove this part and you
have to remove this part separately so
that
so they can ask you like they can give a
radiograph where you can see apical
notch or they can given the description
part a patient of this says
and get the department upon radiographic
examination you have seen an apical
notch on the root configuration
and now what is the mode of treatment
that you are planning for this is going
to be a split technique you are going to
split the teeth and you are going to
remove the teeth in different multiple
pieces okay that's what the treatment
plan is
the next comes okay this is this is a
very better thing like you can see this
apical notch clearly in this
3d print view
see you can see this this is the notch
so here it is clearly seen that your
channel now bundle is going into the
roots in between the roots so when you
are extracting this state
there are high chances that this bundle
is going to get damaged so this
technique
what you have to do is you have to split
and you have to
you have to split and you have to
operate okay so that is what you have to
learn
the next comes i was talking about this
forum and that is mental forum and
mental foramen
you can see this is present between very
important points that you have to make
you know
mental foramen
is present between the first s and
second
premolar mandibler and it is very close
to
because they can ask you this also very
close to second premolar when compared
to the
first premolar you can see this
sometimes due to the variation in the
angulation you can see mental foramen
as a periapical radiation in this case
you can see as a periapical radiation
so in such case what you have to do you
have to apply the slop technique
so once you apply the slop technique if
it is moving away from the peripheral
area then you can consider it as a
mental foramen okay
so mental foramen is present between the
first and second premolar
and mental foramen is very close to
second premolar when compared to the
first premolar mental foramen sometimes
may get confused with a periapical cyst
or a
periapical lesion in such cases you have
to apply slob rule
to rule out of it i think
you're clear until now so we are done
with the
radiographic analysis also with some
diagram based on some case related stuff
also
so now you are planning for a like most
of your questions will move on
multiple extractions or
they may be on
like a complete mouth extraction full
mouth extraction so what is the like
when you're planning for a full mouth
extraction
uh what sequence you should follow is a
very very important area
and the area of cushions okay so first
of all you have to extract the maxillary
teeth
and the mandibular teeth has to be
extracted followed by the maxillary
so maxilla is first followed by the
mandible okay they're gonna ask you why
why maxilla is first important thing is
when you extract mandible first okay the
sockets will be open and if you are
planning to extract the maxilla
the debris or the tooth fragments or any
sort of
trauma can occur to the mandibular
socket so it's better to extract the
maxillary so
that is due to the gravity that's that's
just due to the
gravity so it's better to extract the
maxilla first followed by the
mandible that is a that is one reason
and second good explanation is if you
see the bones of maxilla and mandible
maxilla and mandible your maxillary
bones okay your maxillary bones are
porous bones
the porous bones when compared to the
mandibular bone okay more cancellous
bone is present in the maxilla
so whenever you give la to both maxilla
as well as mandible at the same time
maxillary teeth will anesthetize fast
maxillarities will get anesthetized fast
anesthesia
spreads fast in maxilla when compared to
the mandible okay
so that is one more reason but the
primary reason is
the debris and the fragments may fall
into the mandibular sockets
so the first tree that you have to
extract the maxillary posterior
most teeth that is maxillary third molar
if the molar is present
except except first molar
okay so first you have to extract third
second
then leave the first molar then go for
your premolars
okay premolars then extract the
first molar okay so that that's what the
sequence that you have to maintain
okay so how you have to do first you
have to go for the
maxillary posterior teeth except the
first molar followed by the mandibular
anterior teeth except the canon why
because
the root surface area of the maxillary
first molar and the root surface area of
the canine
this this will learn in both the
prosthetics as well as in the ortho
that the root surface area of the
maxillary first molar is highest among
the
more among the posterity and the canon
is highest among the
anterior tip so it is very difficult to
extract them so relaxation will be a
problem so it is better to extract the
adjacent teeth first then go for the
extraction of the
teeth that is either the first molar or
either the canal
followed by the first molar followed by
the canine
followed by the same sequence for the
mandibular
teeth molar and the canon the last t
that is extracted is again a commonly
asked question that is the mandibler
current is the
last teeth to be extracted the first
teeth to be extracted is a question for
you
the first teeth is the posterior most
man
maxillarity is the first teeth to be
extracted and the mandibular cannon is
the last teeth to be extracted
so you learn some reasons why
this is extracted first that is
extracted last okay so
we're going to the next level i mean the
very important aspect is about the
theories of
impacted teeth okay there are two
theories the first theory says that
it's almost the same it's all about
talking about the size okay
the first series says that the okay as
the as the evolution occurs
okay the mandibular size decreases
and there is no space for the adaption
of the molars
and the second theory is more often like
genetic based theory
okay what genetic base theory occurs
okay they talk about the two parents
okay you you i mean the child obtained
smaller jar from one parent and larger
teeth from another parent
so because of which there is no space
so both these are they gives the same
information no space
as there is no space for the eruption of
the
mandibular or maxillary third molars
they get impacted so these are the
theories of
impacted teeth
so the next goes is causes causes of
impaction
okay so because like nowadays your
questions are moving on the application
based
okay reading returning and just
trying to expel in the examination is a
is a pattern of
approach what we have learned in the ug
level because
uh you may not be exposed to the cases
and number of cases or even if you are
being exposed to the cases
you don't have that analysis power of
thinking like for example
this teeth is impacted why it is
impacted we never think
uh as an as an intern or an as in a
student from undergraduation level
in your opd what you do is you see when
the teeth is not
open out you just simply says okay that
is impacted
we don't analyze why it is impacted why
what is the reason it is impacted
so such application based questions will
be asked in the examination so it is a
it is a starting process where you need
to
think a play what you learn reading
and application okay so application part
is very very less in dentistry
we rudely go like for example if it is a
pulpal infection
i do root canal treatment done what root
canal treatment okay take working length
okay fill the obturation feel it finish
lines
no we we never think that why why we
have to do this
what is what is the exact diagnosis for
this
what type of finish line is given in the
crown why this finish line has to be
given
so we don't analyze all these things
someone comes we do
someone comes they they tell something
and we just follow this is what
dentistry is in most of the scenarios at
undergraduate level
and i can i can add the same note for
even the post graduates
someone comes they ask you to do this
you do it
why the outcome is it's a small thing
like
a tooth structure is a small thing and
you have a braid that is 32 plus 20 that
is 52 teeth you have
okay so no one is going to ask you pulp
is something very small
very very small okay the same thing
cannot be applied to the human body
if you have some issue in the heart ah
go give this do this
no it's not possible because the patient
will die
even if a tooth is damaged the patient
may not die so this is what the
negligency that occurs
in dentistry in india
but once you go out of out of the scope
and
uh go go to the other countries
dentistry is very very clear
documentation okay
and you have an evidence-based dentist
and all these are there
so it's time that uh uh i mean like good
good format of exams
okay your need or inacti okay mostly
your need
ins it is not still updated to
integrated approach i
what i feel by seeing the questions or
the question graph is still there just
focusing on asking the diamond
dimensions diameters which is uh
meaningless at one point of you
according to me
okay but your need luckily has become an
integrated approach
okay so most of your abroad examinations
for example once you're done with your
masters
if you're planning to move ahead to
other countries most of the inter
country trans examinations are now
become integrated
means they're going to give a clinical
scenario and they're going to ask you
the reason they're going to ask you the
treatment plan they're asking they're
going to tell you the treatment plan and
they're going to ask you
why only this treatment has to be done
so
i request personally okay we need to
update dentistry
at least from our point of view not in
the fabric of examination
but to make yourself a better dentist
for the future
so let's try to analyze everything just
try to find out the secrets behind
everything okay
so these are the causes of impact and
the they're divided into two types one
is local causes and
second one is generalized or systemic
causes so coming to the local causes
uh the first one is obstruction for
eruption so something is coming
and obstructing so that the impacted is
not going to
come out that is the irregularity in the
position or the presence of edges and
teeth
no space the existing teeth was tilted
no space
the second one is the density of
overlying and the supporting bone the
density of supporting bone is not too
far
or not too too at the point for
the impacted teeth to come out and this
is what an application based question
which is given in pga
okay now we don't have this pga
examination now everything is shifted in
icd
lack of space in the dental arch okay
they have given the super numeratory
in the in the description so whenever
you have a supernumeratory teeth the
extra teeth okay there are high chances
that the adjacent teeth may get impacted
uninterrupted adapted delayed eruption
or unarrested or
impacted and of course we have discussed
this ankylosis of either primary teeth
or permanent teeth
okay they they get impacted they don't
come out
okay our return deciduous teeth or
non-reserved uh deciduously they still
stay so that the
primary so the permanent teeth which is
present below the deciduous is not going
to come out
your angular bone is very strong it's
not able to resolve
so that there is no space for eruption
of the permanence
or sometimes it can be ectopic position
of the tooth burn okay
it's not in the arch it is erupted in
somewhere
out of arch or somewhere in any part of
the human body
okay so such also they don't come out
when they don't come out they are called
as impacted
so dilation or or maybe trauma
no proper eruption pattern
or associated with existent soft tissue
or or bony lesions
it's very difficult so all these are the
things that you have to
make a note these are the local causes
means causes at a single point at a
particular point at a particular tooth a
single tip
the next comes is the systemic causes
you need to learn about few
syndromes and everything where you can
see more retained
teeth or unadaptative that is sometimes
it is hereditary
sometimes it is post natal okay that may
be due to the abnormalities like
rickets anemias tuberculosis
congenital syphilis okay or due to
malnutrition or any of these
systemic causes can lead to the impact
at it
and of course endocrine glands are going
to control lots of things
uh in the human body including the oral
cavity that is the
endocrine disorders of thyroid
parathyroid pituitary like hypo
and all these things uh they have some
effect on the osteoclastic activity
uh which is the primary culprit okay
where once the resorption occurs
then there is a chance for the eruption
of the permanent okay
so i mean these endocrine things may be
indirectly related to the
osteoclastic activity some hereditary
things that you have to make and what
about these are the syndromes which we
will learn at the best of these
syndromes in your oral medicine and oral
path that is down syndrome
your your osteopetrosis ketocranial
dysplasia cleft palate very important
cleft palate
and all these again are some of the
systemic causes for occurrence of the
impacted tics i hope you are very very
clear all these points are important
they can convert that into clinical
scenario they can tell you
patient is having cleft palate and they
can ask you like
an option related to the impaction
the next is about the classifications
okay so very very important
classifications
okay so i hope you should be very very
familiar with
all these contents okay so i mean
you're familiar because these are very
very important first is winter's
classification
the second one is classification which
helps in telling the relationship of the
ramus with that of the mandibular third
molar the third one is
depth classification how far how depth
it is we'll learn about this
but make sure you practice this keep try
to record this
in your brain this diagram this is
because this diagram is going to explain
everything what is required
so first is depth classification
so what happens in depth okay the depth
is just a comparison
of your ocular surface of second molar
to the occlusal surface of third molar
okay so when the occlusal surface of the
second molar and third molar
are at same level or at same level
or when the third molar is above the
level of second molar then it is
level a the second comes is
b when the ocular surface of the second
molar
or i mean the third molar is below the
occlusal surface of the second molar
but above the cervical part this is the
cervical part
above the cervical part then it is
called as level b
and the third one the occlusal surface
of the
third molar is
below the occluded surface of second
molar
and below the cervical line of the
second molar
then it is called as level c which is
difficult
level c is difficult which is easy this
is easy
the next classification next
classification is
rama's relationship
you can see this is a ramus you have
space
when the space is available it is class
one
when the space is not available half of
the part is
half of the third molar is out and half
the third molar is in the bone then it
is clustered
entire third molar is in the bone then
it is class which is difficult
this is difficult which is easy this is
easy
next the question on difficult index
2017 knee 2018 nate
that is a question on difficulties this
question can be prepared with a clinical
scenario
by giving a radiograph and asking you to
analyze it one
second thing or by giving the
description for example a patient
entered the department upon the
radiographic iop examination it is
concluded that
your mandibular third molar is at
depth b and it is in relation to
ram relationship is class 2 and it's a
misangular impacted teeth what is the
difficult index
such questions can be asked either by
description or the description you have
to interpret from the radiograph they
can give a radiograph
by seeing the radiograph rammus and
comparing with the occlusal surface of
the second molar to the third molar
and by seeing the orientation of the
third molar you have to come
to the conclusion of the difficult index
okay the important thing so this is a
difficult index which is taken from
nilima malik fourth edition
so coming to the types okay that is miso
angular
horizontal vertical distributor so this
is
lower third molars so the most easiest
is
misangler it has one score followed by
horizontal two score
followed by vertical three square
followed by this two angular is four
square so
the most difficult extraction in the
mandibular third molar is
disto angular the most easiest
extraction in the
mandible or third molar is misa angular
and
it's going to be reverse in the
maxillary third molars so the same
question is asked in the
maxillary third molars so maxillary
third molars the easiest is going to be
distributed
the difficulty is going to be the misa
angular okay so these are the
important things that you have to make
about and further important thing is
the most common impacted teeth is a
regular last question so most common
impacted teeth is
mandibular third molar the most common
type of impaction is
mesoangular the most common tooth
impacted is mandibular third molar
the most common type of infection is
miso angular
the most easiest type of impaction in
mandible or third molars is again miso
angular
the most difficult is this triangular
and it's going to be reverse if they're
asking for the maxillary third molar i
hope you're very very
clear and i hope it is very simple
common sense for an
undergraduate who is done with the bds
to identify
the angulations by seeing the iop which
is misa angular which is distributed
okay which is vertical which is
horizontal everything can be
easily done okay done next one we have
already learned
depths a b c a is the easiest and
c is the difficult scorings are one two
three
we have learned the classes that is the
rammus relationship or the space
availability
class one class two class three one is
easy three is difficult one two three
so basing up on these three values that
is the type of impaction
that is the depth of impacted teeth that
is the space available for impacted
teeth
you combine all these values okay you
add them
on adding if the value ranges from seven
to ten this is very difficult if it
ranges from five to seven
it is moderately difficult if it ranges
from three to four it is minimal
difficult so they can ask a question
okay upon radiographic examination it
was concluded that
the patient is having a disto angular
teeth which is at
level b and which is at class 2 in
relation to that of the
ramus so what is the answer distro
angular the score is
4 class 2 is 2
and i mean level 2 is 2 class 2 is 2
so it is 8 so if it is 8 it falls under
very difficult okay so such questions
either by giving a radiograph or an iopa
or an opg or by giving the description
they are going to ask you and then you
have to count all these three parameters
add one to other and then you have to
compare with this index and you have to
tell the index simply they can ask you
what is the difficulty score
second thing i can ask you what is the
difficulty level these are the three
levels
or they can ask you simply the
difficulty score the difficulty score
for the question what i have given is
eight
for the difficulty level is very
difficult
i hope you are very very clear and
familiar
with this okay so i'm moving to the next
part
okay i hope most of you are familiar w
a r what are these called as
war lines or winter lines right
so very very important so what are these
water lines how to draw these water
lines
okay and i mean these are drawn on the
radiograph right on the radiograph
and the radiograph of war line should be
taken
must taken by parliament angle technique
we'll learn about this paralleling angle
bisecting angle what are the advantages
what are the uses in our radiology but
make a note at this point of radiology
whenever you draw the water lines
whenever the water lines water lines are
given by scientists the scientist
also has taken with paralleling angle
technique so
you have to draw these lines on a
paralleling angle technique these are
war lines that is white line
this is a white line red line
okay and this is an amber line okay so
these are the
three lines which are called as water
lines so we'll try to learn
each and every line related to water
length because war lines
at one point are going to be very easy
at one point
the question paper or the paper setter
can make the things very very tricky
so let's read each and every line and
we'll try to understand
what is given in our nilima malik
done we'll move yeah so we will discuss
what are these war lines in detail
so coming to the white line okay the
first one is
white line so as we have already seen in
the
radiograph i mean in the radiograph or
the animation photograph in the last
slide
that it corresponds to the occlusal line
what a closure line a line that is drawn
touching the occlusal surface of the
first and second molar
and extended posteriorly over the third
monitor
so it's going to give the occlusal
difference between the
second molar first molar to third mole
okay so that is that is something like
what we have learned in the
classification that is the depth
position
so it indicates the difference in the
occlusion level of the second and third
so it's very very easy white line
okay the point to be added is occlusion
okay that is about white so most of we
get confused between this amber line
and the red line okay so we will try to
read each and everything
so amber line represents the
bone level amber line represents the
bone level how it is done a line that is
drawn from the crust of the interdental
septum between the molars and extended
posteriorly
digitally to the third molar and the
ascending ramus
and this line dilutes the
bone covering the impacted teeth
and the portion of tooth not covered by
the bone
so it's going to give the amount of
tea that is covered by the bone and the
amount of the teeth that is uncovered by
the bone that is the
ambulance the last one is red light
okay what what is red line is drawn
perpendicularly from the amber line to
the imaginary point
of application of elevator so when you
are planning for an extraction that is
impacted in extraction you are going to
keep an elevator so you are going to
draw a line or a perpendicular
from the amber line to the imaginary
point where you are going to keep the
elevator
that line is called as a red line and
red line gives an information about
the amount of bone that have to be
removed before elevation because
you have to remove that bone that the
the line from amber line to the
perpendicular where the elevator has to
be opened
so you have to apply the elevator at
that point you should not have any bone
right so all the bone has to be removed
so what is the red line purpose red line
is going to give an information that
how much amount of bone to be removed
before you apply the
elevator
okay so these are the important things
that you have to make a white line is
going to give the
occlusion difference amber line is going
to give the amount of
bone covered by the impacted teeth and
amount of bone uncovered by the impacted
death
redline is going to give a clear cut
idea about the
amount of bone that you have to remove
before you apply the elevator okay so
this is important the last lines are
important because this was once given in
the
one of the entrance examination
okay so if the length of the red line
is more than five millimeters then the
extraction is difficult
so red line is amount of bone removed
amount of bone to be removed
when the amount of bone to be removed is
more than five millimeters and the right
leg is more than five millimeters it is
called as a difficult extraction
every additional millimeter
increasing in the bone removal will
increase the difficulty by three times
means whenever it is if if the
difficulty index for five millimeters
is x if it is increased by one
millimeter that is six millimeters
it is going to be three x
if is increased by seven millimeters
the difficulty is going to be three
times more difficult okay so it's going
to be
three times more difficult every time
when there is an increase in the
one millimeter and mega knot when it is
nine millimeters
and it is nine millimeters
okay it will be present below the level
of apexis of the second model so if it
is
nine millimeters bone has to be removed
your third molar is present below the
roots of the second molar okay so these
lines points are very very very
important
so there is one more resistant okay so
very important
you have a question on this in your
regular mcq book studies
the w stands for
windows classification
your h stands for
height of
mandible your a stands for
angulation of
third molar your r stands for
root form and
development your f stands for
follicle and your e stand for
exit that is nothing but path
of accept okay
so do make a note they can ask you the
full form they can ask you what is are
they gonna ask you something like that
so do make a note about this
and coming to until now we have
discussed about the max
mandible or third molar so it is
maxillary third molar
so the classifications of angulation and
the depth classification has same as
mandela third molar
but there is one more thing to be added
when you are talking about the maxilla
that is maxillary
so whenever the sinus is approach up
approximating
okay that is one is sinus is
approximating sinus is not approximating
if there is no bone or a thin bone
between the roots and the maxillary
sinus that is called as sinus up
approximately and if there is no sinus
approximating
ah like that then you will have a bone
of two millimeters or more than okay so
this is
this is an extra thing that you have to
make around when you are talking about
the maximal thermometers
so next ah of course we have discussed
about the pre
radiographic analysis but we learn few
things about the radiograph second
right related to your impact
so regular radiograph what what we use
in the case of your iobs
is iop so what is iopa
intraoral periapical reader okay why the
reason why i have kept this is very
simple
this is not called as iopl you have
taken when it is not called as i four
people
because i o pa is intraoral periapical
there is no periapex here right
so this this according to the norms is
not considered as
iop and it is of no use okay so this is
iopa where you can
uh learn so much about the anatomy of
the roots and the bones and everything
right so there's so many
so many advantages so when i'm talking
about the radiographs
i mean most of you know about the
radiograph that is intraoral radiograph
the
choice is iopa whether it's a maxillary
or a metabolite
for example if you are planning to
extract the mandibular teeth
okay the choice of radiograph is going
to be
the opg or the
lateral oblique and when you're planning
to extract the maxillary teeth
the choice of radiograph is opg or
the pa view or the water stream
okay so they can ask you what are the
external radiographs that are advised
for uh the mandibular teeth extraction
or the mandibular molars extraction of
the maximary molar subtractions do make
a note about this
there is something called as right angle
technique okay right angle technique is
exposure
in two different angles which are 90
degrees to each other
so this is an iopa and this is an
occlusion radiograph and these two are
exposure is 90 degrees because ioba is
going to give you
one line of alignment it's going to give
you the mesodictal environment
whereas approachable radiograph is going
to give you buckle equal alignment
by which you can identify the exact
position of the
okay so that is called as a right angle
technique
this is a part of your object
localization there is something called
as object
localization in your radiology so one
technique of
object localization is right angle
technique two exposures
right angle to each other the next one
is of course most of you are familiar
with that is called as slop technique
what is slop
same side lingual opposite set buckle
so this is a slop technique okay so this
diagram based uh
slop technique is is a very familiar and
most common
type of technique or type of question in
your radiology okay so what is this
this is a regular direct exposure you
have the lesion here
or you have the interest of focus here
and this is the mesial side this is the
distal side this is the mesial side of
the table is the distal side of it
right so this is your area of focus that
is the second primal
area okay so what happens the rays has
been
shifted to mesial z previously have
given direct
now it has been shifted to the mesial
cell
similarly your object of interest is
here it has been shifted to the mesial
side
it has been shifted to the measure so
when you shift to the mesial side the
object of interest is also shifted to
the mutual side that is same setting
as it is shifted on the same side it is
present on the linger
for example if you have shifted to the
medial side and the object of interest
has moved to the digital side
angle that is present on the opposite
side is going to be bug
so now this case is this this point is
present on the lingual side because it
is shifted to the same side
okay this is one more technique of slop
i just want to add a node because as a
talking of this law
again we may repeat this in your
radiology this is used in endodontics
this technique is called as
wall trans technique
and the deviation of angulation is
20 degrees so when you have two canals
in a root which are overlapped
you cannot see on the radiograph so what
you are going to do you are going to
change the angulation by
20 by which you can see the canals is
most commonly used in indoor this is a
type of slop technique
but the angulation is very specific it
is 20 that is used in the
endodontics
to see the extra all clear
the next goes are few radiographic
questions which are asked in the
examination
i hope you are very familiar clearly
seen the laceration
clearly seen like dancing deep did
isolated t
okay so dilacerated teeth sometimes on
radiograph
appears like this because this
dilapidation is a miso
miso mesodigital dialysis means it is
bended from here to here miso distal
which can be seen on a radiograph
this type of d dilaceration is a buccal
lingual so your bucco lingual
dilacerations can be
seen as a scorpion day or can be seen as
a target lesion or a bone solution on an
ivf
see this buccal lingually dilated okay
so they can ask you
a diagram based question over this area
this is a scorpion teeth or a dialysis
the angulation or in which direction is
buckled
this is again called as a [ __ ] which
is seen on iop
lingually impacted
lingually
[Music]
impacted mandibular
third molar will appears like a bull's
eye
you can see a bull like right so they
can give you a radiograph
they're gonna ask you like this it's a
lingually impacted
mandibular third molar atoms
okay there are few uh techniques that we
have to make a note
when we are talking about this this is
called as
lateral definition this question was
given
in 2018 neat examination
question is very very simple okay so
please do make a note of the scientist
name for academic purpose
and the paper center is too rude okay
they can ask you the scientist
when the paper center is extraordinary
root they can ask you this technique was
first invented in gucci
all these are stupid questions which are
out of globe
okay so i don't advise the student to
remember the years not all years but few
years are important okay
so just try to move on like it's
learning the subject uh
is one of the parameter of course we
need to end up with a good rank also
that is also important
but uh pleased to make it out of the
scientist and the type of incision that
is used
here is a modified as shape of incision
we can see
a modified s type of incision that is
made from the
retromolar fossa i mean retromolar force
are crossing the external oblique reach
of the
first molar you can see the external
obliques
ah and it is extended up to the first
model clearly
and what you have to do is the buccal
you can see this this is a buccal
cortical plate is
this is is you have you have given some
definitions
definitions is preparing a window
preparing an opening
okay prepare an opening and this is a
mode of like a treatment when you have
an abscesses
uh in your dental structures also okay
which is a part of your endo learning
endo okay this is the mode of treatment
like you're going to keep holes and
relieve the pressure
so that the pulse or abscess will drain
and
so your your definitions will be done on
our
third molar and the parts buds are used
to prepare the vertical cuts anteriorly
and positively you can see that vertical
cuts
okay anteriorly and posteriorly and
followed by
the suturing technique okay i hope you
this is the mode of technique for
extracting the
mandibular third motor
of course again this is a diagram based
question and it's a very complicated
thing that's a
lingual split technique so lingual split
techniques
okay so what is this lingual speech
first of all the important things that
you have to make you know the lingual
split technique was first described by
sir williams kesley fry
and of course very important point it is
popularized by
t word and this is a mode of technique
which is useful for
lingual impacted it lingually
impacted
mandibular
third molar lingual impacted mandibular
third one so the steps they can ask you
as a sequence based question
in your inic and to understand
to have a better concept it is better to
learn the steps okay
i have clearly given the steps the eight
steps of this technique
so initially uh it's very simple like
for every extractivity you have to give
a local anesthesia
and followed by you have to go for
either what's technique what's technique
of incision or modified words technique
of incision
okay again your words technique and
modified walls technique insertion are
your
most commonly asked diagram based
questions in your examination so once
you're done with the incision then
the next step is you need to create the
vertical stops
so how these vertical stops i mean like
this is a technique again which is done
with malik and chisel
okay so the patients are very very
phobic okay by seeing that mallet and
chisel so this is a technique which is
done by marathon scissors the first step
is
creating the vertical stops so where
these vertical stops are created
they are created digital to that of the
second monitor
so if you consider this as a as a third
monitor
draw a simple diagram let's make it is
very simple
so you create a vertical vertical stops
this is third so this position will be
occupied by second so you create a
vertical stops
uh post i mean like distant to that of
the second mother that's the first step
so once you're done with that you what
you're going to do you're going to
convert
a horizontal cut
you're going to convert a horizontal cut
you're going to convert a horizontal cut
so once you convert a horizontal cut
then you are going to extend like this
this is by keeping some definitions
so this area is going to become weak so
that's the buccal area it's going to
become weak
so you what you're going to do you're
going to remove the buckle plate
so first you're going to vertical stop
second you're going to give a horizontal
stop
third you're going to keep some holes
and you're going to cut the buckle plate
okay so by which you can get access to
that other
disto lingual bone and where you as as
the area is very very thin you can
fracture the distal lingual
plate okay that is the lingual particle
plate you can fracture it
so when you fracture this lingual
particle plate you will have
a wedge type of access to that of the
roots where you can keep the elevator
luxate the teeth and remove the teeth
okay
and you can reposition the flap and keep
it switching very simple
techniques are vertical stops are given
first distal to the
second molar followed by vertical stop a
horizontal stop is given
keep holes remove the buckle plate now
that you get access to the lingual
lingual plate okay break the lingual
plate so you get access completely you
get an edge type of axis
keep the elevator remove it keep the
flaps back
suture it topic is over right so
they can ask you the steps they can ask
you the indications is useful for
lingual impacted
mandeville third molar given by
popularized by
and the materials which are used what
are the materials using
male attention are the things which are
used so they can ask you what are the
advantages of this technique and
disadvantages of this technique
so coming to the advantages of this
technique it's very very familiar
question okay
so it's a it's a uh it's a it's a it's
one of the fastest mode of removing the
teeth i'd want us
and the second one is there is less
chances
for causing damage to that of the
inferior angular
channel or the bundle of nerves which
are present closely to the
third molar and third one uh it reduces
the risk of the
blood clot formation because mandelbrot
third molars are the most common teeth
gives rise to tri sockets so dry socket
formation can be reduced
and it decreases the damages to that of
the adjacent
periodontal ligaments of mandibular
second molar
okay and it it it decreases the risk of
healing problems all these are the
advantages when i'm talking about this
split technique
the next course the disadvantages okay i
just want to mention
uh disadvantages the reset one answer
the risk of damaging the lingual nerve
is very high because
it is lingually impacted and you are
going to break the lingual cortical
plate so risk of damaging the lingual
nerve is very high
whereas risk of preventing damage to the
inferior nerve is a good aspect
whereas risk of damaging the lingual
nerve is is a bad aspect
and it also increases the risk of the
post-operative infection
and the patient is discovered because
you use a chisel mallet patient will
feel discomfort and this is
regularly not a technique of choice in
the case of individuals because the bone
is
elastic bone so elastic bone handling
with chisel and mallet is
a bad option so one important aspect
that i want to talk about the
complications like complications and
everything you can go for your regular
mode of preparation
either with your basic mcq books or your
textbook based reading
most of you are well familiar with this
there's more of common sense so most of
your questions will move on
one of the peculiar thing that is called
as dry socket
okay so what is this dry socket
so dry socket is a one of the
complication that you can see
after the extraction okay so they can
ask you dry socket is most commonly seen
with which tape so dry socket is most
commonly seen with
mandibular third molars how much
incidence
20 is the overall incidence
of all the teeth for dry socket is two
percentages
and for a mandibular teeth it is twenty
percentage this question was given in
the aims examination
okay so aura incidence of dry socket is
two percentage
whereas particularly the mandibular
third mother where dry socket is most
common
is twenty percent so two percent is
twenty percentage
or an important area so when dry socket
what are the ethiology of occurrence of
dry socket
so whenever you extract a mandibular
third molar in a very dramatic way
without taking any precautions there are
high chances that the dry socket can
occur so what is the first one
traumatic extraction
the second one is lack of proper
irrigation
no no irrigation no irrigation
high chances of dry soil the third one
is you have to make a note about
all
contraceptives it's a very very common
thing okay
when you're planning for extraction you
should take all the medical information
so oral contraceps what they do is they
increase the fibrolytic activity
so the fibonacci actually whenever your
fibromyalgia activity increases your
blood clot is going to split
it's going to break and it's going to
release the tricep so the patients or
the women who are under oral contraceps
increasing the fibroidic activity losing
the breakdown
of the blood clot which is formed in the
socket leads to dry socket
and the next one is hormonal changes so
during the menstrual cycle all these
hormonal changes again indirectly
increase the fibrolytic activity
the next one is the most common thing
that we encounter
in the clinical scenario is smoking most
common in the
males smoke and the dry socket
complement
or maybe any foreign body or any sort of
thing which is left over by extraction
all these things are the primary
theologies for the occurrence of the
dry soil so what are the clinical
features that you can see in the dry
socket
you have to make out so dry socket is
regularly seen after
three to four days three to four days
delayed it's a delayed problem
we've seen after three to four days the
patient complaints of pain the patient
complaints of
abnormal order in the mouth that is
taste or difference in the taste
perception also
other important thing that you have to
make about when i'm talking about three
to four days is
there is something called as delayed
expansion
in your amalgam the patient comes with a
broken teeth after uh like after
amalgam filling or patient complaints of
severe pain after three to five days
that is basically due to the delayed
expansion
that is due to the gene content zinc
will show this delayed expansion
by reacting with water and releasing the
hydrogen gas this hydrogen gas is going
to cause the
delayed expansion and similarly you have
same
time duration that is hypersensitive so
the that is dry soft
three to four days or three to five days
after the extraction the patient comes
back with the pain and
change in the overall perception and
halidosis that is called as
uh dry socket and uh i mean like uh the
next important thing that you ought to
make
or sometimes the patient may complain
something favor some systemic uh
signs like fever lymphadenopathy and xyz
and the first thing what you need to do
is you need to take a radiograph of the
socket and confirm that
none of the root or none of the foreign
bodies left over first you need to take
it
okay so the next important aspects of
this are
you need to make a note about the
these
theories of dry socket
hope you are very familiar with the
theories of dry socket
one theory is brings
theory it says about the
fibrinolytic system
the fibrinolytic activity is also called
as fibrinolytic theory
and the organism that is primarily
responsible according to this theory
according to this theory
is
t identical
the second one the second one is a
different theory that is called as
bacterial theory
and the bacteria responsible according
to this theory are
acne mycosis
and streptococcus mutants so do make a
note about the
bacteria denticola is again a regularly
asked question
so these are the theories of dry socket
the next comes is
the treatment so already discussed the
first thing that you have to do is
take a radiograph and rule out of the
leftover root fragment or
leftover foreign body then you have to
go for irrigation
good irrigation with the chloride
excellent that is zero point
one two percent make it out zero point
one two percentage of fluorescent is
used as irrigation here
in dry socket and it is the same
percentage that is used in the
mouthwash whereas if you are talking
about the irrigation in endodontics
chloride oxidation chloride accident as
an irrigation endodontics the answer is
two percentages
two percent is chloroxylation is used in
irrigation of endodontics
and zero point one two percent is
production is used in the irrigation of
dry socket okay so apart from this the
other important thing that we regularly
do in our departments when you see this
dry socket case is
good irrigation followed by jaguar paste
okay or you can use metronidazole
antibiotic paste
or uh ida ida form which is soaked
because you're going to keep it along
with the paste
and recently few textbooks clearly says
that
you can use something called as phba
para hydroxy
benzenoic acid can also be used instead
of
your joey or materials test
so how this paste is used they can ask
you questions on this
first this page has to be changed for
every 24 hours
then then you have to change for every
alternative day then you have to change
for every
three to f four
days for
two weeks right
first it is 24 hours then you can try it
for every alternate today
then three to four days you have to
change it forever for
about two weeks so these are the
treatment
things that you have to do when you're
when you have seen a case of dry sockets
so
they can give you a simple clinical
scenario okay a patient went for an
extraction
uh of mandibular third molar and
reported back
with a severe pain and a mall order and
upon this you have seen this
you can see this clinical feature ah and
they can give you a history of smoking
or
a woman of using under the medication
overall contraceptives
so what is the possible diagnosis and
what is the treatment plan can be a case
limit question
okay so okay so major content of exodus
is done
and few other things we'll be discussing
on our daily activity on the group
okay so it's very important for each and
every one of you
as you go into the preparation phase
at every point at every day at every
exam
at every level you have to question
yourself
am i doing good yes yes i'm doing good
so at every point of your preparation
whether it's a daily examination whether
it's a topic specific exam
whether it's a class or a topic or a
subject you have
to review yourself at every point that
how far you are
and how far you are up to so if you do
this
this is going to create a cumulative
effect
on the end product so that is going to
be on the final exam
all the best signing off dr srikanth
