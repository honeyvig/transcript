hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about inserting pdf in excel
but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple technologies so if
you're a tech gig in a continuous hunt
for latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to insert pdf in
excel now there are multiple ways to
insert a pdf into excel so we will go
through a couple of ways
first is here let us imagine that we
wanted to insert some powerpoint
presentation in pdf format into our
excel sheet so that belongs to excel
basics
now click on the cell where you want to
add the pdf or just click any cell in
the excel spreadsheet then go to
the option of insert in the toolbar then
navigate to text option
click on it and select object
and here
you can select create from file and then
you can browse
and here you have your excel basics pdf
in my documents click on that select
insert so
here you can just press ok
and the pdf will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of pdf to fit the cell
there you go the pdf got successfully
inserted into your excel spreadsheet now
let's discuss about the second way
now the second way is completely same
the only difference is you can add some
logo to your pdf so you can see it has
been added in direct form of a pdf like
what's the first slide of the ppt but
instead of that if you wanted to
highlight it as an icon then you can
select the display as icon button here
and press ok
now you don't have to reformat the size
of your ppd or pdf all you have to do is
add the logo to your pdf and it will
also include the title so this is
another way of adding
you know pdf to your excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the
pdf to be visible or any kind of logo of
that pdf reader to be visible on your
spreadsheet sometimes all you want is
some dedicated image or a dedicated logo
right so this time let's try to add a
dedicated image to our pdf so go to
insert again here you can see the
illustrations option
click on picture and from this device so
i will select the simply launch logo
and now you have to resize the logo a
little bit to fit the cell
there you go
you can uh you know click on the
right click button and
and select the option of link
now
select the existing file or web page
option so if you are interested to learn
more on hyperlink in excel we have
dedicated tutorial on that please go
through hyperlinks in excel by simply
learn which will explain you everything
about hyperlinks in excel how to insert
them different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page
and go to documents
navigate to documents and
inside this
you have the excel basic pdf click on ok
and it has been added to your image
so when you click on it it will open the
pdf document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning
so you can see the pdf has been
successfully open so with that we have
come to an end of this tutorial on how
to insert pdf in excel if you have any
