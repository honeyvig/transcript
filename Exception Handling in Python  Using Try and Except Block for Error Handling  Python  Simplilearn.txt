hello and welcome to this session of
exception handling in python
today we are going to discuss how
exception handling is done in python
this concept is not new
in any programming language it is pretty
prevalent in java and other programming
languages and it's on the same lines how
we can do exception handling in python
so let's take a look what are the
nuances and what are the syntaxes for
exception handling in python
so what are we going to discuss today we
are going to start with discussion of
need of exception handling what is
exception handling the types of errors
you can handle in exception handling and
how exception handling works and
in the end certain points to be
remembered
and also we will support our slides with
the python jupiter notebook examples
now what is the need for exception
handling any programming language or any
program you write there is definitely a
need in order to have a clean
execution of the program even if the
program throws errors
so you need exception handling for
cleanly
logging the exceptions or throwing
meaningful errors to the users
so
when does exception occurs right
whenever the program gets terminated
right the program terminates whenever an
error occurs right so it could happen
that an error could be a fatal error and
the program gets terminated in between
or there could be a certain termination
which can corrupt the program right so
you need to handle exceptions
or there may be there might be a data
loss because of those exceptions and you
need to take care that that doesn't
occur or the data loss does not happen
or even if data loss happens then you
pass on a meaningful message or you
capture a meaningful message in the logs
at the right point
now what is exception handling
an exception is a runtime error that
terminates the execution of a program so
basically whenever an exception occurs
the program gets terminated you are
thrown out of the running program
exception handling means you generate a
message in correspondence to the
occurrence of the error
and take the right step to handle it so
now an exception has occurred but you
need to handle it
now by handing we mean that you need to
throw a meaningful message as i said
earlier
and then you might need to navigate the
program into the right direction or take
some certain corrective actions
in order to handle the error so all that
it comes under the exception handling
criteria
now in general there are three types of
errors compile time errors logical
errors and runtime errors
now compile time errors are the errors
which any programming compiler or python
compiler
will show you while you are compiling
your program so
it could be because of the syntax
spacing
indentation
or you would you you are using wrong
keywords all those will get captured at
the compile time
logical errors you know you have not
used the correct syntax around logical
operators like and or or your if else
conditions are incorrect and you are
expecting an output
but it is not coming as per your
expectations so those are logical errors
and the most
difficult ones to capture and track
and handle are the runtime errors so
imagine your program is compiled and as
per your expectation
you are expecting an output you have you
know written a logic but at the runtime
it does not get executed it does not run
as per your expectation and the program
gets terminated unexpectedly so the the
runtime errors are the most critical and
important
in order to handle them and if you talk
about
uh runtime errors handling in production
scenarios then it becomes very critical
that you have handled the exceptions
correctly and captured the logs
correctly so that the support to team
can point out
where the error has exactly happened
now how exception handling works
there are certain
syntaxes
in python which you need to follow
now
you generally put
the
exception handling code the code for
which you you want to handle the
exception under a try block so you run
that piece of code
under a try
block and then you put an accept keyword
where you basically throw an error
message
and then
if there is no exception right then also
you can handle the code okay if there is
no exception in my code then
how the code will behave yeah right so
it could be possible that there is a
runtime error but if there is no then
you might want to do some logical
calculations or you want to put
something over there you can put in the
else block
and then finally now finally
is a
code block which will always get
executed irrespective of you had an
exception in your code or not
so basically generally uh if you go by
the legacy programming
if you have opened a database connection
uh or if you have opened a file and you
it is essential to close
those connections uh from your program
then those closed connection
code are written generally in the
finally block irrespective of the except
exception coming you need to close those
connections otherwise you will run out
of your connection pools
now it's a pretty straightforward
flowchart of an exception and handling
you start with the try block and then
if an exception occurs in your code then
it will go to the accept block otherwise
it will go in the else section and then
finally you have the finally block where
the code will finally get executed and
stop
so as i said you put
that piece of code in the finally block
which is mandatory
and generally the block the code which
is essential to release the resources
which the program has consumed uh the
cpu resources the memory resources
hardware resources which the program is
using you have to release that in the
finale block
accept block
you have to use for capturing the error
and throw a meaningful message or
do any other logical operation and else
block if you want to continue your
program as is
now what are the points to remember
these are very important uh points which
you should consider
you can write a try block without any
except block so it's not essential that
you put an except block always
or
you can write several except blocks for
a single try you might be expecting a
null pointer exception or a divide by
zero exception
or incorrect variable naming exception
so you can start off with one try but
you can have different accept blocks to
capture these different kind of
exceptions and throw a relevant
meaningful error per accept block
also you can write multiple accept
blocks to handle multiple exceptions
it's almost the same thing
and you can write exception as an object
you can also
print or capture an exception as an
object
or you can write multiple exceptions
within a tuple you can capture the
multiple exceptions add it to a tuple
and
throw it away okay so now let's take a
look at
certain examples which we want to run
in order for better understanding of
exception handling
now throughout my exercise i am gonna
focus on divide by zero error which we
are
easily able to simulate
so i am gonna mostly show you how we can
capture a divide by zero error
okay so i have declared a variable a
and i have declared a variable b z uh
as10 bs0 now i'm trying to divide
a by b now i'm trying to divide a number
with 0
so ideally yes this is not a
correct mathematical operation divided
by number 0
is not allowed
so i should get a zero division error
now
this is
an unhandled exception
my program has not handled it properly
so that's why you're getting this error
on the
trace
of the python trace but
if i handle it properly
then i can very cleanly
throw this error
and capture this error
okay so
i am going to take input in b enter a
and b
and
i'm just going to print a generic except
block
so 10
0
and i have got an exception and i have
printed it now there is no stack trace
there is no trace but at least i am able
to cleanly throw an error a meaningful
error
now
again i'm differently going to handle
the exception
i'm going to
create the same exception but gonna
handle it differently
now there's a try block
now i am
[Music]
writing an accept block to capture
the specific exception zero division
error exception
in the earlier code block i had just
written except so any exception would
have come to this block but in this
except block only zero division error
will be captured
so as you can see
uh
i cleanly
handled the exception of course i gave
the name accept zero division error and
then my
code
got executed
later on
now in another example
what i'm gonna do is
i'm gonna show you that if my code runs
cleanly
then it's not necessary my accept block
will get executed definitely because if
there is no error then the accept block
will remain redundant
now here you see what i have done is i
have taken genuine two numbers
divided them printed a new line and then
completed so
as there was no exception
the
exception block did not got executed
so the point to be highlighted over here
is that it is not essential
that you know exception block will get
executed always it will only come into
picture when there is a relevant
exception getting
getting generated
now let's take an example of
how
we can print an exception object
so i'm going to take my previous code
and here
i am
capturing the exception
but also printing the exception object
so what has happened is
i have printed the exception of a
message a custom message plus i have
printed the
exception
object okay
now i'm gonna take the same example
but i'm not gonna generate an exception
so my exception block did not got
executed and i was able to simply print
simply learn
now
let's take another example
where i am
capturing my exception in an in a
variable
so do not divide number by zero
and
in this x i have captured my exception
division by zero
so in the exception the python generated
exception name is this and i have
printed over here
so division by zero is the python
generated
exception which i have appended in my
print command
now i'm going to take another example
where i'm saying is
that i will print exception
as a
plus i'm gonna also capture another
exception so it's like one try and two
exceptions
so one exception is do not divide number
by zero and second exception is name z
is not defined right
so i'm so as i said earlier you can have
one try but to accept blocks which is
permissible
now one thing is that you know you this
exception print a by z
came uh went through both the except
blocks except this exception and this
exception
though this exception is not divided by
zero error so therefore therefore
in this a variable nothing came in
but in the b variable
the name error was definitely captured
because it's a name undefined
name z is not defined error and that's
why you can see
that do not divide number by zero up
after that we do not have any relevant
meaningful message
okay
now let's take another example where
we are gonna have
two accept blocks
and out of these two
only
one will get executed
okay so there is no type error exception
so that except block did not got
executed but only zero division error is
there so only that got printed
now you can explicitly also raise an
exception it's not like you just have to
wait for a runtime exception
you can also raise your x raise an
exception from your code and execute it
so if you see this
what we have done is just
created a variable with a negative value
and just checking that if the value is
less than zero then raise an exception
so that's what we have done
similarly you can also throw raise an
assertion error
it is called assert
and you can run
this
message you can throw this message
compatible with linux only
so i hope you guys had a great learning
session and i look forward to connecting
with you in my next session thank you
