In hello everyone welcome to as simple
as that today I'm going to speak with
Karthik Simas Karthik is an engineer
he's a marketer and now an entrepreneur
and he did everything in the last six
years so who is KARK let let him
directly introduce himself so Kik why
don't you tell my audience on what's
your background and and how do you like
to get introduced hi Krishna first of
all nice to meet you and uh thank you
for having me on the show so I come from
a town called Kun so it is a very small
town part of the niri district in Tamil
Nadu okay and basically it is a small
hill station part of this Western it's
very popular Hill station I know for
sure I've seen photos and clips of Kun
unfortunately I've never been to Kun but
I would love to go at some point yeah
it's a really beautiful place you have
to like visit once at least so basically
it is a small hill station but of the
West angs and uh if you see the journey
from a small town like Kun to Bangalore
was like a tough and challenging one for
me my childhood was without my father so
I lost my father at the age of like 80
so it was my mother who took care of me
and my and my sister so I started doing
my engineering so during my college days
I used to uh work for one of my farest
friends who own the uh distribution ship
for a beverage company for my area Okay
so it was at that time I got introduced
to like sales and marketing but it was
just a parttime so I didn't thought like
much about it and after completing my
graduation I started working as a
service executive for an automobile
company and I was 22 at that time and uh
that was the time I lost my mother so
that time I was with a huge
responsibility of taking care of my
younger sister so we moved to a city in
called coor in tamaru so like I start my
sister started doing her graduation over
there and then I switched from this
automobile sector to the BPU just for
the only reason that I was getting a
higher P so that I was able to manage my
expenses and all those things uh but the
process that I was in the BP was again a
sales process for the US region so I was
trained on sales and uh with my previous
field experience I was able to like
excel in the role that I was doing
but always I thought like this is not
the place where I belong so I wanted to
do something uh different and this was
the time when the pandemic hit and
slowly the world was like getting back
to normal and I had one of my friend was
in the digital marketing Feld and I just
like spoke to her and with the basic
understanding of what digital marketing
is I decided okay this is what I wanted
to do and at this time my sister
completed her graduation and she was
able to like help me financially so what
I did is I just prepared myself for for
entry level uh interview and I cracked a
job in an dis marketing agency as an
intern so I started as an intern and I
learned the basics and um I was able to
like implement the strategies and the
learnings that I've got and I was able
to like perform well and after a couple
of months the learning was like limited
and uh this was at this time I thought
okay I should do a professional degree
in legistic marketing and at this time I
did my research online and I got to know
a simp and that's how I ended for a
course in for digital marketing in simp
and completed it and that was the ticket
for a small to boy like me to come to a
Hightech c b so right so did you join a
company in Bangalore yeah so I got an
hike with like 30 percentage then I
moved to bang I joined as an for a
senior role in the digital marketing
agency so you moved your sister also no
like my sister she stayed in quor and
she completed her graduation and she is
now married first of all let me tell you
that we are very brave boy like losing
parents at such a young AG taking care
of your younger sister and still
thinking about growth is not that easy
not everybody can do that people get
into like depression and what not so I
think you have done a great job so thank
you and I it's my pleasure to be
speaking with you and I wish you all the
best for future and while we continue
the conversation I couldn't stop you
wishing all the best based on whatever
story I heard about you thank you now
let's get little deeper so what
engineering did you do like what was the
engineering I did uh Engineering in
mechanical so that's how we started
working in automobile seob sect for this
machines and Automobiles and all those
things so I started but I couldn't
because of my fing situation at that
time I couldn't do then I understood
that I got some have some idea passion
for like sales marketing and all those
things so that's how I thought okay let
me do this marketing so this is going to
be like a big thing for the next decade
got it so when you started so you have
like very diverse background right you
also had little bit of not a normal like
I'll say childhood because of your
family situation and then you worked in
your father's friend in sales and
marketing so you got a firsthand
experience on how beverages are sold and
how distribution ship is done right I'm
it must be a distributor and giving it
to all the retail outlets so that was
one experience then we would experience
as in automobile service sector also
that's again a very different kind of
sector so I think you got exposed to
multiple industry you got exposed to
this whole retail industry through
distribu you also got exposed to an
automobile sector
with your service experience and both of
them being in konur must be a smes like
a small companies right so did you see
some par seeing the challenges of be the
retail companies in kunu or be the
automobile companies in kunu do could
you draw some parallel that okay
companies of a certain size are the
smaller companies in the smaller cities
have similar kind of challenges uh yeah
this is one major challenge which every
uh small town boil faces so in your
homet toown you are comfortable with the
people or with the company you're
working or with the people like you're
interacting and when you move to a city
like P like chenai or like bang the
first thing is like the exposure what
you get is something so first to
adapting to that itself is a Bigg
challenge so you get to like meet
different people so you have to like get
along with them learn how to talk all
the basic things and how to communicate
so those were the initial challenges
that I faced so but but like I was able
to like work on those skills and once I
got my Basics right I was able to like
again okay take the next step with with
the confidence so K while is a small
town which very popular and is a hill
station lot of people have big houses
there Hospitality sector is I'm assuming
should be good because lot of people
want to go for short-term vacation in
you never thought about getting into
Hospitality
sector uh no uh I was since I got
introduced to this like distribution
retail and all those things so I was
like very much interested in the retail
industry okay so maybe I could think of
in the long term I will be I'll be part
of the state retail industry so I just
wanted to learn the basics right from
what is marketing what is production
what is managing what is distribution
and all those things so once that I'll
be able to like excel in
that now when you first heard about
digal marketing from your friend and you
started learning on your own on internet
what was your thought like you wanted to
like serve the local again local
businesses in Kun in and around Kun or
idea was to do join a big company or
maybe sit in Kure and serve customers
all across the world what was the first
thing that excited about that okay looks
like getting into digital marketing is a
better career option for me than working
in that auto sector as the service side
so when I thought about doing this the
first thing I had was like self because
my graduation was from engineering okay
and but I'm moving to a different field
that is like sales marketing that is
completely like new terminologies and
everything is new for me so first what I
thought was okay let me have an
understanding of what it is first so I
just uh do did my research online but
got to know what are the terminologies
what are the things and all those things
and after that I was able to like find
mentors so like who are people who are
already in the field so I used to like
ask them what it is and in case if I'm
planning to do this what I'm supposed to
do so in that case like I had like got
of got a lot of people who gave me like
a good advice okay so first like you
start start as an intern so you work for
a small agency so I get an understanding
because uh when you join like a big
company you might be limited the for the
services but when you start with the
startup you get to get into like all
kind of shoes so right from like
planning right from like running ads
right from execution all those things so
completely agree based on my experience
also that you learn a lot when you're in
a smaller setup because in smaller setup
roles and departments are not that well
defined corre so you pretty much get
exposed to every kind of work that an
agency does as you go a big company
everything is compar in a different
compartment so only get exposed to one
part so that part is is definitely like
true but tell me when you we into auto
service sector to going and joining as
an intern in a small typ
agency it's also the risk because I'm
assuming that aut companies are always
must be distributed at least you don't
have to worry about your paycheck and
all you get it so whether they're paying
you the same amount of money or took a
risk that even though they're paying me
less is more unable I still want to
build my career in that direction and I
want to go and join them yeah it was a
risk that I took at that time because I
thought okay I'm just like 23 or 24 so
like I'm still young so after maybe
couple of three to four years I can take
risk and in case even if I fail I'll be
able to like go back to the industry and
like again started so I'm was like very
clear with that so let me take this risk
and at the same time my sister completed
her graduation she was like working she
was able to like help me financially so
it was like a collective combined risk
that we took at that time so again I was
like started with a pay of like 70% less
of like what I was getting and uh then I
like started slow so I think I just want
to take a pause and also tell my
audience that see people talk about that
okay I can't take risk because I don't
have a very strong family background I
have to manage my expenses and and what
not I think there's a lot of for them to
learn from you because you didn't also
had your parents backing right your
sister who's younger sister backed you
to take this risk of taking a 70% pay
cut and I assume that at entry level the
100% ping itself is so small so if
you're getting 70% that you're getting
virtually nothing maybe just getting
petrol for bike or something to just go
from home to office and office to home
right so the only thought I had that
then was okay I have food to film and I
have like a roof on top of so this is my
basic need so have arrangements for that
next let me learn and like explore and I
can take the L so how long you worked in
that agency in that agency was working
for like 2 years okay then after that my
learning got limited so it was a small
agency and this time I thought I that
agency was serving mostly the to small
business then when I thought of uh like
moving I thought okay bang will be the
right so but before going to that I had
again I have this scar okay so I have an
understanding about all these things but
still my experience is like very less
compared to like if I wanted to join a
big companies in and at that time only I
thought okay I should do some
professional Coes just as a back so
that's how I chose Li and PR learn then
I did my uh course through S once I
completed it and I got the part it's
okay now I'm ready I'm ready to join a
company and after that also like 3
months I was working for that agency and
I was able to like implement the
strategies and the concepts that I
learned from the in that agency and I
was able to like see the results but the
only thing was uh uh the brands that I
was working they were not ready to like
scale up a smaller local smaller local
so that's what I thought okay I have to
like move to a bigger city or bigger
environment so I can
explore so Kik you you joined the course
where you were still part of the smaller
agency in katur and this course is I
think one year long so at what point of
time you decided to move out of that
agency and how did you go did you get a
new offer or how can you tell about that
that part of the journey yeah so I was
doing this course when I was associated
with the small agency so it was a six
Monon course so once I completed the
course and I was still like working with
the same Agency for like 3 to four
months then after that I got an offer uh
in a company in bang with like almost
like 30 to 40% he for the P what was was
getting in got it and then I decided
okay this is the right I have to make a
move so this agency was a little bigger
agency this was a smaller agency yeah
this is a little big bigger agency so
this agency like worked with like a
couple of like well established Brands
local brands or they were working for
international brands also it's majorly
like
Indian so how long you worked in that
agency yeah with that agency I was
working for like almost like one year
then after that like I wanted to uh do M
freelancing and I wanted to start my on
like company in the future so I thought
okay like let me my fulltime and let me
work as a so tell me this is a very
risky idea right that while you you did
lot of risky things right moving from
automobile to 70% pay cut and moving to
Bangalore leaving your sister alone I
can understand that it's not an easy
decision right you always have this wor
especially for younger sister when
parents are not around and then you come
came to bang within a year decided that
no I want to get become a freelancer and
and be be on my own so what gave this
confidence like where was this
confidence coming that key now I can
also do it and why to work for this
agency when I can getor on internet
ially that's what the digal marketing
means that you know how to Market so why
should you work for anyone you can
Market yourself on internet get work
deliver those work and get directly paid
but it easier set than that right there
are lot of challenges sometime you might
not get work sometime you might get too
much work sometime you might do work but
you won't get paid by your customers so
how do you what made you make the
decision the first decision the sister
was ready to pack you and you're looking
at your combined household income what
was the trigger at this point in time so
more than the confidence that I have I
chose this because of the fear what I
because very soon I get into a comfort
zone I'll start thinking okay I'm
getting into a comfort zone so I have to
like move on so still like young you can
take the risk so till like 30 35 you can
take the risk and even after that like
you will be able to like recover so only
thing is you have to have the family
just to like back back you up no not
just in the terms of like Financial just
by the kindness the cooperation whatever
you doing so in that way I thought like
I don't have like any restriction so I
can take that risk maybe for a couple of
years so like let me TR let me try it
out and in case even if if I like I'll
not be like worried about again I can
start as a as a beginner then I can
move so how is it going like how long
it's been that you no it's just like 3
months so right now I have like three
mons that
working as how did you these uh these
were through my like known contacts so I
got the brand and initially I worked for
like one grand I gave them like like
last and with that I I got the contact
with the other two so two BRS is like
recently I and starting to work for very
nice so how so how do you see this
experience like are you really enjoying
being on your own what are the
challenges that you see what what area
do you think if I had so you got some
mentors who who sest stud you that okay
you can switch the job you heard them
and then you start and you took the
plunge of Runing in a small company with
strong Pier now at this point of time
that you are an entrepreneur and you
have three brands which is a very good
progress in the last three months what
kind of you think that advice and an
access to information or access to
mentorship can really
help are clearly that you think that
okay I wish there was somebody who can
assist me in this side now the only
thing is like uh so if you have like
good thoughts and you will have like
people around you and uh they will be
able to like guide you so that's what
like every time when I add a question or
like a self-doubt like what I should do
next and somehow like I'll get i'll get
introduced to like some people and like
I'll just like ask them like an open
question like I'm in this situation
maybe if you are in the situation what
would you do so I just like take
inspiration from that okay fine let me
it so you always open to network cor so
if you have any challenge of talking to
someone who might introduce to somebody
else and correct and you're discussing
that your issues
and then deciding after listening to
M take the learning from their
experience and just like explore and see
what it is for do very nice so so now
are you based in Bangalore or you're
going back to K actually I'm like based
in Bangalore only but the branch that
I'm working currently are like part of
Kerala and so now I
keep but you're going to keep your base
in bangal correct why why Bangalore why
not now that you're on your own most of
the brands you are going to help them
with digital marketing that means
marketing on internet so you can do
pretty much from anywhere that's the
promise of Internet so why not K yeah so
that's the promise of f we will
understand but like Bangalore being the
Hightech City so whatever Revolution
that happens in the tech industry so
Bangalore is the first place that and
all those things so uh I'm going to set
up my Bas like B but I'm going to take
those like JS to be small TOS so that is
what so for that I have to be we B and
understand what is happening then I have
to take it to the other course it's very
inspiring and and thanks for coming K
now me I also saw the note that I got
from it is that now that you're doing
another analytics course so tell me
about the trigger see as part of we
running simply I know that marketing
analytics are very close but at what
point of time you realize that okay I
know marketing now there are additional
skills that I need to acquire yeah so
when it comes to business there are like
multiple aspects not just like sales
marketing and all those things so what I
thought was okay I have an understanding
like marketing so now I need to like
upscale so when I thought about that one
close thing that I can upscale upscale
very quickly was like marketing
analytics right so that's what I thought
okay then I join for another course and
simp for the business analytics so once
I complete this course I'll be able to
make like a database like right
decisions for the marketing whatever I'm
do very nice so have you completed the
course are still I'm still like pursuing
I'll be completing in maybe one of on
very nice so so you are a constant
lifelong learner that not only doing
business but also at every opportunity
that you realize that something is
missing and something make you more
valuable you're doing it so great
example of how you should be in my view
but tell me like how do your how do you
your friends look at it I'm sure you
have a lot of friends in engineering
College many of them might still be in
Kun many of them might still working in
auto service sector or maybe different
different businesses that they got an
opportunity to work on and they see you
constantly changing from one thing to
another to another how do they look at
it no my friends find myself like
approachable so not just in terms of the
digital marketing other even if they
face any like like challenges approach
me
okay so like I'll be able to share my
experience and I'll be giving them my
point of view like maybe what I might
have done but it's not that like I did
this you have to do this maybe it's like
your life you just like try to figure
out what is happening in based on that
like either it's you have to take the
risk or you have to do something you
have to do or it be just like with a
fear you have to like set so rather than
that take the risk and do so in your
view they look at you as a somebody
who's Like A Hustlers or somebody who's
like inspiration for them or they think
that okay this gu is unnecessary putting
puts Lots him him into a lot of what you
call troubled situation and it's not
going to have any real long-term result
it's going to be the same thing no it
depends on the person who's like
approaching so anyway like if if one of
my friend or any my is like approaching
me they might need a solution for
something and if the solution what I
give is like if they find it like used
to they they think that okay like a
mentor or like and if that solution like
doesn't for them then okay this guy
might put me in this so that completely
depends on the first I'm the same good
good very nice now knowing you that
you're always trying to see how you can
become better how can how you can do
well what is that you're looking for
forward in next I I not say 5 years
maybe next 2 years what are do we have
do we keep create some goals that okay
now that I'm I'm on my own I already
have clients maybe might add some more
team members assisting you as you get
more more clients that come to you for
for your services and you're learning
analytics so you can do better decision
making you can look at data in a much
better way than what you're are used to
because I'm sure additional marketing
also there's always some data that we
here but this is much more intense and
much more deep so what is that your look
so more than the goal like what I focus
is the journe so yeah like what I'm
planning to do is like I just wanted to
build my team I should have like my own
core team and I should be able to like
grow my clients as well and I also like
have a thought process that I should
like s maybe like not in the next like
three or five years maybe 10 years down
the line I should be able to like
contribute and give it
back really a great thought so as let me
tell to my audience right there are a
lot of Learners who come to Simply learn
and we have a large base of free
Learners also so not everybody can
afford and take our paid program so on
our simply learn skill up platform we
have like thousands of free courses
available and we see a a similar pattern
like you only a part of pattern like you
that many of them are from a small town
um not sure what they should do in live
somebody suggested that do engineering
so everybody they did engineering but
they didn't get a job after after
completing their engineering they're
trying to spend some time on one
internet website to another internet
website talking to their friends
figuring it out that what can I do now
let's say there is a one such student
somewhere in India who's in who's in
this mindset that okay now now that
engineering is done I don't have a job
and I don't know what to do what will be
your advice to those people uh What uh I
would tell is like first take it slow
and in life we might have like
challenges and we might be in like tough
situations so just like take slow just
like think what you're going through and
just try to like interact with like your
friends or like family members and just
don't take Vision with like uh based on
like whatever you talk to your friends
or your just get the understanding and
once you have like a lot of
understanding and it's now it is your
turn to like figure it out what you
should do because it's your life and
it's your responsibility to like lead it
so K what I heard you saying is that uh
if you are in a small town um student
just completed graduation and you don't
know what to to do your Sugg is that you
might talk to a lot of
people so I'm sure this there is some
Tamil word also that explains the same
emotion the can
telling okay so that means the same
thing that correct yeah so what you take
that should be in your own hands good so
I think thank you everyone for taking
time to listen to me and Karthik
speaking about his journey I hope you
can relate to the story many of you who
are watching this show are in the
similar situation as Karthik was in 2017
and he always followed his heart he took
uh the right decision keeping long-term
perspective in mind and it is paying off
like he's on his own he's happy he's
adding more customers who knows one year
down the line when meet Karthik instead
of three clients he might have 30
clients many of them might be
International C so Kik I wish you all
the best and and thanks again for coming
here I'm sure your story will inspire a
lot of
audience that we have who are watching
us speaking thank you thank you thank
