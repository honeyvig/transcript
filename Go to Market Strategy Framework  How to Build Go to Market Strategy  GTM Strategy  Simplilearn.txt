get started so let us first start by
understanding what is a goto Market
strategy framework in simple terms it's
a step-by-step process for bringing a
product or service to Market it answers
key questions like who we are selling to
how do we reach them and how do we stand
out from competitors for example let's
say you're launching a new project
management tool your GTM framework would
help you identify your target market
maybe small business or startups figure
out how to communicate the benefits of
your tool and decide whether you'll
focus on inbound marketing or outbound
sales sales to get the word out we will
understand inbound marketing and
outbound sales in the upcoming topic the
GTM framework aligns everyone on your
team and gives you a clear plan to
follow from start to finish now first we
have to understand how to define your
Market this is all about figuring out
who you are selling to a common mistake
businesses make is trying to sell to
everyone but in reality you need to
narrow down your target market let's say
you have developed a new f App instead
of targeting all Fitness enthusiasts you
could Define your Market as busy
professionals who want quick effective
workouts this helps you focus your
marketing efforts and craft more
tailored message the more specific you
get the better you can Target your
audience and connect with their needs so
now the next step is to Define your why
your value proposition is essentially
why people should choose you it's the
unique benefit your product offers that
your competitors can't match let's go
back to the fitness app example your
value proposition might be we help busy
professionals squeeze in a 15minute
workout that's just as effective as a
full hour in the gym you're not just
offering Fitness but also offering
convenience and timesaving which speaks
directly to your audience a well-defined
value proposition makes it clear why
your product matters and why your
audience should care let's go back to
the fitness app example your value
proposition might be we have busy
professionals squeeze in a 15minute
workout that's just as effective as a
full hour in the gym you're not just
offering Fitness but also convenience
and timesaving which speaks directly to
your audience a well- defined value
proposition makes it clear why your
product matters and why your audience
should care the next step is positioning
positioning is all about figuring out
where your product fits in in the market
and how you will differentiate from the
competition let's say you're launching a
premium skincare line your positioning
might focus on the high-end natural
ingredients to use which differentiate
you from the mass market products your
positioning helps set the stage for your
pricing branding and overall Market
strategy so what are the five goto
Market strategies when it comes to
launching a product or entering a new
market there are five primary goto
Market strategies which businesses
typically use the strategy allows you to
choose which depends on your product
target market and overall business goals
let's break down each strategy with
examples so that you can see how they
play out in real life the first is
inbound marketing so this marketing
attracts customers by creating valuable
content that addresses their needs and
pain points over time potential
customers find your content organically
through search engines or social media
for example HubSpot mastered inbound
marketing by providing free resources
like blogs and webinars their content is
optimized for search engines leading
small businesses to their site where
they eventually convert to customers
this marketing is best for companies
which is investing in long-term content
creation and SEO to attract organic
leads the second is outbound sales
outbound sales involved directly
reaching out to prospects through cold
calls emails and demos this approv
coaches more direct and aggressive
targeting high value clients for example
Salesforce uses outbound sales by
targeting decision makers at large
Enterprises with personalized Outreach
scheduling demos and closing deals
through direct interaction this type of
marketing is best for B2B companies
which Target Enterprise clients that
require personalized engagement the
third is product Le growth in product Le
growth the product itself drives growth
a premium model lets users try the
product for free with upgrades to
premium features based on the product's
value example slack which offers a free
version of its platform allowing teams
to experience its benefits before
upgrading to a paid version for more
features so this type of marketing is
best for software as a service companies
which is focused on user experience and
self- serve onboarding the fourth is
channel sales Channel sales rely on
third-party Partners resellers
distributors uers to sell your product
which allows you to reach Market you
couldn't through direct sales alone for
example Microsoft partners with
resellers to sell products like Office
365 bundling their software with other
services to reach more customers so this
type of marketing is best for companies
which is looking to scale quickly
through thirdparty networks fifth is
account-based marketing account-based
marketing focuses on targeting high
value accounts with personalized
marketing and sales efforts it is
tailored approach designed to build deep
relationship with key clients example
snowflake targets large Enterprises like
finance and Healthcare companies
crafting personalized content and
Outreach to address their specific needs
this type of marketing is best for B2B
companies which targets large
Enterprises where personalization is key
to closing deals now that we have
discussed the top five marketing
strategies let's not talk about
important step which is understanding
the competition knowing your competition
is crucial to understand the successful
goto Market strategy you need to ask who
else is solving the same problem and how
they're doing it once you understand
your competition you can figure out how
to differentiate yourself for example if
you're selling a new project management
tool you might find that the competitors
offer more features but they are too
complicated for small businesses so your
strategy could be offering more simpler
userfriendly to tool specifically
designed for startups and small
businesses the next step is messaging
your messaging is how you communicate
your value to your audience it's
important to keep your message clear and
consistent across all the channels think
of messaging as the story you tell about
your product what makes your product
special how will it improve your
customers's life this messaging needs to
come across in your website email ads
and even in sale conversations for
example if your value position is about
saving time your messaging might say get
fit in just 15 minutes a day no gym
required this directly speaks to your
audience paino of not having enough time
for long workouts next step is execution
now it's time to put everything into
action you have defined your Market
crafted your messaging and figured out
how to stand out from the competition
your execution could involve inbound
marketing like content social media and
SEO outbound sales through cold out
reach or email campaigns Partnerships
with other businesses that reach your
target audience for example if you're
using inbound marketing you might create
helpful blog posts or videos that
address your audien's pinpoints and lead
them to your product if you're using
outbound you'll want a highly targeted
email campaign that resonates with
potential customers and there you have
