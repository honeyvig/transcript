hello everyone welcome back to Simply
learns YouTube channel are you
fascinated by data and want to turn it
into a fulfilling career today we are
going to talk about data science and how
you can become a data scientist whether
you're just starting out or looking to
improve your skills this guide will help
you get started on your journey in data
science firstly what is data science in
simple terms data science is a field
where you use programming
math and knowledge about a specific area
to find useful information in data data
scientists look at large sets of data to
find patterns Trends and connections
that can help companies make smart
decisions for example think about
Netflix have you noticed how it always
seems to know what show or movie you
want to watch next that's because
Netflix uses data science it looks at
what you have watched before what you
have liked and even what time of day you
watched by studying on this information
Netflix can suggest shows and movies it
thinks you will enjoy making it easy for
you to find something to watch and
Amazon does something similar when you
shop online when you search for items
buy something or even just add something
to your cart Amazon keeps track of that
it then uses this data to recommend
other products you might like this helps
you discover things you might need and
it also helps Amazon sell more products
now that we have a clear idea of what
data science is let's talk about how you
can actually become a data scientist
this might seem like a big task but
don't worry we'll break it down step by
step so you can see exactly what you
need to learn and why it's important

python RW and SQL you can find the co
Link in the description box and pin
so the first step is to learn
programming language data scientists
often use two main languages Python and
R python is very popular because it's
easy to learn and has lots of libraries
or tools that help with data analysis
and machine learning rart is also great
especially for statistics and creating
graphs learning these languages will
help you write code to work with data
which is a big part of being a data
scientist so once you have chosen your
programming language it's important to
start with the basics understand these
fundamentals will make everything else
you learn much easier so before you dive
into complex stuff you need to
understand the basics of python includes
learning about variables which are like
containers that store data and if else
Loops which are used to make decisions
in your code these Basics are like the
ABCs of programming and you'll use them
all the time when you start working on
data science projects so now that you
have the basics down it's time to move
on to some tools that will make working
with data much easier let's talk about
numpy and pandas so once you're
comfortable with python Basics it's time
to learn about two important libraries
numai and pandas so numai helps you work
with numbers especially if you're
dealing with large amounts of data it's
like a superpowered calculator and
pandas is used for handling and
organizing data in tables making it
easier to clean transform and analyze
data so these tools are essential for
any data scientist now data science
isn't just about coding it also involves
a lot of math here's a quick rundown of
the key areas you need to focus
on statistics for beginners focus on
descriptive statistics which involves
understanding measures of central
tendency like mean median and mode as
well as measures of spread like variance
and standard deviation you'll also need
to grasp the basics of data distribution
such as normal and binomial
distributions and as you move on to
intermediate level statistics you will
explore inferential statistics which
involves drawing conclusions from data
samples through Concepts like sampling
confidence intervals and hypothesis
tesed you'll also need to understand
probability distributions such as poison
and exponential distributions at the
advanced level delve into regression
analysis learning techniques like linear
regression logistic regression and
multiple regression which are crucial
for making predictions Based on data
additionally understanding patient
statistics will be key especially
Concepts like base theorem priors and
likelihoods which are used in advanced
predictive
modeling next comes linear algebra so in
linear algebra start by understanding
vectors and scalars which are
fundamental in representing data so as
you progress study metrices and Metric
operations which are crucial for
handling data in multiple Dimensions
finally at an advanced level learn about
Egan values and igen vectors which are
important in many machine learning
algorithms such as principal component
analysis now calculus is another
important area though you don't need to
be an expert in it begin by
understanding derivatives which measure
how a function changes as its inputs
change this concept is essential when
you're optimizing machine learning
models and finally in probability start
with basic concepts like odds and
conditional probability which will help
you understand and manage uncertainty in
data as you advance explore base theorem
and learn about probability
distributions which are used extensively
in statistical modeling and machine
learning algorithms now once you
crunched the numbers the next step is to
make your findings easy to understand
that's where data visualization comes in
now data visualization is all about
presenting your data in a way that's
easy for others to understand so start
with matplot li a python library that
allows you to create simple plots like
line graphs and Scatter Plots this will
help you identify Trends and patterns in
your data and as you gain confidence
move on to cbor which Builds on matplot
and allows you to create more complex
and aesthetically pleasing
visualizations like heat maps that can
show correlations between
variables additionally it's important to
have a basic understanding of excel
especially if you'll be working in a
business environment Excel is widely
used for quick data analysis and knowing
how to create basic charts and pivot
tables will make it easier to share your
results with colleagues who may not be
familiar with python now to take your
data visualizations to the next level
you can learn tools like power bi and
tab powerbi a tool from Microsoft allows
you to create interactive dashboards
that are easy to share and update in
real time this makes it great for
businesses that need to monitor key
metrics on an ongoing basis ta is
another powerful tool for creating
interactive and sharable visualizations
so it's particularly useful for working
with large data sets and Performing
complex analytics so both of these tools
are highly valued in the industry for
the ability to turn data into actionable
insight
making your visualizations even more
impactful and useful for decision making
so now that you can analyze and
visualize data it's time to explore one
of the most exciting parts of data
science which is machine learning
machine learning is a powerful tool that
allows computers to learn from data and
make predictions or decisions without
being explicitly programmed let's break
down the different types of
machine number one supervised
learning so supervised learning is one
of the most common types of machine
learning in supervised learning you
train your model on a data set that
contains both the input features and the
corresponding correct outputs so this
means the data you use to train your
model is labeled and the goal is to
teach the model to make predictions
based on these labels for instance you
might model that predicts house prices
based on features like the number of
bedrooms location and size of the house
so popular algorithms and supervised
learning include linear regression for
predicting continuous values and
classification algorithms like logistic
regression decision trees and support
Vector machines for categorizing data
into classes next up is unsupervised
learning now unlike supervised learning
with data that doesn't have labels so
the goal here is to find the patterns or
structures within the data so for
example you might use unsupervised
learning to group customers into
different segments based on their
purchasing Behavior without knowing
beforehand what those segments should be
so clustering algorithms like K means
and hierarchical clust clust string are
commonly used in unsupervised learning
to identify these groupings additionally
you'll use techniques like principal
component analysis to reduce the
dimensionality of your data while
preserving its important features next
comes semisupervised learning so
semisupervised learning combines
elements of both supervised and
unsupervised learning so in
semi-supervised learning you work with a
data set that is partially labeled this
approach is useful when labeling data is
expensive or time consuming the model
learns from the labeled portion of the
data and makes predictions on the
unlabeled portion so this technique can
be very effective in scenarios where you
have a small amount of labeled data and
a large amount of unlabeled data such as
in text classification or image
recognition tasks now finally let's talk
about reinforcement learning in this
type of learning an agent which can be a
computer program or robot learns by
trying things out and getting feedback
so the agent makes decisions and based
on whether those decisions are good or
bad it gets Rewards or penalties so the
goal is to figure out which actions lead
to the best outcomes over time now with
a good grasp of programming math and
machine learning under your belt there's
one more essential skill you need to
master working with databases so let's
talk about SQL so SQL which stands for
structured query language is a standard
language for managing and querying
relational databases it's crucial for
extracting and manipulating data from
large databases start by learning the
basics like how to write simple queries
to select insert update and delete data
understanding how to join tables is also
important as it allows you to combine
data from different sources into a
single query as you advance explore more
complex SQL features like subqueries
transactions and indexing which helps
improve the efficiency and performance
of your database queries the mastering
SQL will enable you to handle data
extractions and manipulation tasks more
effectively making you a more versatile
data scientist so now that you have got
a solid foundation it's time to put your
skills into practice so kagle is a
