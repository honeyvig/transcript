hey everyone welcome back to another
video tutorial by simply learn
in this session we will be learning
about kotlin functions a function helps
in reducing the duplicacy of the code
and also used for information hiding
the kotlin function is a very important
topic of kotlin language and in this
tutorial we will cover all the important
points or concepts of kotlin functions
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we will be covering today
so we'll start with kotlin functions
then we'll understand
function parameters function returning
values
then
cortland functions with no return type
after that the higher order functions
and lambda function
and at last we will study
higher order function with lambda
functions
so without further ado
let's get started
so our first topic is kotlin functions
functions in kotlin is very much similar
to functions in java
there are some minor differences in
between them
so let's have a look at them
a kotlin function can be defined as a
block of code which is used to hold the
data
this block of code has a name and is
defined with fun keyword
for example as we can see fun is the
keyword here and info here is the name
of the function
a cortland function divides the program
into small modules
these functions can easily be invoked by
making a call
and to make a call we use the name of
the function with parenthesis
as we can see in the example the
function info is getting invoked from
the main function
that is from the main function we are
making a call to the info function by
using the name of the function with
parentheses
now
let's understand function parameters
vectors can be defined as the
information that are passed to the
function
so basically functions can accept the
data or information passed to them
these informations and data are passed
in the form of parameters
after receiving the data or information
function can easily use this data to
calculate or display as per the function
definition
the parameters are specified after the
name of the function
and is mentioned inside parentheses
separated by commas and we can easily
pass as much parameters as we want
for example as you can see function calc
is accepting three parameters a b and c
of integer type
these three arguments or values are
passed from the main function where the
function call is made
so a b and c three arguments are passed
to the calc function and the function is
providing the average of these three
values
also the values that are passed to the
functions are called arguments and the
parameters are the values that are
defined in the function
definition so now let's understand the
next topic which is function returning
values
just like printing the values functions
can also return values
to return a value or values a return
keyword is used
also
while returning a value the return type
of the function is also specified as you
can see in the example
int is the return type of the function
and return keyword is used to return
values to the main function where they
are getting printed
so now moving on to the functions with
no return types
bottling function with no return type
in kotlin language if the function is
not turning anything then we don't need
to specify any return type
but if we want to mention the return
type then we can add unit as the return
type
so basically unit type in kotlin is like
void type in java
that means it is used with function that
doesn't return anything
next is
higher order functions
the higher order function in kotlin is a
function that can accept the functions
as a parameter and can also return a
function
we have heard that function accept
variables but we haven't heard about
function accepting other functions
in higher order function we can easily
do that
so as we can see in the example of
higher order function
the name of the function is high order
and is accepting two integer values that
is num1 and num2 and a function whose
name is fname
now this function fname is accepting two
integer values and its return type is
int
inside the function body we are calling
fname function and printing it
let's understand it with the help of an
example
so this is our kotlin playground
here we will do an example of higher
order function
we will do a basic example of higher
order functions so let's start first of
all we'll create the main function
function main
and inside this main function
let's name the higher order function as
high order
you can name it as per your choice i
have named it high order
and now let's pass the variables let's
say 50
80 and let's say 40.
now
we have to pass the function to this
higher order function
so we can do that with the help of these
two column operators and then
the name of the function
let's say the name of the function is my
function
so here we are passing three variables
and a function to the higher order
function
now
we'll create the higher order function
we'll write fun keyword
then
high
order
and now inside the paranthesis we'll
write num1
in the parameters that is 5080 40 we
have to
write the parameters
similarly num3
now after that
here we will
here we are accepting a function as well
so we'll write the name
let's say if name of the function is
func name
and
here
int and and the type of
the values that this function will be
accepting
here also we have to mention the types
of the function that this function will
be accepting and the return type of the
function as well
so int is the return type of this
function
we'll have to mention that as well
[Music]
by mistake we have done this we have to
use arrow operator for that
and yeah
now
we'll write the print basically will
call the function
in which
we will define the
definition of this function
so let's say the yeah the function name
was funct name
and these three are the parameters num1
num2
and num3 we are passing these
arguments
now
let's create this
function definition
so we'll create fun
keyword
my function
function is accepting num1
of integer type
num2 of integer type
and
num3 of integer type
now after that
the return type of the function is int
all right
now let's say we want to do the average
of these three numbers
so what we'll do is we'll write return
num1
plus num2 plus num 3
divided by 3
all right so
all we need to do is just enclose it
within the brackets
yeah now let's try to run this
as you can see 50 plus 40 90
90 and 80 is equals to 170
170 on
divided by when it is divided by 3 it
will give you
56.3 something and as we have used in tj
value so it is showing 56 only
so
what we are doing here is first of all
we are calling the high order function
so basically this is a higher order
function and we have named it high order
and we are passing three integer values
and one function
so these three integer values are
passing over here and these are the
parameters and this is how we accept
function as a parameter
this is the syntax of it
after that we are here calling the
definition of this function
so this is the definition we are calling
this function and this is the definition
of this function the value is calculated
over here and then is returned here and
then here it is getting printed
so the answer or the output of this
program is
56
as you can see so this is a higher order
function
now
let's understand lambda function
lambda function
lambda is an abbreviated form of
function writing
the lambda function is written without a
name and is enclosed in curly brackets
the lambda function has the basic syntax
arguments or variables are mentioned on
the left hand side of the operator and
the body of the function is present on
the right hand side of their operator
in the example
avg is the lambda variable
n1 n2 and n3 on the left side of the
arrow operator are the parameters and on
the right side is the function body
that is the average of three parameters
so as we have understood the lambda
functions and the higher order function
as well now let's understand how to use
higher order function with lambda
function
so lambda function allows us to
eliminate the code and write the code
more compactly
as we can see in this example
we have used the lambda function instead
of the normal function which has
decreased the lines of code
now
let's understand this with the help of
an example
so this is our example of higher order
function that we have done previously
now we will do this example or edit this
example
with lambda function
so now we will understand how to use
higher order function and lambda
function together
and it will make our code shorter and
more compact
so as we can see this was the here we
have used two column operators with the
name of the function
now all we need to do
is to create a lambda function over here
and for that as we know that there is no
name for a lambda function
the
lambda function is enclosed into
brackets
now let's say num1
and this is the parameters or the
variables
that is on the left hand side of the
arrow operator
then num2
m3
after that
here we can see here we have used the
arrow operator now we have moved to the
right hand side of that operator which
is the function body
now we'll use the parentheses
num1 plus num2 plus num3 so basically
this is the function body or the
function definition we can say
so now here we have
we are doing the average of these c
numbers as we have done previously
in the higher order function
now here we don't have to use this
function
we can just
eliminate this one
now as we can see our function is almost
done and let's try to run this program
as you can see the output is 56
so here we have used the lambda function
so this part which is the left hand side
part
of the arrow operator this is the
variables or the values
and this part
on the right hand side is the function
body
so the lambda function is enclosed in
the
in two brackets as we can see
here we have positive three variables
and this is the lambda function
also we have eliminated the my function
function because in that particular
function we are just defining or doing
the
calculation
and that we have already done in this
part so we no longer need that function
so
as you can see this is
here we are using higher order function
with lambda function
and with that we have come to the end of
