hey everyone I'm Ral and I welcome you
all to Simply learns YouTube channel
today we will talk about link and Lambda
expression but before we begin let me
tell you guys we have daily updates on
multiple Technologies so if you are a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for the
latest technological advancements then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update on
simply
learn so now without any further Ado
let's get started with the agenda for
today's session we will begin our
session with the discussion on
link then we will discuss the Lambda
expression and async Lambda after that
we will look into the Lambda in the
standard query operators with an
implementation now we will Dive In into
the type
interface then we will discuss the
variable
scope after that we will have a look at
the expression tree and expression
statements finally we will wind up this
session with a conclusion now let's get
started with link link is an
abbreviation for language integrated
query Microsoft query language is
completely integrated and allows for
simp simple data access from inmemory
objects databases XML documents and many
other
sources link unifies queries and c and
visual Basics through series of
extensions next up let's discuss Lambda
expression Lambda expressions are the
executable components of Link equations
that translate logic to send to the data
source at runtime here's the basic skill
SCH for Lambda
expression next async Lambda a Lambda
expression that use the asnc keyword to
integrate asynchronous processing here's
the syntax to print simply learn using
asynchronous
programming now let's implement this in
the code editor let's get started so
using system
then
using
system dot
collection dot
generics we will also use
using
system do link
link and
using
system dot
text now name
space
Lambda X
then C braces and inside that we will
have a
class
program C
Braes then I will declare a
delegate
and the
and
I then we will
have
static
void
Main stren
args again craes and in
this we will have
delect with my
delect is equals
to
A equals greater than to make an arrow
a
star
a
then
int
X is equals to
my
delect with the
value let's say
7 now let's use
console dot right line
and print out
X then
console dot
read
line basically this function will be
printing out the square for the seven so
basically it it should print out
49 let's save
it and run
as you can see it is printing
49 let's get back to our
slides now let's discuss Lambda in
standard query operators Lambda
expression with query operator is
evaluated on demand and operates on each
elements in the input sequence rather
than the entire sequence a Lambda
expression allows developer to insert
their own logic into the usual query
operator let's take a look at an example
in a codor where the developer utilized
the we operator to recover the odd items
from a provided list using a Lambda
expression let's go to the code edor
let's write a code to get an average of
the OD fibak numbers in the series so we
will start with introducing
using system
then
using
system do
collection dot
generics then we have
using
system dot
link then we are
using system
dot
text another name
space let's have
Lambda
X then we have a class
program then C
races in this we will have
static
void
main
string here
now we will have
in
braces
Feb is equals
to on cly Braes let's have numbers one
1 comma
2 comma
3 comma 5 comma 8 comma 13
comma
21 comma
34 these are some fibon
numbers now let's declare another
variable
double
average
well equals
to
FB
dot where
and Braes n is equals toal to greater
than
n modulo
2 equals to equals to
1
dot average
then let's have a
console do right
line to
print average
PA and another console
line to read line
read
line let's save it and run
it as you can see it is printing
7.33 which is basically the average of
these
numbers now let's get back to our
slides now let's discuss the topic type
inference type inference is useful in a
number of circumstances in C and it may
be used without explicitly stating the
types in the case of a Lambda expression
however time inference will only
function if each type has been provided
as the compiler must be
satisfied the compiler uses type
inference to deduce that X is a
integer which it does by inspecting the
Transformer arguments given below now
let's discuss the variable scope in
detail variables launched within a
Lambda expression are not supposed to be
visible in an outer method according to
the several regulations when employing
variable scope in a Lambda
expression there is also a requirement
that a captured variable is not to be a
garbage collector unless the delegate
addressing it becomes garbage collection
eligible furthermore it is against the
rule to utilize a written statement
within Lambda expression to force the
return of an enclosing
method now let's try a code to
understand this in
detail let's start with
using
system
then using
system do
collection do
generics
then
using
system do
link then again
using system
do
text then I will have a name
space
as
Lambda
X in craes I will have a
class program
then I will declare some
delegates
both tell
D1 and
delegate pan
D2 this D2 will have in I as
argument
next let's have a
class test
where I will have my D1
delegate as
del1 and D2 delegate
as Del
to
now let's have
public
void test method
function with an argument as
in
input in curly
basis let's initialize the delegates
with Lambda expression so first in P is
equal to
0 then we will have
del1 is equals to
empty
braces equals to greater
than p is equal to
10 then
return p greater than
input then we will invoke del2 after
test method goes out of the score so
del2 equals
toes this time we will have
x equals to greater than to make an
arrow
craes we will have
return X is equals to is equals to
e then we will close this
delegate now we will demonstrate the
value of P this time the delegates has
not be evoked yet
so we will have console
dot right
line here I can write p is equals
to I will have a placement zero
here for the
variable J
then we will have
B bu
result is equals to
Del
one
then we will
write
console dot right
line here we will
have p is equals to in C
Braes we will have placement
zero then comma then we have B is equals
to in curly Braes placement for
one where the 0er and 1
represent p and will result
now let's write
static
void
main
string ARG
now let's
have
test small
test is equals to
new
test with small
bra here now I will
call test DOT test
method for Value
five now we will prove that the del2 is
still has copy of local variable P from
the test
method so now
bull
R will be equals
to
test dot
Del for the value
10 then we will print out this with
console
dot right
line
rest then I will have a
console dot read
key let's save it and run it
as you can see it is first printing P
equal to Z then when we replace it it
with 10 the PS 10 and it is printing B
is true and then again result as
true let's get back to our slide now
let's have a look at the expression
tree Lambda expressions are often
utilized in expression tree development
an expression tree distributes the code
in data structures like a tree with each
node being an expression such as method
call or a binary operations such as X
less than y statement lambdas which
consist of two or three statement are
also available but are not employed in
the creation of expression tree a return
statement must be expressed in a Lambda
statement now let's implement this in a
code editor
let's
start
using
system then I will use
using
system dot
collection do
generic then we will use
system do
link then
using
system dot
text this time we will also
use
using system
do link
dot
Expressions now let's have a name
space Lambda X as usual
here we will have a
class
program in this we will have a
static
void mean
where in main we will have
string
args then we will have
in
SRC equals to new
3 comma 8 comma 4 comma
6
comma
2
comma 10
comma 19
comma 2 comma 4 comma 8
now let's have a for
each
statement where we will have
and
J
and
SRC dot where
X is equal to greater
than
f x is less than equals to
3 then we will return
true
l
f
x is greater than equals to
7 then also we will return
true
s we will
return false
then we will have
console dot right
line and we will print
J then we will have another console
line dot read line
basically what we are doing is we have
this set and we are only returning the
value which are either less than three
less than equals to 3 or greater than
equals to 7 so the four 6
8 sorry four 6 and four will be removed
and others will be
printed let's save it and run it
as you can see it is printing every
value except for four 6 and
four now let's get back to our
slides let's have a look at the
conclusion a Lambda expression can have
parameters and return a value a Lambda
expression may be used to declare
parameters in a variety of
ways there is no need need for curly
braces in a Lambda expression if there
is only one statement but a curly braces
and the return value must be return if
there are several
statements a feature called closure
allows Lambda expression to access
variables that are available outside of
Lambda expression block the closure
should be used with caution to avoid
problems any hazard code cannot be
executed within a Lambda
expression Lambda Expressions should not
be utilized on the left side of the
operator and this was all for today's
