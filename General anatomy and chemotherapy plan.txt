yes hi Venus so this is doctor Street
hunt from Team MDS conquered now I'm
here to do a brief idea of inaudible
okay so so the task for the next few
days is first is gentle anatomy and
followed by chemotherapy
okay chemotherapy of Pharma so first I
will be talking about a not so I not
according to the need blueprint is going
to carry 14 months and if we come to
Ames and PGA it has a decent importance
okay not as intensified as a need but it
has a very good decent importance so how
you have to handle another way okay so
an automate the books to be considered
are the things to be done if you are a
dental student okay one is you need to
follow the group because group we are
going to upload videos which were
prepared from standard textbooks okay
that's the first thing what you need to
do and second thing is the PDFs that are
shared on group so all these are primary
importance and the evening discussions
apart from this you need to be perfect
with dental pulse
an order me synopsis so at the end of
general and what ami subject of tendril
pulse you have a decent synopsis of
somewhere around 12 to 15 pages okay
which is very very important covering
all the memory based short things so
apart from this I'm going to share a
notes okay a smart notes but it's
prepared by one of our student long back
three years back which has a very great
importance in covering major aspects but
whatever it may be whether it's a short
notes or whether it's the synopsis from
the angel pulse or whether it is
anything
make sure you add diagrams okay so
diagrams in the anatomy are important so
everything what you read just try to
correlate with the diagram because they
can ask a diagram list question that is
one important aspect because if you see
the recent need of two zero two zero
there are more than forty to forty-five
diagrams of course in the aims also they
have decent handy number of diagrams so
and ultimately is the subject of forever
to give few diagrams so if you correlate
your stuff whatever you're reading
whether it's a PDF that is posted on the
group whether it is the notes that is
being posted on the group whether it's a
tangible synopsis make sure you try to
coordinate with a beautiful diagram
that's what we are doing in the videos
so every day we are trying to upload few
videos on general anatomy which will
definitely cover may majority of the
stuff related diagrams which are
important for you to return for a longer
duration of them so these are the things
that you have to do for an order you
have to follow for anatomy as an MDS
conquer student okay I hope you are very
clear about this part so coming to the
next coming to the topics the first one
is I mean apart from the regular topics
of general an autumn II which includes
the regular topics so there are three
other topics that you have to do okay so
one is brain okay brain is a part of
your dental syllabus in general
inaudible which is not much stressed in
in in the ug level so brain is important
both this physiology part of brain as
well as the anatomical aspects of the
brain are important that has to be done
apart from this ear and eye has to be
done regularly the most commonly asked
questions in the year are about
obstacles or about the tubes and in the
eye the most commonly asked questions
are a their muzzles related to the eye
or nurse related to the eye but it is
mandatory that you have to learn all
this brain I here with some more concern
because these are not properly covered
in the regular syllabus of your regular
and secure books okay so you have to
keep a step forward and you have to give
some more time for these things and try
to retain the basics of brain eye and
ear okay I hope you're clear about the
topics so apart from the general an
automated Anatomy will also contain two
other subjects okay that is general
histology and general embryology which
will be covered as a separate topics
okay which are not covered now which
will be covered as a separate topics
once we are done with that
okay so total these three subjects are
going to carry 14 but logically speaking
an autumn a exclusive will be for twelve
and your embryo and histology will be
one plus one okay most of your general
histology general embryology will be
covered simultaneously with your oral
historian I hope you're clear
so coming to the topics and where you
need to focus on the specific topics the
first important thing is about brain so
brain a beautiful PDF of brain and
spinal cord was posted few aspects of
physiology were also included in the
synopsis and please do this PDF that is
more than
sufficient okay so we are done with
brain and spinal cord that's the topic
one the second topic is osteology so for
osteology we have posted a video along
with the video of beautiful notes that
is prepared from shouders yeah there is
smart notes and followed by your dental
pulse synopsis and and and secures of
this particular talk that is more than
sufficient once you are done with this
evening you can attend the discussion
where everything is covered in a brief
systemic way followed by you can give
your regular exam of the specific topic
okay so hope you're done hope you're
clear about the second day the third day
I have kept more topics well known and
familiar topics one is thyroid gland
second one is mouth third one is facts
okay so of this the most important thing
is thyroid gland
okay so thyroid gland you have to do the
anatomy part of thyroid gland in your
general surgery there's a channel
surgery you have diseases of thyroid so
once okay so you can directly go to the
synopsis part of general surgery where
the anatomy of thyroid gland is covered
for one to two basis in order to go into
the diseases aspect of thyroid but go
back to your general surgery synopsis of
your dental bells try to cover the basic
anatomy of thyroid gland which is given
in 1:1 and off pace support from that
the rest important aspects related to
the thyroid mouth fairings will be
covered both as a smart notes as well as
the videos and followed by the
discussion and a beautiful examination
so in this you can include your dental
pulse part and you can just try to
finish the things which are there in the
dental pulse that is more than
sufficient okay so next coming to the
next one that is topic number four okay
the topic number four is larynx and the
tongue okay and coming to the larynx the
most important aspects in the larynx are
the cartilages
so you have to learn about each and
every catalyst their shape and
function the moment and whatever that is
required from the textbook so you need a
textbook reading for the catalysis of
larynx which has a high chance of a
diagram based or a regular question and
the next one is coming to the tongue
tongue you need to cover both the
developmental aspect of the tongue as
well as the functional aspect moment as
well as the muscles of the tongue and
preferably they are there in the
synopsis as well as I'm going to post
some smart notes there will be covered
here and there but whenever it is
required coming to the moments of the
tongue or the muscles of the tongue I
prefer you need to go back to the
textbook and have a glance over it
because anyway we are going to cover
them from our side but I want you guys
to go back to your textbook and just
have a glance and followed by you will
have a decent video based discussion and
followed by an exam in the evening so
coming to the topic number five the
topic number five is the vascular system
that is nothing but the blood system of
head and neck so blood system of the
head and neck I'll be posting a notes
and some synopsis part of tangibles are
going to help just go with the synopsis
followed by them seekers and followed by
the discussion and examination and next
come to the sixth topic the sixth topic
is going to be the muscles look at the
muscles of head and neck the same same
sequence notes video pulse synopsis
pulse MCQs followed by union discussion
and the examination these are the levels
how you need to handle this muscles and
the next comes is the now supply
but then the nerve supply is going to be
the same sequence where the vascular
supply muscles are played no supply try
to follow the same sequence of your
notes and videos followed by pulse
synopsis one of my pal Sam secures a
union discussion and followed by the
examination and the next comes is eye
and ear so iron here are basically not
covered properly in your in any of them
secure books so I'm going to post a PDF
over this and please try to cover the
PDF and followed by the discussion and
followed by a small examination in the
evening session ok so apart from this
there are many other simple topics like
ganglions ok salivary glands lymph nodes
and many other things which are
important in the examination point of
view will be covered individually
whenever it is required on the group
either in the video format or in the
audio format in Twitter with the
discussion right the lasts in the least
one to talk about is the clinical aspect
clinical aspect of inaudible ok the
clinical aspect of anatomy will be
covered in various other subjects like
your general medicine or any other thing
but basically in the last day I am just
going to give a brief idea that how you
have to focus on the technical aspect of
anatomy and how you have to coordinate
like how you have to apply or clinical
skills when a clinical aspect of a
clinical based question is coming
related to the gentle inaudible but most
often time I can consider gentle and
order me as a static subject a static
subject is a subject which doesn't
change over a period of time whereas
coming to your dental materials or your
prosthetics or your endo every every new
day or every new year you come up with
some new material and you come up with
some new concepts modification of this
Center regularly this will not happen in
your inaudible
because Anatomy is always the same
whatever trigeminal now what are the
branches you have is same as whatever I
have and whatever is going to be after
10 years the branches will be the same
there will be no modification of the
branches so similarly most of your
questions
in your channel and/or to me will not
change ok the pattern of questioning or
the way they ask the questions and the
things will be the same means largest
know is always the same longest nerve is
always the same so there will be no
modification so my request for you guys
is to just prepare a proper organized
stuff how you are organized on the day
one is same as how you are going to read
before the examination as a revision so
please do organize your stuff properly
arrange your stuff properly so that the
revision of Anatomy is not going to take
much time whatever we are doing from our
side is as a team we are trying to
authorize the material and trying to
make the things as easy as possible
whether it is in the notes or whether
it's in the smart video or whether it is
in the evening discussion and whatever I
am giving as an exam in the in the late
night as a daily exam of 20 or 25 marks
I am just trying to revise few things
and trying to expose you for new new
things trying to give an application
based question so this is what we are
doing okay trying to improve your skills
from all the directions the possible
direction whether it's a it's an
application based question whether it's
a diagram based question or whether it's
a memory based question our goal is to
make you strong from all the aspects not
only in in a particular direction the
goal is to make you strong in all
aspects like to make you to get exposed
to more number of MCQs okay so that you
you you can be very familiar in the
examination hall like you can you can be
very cool and you can handle the
situation well so that is about the
anonymous and coming to the last two to
three days my plan is to cover the
chemotherapy so chemotherapy is one of
the part of pharmacology where we are
going to split and
it's something like this divide and rule
bonus like you have to learn
pharmacology by divide and rule honestly
because if I'm giving 10 or 14 days for
pharmacology and asking you to read you
will fed up with pharmacology because
pharmacology is a dry subject and the
second one is more memory based subject
because the drug names and everything
about very typical there is no concept
except like farmer called kinetics and
dynamics which would talk about the
action of the drugs on the body and the
metabolism which are related more often
to the physiology their concept we're
injecting the rest all like remember in
the classification remembering the
different generations of drugs different
sub sub categories of drugs their
complications their adverse effects
their dosages and is more often a memory
based stuff so when it come to a subject
which is more of a memory based like
pharmacology in specific or something
like biochemistry in detail you have to
split and read how to play the policy of
divide and rule so that's what we are
doing
so the first pretend rate topic of
pharmacologist chemotherapy so in
chemotherapy you have many things like
the most common things are pencil ins
you have tetracyclines you have macro
leads you have a minor like receipts how
many other you have sulfonamides apart
from this you have antifungal drugs you
have antiviral drugs you have anti
Helaman thick drugs or anti-parasitic
drugs and you have anti-cancer drugs so
there are many other things and out of
which definitely you know that the the
antibiotics or the anti-fungal agents or
the antiviral which are most commonly
used in dentistry is a most common area
of question of course my aspect is to
read each and everything top to bottom
as we have three days allocated for this
and I want you guys to give your best to
cover major topics so our team goal is
to make the stuff as simple as possible
and will feed you in the best way
okay so your job is to just follow the
things and try to work hard and try to
practice more so for this you need to go
for sparsh Gupta there is no other move
okay you need to read Spurs kata
probably I'll let you know the pages and
the things what you need to cover from
SMERSH Gupta so we will do this
specifically strums version of the once
we are done with this first Koopa like
you will have multiple practices like
either either an exam if you want to
take an exams on individual topics you
can take that is one option you have
what else if you want to directly solve
your dental pulse pharmacology part of
chemotherapy or tangibles can be easily
solved if you are very familiar or
strong over the subject with spesh okay
so this is about the plan of action for
the upcoming ten or ten to twelve hour
days and I hope you guys were up to the
frequency okay
still few people are trying to attend
that frequency Matt but but I feel like
most of you are taking the thing
seriously working hard I can see that
positiveness say in offline classes as
well as in the online sessions in the
doubt sessions that you are asking the
doubts or you are calling me interacting
so they're very good positive signs that
I am able to appreciate from your side
and so these these are all positive
vibes
that we are going to intensify our
preparation because we are approaching
because it is roughly we have nine
months from now for the examination and
roughly eight months for the number aims
and nine months for the December need
okay thank you all
signing off dr. Steven from team MDS
confession take care guys
