your resume within two pages and not
more than that

very respectful be aware of your
movements and stay calm through the
course of the interview now let me brief
you on answering a few of the most
frequently questions in an interview

this question is asked to get your
confidence and communication skills here

and hobbies make sure to have a concise
answer and answer with enthusiasm two
what are your strengths and weaknesses

wishes to see how positive you think
about yourself and if you can identify
your weaknesses
speaking about your strengths there's no
right or wrong it can be about your
flexibility your attention to detail and
so on however speaking about your
weaknesses you don't have to be hard on
yourself you can reply with an answer
like your attention to detailed trait
can sometimes be a disadvantage and you
tend to spend more time this way your
weakness still has a positive side three
where do you see yourself in the next
five years this question can be a little
tricky through this question the
interviewer is analyzing your commitment
to the company an ideal answer to this
would be to tell how you wish to be a
significantly higher position in the
future and learn new things
four why should we hire you when
answering this question do not speak
about how good your academics are
instead speak about how eager you are to
learn and hence the opportunity would be
a good one to show your zeal you can
also touch upon a few qualities that
they have that will be highly beneficial

positive impacts you have made in the
previous organization and how you can

identify the right candidate for a
particular job role recruiters call
candidates who have impressive resume to

the job
telephonic interviews make the screening
process easier by shortlisting a handful
of applicants from an entire pool of
applicants for the in-person interviews

makes it relatively quick to determine
whether a candidate is suitable or not

barriers or situations like the current

interview goes well congratulations you

30 to 45 minutes or even less you have a
short time to positively impact the
recruiter and convince him or her that
you are the right fit for the job so
here are a few tips to help you crack
your next phone interview

the job description well and research
about the company ideally you would have

informed of the date and time of your
interview well beforehand

room where you can speak without any
disruptions

traffic or any other noise
additionally keep your family members
aware of your interview so that there is
no disturbance from their end as well
after choosing your ideal spot make sure
that you use a good phone with good
connectivity or preferably the landline
for your telephonic interview

drops or poor network coverage at this
time

conversation

questions asked you don't need to talk a
lot to impress the interviewer at any
point if you have any questions you can
jot them down and save them for the end
make sure to wait and think before you
start answering a question
once the interviewer asks you a question
give a second or two and then answer

talking all at once which will sound
chaotic and can be awkward

any interview process whether you are
applying for your dream job or trying to
get into the top tier colleges group
discussion is undoubtedly one of the
eliminating rounds that you need to face
many candidates panic about group
discussions but not to worry as we have
a few important tips to help you crack
your ged before listing our tips let's
understand what a group discussion means
in short gd is a process in which a
group of people sit together and discuss
various aspects of a given topic
in the meanwhile the gd panel will be
gauging you on a set of criteria
so what are you tested in on a group
discussion what does the interviewer
wish to see the panel evaluates your
leadership skills listening skills
confidence and teamwork qualities
through a group discussion in addition
to these qualities they also wish to see
how well you can logically present your
perspective and how gracefully you can
conduct yourself in a group the gd round
strains the right candidate from a large
pool of applicants
so here is a list of the top 8 tips that
will help you master group discussions
1. before you participate in a group
discussion it is advised that you have
some knowledge on the given topic
yes you cannot be aware of every topic
under the sun however there are a few
general gd topics that you could
research on
a few such topics are women make better
managers agree or disagree
social media is a boon or a bane for the
society
your views on bitcoin and cryptocurrency
given the current scenario you can also
prepare on topics around covid19
topics like coronavirus impact on global
economy
how effective virtual learning is
and is social distancing the new norm
to name a few
different topics can be given to you
starting from general topics to
controversial to case studies before
stepping into the gd research on a few
topics that are frequently asked you
don't need to carry out a detailed study
on these topics it is enough if you have
a rough idea about it
in the end you are not judged on your
knowledge but on how wisely you present
your answers
two
next we will speak about how you should
initiate a group discussion many of you
might think if you speak first you can
grab the attention well yes you
definitely can however it can also
backfire on you
our tip to you is that speak first only
if you have meaningful information on
the topic you could start the discussion
with a relevant quote story or fact
if you are confused about the topic and
unsure how to start it is fine to wait
and listen to the others and then
rephrase your answer
three
once the group discussion is in full
swing be careful about how you speak
there will be many candidates with
different views you need to respect that
and assertively put across your view but
not aggressively at no point should you
shout and get angry
there are a few phrases that can help
you respectfully communicate your
opinions
firstly if you disagree with someone be
graceful and control your emotions you
can use phrases like i beg to differ i
do not support your point of view i have
a different opinion
and so on in situations where you agree
with someone use phrases like i second
you i have the same opinion
apart from this there will be scenarios
where you might partially agree with
someone at that time it's best to say
you are right however i don't fully
endorse your statement and so on
at some point if you are required to
interrupt someone think before you do
that and say
sorry i wish to interrupt you there
lastly if you would like to add a few
pointers you can start the conversation
by saying in addition to that
you must use the right words and phrases
through the course of your ged this
shows you respect the other person and
your flexibility in accepting others
points of view while sticking to your
own
remember you have a positive attitude
throughout the discussion
it is important to carry out a healthy
discussion
group discussion is not a process to
judge your current affairs knowledge but
evaluate your interpersonal skills and
behavior
4. using the previously mentioned
phrases allow you to speak
hence it would be best if you spoke with
clarity and put across your opinions
communicate confidently have a good
command over english and speak
comfortably
take a pause and think of what to talk
do not try to be dominant while speaking
finally everything boils down to how you
present your opinion and how well you
can convince the rest of the candidates
and leave a positive impact on them
through your speech
remember to talk well and catch the
attention of the panel
another point to remember is not sitting
back after talking once try to have more
than one entry
five our next tip to you is to listen
carefully not just hear but listen
a vital skill the panel judges you on is
on your listening skills
listening is a sign of respect
do listen to understand your teammates
and not just to reply to them
this may sound easy but it is one of the
most challenging tasks to carry out in a
group discussion
listen carefully and then reply give
others a chance to talk
make eye contact with the speaker and
acknowledge him or her by nodding your
head
this shows your active participant in
the discussion
6.
body language also plays a prime role in
a ged the panelists notice the way you
sit and react
body language speaks volumes about you
hence sit straight avoid constant
impatient or tensed movements
stay calm and maintain eye contact
always
you should also remember to dress
professionally and be presentable
seven do not deviate from the topic

common questions asked by an interviewer
seem easy but are a little tricky this
video on the top 10 interview questions

answers still it is advisable to build
your answers around the tips we will
give you here based on your skills and
experience of course by doing so you
will feel more confident and stress-free
in your interview
so let's begin and lay out the most
commonly asked interview questions that
will play a huge role in determining
your future one one of the first
questions you can expect in an interview
is tell me about yourself
although this seems to be easy there are
a few tips to remember while answering
this
through this question highlight your
education experience and hobbies don't
get too personal while answering this
simultaneously make sure to highlight
your qualities
another question that is commonly asked
is what is your strength and weakness
this is generally asked to check if you
as an individual can identify what you
lack and at the same time understand
what you think is a positive trait that
you own
we suggest you break this answer into
two parts and speak about your strengths
first
do not be overly confident while listing
out your strengths as it can always
backfire you a few good strengths that
an interviewer seems fit will be
flexibility teamwork attention to detail
and so on you can add whatever else you
feel is correct for you however don't
keep the list too long and brag about
yourself coming to your weaknesses you
don't have to be very hard on yourself
think of a particular weakness that also
seems to be beneficial in some way for
example you could say that your
attention to detailed trait can at times
be a disadvantage as you tend to spend
more time and deep dive when issues crop
up so this won't be just a weakness
since it carries a positive side as well
there are instances where the
interviewers ask you if you have
overcome your weaknesses make sure to
mention that you are working on it and
trying to improve three another tricky
question can be why do you want this job
it can also be rephrased as why should
we hire you what interests you about
this role this is an answer that you can
ace if you plan it well through your
answer you can get an opportunity to
show what you know about the job you are
applying for and the company be accurate
with your answers list a few aspects of
the job role that appeals to you the
most and speak about ways to contribute
to this role carrying out good research
on the company and understanding the job
description will help you answer this
question
mention specific points that will
convince the hiring manager that you are
a good fit for this particular job
make sure that you don't sound arrogant
at the same time not too modest in
reality you might just want the job to
fill a career gap for the money however
it is best if you don't say that and
instead polish your answers around these
tips four so the next question you can
expect is why did you leave your last
job
this question might seem a little
awkward and can get you job seekers get
nervous but don't worry we'll give you a
few tips to maneuver through this
so if you were fired from your last job
it is best if you own up to it and tell
them what you learned from that
experience and how you have to overcome
those issues right now
you might think it's best not to tell
the truth here but that's a bad idea as
companies can always do a background
check and know the reality and when that
happens it won't leave a good impression
we all make mistakes and hence it is
okay to own up to it as long as you are
facing those mistakes right now
so in cases where you have voluntarily
left your previous job
explain why you can mention points like
you were looking for a different
challenge and indirectly map it with a
new position you're interviewing for you
could also say how the new company you
are interviewing for has been one of the
dream companies and so on
if there are other reasons for it like
budget cuts or economic issues you can
mention those as well
however at no point should you be
speaking wrong of your last company or
your previous management don't make
statements like how boring or mundane
your previous job was try to answer this
question with positivity only five
another question that could be asked is
what is your greatest accomplishment at
work here you can pick an accomplishment
that displays the right set of qualities
that the company values and those that
match the role you're interviewing for
pick a single accomplishment that you
feel will have the most impact
another way this question can be asked
is describe a difficult work situation
and how you handled it this question is
asked to assess how well you work in a
tough situation in your approach
for this you need to have a well thought
out success story ready think of an
instance wherein you successfully dealt
with a problem all by yourself take a
story that exhibits your skills to be an
asset to the job you are interviewing
for first mention the situation then
move on to the task and action you
carried out
finally speak about how fruitful the
result was
you could speak about a situation
wherein your boss was away and how you
single-handedly handled issues of a
client who was on the verge of leaving
and so on
basically through your answer the
interviewer wishes to see how fit you
are to handle any problem that could
arise make sure to be precise with your
answer display how passionate you are
and that you are a problem solver
six moving on to the next question how
do you handle stress and pressure
don't fall under pressure while
answering this question and instead
respond calmly to begin with don't say
that you don't get stressed as
fascinating as that sounds it is
unbelievable since we are all humans
indeed being overconfident this way will
make the interviewer suspicious every
job comes with its own kind of tension
and pressure this question is asked to
know how work pressure affects you and
your approach to it the best way to plan
this answer is by providing examples of
how you've handled work pressure and
stress in the past and how that's molded
you for the better for example speak
about how good pressure can help you you
could say having pressure keeps you
motivated and more productive mention
that the best way you overcome stress is
by creating a well-planned schedule that
will help you complete the assigned
project before the deadline this shows
that you turn stress into action and
take it positively to accomplish your
tasks seven our seventh question is
about your goals you can be asked where
do you see yourself in five years
your answer to this question analyzes
your commitment to the company
don't mention how you wish to be the ceo
of the company you are interviewing for
that makes it look too unrealistic be
grounded while answering this question
for example speak of how you want to
break the next five years into phases
in the first couple of years mention how
you want to learn everything about your
job and acquire new skills after which
in the next few years mention how you
wish to be in a position to help other
team members and the company with your
skills and the acquired knowledge
this way you are showing that you wish
to learn and grow at the same time
another question that can be asked on
the same lines is what are your future
goals this is also asked to determine
whether you will stick with a company in
the long term this question also
analyzes your ambitions and how you
forecast your career you could answer
this in the same way as the mentioned
previously before answering do try to
understand what you want for yourself
and see if the job role you're applying
for helps you reach your ultimate
desired goals eight our next question is
what can you do for us that other
candidates can
this question is asked bluntly to
distinguish yourself from other
candidates it is not very simple to
answer this question hence plan it
beforehand this question can be answered
on the lines of your strength and how
you stand out from the rest of the pack
at no time should you be critical of
other candidates all you need to do is
speak about yourself emphasize any
special certifications that you have
your prior industry experience or you
could speak about your strong
interpersonal skills in the end you can
mention that the combination of these
skills can add great value to the team
you will be working with remember to
keep it precise and don't compare
yourself with other candidates and
instead highlight your qualities and
skills
nine our next question is what salary
are you seeking or what are your salary
expectations
this is asked to check if your salary
expectations match the company's amount
budgeted for the role you are applying
for
to be able to answer this you need to
know your worth hence research the
salary range from your role in your area
and have an idea about it before
replying to this question
for example if you give a range that is
way higher or lower than the market
value it looks like you are unaware of
your worth you could wish to ask for a
higher side of the market range however
you must clearly show that you are
flexible and salary can be negotiable
you could also be careful and instead
ask for the employer what range they are
looking to pay someone your background
typically has this way you will know
what the employer has in his or her mind
and speak around that
10 our final question is very common do
you have any questions for me usually
the interviewer concludes by asking you
if you have any questions for them now
is the right time for you to clarify
your doubts and ask questions make sure
to ask good and relevant questions this
displays the seriousness you have
towards the job firstly if you have any
doubts or questions in mind regarding
the job role and your day-to-day
responsibilities feel free to ask
secondly it is good if you ask about the
company's culture lastly you can ask
questions regarding the opportunities
you will be getting for the professional
development in this particular role it
is of utmost importance that you are
convinced about the job role and its
growth to go ahead this is the time for
you to decide as well if you want this
job or not based on the interviewer's
reply you can decide if that particular
job is good or not for your career
avoid asking too many questions and
questions about off-work activities
remember that every question you ask
shows your seriousness hence avoid
asking silly time wasting questions

interview questions now you know the
kind of questions you have to review and
prepare for before your next interview

respond to any questions keep these tips

accordingly following these tips will
surely help you stand out from the crowd
where do you see yourself in five years

the most frequently asked questions
so what does the interviewer keep in
mind while asking you this
what is your safe answer
the answer to this can get quite
delicate and can set you apart from the
other candidates here we are to help you
answer this question smoothly before
answering this question you need to
understand what the interviewer wants to
know while asking you such a question
when you are asked where you see
yourself in 5 years it is nothing but a
question about your career goals
employers want to learn about your goals
and see if it fits with a job they're
offering
interviewers wish to know if this job
role will satisfy you and that you'll
work hard and stay with the company for
a long time they want to assess you on
your vision ambitions and career outlook
they wish to see if you have realistic
expectations of your career and if this
particular position aligns with your
goals overall
you must think about how this job aligns
with your broader professional goals
most jobs need training no employer
would be interested in investing their
time and money in a candidate who is
planning to leave hence companies hire
good prospects for their businesses
those who are genuinely enthusiastic
about the job and those who are truly
dependable you should give an honest
answer this question but make sure to
present your answer well in a way that
can help you get hired you must make
sure to think about your goals before
formulating an answer to the interview
think of this question as an opportunity
for you to do a bit of career planning
and answer the question
by developing your answer to this
question you can get an insight into
your career direction
however a wrong answer to this question
can wreck an opportunity for you so how
to answer this question rightly here are
a few magic tips to help you first and
foremost do not answer this question
with an i don't know and avoid joking
this shows you that you have no
seriousness towards this job in your
career employers want to see if this job
truly matters to you or not it shouldn't
look like this job is just a way to pass
your time or an opportunity to break
your unemployment secondly when
answering it is best if you stay
grounded and not bring up unrealistic
expectations for example do not say
things like you see yourself as a ceo or
a cmo in the next five years that will
give the employer a feeling that you are
over ambitious and that you may not be
happy if the growth doesn't escalate to
that speed
very few employers will be interested in
hiring you then such an answer will also
make your current job just a stepping
stone and not something you truly want
hence refrain from speaking about
promotions or seeing your job roles and
rather stay grounded finally what are
you supposed to say then how are you
supposed to answer the question
one quick tip is that you must present
your answers as actions and not goals
when answering this question it is
advised that you break this question
into parts one as a short-term goal and
another as a long-term goal this will
help you channelize your answer and
provide good clarity to the interviewer
for example you can say something on
these grounds for the next couple years
i would like to immerse myself in this
job and improve my skills around it
after which i would like to take up
additional responsibilities and help
others in the organization with my
expertise
when you say this it shows how solely
focused you are on this role how excited
you are to learn new skills and at the
same time it also shows that your
learning will help the company in the
future
make sure to mention a set of actions
you will undertake to help facilitate
your growth and not the final goal by
itself
the bottom line an employer wants to see
your future goals and see if it will
align with the company's needs by doing
so they will understand if you are an
asset to the company or not preparing
for this question is a great exercise in
understanding what you like doing and
what is genuinely meaningful to you in
the future
take the time to think about what you
want in life and present your answer
well this way there are more chances for
you to be hired and you will also be
happy about where you will be in the
next 5 years

complex problems perfectly
most jobs in the present are dependent
on technology coding helps to find jobs
quite easily and impact theory group
coding skills also help in improving
resilience skills which can be a huge
advantage today we'll be discussing
about the coding interview questions
we will begin this video with some
conceptual questions about data
structures algorithms and then move on
to discussing the coding problems that
are most commonly asked to solve in the
interviews
these questions will help you summarize
every important programming concept and
serve as a perfect preparation resource
for coding interviews
by the end of this video i can assure
you that you will have a proper
understanding of data structure concepts
and you will be able to code the most
common problems asked in interviews
now let's begin with the top 40 coding
interview questions that you should know
programming interview questions are an
integral part of an interview for the
developer's position no matter which
programming language you master it is
expected that you are familiar with the
fundamental concepts of the programming
coding skills are always the deciding
factor in any programming interview we
will discuss the top 40 coding interview
questions you should absolutely know how
to crack in interviews to get your dream
job so without further ado let's get
started so as discussed the first part
would be the conceptual interview
questions
and that the first question we have to
face is what is a data structure so the
answer for this question is a data
structure is a storage format that
defines the way the data is stored
organized and manipulated some popular
data structures are arrays trees and
graphs
moving ahead we have our next question
that is what is an array
so basically all the items that an array
stores are of the same data type it
organizes data so that a related set of
values can be easily sorted or searched
now followed by an array the next
question we have is about the linked
list
so what is a linked list it is
completely similar to array but there
are some basic differences like an array
a linked list is a linear data structure
in which elements are not necessarily
stored in a continuous manner so linked
list is basically a sequence of nodes
where each node points to the next node
forming a chain like structure
so followed by the linked list we have
the next question which is based on
stacks so what exactly is a stack stack
is a linear data structure that performs
operations in a leaf or order so in a
stack elements can only be accessed
starting from the top most to the bottom
element
so followed by stacks we have our next
question which is what is a lifo so
basically lifo stands for last in first
out
so it is a way of accessing storing and
retrieving data
the data that was stored at the last is
extracted at the first
the next one after lifo is a queue so
what exactly is a queue
q is a linear data structure that
performs operations in a fifo order
so basically fifo is first in first out
in a queue the least recently added
elements are removed first as opposite
to the stack
so up next we have the fifo so what
exactly is fifo fifo stands for first in
first out it is a way of accessing
storing and retrieving data
the data that was stored first is
extracted first
the next question is about the binary
trees so what exactly are binary trees a
binary tree is an extension of linked
list data structure where each node has
two children
binary tree has two nodes at all the
times a left node and a right node
so these left and right nodes for the
top node are known as children of the
top node
next we have is recursion so what is
recursion recursion refers to a function
calling itself based on a terminating
condition
it uses last and first start
functionality and therefore makes use of
the stack data structure
followed by recursion we have the oops
so what is the oops concept
oops stands for object oriented
programming system a paradigm that
provides concepts such as objects
classes inheritance polymorphism
encapsulation etc
so what are the concepts introduced in
oops
so the following concepts are introduced
in oops they are object class
inheritance polymorphism abstraction and
encapsulation now we will discuss each
one of them in a bit more detail
so we will begin with object a real
world entity having a particular state
and a behavior is called as an object it
can be defined as an instant of a class
so next we have the class
a logical entity that defines the
blueprint from which an object can be
created or instantiated is called as a
class so basically class is a blueprint
which we use to create an object
so followed by classes and objects we
have the inheritance a concept that
refers to an object acquiring all the
properties and behaviors of a parent
object is called as inheritance so
basically inheritance provides code
reusability
so followed by inheritance the next
important concept we have is the
polymorphism
so polymorphism is a concept that allows
the task to be performed in different
ways in java we use method overloading
and method overriding to achieve
polymorphism
followed by polymorphism we have the
abstraction
a concept that hides the internal
details of an application and shows only
the functionality is called as
abstraction in java we use abstract
classes and interface to achieve
abstraction the last one is the
encapsulation encapsulation is a concept
that refers to wrapping of code and data
together into a single unit so basically
every code we have in the java will have
data members and data manipulating
methods so encapsulation is a basic
concept that brings them together and
binds them as a single unit
so followed by oops concepts the next
important question that we will be
facing is about the binary search tree
so explain binary search tree
a binary search tree stores data in such
a way that it can be retrieved very
efficiently
next the left sub tree contains nodes
both keys are less than the of the
node's key value
the right subtree contains nodes those
keys are greater than or equal to the
node's key value
followed by that the next question we
have is the doubly linked list so what
exactly are doubly linked lists the
doubly linked lists are special type of
linked list in which traversal across
the data elements can be done in both
directions
this is made possible by having two
links in which one of the node will be
connected to the next upcoming node and
the other link is connected to the
previous node
so followed by the doubly linked list
the next important question we have is
the graph so what exactly is a graph a
graph is one type of data structure that
contains a set of ordered pairs so these
ordered pairs are also referred as edges
or arcs and arcs are used to connect
nodes where data can be stored or
retrieved so followed by this we have
our next question that is called as the
difference between
linear and non-linear data structures
so the first difference is the linear
data structure in which data elements
are adjacent to each other and the
non-linear data structure is a structure
in which each element can connect to
two adjacent data elements
followed by that the next difference is
examples of linear data structure are
the arrays linked list stacks and others
like queues and examples for non-linear
data structures are trees and graphs
followed by that the next question is of
what is a dq so dq is a double ended
queue and this is a structure in which
elements can be inserted or removed from
either end
followed by that we have our next
question which says the difference
between the stack and an array
so stack follows a lifo pattern it means
that the data axis follows a sequence in
which the last data to be stored is the
first element to be extracted
next we have the array address on the
other hand do not follow a particular
order and instead can be accessed by
referring the indexed element within the
array
followed by that the next question is
which sorting algorithm is the best
there are many types of sorting
algorithms like quicksort bubble sort
balloon sort radix sort merge sort etc
and no algorithm can be considered as
the best or the fastest because each is
designed for a specific type of data
structure where it performs the
best and our 19th question is how does
variable declaration affect memory
so the amount of memory can be allocated
or reserved depends on the data type
being stored in that variable
for example if a variable is declared to
be integer type then 32 bits of memory
storage will be reserved for that
variable so the 28th question is what
are dynamic data structures so dynamic
data structures are the data structures
that expand and contract as the program
runs
it provides a flexible means of
manipulating data because it can adjust
according to the size of the data
so these were the conceptual based
questions so far we discussed now
next we will move ahead into the
programming interview questions
so at first we have
how do you reverse a string in java so
you can see on my screen we have a code
segment that is capable of reversing a
string so basically you declare a string
then take the length of that string loop
through the characters of the string and
add these characters in the reverse
order then print the resultant string
next we have how do you determine if a
string is a palindrome or not
so for that particular question we have
a code segment which is capable to
reverse the string and check if it is a
palindrome or not and accordingly
provide the result so a string is a
palindrome when it stays the same on the
reversing order of characters in that
string it is achieved by reversing the
original string first and then checking
if the reverse string is equal to the
original string or not
followed by that we have the 23rd
question that says find the number of
occurrences of a string character in a
string so the following code segment is
capable to find that particular task and
to find the number of occurrences of
loop through the string and search for
that character in every iteration
whenever it is found then the count will
be updated
followed by that the 24th question is
find if the given two strings are
anagrams or not
two strings are considered as anagrams
if they contain similar group of
characters in varied sequence
so for finding out if two strings are
anagrams or not we have the code segment
on the right part of my screen right now
so basically you declare a boolean value
that tells the end of the two strings
are anagrams or not then first check the
length of the both strings if they are
same or not then
if they are not same then they are not
anagrams if they are same then they are
anagrams like they might be a chance of
being the two strings as anagrams and
followed by the next step is convert
both the strings to character arrays
then sort them out and finally check the
sorted arrays if they're equal or not if
they are equal then print their anagrams
and if they are not equal then you
should print not anagrams the next 25th
question is how do you calculate the
number of wobbles and consonants in a
string so you can see on my screen i
have a code segment which will be
capable of counting bubbles and
consonants in a string so loop through
the string so that's the first step
followed by that increase the vowel
variable by one whenever the character
can be found as a vowel using the if
condition otherwise increment the
consonant variable finally print the
values of both the vowels and consonants
count
the next important question we will be
facing in the coding interview is how do
you get matching elements in an integer
array so for that we have a code segment
on my screen right away now the steps
for that are declare an array nest a
couple of loops and compare the numbers
with the other numbers in the array and
finally print the matching elements
whenever found
so next we have this 27th question that
says code bubble sort algorithm you
don't have to code the entire bubble
sort algorithm what you can do is just
write the code segment which has a logic
for it so that is currently on my screen
right now so what you basically do is
declare an array so next what you do is
nest a couple of loops and compare the
numbers in that array and then the array
will be sorted in the ascending order by
replacing the elements if found in any
other order
28th question is code the insertion sort
algorithm so this is completely similar
approach what we followed for the bubble
sort you just have to write the code
segment of logic
so the steps will be first the element
in the array is assumed to be sorted
take the second element and then store
it separately in key now the first two
elements are like sorted take the third
element and then compare it with the
elements in the left of it
the process goes on until the array is
sorted
so next we have the 29th question how do
you reverse an array so you can see on
my screen we have a code segment that
says how to reverse an array
loop till the half length of the array
next we have to replace the numbers
corresponding to the indexes from the
starting to the end
followed by that we have the 30th
question where we have to find a way to
swap two numbers without the third
variable so this type of interview
question will be asked most number of
times to the beginners most frequently
now the solution for that has been
written on my screen right away you can
check out that and the steps to be
followed are declare two variables and
initialize them with the values make b
the sum of both the numbers then
subtract the sum that is the b from a so
a is now swapped lastly subtract a from
the sum b so b is now also swapped
next we have the 31st question which
says print a fibonacci series using
recursion so for that we have a code
segment which can print a fibonacci
series on my screen right now so the
code on my screen can be used to print
the fibonacci series so basically what
are fibonacci numbers so the fibonacci
numbers are the numbers in the following
integer sequence 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 and
so on they can be calculated using the
mathematical formula used in the
fibonacci recursive function
the next question you'll be facing is
how do you find the factorial of an
integer
so we have the code segment on my screen
which can perform the factorial of an
integer operation so the factorial is a
function that multiplies a number by
every number below it for example
factorial of 5 is 5 into 4 into 3 into 2
into 1 which is equals to 120 so
recursive function multiplies the number
until it reaches 1.
the next one is how do you reverse a
linked list so for that we have the code
segment on my screen right away you can
please check it out and try it so if you
can find out if it can reverse a link
list or not so the steps to be done for
that are declare a linked list first
then add elements to that linked list
apply the descending iterator method to
the linked list and then they should
reverse the order of the elements in the
linked list
the 34th question is how do you
implement the binary search
so for that we have the code segment
right on my screen you can check that
out and the steps to be followed are
mentioned in the code segment so the
binary search divides the array into
half in every iteration step until it
finds the element
it works on sorted array since it
compares the values of adjacent elements
and then calculates the middle number if
the value of low becomes greater than
high
at any point it means the element is not
present in the list so this is how the
binary search basically works followed
by that we have the 35th question which
says find the second largest number in
the array so you can see we have a code
segment on my screen to find it out so
the steps to be followed are loop
through the array if the value of i is
greater than the highest store the value
of i in the highest and store the value
of highest in the second highest
variable
so now let's move ahead to the 36th
question
how do you remove all occurrences of a
given character from the input string so
we have a simple small code segment on
my screen right away so that code
segment can be used to remove all the
occurrences of a given character from an
input string so what you can do is use
the built in string method that is
replace to replace a character with any
other character including symbols and
white spaces
so followed by that we have our 37th
question so that is showcase inheritance
with the help of a program
so we have a small course limit on my
screen to showcase the one of the major
object-oriented programming
method that is inheritance
so the class cat inherits the property
color from class animal by extending the
parent class animal this way a class cat
can have more parent classes if it
wishes to inherit their properties as
well
so next question that is the 38th
question is explain overloading and
overriding with the help of a program
so this is a major question which is
asked many number of times most
frequently for the beginners and
sometimes even the experienced
candidates cannot escape this question
so first we'll discuss overloading when
a class has two or more methods with the
same name they are called as overloaded
methods so you can see a code segment on
the right side part of my screen right
away so this is an example for
overloading next we will discuss the
overriding
so next we will discuss the overriding
so when a superclass method is also
implemented in the child class then it's
a clear case of overriding so on the
right side part of my screen you can see
a code segment where a child class is
extending the base class method which is
print name
now followed by that we have the 39th
question
that is check if the given number is
prime or not
so you can see a code segment on my
screen which determines if the given
number is a prime number or not
so the steps to be followed to find if a
given number is prime or not r use if
statements to check for each condition
separately if the number is 0 or 1 it
cannot be prime if the number is 2 it is
prime if the number is
and finally the third condition you need
to take care of is if the number is
indivisible by other numbers then it is
prime so basically prime numbers are
divisible by 1 or itself if any other
number is capable to divide the number
then it is not a prime number
now the last question in the list is how
do you sum all the elements in an array
so for that we have a code segment right
on my screen
please check it and try to run it and
that's the best way to learn so the
steps to be followed are use the loop to
iterate through the array and keep
adding the elements in that array and
finally you will get the sum of the
elements in the area and you can just
print this thumb at the last
so with that as you prepare for your
upcoming job interview we hope these
coding questions have provided more
insight into what types of questions you
are likely to be asked
all right that brings us to the end of
this video tutorial on interview process
full course by simplylon i hope this
video was useful and interesting if you
have any queries please feel free to put
them in the comments section of the
video thank you for watching
