hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in today's session we
will be learning how to compare two
different columns in excel but before we
begin let me tell you guys that we have
daily updates on multiple technologies
so if you're a tech gig in a continuous
hunt for latest technological trends
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now comparing two different columns or
multiple columns happens to be an
important job when you're working in
data analytics as you have to come up
with some decisive decisions based on
the data
now if you had to do it manually then
you might end up taking hours or even
days based on the data set you're
working with but if i say that you can
do it within minutes then it would be
interesting to work with right now we'll
be doing the same now we'll work on a
sample data set right on my screen
so here we have column one and column
two now our job is to compare the column
one and column two and come up with the
result now the first and the simplest
way to do it is use the built-in
condition formatting which comes with
excel by default now all you have to do
is
select all the data
and navigate to home and in the home go
to styles group and select conditional
formatting
and in conditional formatting you can
see highlight cells
so in that you can use duplicate values
when you click on duplicate values a
small pop-up window will come on your
screen and here you have an option of
choosing whether duplicate or unique so
duplicate means you're comparing the
cells and you can see there are some
duplicate cells which are present in
column one are also present in column
two now you can also check how to uh you
know find out the unique values which
are only present in column one but not
in column two so you can just press
unique and there you go you can find it
now you can also try to you know change
the color by filling with green for the
unique columns and duplicate cells with
color red
now this was the first method and you
can also work out some different ones
like you can just directly
press equal to and select the cell and
equals to and the next cell
press enter and if there is a match it
will give you true if there is no match
then it will give you false now you can
drag it down and see which all are
matching and whichever or not
now you can also make some minute
modifications to this
so uh
if in case you didn't find the data then
you can say not found so for that uh you
can try if and inside brackets
and then
you can give the value as not found
if true it's found first you have to
give the true values so for true you can
write as found and in case if it's not
found then you can write it down as not
found
there you go close the bracket press
enter
and there you go if there is a perfect
match you will have found and if there
is no match then you'll get not found
now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to operator by
involving with f operator and apart from
those we also have another way to
compare two columns in excel so another
way is using the lookup functions so
we'll use a simple vlookup function to
compare both the cells
so for that let's type in equals to
vlookup
space and
select the cell you want to
check for and then
the
range of elements you want to
compare and then i'll press f4 to log
them
now
uh you want the data from column one
and now you want the exact match so zero
press enter
so there you go
so the elements which are present in
column one and column two are been
displayed here so but in case if the
elements are not found you'll get an
error so let's look at that simply drag
the
formula to all the cells and there you
go so the elements which are matching
will give you the proper result but the
ones which are not matching will give
you not applicable or error message this
can be fixed we can make some minor
tweaks to the same formula
so
we can add if error
comma
simply write in as not found
and close the bracket so that should do
so we have closed the bracket and press
enter there you go now simply drag this
and
soon you can see the data which is
having no match is shown as not found
now
uh there is another possibility okay
let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work
so uh we already have the formula so
let's erase that first
i'll erase the whole data
and even this one
yeah now we have the clear column four
so here you can see we have for india
and here you can see we have just four
and similarly here you have mahendra and
mahindra and here you have mahendra
right so in some situations you might
have to compare
two different columns
but the names might be a little
different right so for example
uh if you're working with oracle and if
you're working with oracle america and
you have in the first case is oracle and
then the second column is oracle america
then those are one and same but you have
some minor text changes right just like
here you have for india and here you
have four
so what if you had such kind of issues
so you can also make some minor tweaks
to it so using the same lookup formula
you can add equals to
vlookup
and
also the comparison cell which is this
one
and you're not you're not stopping there
you're trying to add
the wildcard here so the wildcard is
hashtag which means if there is anything
like
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that's what we are
going to do so after ending entering the
wildcard symbol you'll select the range
of columns which you have to
you know fetch the data from
and then
try to fix them using function key f4
you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and enter
now let's try to drag it
there you go
so you have the data mahindra and
mahindra
hyundai india honda india so that's how
you try to use uh comparing cells in
excel and if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session or if you need the data set
that we have used in this session then
