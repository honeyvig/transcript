hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to convert numbers to
words but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to convert numbers to
words
now here on my sheet you can see we have
some numbers that is ten dollars or ten
point two zero dollars twenty two
dollars fifty three point one two
dollars twelve dollars and hundred and
ten dollars now the task is to convert
these numbers into word format that is
representing the numbers alphabetically
right this might be a little curious and
we also might end up searching for a
predefined method which is not readily
available in excel but there is a way
where you can create a function using
excel vba or macros now again creating a
macro is completely complex now
identifying the trouble microsoft has
already come up with a readily available
macro code on their official website
which will support the various versions
of microsoft excel starting from
microsoft excel 365 to all the way up to
the older excel version that is 2010.
now you can scroll down and use this
particular macro function which
microsoft has readily made us available
and use this to create our own macro in
excel vba now let's get back to excel
and you can create a macro using the
developer option now developer options
will not be readily available in
microsoft excel to activate developer
option go to home and
go to the options menu in the last
and here go to customize ribbon and here
in the second drop down menu you can see
developer option by default it will not
be checked click on the check option to
activate developer options and press ok
now you have your developer options
ready click on developer options click
on visual basic and here to insert a new
macro click on the insert button click
on module and a new
macro window is readily available for
you now ctrl v to paste your code and
your function is with the name
number to text right now close the macro
and here your function will be readily
available
equals to and the function name was
number
to text press tab to select the function
and select the cell where you have the
data close the function press enter now
drag the same formula across all the
cells
and here you have the text converted
from numbers so here we have ten dollars
twenty cents and you have ten dollars
twenty cents twenty two dollars and no
cents fifty three dollars and twelve
cents twelve dollars and no sense and
hundred and ten dollars with no sense
now that's how you can convert numbers
to words using the macro which is
predefined for excel in the microsoft
website now with that we have come to an
end of this session on how to convert
numbers to words if you have any queries
