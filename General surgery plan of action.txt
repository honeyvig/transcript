hi winners
this is dr srikanth from team mds
conquer
now i'm going to give a brief idea of
how you need to handle
how you need to approach and how you
need to finish and focus
general surgery so hope you remember
this particular subject in your
third year okay among the list along
with
oral path and general medicine
so general surgery according to the need
blueprint is going to carry somewhere
around a score
of 14 marks
and it has a decent weight is in the
ames and pga
and gypma2 so the regular approach is
even if you have a look over into the
recent need that is 2020
a trend setting or a modified paper or a
modified approach made
most of your general surgery questions
excluding few topics
were a questions of your oral surgery
means you cannot differentiate
a question of general surgery from oral
surgery because ludwig's angina
is a common topic for both of this and
similarly there are many other space
infections which are common for both of
these cover
sinus thrombosis will be discussed in
both the subjects
and most of the trauma cases will be
discussed in both the cases
fluid replacement most of the things
will be discussed in both
so you cannot differentiate a question
of a general surgery like
a few questions of general surgery from
the oral surgery
so taking this into consideration i have
divided the subjects
exclusively the subtopics exclusive to
that of the
general surgery so going into my
schedule okay first i want to describe
the topics
okay so i have differentiated the topics
into red blue and green
okay so green topics are the topics
which are
not only specific to general surgery for
example if you take the diseases of
salivary glands
and the infections topic okay these are
common for both your oral path oral
medicine
general path general medicine everywhere
you see the diseases of salivary glands
and infections even it is common for
your oral surgery also
and same goes with the wound healing and
repair okay these are common things for
your
general pathology these are common
things that you encounter in your oral
surgery also
okay so these things are common for most
of the subjects okay common and these
are important topics too
and coming to the red topics which are
exclusively for your general surgery
means
diseases of thyroid maybe you may learn
about the symptoms
in general medicine but the surgical
aspects or the carcinomas of thyroid
gland which is the most commonly asked
question for you in the general surgery
will be exclusively
to your general surgery and similarly
you have topics like
cysts ulcers swellings of head and neck
apart from the oral cavity what we
discuss in your general
in your oral medicine and oral path
there are many other cysts which move
around head and neck which has to be
covered here which is an important topic
to be
focused on this is a flaring seesaw
[ __ ] and pharynx of course they are a
part of your general medicine but
surgical aspect will be learned in
general surgery
and your venous and arterial diseases
all these are a part exclusive to that
of
your general surgery whereas coming to
the topics like this
uh transfusion reactions shock
hemorrhage
burns fluid electrolyte replacement
nutrition replacements
are common topics for your general
medicine tracheostomy is a common topic
uh which we encounter in
uh the emergency things so the most
focused thing
in the general ah surgery uh
uh if you take into consideration into
the need or
the aims okay most of your
most of your diagram based questions
will move around general surgery
exclusively apart from
including general medicine your tubes or
most
they regularly ask about the tubes
suturing techniques
okay they ask you uh about the knots and
all these are
uh mostly related to uh general surgery
in comparison to
subjects like your oral surgery and the
perium
okay most of the surgical stuff will be
asked from
a general surgery point of view so this
is a brief
distinguished topic that you need to
cover from general surgery
okay so i have given somewhere around 12
days for your preparation
which is more than sufficient to focus
mainly on the important topics in
general surgery so i've given two days
for you to cover uh the diseases of
thyroid parathyroid eternal
one day for the salivary glands and
infections followed by one day for
transfusion shock and all this stuff
followed by one more day to cover
tracheostomy and wound healing and
repair
two days for cis ulcers swellings of
head and neck one day for diseases of
larynx and pharynx and esophagus one day
for
a b diseases disorders and followed by
two days for your revision and
image-based stuff and followed by 20th
is going to be your exam
so this is plan of action
to handle your general surgery the books
to be followed
the things to be done where to be done
how to be done in how much time to be
done
and you will have examination this
particular i want everyone to prepare
this particular
table and stick on uh to your
room okay where you're preparing or you
can stick on these to the first place
of your notes before you start general
surgery i want everyone to drop your
scores because we'll have
i'm planning to keep every exam every
day you'll have an exam
okay so once you're done with 9th and
10th on 11th
morning before you start this particular
topic you need to finish the exam and
you need to drop this code
okay how much for example if it is 25
marks
how much is for 25 max so i want this
analysis that everyone has to including
your final exam that is the grand exam
on general surgery analysis also
okay so uh once you're done with this
once you're done with this this should
be on the first phase of your
preparation of general surgery notes or
anything and on the last page before you
end
with an exam because the last one is the
exam on 20th
once you're done with the exam i want
everyone to write about the review of
your preparation
of general surgery like what topics you
have done what topics you are good at
what topics you are bad at what topics
which are not
done what is your score why you got a
bad score what is the reason behind your
bad score or what is your
reason behind the questions where you
lost and everything has to be
written by you so that once you are
coming back to general surgery again for
revision
that review is going to give an idea
that where you are weak at
and you can focus on such things okay so
the review is
must for every subject once you're done
once you're done with a particular
subject
make a note once you're done with the
grand exam write about the review
your personal analysis over your
preparation
relevant to that particular subject so
this is going to give some
sort of hint that where you need to
focus when you're starting with this
subject
again in the second are third rounds of
revision
okay hope this video is informative and
give
some modifications in your preparation
pattern
to focus you more on the
on your preparation and how to improve
your scores and everything are
all these are microscopic things that
you have to focus on okay
reading writing giving an exam is one
level
but once you are in the competition zone
you need to be
first among the list okay so if you want
to be fast you need to have a
microscopic analysis like this
micro analysis like where i am losing
where i am hitting wrong
so you need to focus in this particular
way
so apart from this we are planning to
have multiple
case-based discussions okay so
case-based discussions are
like connecting the stuff to one another
means you are going to connect one
question on a particular uh disorder
in a particular system to the other
question
in in the case based question for
example if i am talking about ludwig's
angina
so this tumor is also called as this
tumor is most commonly
due to the infection of which are the
following organisms which causes
infection how the patient will look
clinically a diagram based question what
are the emergency procedures that you
are going to do
what is the antibiotic prophylaxis that
you are going to do what are the
emergency
precautions that you are going to take
all these are uh connected questions
like
related to ludwig's angina and if you
convert all this information into one
question that is called as case based
question means
multiple single liners or a multiple uh
open-end questions will be covered
in a case-based connective question so
uh if you
open you if you have a look over into
the recent neet okay that is two zero
two zero most of the things are like
case-based questions may they connected
to one another
so if you read or approach and if you do
the things in case based approach it
will be easy for you to return for
longer duration of time
and it will be easy for you to handle in
the examination hall
