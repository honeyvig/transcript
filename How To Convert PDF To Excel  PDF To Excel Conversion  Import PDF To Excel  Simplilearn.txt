hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
learn how to convert pdf data format
into excel data format
now let us imagine that you are provided
with a huge pdf document and that pdf
document consists the tabular data and
your manager asks you to copy all that
data of pdf into an excel sheet now
let's imagine that that pdf has 100
rules so even 100 rules can be copied
from pdf to excel but what if there were
1000 rows it would be a little
complicated right so today we will learn
how to extract data from pdf format to
excel within just a few steps now let us
begin with our one point agenda that is
convert pdf into excel
now to do this let's get back to the
practical mode and try to convert some
pdf data into excel
now you can see the pdf document which i
am looking to convert from pdf to excel
so this particular pdf document has a
table
so this is the statewide gst collections
that happened during march of 2020.
now we need to convert this tabular data
from pdf format to excel format
now we are on the microsoft excel now to
initiate the process we might want to
choose a blank workbook for this
so now we are at the blank workbook and
the complete sheet is empty
now let's go into the data option in the
toolbar
and in the data option of the toolbar
we have
the ribbon of get and transform data in
this ribbon you can see get data option
select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from other sources etc
now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a drop
down and in that drop down you might
want to select the pdf if you have a
json file you can also choose from a
json and if you have the data from xml
you can choose that and even you can
extract the data from text or csv as
well
now we need the pdf option so select the
pdf
now navigate where your file is existing
so my file is on the desktop and now let
me select the pdf document
select import
now excel will automatically analyze the
tabular data in the pdf format and give
you the results
now according to excel there are
multiple tabular formats
table 1 table 2 so basically this table
is one in the same so all the 29 states
are fixed in
one table itself but since the pdf is
divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table 1 table
2 and there are few more tables which
excel is assuming that it might be table
but it's not and another table which is
page number zero zero two it has a table
and another one is right here
now there is an option of selecting all
the tables all together at once or you
can select only one table which you want
to select
so if you select multiple items excel
will automatically give you an option of
choosing your tables you can just tick
and select the tables you want
or
you can directly select the table you
want on your excel sheet
so right now let's try to select
multiple tables
so i'll be selecting one two four and
five and this particular one is not a
table so i'm eliminating that
now you might want to choose the load
option
so excel is now loading the data
now all the data has been successfully
loaded
now
yeah it is giving us a notification that
all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load 2
and here
select table option and if you want the
data to be
you know loaded to a new worksheet you
can choose that and select ok
now you can see all the data is being
successfully loaded in the form of
tabular format in the new excel sheet
similarly let's try to load another page
in the table format
new worksheet
select ok
and the third sheet
now get ready to impress your boss by
converting all the pdf data into excel
sheet just in a matter of few seconds
with few steps
and there you go all the four tables
have been loaded successfully in the
form of excel in just a few steps now
this is how you convert pdf to excel
