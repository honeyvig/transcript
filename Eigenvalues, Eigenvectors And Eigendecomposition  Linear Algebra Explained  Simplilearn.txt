Welcome to our video on the essential
Concepts in linear algebra like IUN
values IUN vectors and IUN decomposition
by simple learn these are key topics in
linear algebra with vast applications in
various scientific and machine learning
Fields I values and I vectors help us
understand Matrix Transformations an
igen Vector of a matrix points in a
direction that remains unchanged when
the Matrix is a applied and its IGN
value indicates how much it is stretched
or compressed end DEC composition breaks
a matrix into its IGN values and I
vectors simplifying complex operations
and providing deep insights into the
matrix's structure this technique is
crucial in areas like quantum mechanics

started learning objectives I gun values
I gun vectors and I gun
decomposition in this session we're
going to Define I gun values and I gun
vectors describe IUN values of a square
Matrix list the properties of I gun
values and illustrate the I gun
decomposition IUN
values igen values definition Idan
values are a concept in linear algebra
it is mostly used in Matrix equation the
term Ian in German implies appropriate
or
characteristic other names for the
concept of an Iden value include
characteristic value characteristic root
appropriate value or latent root ien
values are the special set of scalars
associated with the system of linear
equations in simple words the Iden value
is a scalar that is used to transform
the Iden
Vector the basic equation reads as AV
equal 2 Lambda V the the number or
scalar value Lambda is the IUN value of
a an i gun VOR in mathematics relates to
the real nonzero igen values that point
in direction that the transformation
stretches the igen value is regarded as
a factor by which Iden Vector is
stretched there is an IUN value for
every real Matrix the presence of the
IUN value for any complex matrices is
equivalent to the fundamental theorem of
algebra igen
vectors what are igen vectors igen
vectors are nonzero special vectors that
do not change the direction in brief if
a is a linear transformation from a
vector space V and X is a nonzero Vector
in
V then V is is an aen Vector of a if a
of X is a scalar multiple of vector X an
igen space of vector X is made up of all
igen vectors that have the same igen
value as a zero Vector the vector zero
is not an igen
Vector if a is a n cross and Matrix and
Lambda is an Iden value of Matrix a then
x a non-zero Vector is igen Vector
if it satisfies the expression of ax
equal to Lambda X where X indicates an
Iden Vector of a referring to the igen
value Lambda there could be many igen
vectors associated with a single igen
value and the igen vectors are directly
dependent on separate igen
values aen values offer Square Matrix if
a that is an in Cross N is a square
Matrix then a minus Lambda I is referred
to as an igen or a characteristic
Matrix and is an indeterminate scaler
here I stands for an identity
Matrix The igen Matrix determinant and
igen equation can be expressed as
absolute value of a minus Lambda I or a
minus Lambda I equals to
zero properties of En values igen
vectors with distinct even values are
linearly independent singular matrices
have zero ien values if a is a square
Matrix then Lambda equals to zero is not
one of its Egan values for a matrice
scalar multiple if a is a squared Matrix
and Lambda is one of its Ain
value then a Lambda is an Iden value of
AA if a is a square Matrix and Lambda is
one of its even values
and N is greater than zero is an integer
than Lambda to the power n is one of a
n's igen
value if a is a square Matrix and P of X
is a polom and variable X then P of
Lambda is the Iden value of the Matrix B
of A the Iden value of inverse of a is
inverse of Lambda if the Iden value of
the square Matrix a is Lambda
and if the square Matrix a has the igen
value Lambda then the igen value of
transpose of a is Lambda effect of aan
vectors and aen values let's consider an
example The Matrix a has two orthonormal
igen vectors V1 and V2 which have igen
values of Lambda 1 and Lambda 2
respectively now we plot the set of all
unit vectors U belonging to the set of
real numbers as a unit circle
represented in blue in this
plot now we plot the set of all points
of Matrix ad do the unit Vector
U by observing the way that Matrix a
distorts the unit
circle we can see that it scales the
space and Direction V by Lambda I for
example in this case in the direction
View V1 the space has been scaled by
Lambda 1 and in the direction of V2 by
Lambda 2 iGun
decomposition igen decomposition is
factorization of Matrix into its
canonical form which represents a matrix
in terms of Iden values and Iden vectors
Matrix decompositions are handy for
breaking down a matrix into its
constituent parts to simplify a variety
of more complex
operations this decomposition is also
utilized in machine learning approaches
such as principal component analysis or
PCA suppose that a matrix a has an
linearly independent I gun vectors as V1
V2 V3 so on till we n which can be
represented by a matrix V where each
column represents individual igen vector
and associate even values as Lambda 1
Lambda 2 to Lambda n represented by a
vector then the IUN decomposition of a
can be represented as a equals to V
diagonal of Lambda multip 2 inverse of
Wii geometric interpretation of aen
decomposition consider this image where
U is an orthonormal Matrix U is the
rotation of Matrix U and and Lambda is
the diagonal
matrix the unit Vector U is rotated and
transformed into
UT UT is then scaled up by Lambda the
diagonal
matrix and finally the scale up you
transpose is rotated back to
you the scaling of UT happens in each
Direction by
Lambda however the orth Al Matrix U is
what determines in which directions the
scaling is going to
happen similarity transformation rotates
the original coordinate system into an
aen Vector coordinate
system and explains how the Matrix of
even vectors leads to diagonalization of
Matrix a leaving the IUN values of a on
the
diagonal this can be expressed as AAL to
Q lamb Q inverse
key
takeaways igen values are the special
set of scalar vectors that are
associated with the system of linear
equation the existence of the igen value
for any complex matrices is equal to the
fundamental theorem of algebra Iden
vectors are the special vectors nonzero
that don't change the direction when any
linear transformation is applied Iden
vectors with distinct even values are
linear ly independent I values of a
triangle Matrix and diagonal matrix are
identical to the components on the
principal diagonals thank
