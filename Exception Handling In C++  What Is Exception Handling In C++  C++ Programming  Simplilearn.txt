hello everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn
in this session we will discuss an
interesting topic that is exception
handling in c plus
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we will be covering today
so we will start with what are
exceptions
then why do we need exception handling
in c plus
and what
exception handling is
then we will understand exception
handling keywords that is try catch and
throw
and we will understand each keyword in
detail
first we will start with what are
exceptions
exceptions are the unexpected events or
the situations that arise during the
smooth execution of the program
so there are times during the run time
when some errors or situations arises
which create issues in the program
these issues are called exceptions
for example let us suppose we want to
divide two numbers one is seven and
other one is 0.
now if we divide 7 with 0 it will show
an error because we cannot divide any
number by 0 because it is undefined
so exception handling provides a way to
take care of problems like these
so now let's learn about exception
handling but before that we must
understand why we need exception
handling
so why do we need exception handling in
c plus
one of its reason includes handling the
exceptions that arise during the
execution of the program
along with that exception handling
provides a mechanism through which we
can handle the error generating part
separately from the rest of the code
exception handling provides information
to the user about the problem so that he
or she can detect the mistake and
correct it
now let's go ahead and understand what
exception handling is
as we have discussed exception handling
helps in dealing or handling the
exceptions that disrupts the flow of
execution of a program
so how does it deal with the exception
so when an exception is encountered it
transfers the control from one part of
the program to the other known as
handlers
and makes the code more readable and
maintainable
and takes care of the exception by
providing certain code
these exceptions are handled with the
help of exception handling keywords
now let's understand these exceptional
handling keywords
so there are three exception handling
keywords named try catch and throw
as we can see in the example first there
is try block then followed by three
catch blocks
and each catch block contains the name
of the exception
the try block can have more than one
catch block
inside the try block those statements
are enclosed which may cause the
exception
or we can say in this block that
particular code is kept which will throw
the exception
each try block is followed by one or
more than one catch block
the try block throws an exception which
is caught by the catch block
taking care or handling the exception is
the actual job of catch block
this block catches the exception thrown
from the try block
inside the catch block a message or some
code is written to handle the exception
it can be a message for the user or a
default code for a particular condition
both the try block and catch block work
together and every try block has at
least one catch block for it
now next is throw keyword
whenever an exception is encountered it
helps in throwing the exception
it is used to throw an exception and its
value to the consecutive exception
handler
so as we have discussed this topic
theoretically now let's go ahead and do
its practical implementation in our code
editor that is vs code
so this is our code editor here we will
do an example in which
we will make sure a person who is less
than 24 years of age
is not allowed to drink in the club
so we will create an exception that part
and with the help of try catch and throw
blocks we will handle those exceptions
all right so first of all we'll create a
new file
and let's name it
as
exception
one dot cpp
all right now we'll start with the
header files that is hash include
iostream
now the namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
and inside the main function first of
all we will declare
a variable named h so
write int age
equals to let's assign it as 20
so this person is 20 years of age and
now we will create the try block
so inside this try block
we will write an if condition that is if
the age of the person
is greater than equal to 24
then only he is allowed to drink
so inside this we will
print a message saying that
you have
the excess to drink the alcohol
all right
so after this
inside the else block
all we need to do is to throw
and the exception that is if the age of
the person is not greater than 24 that
is age is less than 24
so in that condition
or in that situation we will throw the
exception
that is will throw age
to the catch block
and for that we have to create the catch
block
the catch block
will
catch the exception that is age as you
can see
now
inside this catch block
first of all we will write a message
we'll write
you'll write you don't have the access
to drink alcohol
you don't have
because your age
is less than 24
all right
so after this after this message
we will print the age of the person
so we'll write
your age is
so and so
and then the variable h
now after that we will write return zero
so in this example as you can see the
percentage is 20 as we have assigned and
inside the try block we have set a
condition that if the age of person is
greater than 24
greater than equal to 24
then
he or she have the access to drink the
alcohol
and if not
if his or her age is not
greater than 24
then will throw the exception
and
the cash block with cashed exception and
will print this message that you don't
have the access to drink alcohol because
your rage is less than 24
and then
his age will be printed
so now let's try to run this i hope it
works
as you can see you don't have the access
to drink alcohol because your age is
less than 24 and your age is 20
and now let's try to if we assign
let's say
25
the program is working fine but we want
to check the other condition as well
okay so it is happening because we
forgot to save this 25
as we have now saved it now let's try to
run this
as you can see you have the access to
drink alcohol because now our age is 25
so this is how
exception handling works this try block
inside this drive lock we kept those
code or statements which will throw the
exception
and then
it is thrown with the help of this throw
keyword and then the catch block solves
or prints a message
in with respect to that exception
so now let's do another example
so let's create a new file
and name it let's say
exception
2 dot cpp
all right so here we will do an example
in which we will try to divide a number
by zero
and as we know that we cannot divide a
number by zero
so it will throw an exception
so let's do this example
so first of all
our hash include iostream the header
file
then the name space standard
now inside the main function
you will create three variables
mean
so inside the main function we will
create three variables
one is for the numerator then
denominator and then in which we will
store the output that is the output
variable so let's name numerator as num
and denominator as d num
because it is sounding familiar then
we will store the output in the output
variable
all right
so we have created three variables num
denum and output
now
first of all here we will display a
message to enter the numerator and
denominators
so we'll write
please enter
the numbers
to do the division
all right
after that end l
now we'll take the input
c in num and
c in
d num
so the numerator and denominator we have
taken the input from the user
now after that we'll make the try block
so inside this try block
we will create an if condition
and we'll write if dnum that is the
denominator
is equal to 0 if it is equal to 0
then
we will throw the exception
and
the exception would be denom
because denominator cannot be zero
and
if the dname is not zero then in else
condition we will simply
divide
output equals to
num
divided by
d num
all right
so now after this we have to create the
catch block also
because we have thrown the exception now
we want the catch to catch the exception
so
we can write
d for dinum here
now
we'll print a message saying that you
cannot enter 0 in the denominator
so we'll write
you cannot
enter
0
in denominator
while
doing
the division
operation
all right now after that we'll use ndl
so this is our catch block
after this catch block we will again
write a message
that
the output of the division is that is
if
the denominator is not 0 then we have to
print that result so for that we will
do
this
the output
after the division is
and here we will
write the variable output
so this
will print the result of
this one where the denominator is not
zero
so
after that we can write return zero
so there is one extra bracket as you can
see
of try block
all right now it's done we can save this
one and let's try to run this
but before running this one let's go
through this code
that first of all we have declared these
three variables then we ask the user to
enter the
numerator and denominator
so then we have used this try block and
inside the tri block we have set the
condition that if denominator is 0 then
we will throw the exception
and if it is not then we'll simply
divide both of the numerator and
denominator
so the
denominator which is thrown is called by
this catch block
this and it will display a message that
you cannot enter 0 in the denominator
while doing the division operation
because it is undefined
and if the denominator is not 0 then it
will simply print the message
and the output
so now let's try to run this
so as you can see please enter the
numbers to do the division
so let's say the first number is eight
and second number is
zero that is denominator is zero
then you cannot enter zero in the
denominator while doing the division
operation the output after division is 0
so it will show this output only and
our output is correct now let's try to
run this and do the simple division
operation in which the denominator is
not zero
so let's say now again we'll write 8 and
the denominator would be 2
then as we can see the output after the
division is 4
so
our
code is correct and our output is also
correct so this is how
we can do the exception handling and
handle the exceptions using this try
catch and throw blocks
