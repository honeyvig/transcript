simpl YouTube channel today we have an
exciting and insightful comparison lined
up for you as we dive into the world of
AI language models so in this video we
will be exploring two of the most advanc
and talked about AI models CLA 3 and gp4
as artificial intelligence continues to
evolve these models have become piral in
various application from content
creation and customer service to complex
problem solving and Beyond so Cloud 3
known for its innovative approach and
unique feature Cloud 3 op is the latest
saturation in the cloud series while
chat gp4 developed by open AI has been
making waves with its powerful
capabilities and impressive performance
so we will be examining their natural
language understanding generation
quality and how they handle their
different task so additionally we will
discuss their strength and weakness

understanding of how claw 3 and gp4
differ and which one might be the best
fit for you and for your specific needs
so sit back relax and join us as we
explore the fascinating world of AI
language models craving a career care
upgrade subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to Fast Track Your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so before we jump into the demo
here is a quick info for you if you want
to learn a anml then try simply as post
graduate program in Ai and machine
learning from P University in
collaboration with IBM this Cod teaches
in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP compter
Vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat dup and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box and
pin command so without any further Ado
let's get started so this is open AI
platform so here you can read about chat
GPT apis about the chat GPT apis okay so
this is the original documentation of
the chat gbt 4 and here you can see the
anthropic so Claud is developed by
anthropic company so CLA is a family so
here you can see so this CLA family have
two three version CLA 3.5 opas CLA 3.5
Sonet and 3.5 hi okay and this is coming
soon as you can
see okay so here you
can learn about all the families of CLA
3 like we in ch gbt we have Chad gbt 3.5
ch gb4 ch 4 okay and CH 4 is a premium
version so here also opas and hiu is a
premier version okay so these you can
learn about the apis of these three I
repeat so here you can learn about the
apis of the particular Opus family okay
so now let's jump
into this so here what we are doing we
are just comparing clot 3.5 son not to
chat gb4 okay so here you can see chat
GPT 40 gb4 and gbt 3.5 okay so what here
I will do I will give some prompts to
chat gb4 and the same prompt to CLA 3.5
okay so now so after that we will check
which model is giving the information
fast or you can say who is break
breaking down the information in a good
proper manner okay so there are four to
five category I selected okay in this
first category is factual inquiries then
complex scientific and Technical prompts
and creative writing then we'll ask some
mathematical and complex logical queries
or we can ask some data analysis
question and some generating Imaging
questions like this okay so after that
we will give give some prompt and check
which model is giving the Fast and the
accurate answer okay so here the first
category is the factual inquiries so
here I will write share some
interesting facts
about the
Great Wall of
China
okay okay so here as you can see here
are some interesting facts about the
Great of China like this this this this
okay so and the last it is saying would
you like me to elaborate on any these
points or share more facts okay so you
can ask the particular point to be more
elaborate so same we will copy here copy
this and paste it
here okay then enter
okay so here you can
see Chad GPT is giving long
answer as compared to the CLA 3 okay
just see first what chat GPT does chat
GPT explains what is great
all I repeat what is Great Wall of China
okay so Great Wall of China is the most
iconic landmarks in the world rich and
historical significance and this this
this and after that it wrote here are
some interesting facts about the monom
structure so in this CLA you can check
it is
directly giving some interesting facts
okay so here I can see okay I can vote
for the charge basically okay now let's
move to our second category which is
complex scientific and the technical
problems okay so here first I will write
here describe
the
process of
nuclear
fusion and
it's po
potential
benefits
over nuclear
fusion okay present
Center
okay so even I don't know the process of
nuclear fusion okay just I write because
I want to make the prompt more complex
so that that's why I write the nuclear
fusion and all okay so same we will copy
here okay so now if we will see okay
first is it telling the process then
benefits of nuclear
Vision okay it's writing
more okay the pro maybe the the process
is like long I don't know and here it is
giving some
drawbacks okay first benefits then
drawbacks okay now that after that the
summary P okay so here as you can see
okay what CLA 3 gave is like I believe
there may be small error in your
question you asked about the benefits of
nuclear fusion over nuclear
fusion okay which is the same process I
think you meant to ask about the
benefits of nuclear fusion over nuclear
fusion so I will explain nuclear fusion
and compare it to nuclear fusion oh
nice here what CH GPT does it
automatically took that process okay it
is also telling the same thing nice then
nuclear fusion the process then
benefit
okay so CLA 3 gave only the benefit and
but the chat GPT gave the
uh drawbacks as well which is a good
thing okay and in
chbt that process is not properly
displayed but in CLA 3 the properly is
displayed by the step by step okay which
is again a good thing so now let's jump
into our next prompt or category you can
see which is the creative writing so
here I will like compose a
short
story
about a
time
time
traveler
traveler
visiting
ancient
Egypt okay I will copy this for the CH
as
well okay Egypt
okay the same I will paste it
here so claw 3 is giving here is a short
story about time traveler visiting
in so the eke keepers Gambit okay Dr
Amelia Frost justed her chromometer has
a swolling Vortex sped around her
means uh CLA 3 is using you can say you
know uh heavy English
and okay it's a good story I get the
sand of time first of all CH gave the
title as the sand of time so in the year
22492 time travel had just breed the
bounds of the theortical signs and moved
on to the Practical okay
nice we still writing okay and it's a
small
story does in the simple line and robes
okay I think here also I like the you
know story of Chad gp4 as compared to
CLA because it's hard to you know read
and understand you can say see some the
word gesticulating and this okay and
here Char is using easy
words okay so now let's move to the our
next category which is complex
mathematical and logical queries so here
I will write
prove
the
Pythagorean theorem
and
explain each
step
okay okay so let me copy this and paste
it here as
well okay so first will tell what is
Pythagoras Theorem okay the fundamental
relation in equan Geometry among the
three sides of right triangle it is
state that this this this then the proof
rearrangement method okay first it will
construct the right triangle then four
copies of the triangle arrange into a
square then this then this then this
okay so here what it does certainly I
will prove the Pythagorean theorem and
explain each step theem okay it also
good
abc okay a square + b² = to
c² okay so here clot 3 is giving more
perfect answer as compared to CH gbt
because I can't understand why is
arranging into a square and internal
square
formation so here see simple simply
explain that a side lbel opposite
triangle a b c
okay simple and making I think chgb is
making it more complex okay rather than
Cloud 3 so here I can give V to Cloud 3
okay so now we will do some category
data analysis so first I will upload
some
data okay then here I will write
determine the most
profitable
quarter for ABC
company and
forecast
potential sales
for the next
year
based on
historical
historical data okay
from this data okay first I will copy
this see to determine the pro okay first
I will do it here
also upload from
computer okay so first we will check to
find the most profit C I will calculate
the average sales for each quarter
across all the years okay if you guys
want to
see the data let me open for you okay so
this is the
data okay this is the ABC company sales
data okay so this data also I have
generated from the
same right okay so
forecast
okay so now it's calculating so we will
see whether our answers are same or not
okay so here you can see the most
profitable quarter for ABC company is Q4
as for the cloud 3 okay we will check
the most profit cter for the ABC sarter
4 okay for the same with an average
sales of figures of
$194,000 here it is showing
$192,000 in sale okay we'll check later
so looking forward the full company next
year assuming the continuation of of
content Trend approximately 3 lakh 63
655,000
okay here we will check it is giving us
okay based on hisory we can forecast
potential shes for 2024 okay it's giving
the different facts so even I don't know
which is the right facts or not okay but
as you can see the most profitable
quarter for the ABC company based on the
average sales data is Q4
okay the figures are different maybe but
the profitable quarter for the ABC
company is the same Q4 so now moving
forward let's do uh next category like
solving philosophical and ethical
problems okay so I will write is it
ever ethical to
lie
discuss with
examples okay here I will write the
same
okay so it is saying the question
whether this ethical to is a complex one
that has been deated by philosopher aist
and culture theorist or the centuries
okay so
it's it's giving you some few examples
to consider
okay but about CLA three CLA the ethics
of flying is a complex and nuance topic
that philosopher has deated for a
century so
means they are giving me the same
answers but in the different format okay
they are taking different different
examples okay first CLA is explaining
first and then ex taking example but
here as you can see in chat gb4 it
taking the particular situation and
giving it the example from protecting
someone from harm privacy concern
example third example is preventing
unnecessary Ty fourth example is this
fifth example is negotiation strategy
after that discussion this this this a
conclusion so I can see Char is giving
me more you know structured way I can
see so I can give vot to char4 here okay
so now let's generate some
images so I will write here create so
this is our next category generating
images create a
visual
representation of a
futuristic
city
with sustainable or with flying
cars flying cards okay
so first I will copy it and I will paste
it
here okay gp4 is generating
image okay so here you can see I
apologize but I'm not able to create
generate IIT manipulate of product
images I can okay
okay so here you can see maybe CLA 3.5
Sonet won't generate image maybe you
have to subscribe okay so here as you
can see you can create a visual
representation of a futuristic city with
flying cars so here as you can see again
CL three have a drawback it can't
generate the images but chat GT4 can
generate images
okay and even you can download this
image yeah so now last
category
we can give me
explain the code
from the example from the photo sorry
photo
here
explain the code from the
picture
okay so here you can see the code of the
image simple Java program designed to
REM of a number entered by the user is
even or odd right exactly you can see
the picture even or odd program okay so
here you can see it is explaining line
by line here
gbd4 and uh okay okay the answer is
right but
explaining method is wrong not exactly
wrong but it's difficult to understand I
guess the program enter number okay okay
blah blah blah blah blah this but chity
is giving a proper line by line EXP
explanation okay I can say in my
perception the Chad gbt 4 is far better
than Chad gbt 3.5 Sonet but in future we
will compare pro version with pro
version means Claude Hau versus chgb 40
or maybe 5 income up coming years so
