welcome to Simply launch YouTube channel
in this session we will have a quick
coding interview preparation but before
we begin let me tell you guys that we
have daily updates on multiple
Technologies if you're a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn now in this
coding interview preparation we will be
covering all the important questions for
a software developer and all those most
frequently asked questions from the
coding perspective and followed by that
we will also be covering the most
important and Powerful programming
language based interview questions that
include the python interview questions
Java interview questions and also the
most fundamental and important C
programming interview questions now
without further Ado let's get started
with a coding interview preparation go
to our training experts it's no secret
that all of us get anxious before giving
an interview
however your confidence boosts up when
you prepare for the interview well even
the smartest job Seeker needs to prepare
well so here we are to help you with
that apart from your technical questions
many questions are asked which can make
or break your future these questions
might seem easy but they are not and the
answer to this can be tricky and do more
harm than good so the better prepared
you are the more successful your
interview will be this video will help
you understand what an interviewer is
looking for in your answers teach you to
answer interview questions and convince
the hiring manager that you are a good
fit for the job so first and foremost
before you step into the interview make
sure that you have carried out good
research about the company this will
help you get an insight into what the
company is all about and helps you
answer better doing your research
beforehand will also make a much better
impression on the hiring manager you can
start by visiting the company's website
have a look at their service mission
statement and the company's culture he
can also glance through the company's
social media accounts Additionally you
could also use Google News to stay
updated with the company's current
situation the next point is to keep in
mind to ensure that your skills are
aligned with a job description it would
be good if you understand what the
employer is looking for think about
examples from your work history and
match them with the requirements this
will make it simpler for the employer to
understand that you are a good fit for
the applied job role if in case you lack
any of the required skills you can
mention that you are working on it and
in no time you will Master it on the day
of the interview make sure that you are
dressed professionally be comfortable in
your attire and it is advised that you
look at the company's dress code
policies you can also choose a
professional outfit like business casual
foremost and a comfortable pair of
formal Footwear you need to look
presentable our next tip is to have good
body language body language is also
another way of communication when you
walk into the interview room confidently
greet with a firm handshake and eye
contact while you take a seat keep in
mind to sit up straight you must have
good posture and not slouch speaking of
gestures try not to touch your face too
much avoid a tense impression with your
hands and keep your hands on your lap or
the table hands on the table and a
gentle lead will emphasize that you are
listening carefully your body language
should be very respectful be aware of
your movements and stay calm through the
course of the interview now let me brief
you on answering a few of the most
frequently questions in an interview
number one tell me about yourself this
question is asked to gauge your
confidence and communication skills here
you can speak about education experience
and hobbies make sure to have a concise
answer and answer with enthusiasm two
what are your strengths and weaknesses
through this answer the interviewer
wishes to see how positive you think
about yourself and if you can identify
your weaknesses
speaking about your strengths there's no
right or wrong it can be about your
flexibility your attention to detail and
so on however speaking about your
weaknesses you don't have to be hard on
yourself you can reply with an answer
like your attention to detail trade can
sometimes meet a disadvantage and you
tend to spend more time this way your
weakness still has a positive side three
where do you see yourself in the next
five years this question can be a little
tricky through this question the
interviewer is analyzing your commitment
to the company an ideal answer to this
would be to tell how you wish to be a
significantly higher position in the
future and learn new things
four why should we hire you when
answering this question do not speak
about how good your academics are
instead speak about how eager you are to
learn and hence the opportunity would be
a good one to show your Zeal you can
also touch upon a few qualities that
they have that will be highly beneficial
for this job you can also list a few
positive impacts you have made in the
previous organization and how you can
bring those here five finally the
interviewer might conclude by asking you
if you have any questions for them
always make sure to ask good and
relevant questions this displays the
seriousness you have towards the job ask
questions regarding opportunities for
your professional development in the
particular job role it is important to
know that this is for your personal
growth based on this you can decide if
that particular job is a good choice for
your career or not these were a few of
the commonly asked questions in an
interview whenever you're asked the
question it is good to pause and think
about it before responding make sure
your answers are concise to the point
and honest if there comes using question
do not hesitate to ask more
clarification given the current scenario
with the ongoing pandemic covid-19
everything is digital that applies to
interviews as well many companies are
currently taking virtual interviews for
hiring purposes a virtual interview
takes place remotely over video
conferences in addition to the already
discussed tips let's have a look at a
few more tips that can help you carry
out your virtual interview smoothly
firstly have a good internet connection
which can facilitate video conferences
it is advised that you are familiar with
the platform on which that interview is
carried out like Zoom Microsoft teams
Etc by doing so you won't have to be
worried about the platform's
technicalities on the day of the
interview itself next make sure that you
are seated in a quiet place eliminate
any potential interruptions on your end
before the interview have a good set of
microphones to have a clear audio
quality while talking make sure to look
into your computer's camera and not the
screen in case of any network issues and
lags make sure you politely ask the
interviewer to repeat the question and
politely repeat your answer if you are
asked too so that brings us to the end
of this video on interview tips I hope
these tips are helpful to all you job
Seekers out there and I wish you all the
very best hey everyone I hope you're all
doing great welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel and today we'll be
discussing about the coding interview
questions we will begin this video with
some conceptual questions about data
structures algorithms and then move on
to discussing the coding problems that
are most commonly asked to solve in
interviews these questions will help you
summarize every important programming
concept and serve as a perfect
preparation resource for coding
interviews by the end of this video I
can assure you that you will have a
proper understanding of data structure
Concepts and you will be able to code
the most common problems asked in
interviews
so let's get started with an exciting
video on coding interview questions
before we begin please make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn so I hope I was clear
with the agenda now let's begin with the
top 40 coding interview questions that
you should know programming interview
questions are an integral part of an
interview for the developer's position
no matter which programming language you
master it is expected that you are
familiar with the fundamental concepts
of the programming coding skills are
always the deciding factor in any
programming interview we will discuss
the top 40 coding interview questions
you should absolutely know how to track
in interviews to get your dream job so
without further Ado let's get started so
as discussed the first part would be the
conceptual interview questions
and that the first question we have to
face is what is a data structure so the
answer for this question is a data
structure is a storage format that
defines the way the data is stored
organized and manipulated some popular
data structures are arrays trees and
graphs moving ahead we have a next
question that is what is an array
so basically all the items that an array
stores are of the same data type it
organizes data so that a related set of
values can be easily sorted or searched
now followed by an array the next
question we have is about the linked
list
so what is a linked list it is
completely similar to array but there
are some basic differences like an array
a linked list is a linear data structure
in which elements are not necessarily
stored in a continuous manner so linked
list is basically a sequence of notes
where each node points to the next node
forming a chain-like structure
so followed by the linked list we have
the next question which is based on
Stacks so what exactly is a stack stack
is a linear data structure that performs
operations in a leave for order
so in a stack elements can only be
accessed starting from the topmost to
the bottom element
so followed by Stacks we have our next
question which is what is a lifo so
basically lifo stands for last in first
out
so it is a way of accessing storing and
retrieving data the data that was stored
at the last is extracted at the first
the next one after lifo is a queue so
what exactly is a queue Q is a linear
data structure that performs operations
in a fifo order so basically free Focus
first in first out
in a queue the least recently added
elements are removed first as opposite
to the stack
so up next we have the fifo so what
exactly is fifo fifo stands for first in
first out it is a way of accessing
storing and retrieving data
the data that was stored first is
extracted first the next question is
about the binary trees so what exactly
are binary trees a binary tree is an
extension of linked list data structure
where each node has two children
binary tree has two nodes at all the
times a left note and a right node so
these left and right nodes for the top
node are known as children of the top
node
next we have is recursion so what is
recursion recursion refers to a function
calling itself based on a terminating
condition it uses last and first start
functionality and therefore makes use of
the stack data structure
followed by recursion we have the oops
so what is the oops concept
oop stands for object-oriented program
and system a paradigm that provides
Concepts such as objects classes
inheritance polymorphism encapsulation
Etc so what are the concepts introduced
in oops
so the following concepts are introduced
in oops they are object class
inheritance polymorphism abstraction and
encapsulation now we will discuss each
one of them in a bit more detail so we
will begin with object a real world
entity having a particular State and a
behavior is called as an object it can
be defined as an instant of a class
so next we have the class
a logical entity that defines the
blueprint from which an object can be
created or instantiated is called as a
class so basically class is a blueprint
which we use to create an object
so followed by classes and objects we
have the inheritance a concept that
refers to an object acquiring all the
properties and behaviors of a parent
object is called as inheritance so
basically inheritance provides code
reusability
so followed by inheritance the next
important concept we have is the
polymorphism
so polymorphism is a concept that allows
the task to be performed in different
ways in Java we use method overloading
and method overriding to achieve
polymorphism
followed by polymorphism we have the
abstraction
a concept that hides the internal
details of an application and shows only
the functionality is called as
abstraction in Java we use abstract
classes and interface to achieve
abstraction the last one is the
encapsulation encapsulation is a concept
that refers to wrapping of code and data
together into a single unit so basically
every code we have in the Java will have
data members and data manipulating
methods so encapsulation is a basic
concept that brings them together and
binds them as a single unit
so followed by oops Concepts the next
important question that we will be
facing is about the binary search tree
so explain binary search tree
a binary search tree stores data in such
a way that it can be retrieved very
efficiently next the left subtree
contains nodes worse keys are less than
of the nodes K value the right subtree
contains nodes both keys are greater
than or equal to the nodes key value
followed by that the next question we
have is the W linked list so what
exactly are doubly linked lists the W
linked lists are special type of linked
list in which traversal across the data
elements can be done in both directions
this is made possible by having two
links in which one of the node will be
connected to the next upcoming node and
the other link is connected to the
previous node so followed by the doubly
linked list the next important question
we have is the graph so what exactly is
a graph a graph is one type of data
structure that contains a set of ordered
pairs so these ordered pairs are also
referred as edges or arcs and arcs are
used to connect nodes where data can be
stored or retrieved so followed by this
we have our next question that is called
as the difference between linear and
non-linear data structures
so the first difference is the linear
data structure in which data elements
are adjacent to each other and the
non-linear data structure is a structure
in which each element can connect to two
adjacent data elements
followed by that the next difference is
examples of linear data structure are
the arrays linkless Stacks in others
like use and examples for non-linear
data structures are trees and graphs
followed by that the next question is of
what is a DQ so DQ is a double ended
queue and this is a structure in which
elements can be inserted or removed from
either end followed by that we have our
next question which says the difference
between the stack and an array so stack
follows a lifo pattern it means that the
data access follows a sequence in which
the last data to be stored is the first
element to be extracted next we have the
array arrays on the other hand do not
follow a particular order and instead
can be accessed by referring the indexed
element within the array
followed by that the next question is
which sorting algorithm is the best
there are many types of sorting
algorithms like quicksort bubble sort
balloon sort Radix sort merge sort Etc
and no algorithm can be considered as
the best or the fastest because each is
designed for a specific type of data
structure where it performs the best
and our 19th question is how does
variable declaration affect memory
so the amount of memory can be allocated
or reserved depends on the data type
being stored in that variable
for example if a variable is declared to
be integer type then 32 bits of memory
storage will be reserved for that
variable so the 28th question is what
are Dynamic data structures so Dynamic
data structures are the data structures
that expand and contract as the program
runs
it provides a flexible means of
manipulating data because it can adjust
according to the size of the data so
these were the conceptual based
questions so far we discussed now next
we will move ahead into the programming
interview questions
so at first we have
how do you reverse a string in Java so
you can see on my screen we have a code
segment that is capable of reversing a
string so basically you declare a string
then take the length of that string Loop
through the characters of the string and
add these characters in the reverse
order then print the resultant string
next we have how do you determine if a
string is a palindrome or not
so for that particular question we have
a code segment which is capable to
reverse the string and check if it is a
palindrome or not and accordingly
provide the result so a string is a
parent room and it stays the same on the
reversing order of characters in that
string it is achieved by reverse in the
original string first and then checking
if the reverse string is equal to the
original string or not
followed by that we have the 23rd
question that says find the number of
occurrences of a string character in a
string so the following code segment is
capable to find that particular task and
to find the number of occurrences of
loop through the string and search for
that character in every iteration
whenever it is found then the count will
be updated
followed by that the 24th question is
find if the given two strings are
anagrams or not
two strings are considered as anagrams
if they contain similar group of
characters in varied sequence so for
finding out if two strings are anagrams
or not we have the code segment on the
right part of my screen right now so
basically you declare a Boolean value
that tells the end of the two strings
are anagrams or not then first take the
length of the both strings if they are
same or not then if they are not same
then they are not anagrams if they are
same then they are anagrams like they
might be a chance of being the two
strings as anagrams and followed by the
next step is convert both the strings to
character arrays then sort them out and
finally check the sorted arrays if they
are equal or not if they are equal then
print they are anagrams and if they are
not equal then you should print not
anagrams the next 25th question is how
do you calculate the number of vowels
and consonants in a string so you can
see on my screen I have a code segment
which will be capable of counting vowels
and consonants in a string so Loop
through the string so that's the first
step for by that increase the vowel
variable by one whenever the character
can be found as a vowel using the if
condition otherwise increment the
consonant variable finally print the
values of both the vowels and consonants
count
the next important question we will be
facing in the coding interview is how do
you get matching elements in an integer
array so for that we have a code segment
on my screen right away now the steps
for that are declare an array Nest a
couple of loops and Compare the numbers
but the other numbers in the array and
finally print the matching elements
whenever found so next we have this 27th
question that says code bubble sort
algorithm you don't have to code the
entire bubble sort algorithm what you
can do is just write the code segment
which has a logic for it so that is
currently on my screen right now so what
you basically do is declare an array so
next what you do is Nest a couple of
loops and Compare the numbers in that
array and then the array will be sorted
in the ascending order by replacing the
elements if found in any other order
28th question is code the insertion sort
algorithm so this is completely similar
approach what we followed for the bubble
sort you just have to write the code
segment of logic so the steps will be
first the element in the array is
assumed to be sorted take the second
element and then store it separately in
key now the first two elements are like
sorted take the third element and then
compare it with the elements in the left
of it
the process goes on until the array is
sorted
so next we have the 29th question how do
you reverse an array so you can see on
my screen we have a code segment that
says how to reverse an array Loop till
the half length of the array next we
have to replace the numbers
corresponding to the indexes from the
starting to the end
followed by that we have the 38th
question where we have to find a way to
swap two numbers without the third
variable so this type of interview
question will be asked most number of
times to the beginners most frequently
now the solution for that has been
written on my screen right away you can
check out that and the steps to be
followed are declare two variables and
initialize them with the values make B
the sum of both the numbers then
subtract the sum that is the B from a so
a is now swapped lastly subtract a from
the sum B so B is now also swapped next
we have the 31st question which says
print a Fibonacci series using recursion
so for that we have a code segment which
can print a Fibonacci series on my
screen right now so the code on my
screen can be used to print the
Fibonacci series so basically what are
Fibonacci numbers so the Fibonacci
numbers are the numbers in the following
integer sequence 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 and
so on they can be calculated using the
mathematical formula used in the
Fibonacci recursive function
the next question you will be facing is
how do you find the factorial of an
integer so we have the code segment on
my screen which can perform the
factorial of an integer operation so the
factorial is a function that multiplies
a number by every number below it for
example factorial of 5 is 5 into 4 into
3 into 2 into 1 which is equals to 120.
so recursive function multiplies the
number until it reaches 1. the next one
is how do you reverse a linked list so
for that we have the code segment on my
screen right away you can please check
it out and try it so if you can find out
if it can reverse a link list or not so
the steps to be done for that are
declare a linked list first then add
elements to that linked list apply the
descending iterator method to the linked
list and then this should reverse the
order of the elements in the linked list
the 34th question is how do you
implement a binary search
so for that we have the code segment
right on my screen you can check that
out and the steps to be followed are
mentioned in the code segment so the
binary search divides the array into
half in every iteration step until it
finds the element
it works on sorted arrays since it
compares the values of adjacent elements
and then calculates the middle number if
the value of low becomes greater than
height at any point it means the element
is not present in the list so this is
how the binary search basically Works
followed by that we have the 35th
question which says find the second
largest number in the array so you can
see we have a code segment on my screen
to find it out so the steps to be
followed are Loop through the array if
the value of I is greater than the
highest store the value of I in the
highest and store the value of highest
in the second highest variable
so now let's move ahead to the 36th
question
how do you remove all occurrences of a
given character from the input string so
we have a simple small code segment on
my screen right away so that code
segment can be used to remove all the
occurrences of a given character from an
input string so what you can do is use
the built-in string method that is
replace to replace a character with any
other character including symbols and
white spaces
so followed by that we have our 37th
question so that is Showcase inheritance
with the help of a program
so we have a small core Summit on my
screen to showcase the one of the major
object-oriented programming method that
is inheritance
so the class CAD inherits the property
color from class Animal by extending the
parent class animal this way a class cat
can have more pairing classes if it
wishes to inherit their properties as
well
so next question that is the 38th
question is explain overloading and
overriding with the help of a program
so this is a major question which is
asked many number of times most
frequently for the beginners and
sometimes even the experienced
candidates cannot escape this question
so first we'll discuss overloading when
a class has two or more methods with the
same name they are called as overloaded
methods so you can see a code segment on
the right side part of my screen right
away so this is an example for
overloading next we will discuss the
overriding
so next we will discuss the overriding
so when a superclass method is also
implemented in the child class then it's
a clear case of overriding so on the
right side part of my screen you can see
a code segment where a child class is
extending the Base Class method which is
print name now followed by that we have
the 39th question
that is check if the given number is
prime or not
so you can see a code segment on my
screen which determines if the given
number is a prime number or not so the
steps to be followed to find if a given
number is prime or not R use if
statements to check for each condition
separately if the number is 0 or 1 it
cannot be prime if the number is 2 it is
prime if the number is
and finally the third condition you need
to take care of is if the number is
indivisible by other numbers then it is
prime so basically prime numbers are
divisible by 1 or itself if any other
number is capable to divide the number
then it is not a prime number now the
last question in the list is how do you
sum all the elements in an array so for
that we have a code segment right on my
screen please check it and try to run it
and that's the best way to learn so the
steps to be followed are use the loop to
iterate through the array and keep
adding the elements in that array and
finally you will get the sum of the
elements in the array and you can just
print this sum at the last so with that
as you prepare for your upcoming job
interview we hope these coding questions
have provided more insight into what
types of questions you are likely to be
asked in this video session we will
understand some software developer
interview questions that will help you
in your interview preparation
in this tutorial we will discuss a
series of technical interview questions
and HR interview questions for you so
that you will get a better understanding
of the approach also guys if you want to
become a full stack web developer
consider the full stack web developer
mean stack course by simplylearn and
master those necessary skills check out
the link in the description box for more
details now before moving forward let me
ask you a quick question so what was the
name of the first computer virus option
one is Trojan host option 2 is Christmas
tree option 3 is brain option 4 is
creeper
you guys can put your answers in the

learn introduction to software developer
so software developer is a professional
who designs creates tests and maintains
software using various programming
languages and Technologies
their roles and responsibilities can
vary depending on the organization and
project but some common tasks of a
software developer include writing code
to create a software application
debugging and troubleshooting existing
software collaborating with other
developers stakeholders to Define
software requirements participating in
code reviews and ensuring the quality of
the database keeping up with date of new
programming languages and Technologies
to improve a software developer may also
be responsible for project management
mentoring Junior developers or
contributing to the broader strategy of
the organization depending on the size
of the company so in this video we will
go through some software development
interview questions that will be useful
to you and serve as a valuable resource
for interview preparation so let's go
ahead and have a look at some technical
interview questions
so what is a framework so framework is a
set of pre-written code and guidelines
that provide a structure for developing
software application
it is designed to ease the development
process by providing a common set of
tools and conventions for building and
deploying applications
Frameworks can include libraries modules
and apis that can be used to perform
common tasks such as input output
database access and user authentication
examples of popular Frameworks include
Ruby on Rails angularjs and spring
framework now coming to the second
question which is
what is waterfall model and what are its
use cases
so the waterfall model is a software
development lifecycle model that
describes a linear sequential approach
to software development
the model is named after waterfall
because it describes a process where
progress flows in a downward or linear
fashion through the phases of a project
much like a waterfall cascading down a
mountain
its use cases are small projects with
well-defined requirements and clear
scope projects that have a clear and
cool and deliverables projects with
clear set of deliverables and a defined
timeline projects that have a
well-defined budget projects that have a
well-defined set of rules and
regulations projects that do not require
much change Revolution over time it is
important to note that the waterfall
model is not well suited for projects
with rapidly changing or evolving
requirements projects that require
multiple rounds of testing and revisions
or projects that require close
collaboration between development and
stakeholders so this was waterfall model
now moving on to the next question that
is what are verification and validation
so verification is a process of making
sure software reaches its goals without
errors it is the process of figuring out
whether or not the product being
generated is accurate it establishes
whether the end product compiles with
the requirements and focuses primarily
on the functionality now comes the
validation the process of determining
whether a software product satisfies the
necessary requirements is known as
validation it is a procedure of
confirming product validation or
confirming that the product we are
developing is accurate the quality of
the program is the main focus of the
validation now coming to the fourth
question
so what do you mean by a software scoop
so the scope of a software project
refers to the defined boundaries and
requirements for what the software will
accomplish it includes specific features
functions and deliverables that the
software will provide as well as the
constraints or limitation on the
projects the scope helps to establish a
clear understanding of the Project's
objectives and serves as a guide for
project planning and execution so this
was the software scope now coming to the
fifth question on our list
how can you measure the project
execution we can measure the project
execution through activity monitoring
status reports and Milestone checklist
so now let's discuss these things
so activity monitoring
so this involves tracking the progress
of specific tasks or activities within
the project such as coding testing or
documentation
this can be done using tools like task
management software or project
management software which allow team
members to update the status of their
task and provide the visibility into the
progress of the project as a whole then
there is status reports these are
regular updates on the Project's
progress including information on what
has been completed what is currently
being worked on and what issues or risks
have been identified status reports can
be shared with stakeholders including
the project manager project sponsor and
the other team members then there is
Milestone checklist so these are the
list of specific deliverables or
Milestones that need to be completed in
order for the project to be considered
successful this checklist includes all
the activities that need to be done who
is responsible for them and the deadline
for the completion
this helps to ensure that all the
critical tasks are completed on time and
that the project stays on track moving
on to the next question which is what
are functional and non-functional
requirements a functional requirements
are those that users expect from the
proposed software product and are
referred to as functional leads whereas
the non-function requirements on the
other hand are the how of the system and
they describe the quality
characteristics or constraints of the
system that must be met these includes
things like performance security
scalability usability and
maintainability all right moving on to
the seventh question which is what is a
spiral model so the spiral model is a
software development process model that
combines elements of the waterfall model
and the iterative model it is also known
as spiral lifecycle model spiral model
is an evolutionary approach to software
development that emphasizes risk
management and incremental delivery of a
software product the model consists of a
series of iterations each one building
on the previous one so this was the
spiral model
next up we have what are the
disadvantages of a spiral model
so there are some disadvantages of a
spiral model
for example complexity cost time
consuming so let's understand those
complexity
the spiral model is a complex model and
requires a highly experienced team and
good project management skills it is not
suitable for smaller simple projects
than cost
the spiral model can be expensive as it
requires multiple iterations and
evaluations which can increase the
overall cost of the project third is
time consuming so the spiral model can
take a long time to complete as it
involves multiple iterations and
evaluations this may not be suitable for
projects with stick time constraints all
right so ninth question now is what is
agile software development model
so agile software development is a
methodology for managing software
development projects that emphasizes
flexibility collaboration and customer
satisfaction the process is divided into
small incremental releases called
Sprints which typically lasts two to
four weeks each Sprint includes a
planning phase development phase testing
phase and a review phase agile
methodologies include scrum kanban and
extreme programming so this was about
the agile software development model
moving on to the 10th question on our
list that is what is Baseline so in
project management a baseline refers to
a set of agreed upon projects objectives
deliverables and performance
measurements that serve as a starting
point for the project planning and
execution it is also used as a reference
point to measure progress and
performance throughout the project
throughout the Journey of the project a
baseline is typically established early
in the project planning process and
include Goods project scope schedule and
budget once established these baselines
are used as a point of comparison to
measure progress and performance
identify variances and make adjustments
as needed next question is what is Black
Box texting and white box testing so
Black Box testing also known as
functional testing is a method of
testing software where the tester does
not have access to the internal
structure or code of the software
the tester is only aware of the inputs
and outputs of the software and test is
based on its functionality and
requirements
the tester does not need to know how the
software Works internally this type of
testing is often used to verify that the
software functions are expected and
meets the requirements specified by the
customer now coming to the white box
testing white box testing is also known
as structural testing it is a method of
testing software where the tester has
access to the internal structure and
code of the software the tester is able
to test the software at a deeper level
and can test for things like code
coverage Branch Testing and logic
testing this type of testing is often
used to verify that the software is
structurally sound and that the code is
of high quality now coming to question
number 12 what is quality assurance
so quality assurance is a process or set
of procedure intended to ensure that a
product or service meets a defined set
of quality criteria or meet the
requirements of the consumer it is a
process driven approach to verify that a
product of service being developed or
provided is meeting the defined quality
standards this can include activities
such as inspection testing and audits
the goal of quality assurance is to
identify and mitigate issues before a
product or service is delivered to the
customer so this was the quality
assurance
now comes what is quality control all
right so quality control is a process of
inspecting testing or auditing a product
or service to ensure that it meets a
defined set of quality criteria or
customer requirements it is a systematic
and independent examination of the
product or service to evaluate whether
the relevant quality requirements are
fulfilled the quality control focuses on
detecting and pigmenting the defects in
a product
rather than improving the overall
quality of the product
it typically involves inspecting a
sample of products
to ensure that they meet the required
standards and taking corrective action
if necessary so this was the quality
control now coming to question number 14
which is what are some different sdlc
models
first is waterfall model spiral model
incremental model agile model Big Bang
model and iterative model
so these are various sdlc models that
you must know if you're preparing for
software development interview all right
now coming to question number 15 what is
a use case diagram so a use case diagram
is a type of unified modeling language
diagram that shows the interactions
between actors and use cases in a system
actors represent the external entities
that interact with the system such as
users or other systems while use cases
represent the functionality provided by
the system the diagram illustrates the
relationship between actors and use
cases such as which actors can perform
which use cases use case diagram are
commonly used to model and communicate
the requirements of a system to
stakeholders all right so these were
some of the technical interview
questions now let's understand some HR
interview questions
so the question is how do you stay
current with new technologies and
Industry developments so you can answer
this question this way
I am dedicated to staying current with
new technologies and Industry
developments I do this by regularly
reading the industry Publications
attending relevant conferences and
networking events following influencers
and experts in my field on social media
and taking online courses to learn about
new technologies additionally I am
always open to learning from my
colleagues and actively seek out
opportunities to expand my knowledge
through mentoring training and
professional development programs so
this is how you can answer this kind of
questions so if somebody asks you how do
you stay current with new technologies
and Industry developments this is how
you have to answer the question all
right now moving on to the next question
which is how do you handle deadlines and
pressure
so you can answer this type of question
in this way so I am able to handle
deadlines and pressure by staying
organized and prioritizing my task I
make sure to break down projects into
smaller manageable tasks and create a
plan to complete them on time I also set
intermediate deadlines for myself to
ensure that I'm making steady progress
when faced with pressure I focus on
staying calm and keeping my priorities
in mind and I communicate effectively
with my team and stakeholders I also
make sure to take breaks and maintain a
healthy work-life balance to stay
refreshed and focused so this is how you
can answer this kind of question now
moving on to the question number 18 can
you tell us about a project you have led
and the steps you took to ensure its
success
so if you are being asked this question
during an interview you should provide a
specific example of how you have used
Version Control in your development
process first we set up a central
repository on GitHub where all the team
members had access each member created
their own branches for their specific
task and pushed their code changes to
the those branches
before merging any changes we had a pull
request process in place where any other
team member could review the code
changes and provide feedback after the
code was reviewed and any necessary
changes were made the changes were then
merged into the main development Branch
we also used git tags to Mark specific
versions of the code such as versions
that were deployed to production
additionally we use gits built-in diff
and blame tools to track the changes and
identify any bugs or issues that might
create a problem thanks to the use of
Version Control we were able to
collaborate effectively as a team so
this is how you will answer this kind of
question alright guys now moving on to
the question number 19.
so why do you want to work here
so when answering this question why do
you want to work here it is important to
do your research on the company first
and companies values also it includes
values missions and culture you must do
the research on these things now tailor
your response to show that you align
with these values and are excited about
the opportunity to contribute to the
company's goals additionally it's a good
idea to mention specific aspects of the
job or company that appeal to you and
how your skills and experience make you
a good fit for the role be sincere and
enthusiastic in your response so moving
on to the next question which is what is
your greatest weakness as a software
developer when answering this question
what is your greatest weakness
it is important to be honest while also
framing your answer in a specific way
that shows that you are aware of the
issue and actively working on to improve
that one strategy is to mention a
specific skill or area that you are
aware you need to improve on and then
explain the steps you are taking to do
so such as taking online courses or
seeking feedback from colleagues another
approach is to talk about a time when
you face the challenge in your work and
how you overcame it it is also important
to note that it is better to be honest
but also show that you are self-aware
and proactive in addressing your areas
for improvement all right now question
number 21 is what is your greatest
strength so when answering this question
in an HR interview it's important to be
a specific and provide examples to
backup your answer one approach is to
identify a particular skill or
technology that you must excel in and
explain how you have used that strength
to contribute to the Past projects or
teams for example you might say my
greatest strength as a software
developer is my ability to write highly
efficient and optimized code for example
in my previous role I was able to
significantly improve the performance of
our application by identifying and
addressing bottlenecks in the code I
also enjoy solving complex problems and
coming up with innovative solutions so
this is how you can answer this kind of
a question all right now question number
22 is tell me about your experience as a
software developer
so it's important for this kind of
question to focus on your relevant
experience and skills highlighting
specific examples of projects and
accomplishments while answering this
question be concise use specific
examples
show technical skills demonstrate
problem solving skills Etc that's it all
right now next question is why do you
want to work for a company
so here's an example for this kind of a
question
I am excited about the opportunity to
work for your company because I believe
it aligns with my values
I like its culture and Mission and I
think I can help company to achieve its
goals I am particularly interested in
the company's Innovative approach to a
specific area and I know that my skills
and experience would be a great asset to
the team I'm confident that I can make a
positive contribution to the company and
I'm eager to be a part of its future
success so in this way you can answer
this kind of a question like why do you
want to work for our company all right
now question number 24 on our list is
what do you like best about being a
software developer
so when answering this question what do
you like best about being a software
developer it's important to be honest
and authentic but also to show that you
have a passion for the field and that
you are excited about the opportunity to
work as a software developer you can say
few things like the ability to solve
problems the teamwork aspect of the job
and the variety of the field
Etc all right next question on our list
is how do you handle difficult and
challenging situations so you can answer
this question in this way I have had
several experiencing handling difficult
or challenging issues with customers in
my previous customer service rules one
situation that stands out to me was when
a customer was extremely angry and
dissatisfied with the brood I knew that
it was important to remain calm and
professional so I took a deep breath and
actively listened to his or her concerns
I acknowledge the issue and apologize
for the mistake I then worked with my
team to find a solution that satisfied
the customer such as offering a refund
or replacement product I also made sure
to follow up with the customer to ensure
that issue had been resolved to their
satisfaction so this way you have to
answer this kind of question this is bit
tricky one but you must answer this
question this way
all right
now coming to question number 26
so would you like to relocate to or
travel for the company
when answering this question in an
interview it's important to be honest
with your interviewer while also showing
your flexibility and willingness to work
for the company a good response might be
something like I'm open to relocating or
travel for the company if the
opportunity arises
I understand the importance of being
able to adapt to the needs of the
business and am committed to being
valuable asset to the team so this is
how you will answer this question now
question number 27 on our list is what
are your expectations from a company so
a good response might be something like
I am looking for the company that values
professional growth offers opportunities
for advancement and has a positive
supportive work culture I'm also looking
for a company that is committed to
making a meaningful impact in its
industry I am excited about the
opportunity to work for your company and
believe that my skills and experiences
align well with the company's missions
and values
this shows that you have done your
research on the company and you're a
good fit for the company's culture now
coming to question number 28 where do
you see yourself in five years
so when answering this question in an
interview it's important to show that
your Ambitions and have a Clear Vision
for your future while also being
realistic and aligned with the company's
goals
a good response might be something like
in five years I see myself having an
advanced within the company and taking

so this is how you can answer this
question
all right now coming to the last
question which is what inquiries do you
have for me
it's a common question that is being
asked most of the time there is no harm
you can ask questions about the company
the role you're applying for you can ask
and any potential projects or
responsibilities you would be working on
it is also a good opportunity to ask
about the team you would be working with
the company's culture and any
opportunities for growth and development
within the company C programming
interview questions are a major part of
every interview procedure this video has
covered all the basic interview
questions and that every candidate is
asked to check his or her knowledge in
the programming skills they have become
essential to crack by every interview
and the current I.T industry
so please stick till the end of this
video while we give away answers to that
one importancy programming questions
that is the most frequently Asked in
every interview
hey guys welcome to Simply learn today
we will learn the top 40 C programming
interview questions and answers
before we start let us test your
existing knowledge of C to use
operations like mlog and clo which
header files should be include the
options are
stdio.h
stdlib.h cornea.h or string.h do leave
your answers in the comment section
below and while we are at it please
leave us a like if you find our content
helpful and a sub to the channel would
be appreciated
before we begin with this this video is
categorized into beginner level
intermediate level and advanced level
questions so without further delay let's
get started
the first question is what are the
features of the C programming language
C is a simple and portable it is a midi
level language it has a features of
modularity sales rich in library it is a
procedural language easy to extend and
it consists of built-in operations it
also provides memory management
the next question is mention different
data types in C
data types are classified into basic
derived and user-defined data types
basic data types are int care float and
double derived data types include array
and pointers and user-defined data types
are enum structure and unions
what is the use of static functions
functions declared with the keyword
static are the static functions they
have this scope restricted only to the
functions in which they are declared
the next question is mention the dynamic
memory allocation functions
dynamic memory allocation functions are
mlog see a log realloc and free
when we use the analog function The
Continuous block of memory will be
allocated and the pointer variable will
hold the address of the first element
clf function is similar to analog
function but in the case of Click
function multiple blocks of memory of
the same size will be allocated which
holds zero value by default and it takes
two arguments that is number element and
element size
we use real lock function to change the
array size without losing the data in
short the real up functions will change
the size of the previously allocated
memory block the free function is used
to deallocate the memory space occupied
by the previously allocated by mlog cloc
real log functions in order to use the
memory more efficiently and to return
back the memory to the Heap once done we
use free function what is the difference
between local variable and Global
variable
variables declared inside the functions
with the keyword local are called local
variables the local variable scope is
inside the functions in which it is
declared variables declare outside the
functions with the keyword Global are
called Global variables and they can be
accessed by multiple functions defined
in the program
moving ahead to the next question
what is the use of pointer variables in
C programming and what do you mean by
dangling pointer variable a pointer is a
variable that holds the address of
another variable to be executed which
can be of data type int care array Etc
pointers are used to access the memory
location easily and introduces the
storage space and increase the speed of
the program's execution when a pointer
pointing to another variable is deleted
and a pointer is still pointing at the
same Embry location then the pointer is
known as a dangling pointer
the next question is what is nested
structure nested structures are the
structures where data members of One
structures is referred by the data
members of another function next what is
the use of break control statements
break is used to terminate the loop so
whenever the control encounters the
break statement it will stop the loop
iteration and transfer the control to
the next statements soon after the loop
generally break statements are used in
the loop and switch control statements
and the next question is what are C
tokens
tokens are the smallest individual
elements in the program which include
keywords identifiers constants special
symbols strings and operations
what is predefined functions in C
predefined functions are the built-in
functions it helps user to use already
existing code in the program what is the
use of printf and scanf function printf
and scanf are inbuilt Library functions
defined in the standard input output
header file scanf is used to read the
input from the user and printf is used
to print the output on console
the next question is what is the use of
header files in C
header file contain the predefined
library functions programs can make use
of standard Library functions by
defining hash include in the program it
reduces the number of code and
complexity of the program
what is an array mention its different
types an array is a homogeneous
collection of elements of the same data
type that means similar types of
elements are stored under one name
called an RNA and also the array of
elements stored in consecutive block of
memory types of array includes one
dimensional array two-dimensional array
and multi-dimensional array next what is
the use of const keyword
using a const keyword the value of a
variable is constant throughout the
program runtime constant values are
unchangeable syntax include const
variable name equal to value and
semicolon at the end
what is a memory leak
when the memory is allocated dynamically
and not deallocated even when the memory
is no longer required that leads to a
memory leak now that your basic level
questions are completed let us go
through a few intermediate level
questions
differentiate between call by value and
call by reference in call by value we
pass values by copying variables in call
by reference we pass the address of the
variable in call by value the memory
location for formal and actual arguments
are created separately in the case of
call by reference the formal and actual
arguments share the same memory location
any changes made in copy of variables
will not affect the value of a variable
outside the function in call by value
whereas in call by reference any changes
made in the variables will also affect
the value of the variable outside the
function moving on to the next question
what is the difference between a
compiler and an interpreter
a compiler compiles the whole code at a
time and displays all the errors whereas
The Interpreter executes the program
line by line and displays the error of
every single line
what are the entry and exit Loops in C a
loop in which the condition is checked
first and then executes the statements
is known as an entry Loop for example a
while loop is an entry Loop
a loop in which the set of statements is
executed first and then checks the given
condition is known as an exit flow for
the example do while loop is an exit
Loop and the next question is what is
typecasting
typecasting is a process of converting
one data type to another data type the
conversion that is done automatically is
known as implicit conversion
next
mention four types of storage classes in
C four types of storage classes in CR
automatic register static and external
next what is the use of the size of
operator in C the size of operator is
applied to the data types such as int
care float Etc to determine the exact
size of a variable in bytes
what are the string handling functions
in C string handling functions are Str
Len strc80
strcpy and Str CMP Str Len is used to
find the string length it will count the
number of characters in a string and
prints the output
then stlcat is used to concat two
strings which means adding up two
strings St and cpy is to copy a string
to another strcmp is to compare two
strings
and the next question is write a c
program to print the following pattern
so now let's understand the working of
the code so in this pattern program we
have two for loops
so
where the order follow-up indicates the
number of rows and the inner for Loop
will indicate the number of columns so
here it first checks the auto follow
condition and if the condition is
satisfied the country will go to the
inner follow
and print the value that is it prints
the J value
and once the condition is false the
control will transfer back to the auto
for Loop and increment I by 1.
and this process will repeat until all
the number patterns are printed
successfully so now let's execute it
so as you can see the number here this
is the pattern where we are executing
with the help of two for Loops that is
for I is equal to one I lesser is equal
to n so n value is 5 and then I plus
plus then coming to the inner for Loop J
is equal to 1 J lesser or equal to I and
J plus plus
so now moving on to the next pattern
question we have Implement a program to
print parameter star pattern so in this
parameter star pattern program we have
declared variables i j and rows is equal
to 5. so the number of rows that we are
going to print is 5. so for I is equal
to 0 to I less than 5 it's going to
print the rows at
this for Loop will print the blank
spaces
so from J is equal to rows minus i j
greater to i j j minus minus so this for
Loop is used to print the spaces in
between the parameter star pattern and
coming to this for Loop here J is equal
to 0 J lesser or equal to i j plus plus
it will print this star
so let's run it
okay let's run it
so as you can see the start pattern is
formed
and the next question is write a c code
to swap two numbers without using third
variable so here we have the variables
first and second so first is initialize
to Value 1 and second is initialized to
Value 2. so print before swapping the
values of first and second and it will
print the values of first and second
initially so initially the values of
first and second is 1 and 2. then coming
to this statements
so here first is equal to First plus
second so suppose let's consider
first is equal to so the first value is
1 so 1 plus
2 is equal to 3.
okay so now the first value is holding
the first variable is holding the value
3 then coming to the second
here second is equal to now the value of
first is three so three
3 and minus the value of second is still
2.
so let's give two
so which is 3 minus 2 is 1 so now this
variable second is holding new value
that is 1.
then
first is equal to
first minus second so now what's the
value of first the new value is 3 so 3
minus and what's the value of second
that is 1.
so 3 minus 1 is 2.
so now as you can see initially the
first was equal to one that is before
swapping the value of where first is
equal to 1 and second is equal to 2. now
after swapping the value of first is
equal to 2 and second is equal to 1 so
that's what's Happening Here
so let's remove this
hope it's clear
so now let's run it
so as you can see the screen before
swapping the value of first is equal to
1 second is equal to two so after
swapping the value I have exchanged so
first is equal to 2 and then second is
equal to 1.
moving on to the advanced level
questions first what is a union union is
a special data type that holds the
element of different data types at the
same memory location the concept of
structure and unions are the same
however the only difference is in terms
of storage space and the keyword in
Union memory is allocated once the
variable is created and the union
variables are created to access and
assign values of the union members in C
the next question is what are
enumeration
enum is a user-defined data types
consisting of an integral constant in
short and enum is a keyword that allows
a user-defined data types consisting set
of integral constants the syntax of
enumeration is inum inum name and list
of constants separated with the help of
comma operator and the next question is
what is a recursion recursion is a
process of making a function call itself
in short the user call function inside
the same function
the next question is what are
microcensee macro in C is defined by the
hash Define directive a macro is a name
given to a piece of code so whenever the
compiler encounters a macro in a c
program it will replace it with a macro
value in the micro definition the macro
are not terminated by the semicolon
syntax of a micro has defined macronium
followed by macro value example hash
defined by 3.14 and semicolon at the end
what are file operations in C
creating a file writing a file reading a
file seek operation within a file and
truncating a file
and at last deleting a file
what are the difference between macros
and functions macros are pre-processed
but functions are compiled using macros
execution speed is faster and in the
case of functions this speed of
execution is slower the macro name is
replaced by the macro value before
compilation whereas in function transfer
of control take place during the
function call
using macros the length of the code
increase the code length is unlefted
using the function
the next question is sort an array using
a quick sort algorithm
so as you can see the screen we have a
quick sort algorithm function declared
where we have array
of size 25 left and right variables so
coming to the main function we have I
count and array so
using printer function it will print
enter the number of elements so it will
take the number of elements that means
suppose you want to sort five elements
so it will take that number and then it
will take elements one by one using this
for Loop then it will call the quick
sort algorithm so when then this quick
sort algorithm the control will transfer
to this function
and we have array of size 25 left and
right
so here we have two variable sticklet
that is i j pivot and temp variables so
if left hand side element is less than
right hand side element then left hand
side element is assigned to Pivot and
then left is assigned to I and right
element is assigned to J
so while I lesser than J so while it
takes the condition array of I lesser or
equal to array of pivot and I is less
than right then increment I by 1. while
array of J greater than array of pivot
then it will decrement J by 1. so if I
is less than J
here we are using temp variable
to swap that means to
shift the elements so whatever is there
in Array of I is given to temporable
whatever is then there in Array of J is
given to array of I and whatever is
there in the temp variable is assigned
to array of J then now temp is not
holding any value so array of piot
is given to Temp variable
and
array of J is assigned to RF private and
temp is assigned to array of T then two
times you are calling the quicksort
algorithm first time to saw the elements
at the left hand side and then to sort
the elements at the right hand side
and coming to this main function
uh then it will print all the sorted
elements so let's run it
so as you can say enter the number of
elements so let's enter 5
and let's enter some random numbers
okay so the numbers that we entered was
1 4 32 5 and 5. so sorted elements are 1
4 5 5 and 32 so it has sort all the
elements successfully using quick sort
algorithm
and the next question is Implement a
program to print the factorial of a
given number using recursive method so
as you can see here we have a main
function in which we have declared the
variable n and then enter a positive
integer so it will take the N value
then it will print factorial of a given
number and then call the fact function
so the control will transfer to this
function where we have fact of in n so
if n is greater or equal to 1 only then
it will perform a factorial method so
suppose here we are giving a positive
integer that n to be 3 okay suppose we
are given 3 so n that is 3 into
fact of
n minus 1 that is 2 3 minus 1 is 2. so
again we are calling
fact here fact function
so what this basically do is
3 into 2 it will perform
3 into 2 so 3 2's are 6 so it will print
6.
factorial of 3 is 6 so let's check it
so enter positive integer let's enter 3
and the value is 6. so similarly if
suppose the number is 5 5 into
fact of 5 minus 1 that is 4
so
what it does is
it will take 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into
1. so it will count all this and bring
the value so let's check what's the
factorial of 5.
so let's enter 5 and see
the factorial of number 5 is 120.
I hope it's clear
and the next question is write a c code
to find the Fibonacci series
so inside the main function we have
declared the variables N1 into N3 I num
so initially the N1 value is 0 into
value is equal to 1. so first it will
print enter the number of terms so the
number of terms that you need to fight
Fibonacci so
once you enter it will take the num and
it will print the initial value of N1
and N2 that is it will print N1 is equal
to 0 and into is equal to 1. then coming
to this for Loop
I is equal to 2 so actually I is equal
to 2 and then I lesser of lesser to num
so it will check whether 2 is less than
num so if it is true then it will come
and execute the statements
so N3 is equal to N1 plus N2 so suppose
now we have the value of N1 and into so
N3 is equal to
and one is zero Plus
into is 1 so now the value of N3 is 1 1.
okay so that will print as a N3 then
here it will again we are going to
change now we are assigning N2 value to
N1 so what is N2 value
that is 1 is given to
N1 is equal to 1 then
assigning entry value to N2
what is entry value now that is 1 that
is given to N2 now N2 is also holding 1.
so now once once it print this value
again it will go to the for Loop and
increment I by 1. so once this is the
increase that means once it increment by
1 that means now the I value will be 3.
so again it will check whether 3 is less
than num so again this will continue the
process till the I value is less than
num
so let's execute it
so let's run the program
so enter the number of terms so let's
enter 5
and Fibonacci series of 5 is 0 1 1 2 and
3.
and the next question is write a program
to check whether a given number is prime
number so in this
program
inside the mean function we have the
variables num I and flag is equal to
zero so initially flag value is equal to
0.
so as you all know that flag acts as a
Boolean variable so if the condition is
satisfied it will indicate true or false
so
then it will print enter the number to
check Prime and it will take the number
for condition I is equal to 2 till I
lesser or equal to num divided by 2.
then checks the condition if num module
I is equal equal to 0 this is the
condition that it has to meet to check
whether the number is prime or not so if
this condition satisfies then it will
print number is not Prime
and flag is equal to 1 break if flag is
equal equal to 0 then print number is
prime
so let's execute it
so enter the number to check Prime so if
I enter 3 it will say number is prime
so now let's give another number
which is not prime let's get 4 and we'll
say number is not Prime
so I hope this program is clear
the next question is
how to implement a program to find the
height of a binary tree so as you can
see the screen we have
the structure of node
then we have a variable data
and notes left child structure and right
right child structure
so we have a function called height to
find the height actual height of a
binary tree so if node is equal equal to
none that means if there are no nodes in
a tree then it will return 0 else it
will assign height
of notes left child to L height then
assigning height of nodes right child to
R height so then check the condition if
L height is greater than R height then
return L height plus 1 else written R
height plus 1. so to create new node we
are creating a new node called node and
allocating memory to it using mlog
function and assigning a data
two nodes data point and initially
denotes left child and right child are
assigned to nap then return the node
coming to the int main that is coming to
the main function we have structure of
node that is root assigning value 10 to
the root node and Root's left child is
assigned to 15 whose right child is
assigned to 20 and value 25 is assigned
to Roots left child's left hand and 30
is assigned to Roots left child's right
child then print height of a binary tree
then it will take the the control will
go back to the this function height and
then prints the value
so let's print
let's run it
so here height of a binary Trace 3.
moving on to the next question write a c
code to find the N terms or natural
number and find the sum
so basically we are finding the odd
numbers first
then we are adding up all the odd
numbers and printing the sum value
so we have the variables declared I and
and some initially the sum value is
equal to zero so first enter the number
of terms print it will take the number
of terms suppose we want five natural
numbers or five odd numbers then we are
giving 5 there
then the odd numbers are
using this for Loop it will print all
the odd numbers so I is equal to n i
lesser or equal to n it will print using
this formula it will print all the odd
numbers that is 2 into I minus 1 and
then whatever it finds it will add up
all the odd numbers so using this
statement sum is equal to sum plus 2
into I minus 1 we will get this value of
all the odd numbers
so then if we print the sum of our
natural numbers up to n terms so let's
execute it
so enter the number of terms suppose we
need five odd numbers so odd numbers are
1 3 5 7 and 9. so then it will add up
all these odd numbers so the sum of odd
natural numbers up to five terms are 25.
next Implement a c program to display a
string in reverse order so basically we
have a string where we are going to
reverse the string
so here we have declined care string 1
of size 100 and we have a temp variable
and then length l r and I so L is for
left hand side element R is for right
hand side element so first print enter a
string to reverse so whatever string we
need to reverse that we are going to
enter
so it will take a string then string of
length
string length of str1
is assigned to l e n
so initially L is equal to 0
till R is equal to length minus 1.
so here whatever string we have suppose
we have
simple so this will be 0
here this index will be 0 and this will
be a length minus 1.
so that that's what your basically tells
then for I is equal to l to I less than
r
it will perform this statements so
whatever is there in string of 1 of I is
given to temp
then whatever is there in string of 1 of
R is given to string of 1 of I then
whatever is there in temp is assigned to
string of one or five then the increment
R minus minus then again we'll go to I
and increment I by 1.
so from I is equal to l l to R it will
perform all these operations and then
reverse a string so one by one it will
put and reverse string so let's execute
enter the string to reverse let's enter
simply
and the reverse string is ILP Mis
I hope it's clear
the next question is Implement a program
to remove duplicates in a sorted array
so here we have a sorted array that is
10 12 30 40 and 50. and as you can see
we also have a duplicate elements that
is we have 10 2 times then we have 12
40 repeated and also 15 55 duplicate
number
so here this is a sorted array so
basically we are going to delete the
duplicate elements so for that
we have a remove duplicate array
function
so if n is equal equal to 0 or n is
equal equal to 1 then written in
so if the elements are 0 or the element
is 1 just return those elements then
declaring the temp variable and this
function is used for traversal so the
control will travel all the array
elements so it will check so I J usually
J is equal to 0 so for I is equal to 0
to I less than n minus 1
it checks whether a of I is not equal to
the next Element e of I plus 1 then it
will assign e of I to Temp J plus plus
then again assign here n minus 1 to 10 J
plus plus then modifying if there is any
repeated here if I is equal to 0 to I
less than J
temp of I is assigned to e of I and then
written J
coming to the main function here we have
the array elements as I said 10 12 30 40
and 55 and also along with the
duplicates so n is assigned to size of a
so it will give the size of array divide
by size of a of 0.
the function array duplicate remote
duplicate array is assigned to the
variable n and for I is equal to 0 to I
less than n it will print all the sorted
array elements so let's run it
as you can see the elements were 10 10
so here it's given one duplicate element
is deleted
and here again 12
30 40 and 55 is given successfully
so the elements are deleted
and the last question is Implement a
program to add a node at the beginning
end and specified position in any linked
list
so here we have the node structure where
we have data and also the variable next
so
we have a function for insertion at
beginning
insertion at end and insertion after a
note
so first starting with insertion at
beginning we are creating a new node and
allocating memory to it using mlog
function and
we are assigning a new data to a new
nodes data part and new nodes next is
assigned to head that means head is
assigned to this because head is holding
the address of the new node now so head
is equal to Mu
avoid insertion at end so basically here
also we are creating a new node and
allocating memory to it and coming here
we have a head is assigned to last node
because we are going to insert it in so
head now head is assigned to last note
so new data we are assigning to new
nodes data part and initially the new
next is equal to none now initially
because it's a last node
the node or the next new node's next
will hold the null value so if head is
equal equal to null then head is equal
to new
while last notes next is not equal to
null
then last is equal to last notes next
and last note next is equal to Mu that
means new we are assigning it to a last
notes next then coming to the insertion
of third node so here we have previous
node and new data
so if the previous node is equal equal
to none that means there are no nodes in
a list the given previous node cannot be
none
then creating a new node allocating
memory to it and assigning a new data
and to the next new nodes next
we are assigning previous nodes next to
the new node next and new we are
assigning to previous notes next
coming to the display function checking
while node is not equal to null
then print all the node data part
then assign nodes next to node
so coming to the mean function here we
have head initially equal to none and
insert at n we are inserting 25 at the
end then at the beginning we are
inserting 15 again at the beginning we
are inserting 10 that means 10 15 and 25
then at the end again 30 then insertion
of the note hits next 20. then you will
print the linked list elements
so let's run it
so it has print in our order
so as you can see the linked lists are
10 15 20 25 and 30.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the top 40 C programming
question and answers I hope the session
was informative and interesting today we
will be discussing Java interview
questions we all know that Java is one
of the most sought programming languages
in the current ID industry there are
multiple multi-million dollar companies
which are using Java till today
so this video is completely dedicated to
help out the Java developers and the
beginners in Java programming language
to crack the most frequently Asked Java
interview questions
so without further Ado let's begin with
our interview questions
at first we will start with the beginner
level interview questions
so in the beginner level interview
questions the first question we have is
what is jit
so the answer for this question is
jit is an abbreviation for Java in time
compiler it increases efficiency of The
Interpreter by compiling the bytecode in
the runtime
jit or just in time compiler compiles
code to Machine level directly for
higher speeds of code execution
so basically just in time compilation is
a feature added to The Interpreter of
java so this involves conversion of the
code directly to Machine level during
the compilation stage this improvises
the speed of execution of a Java program
now after the first question the second
question in the docket is
what is a class loader now let's discuss
the answer for this particular question
so basically class loader is the first
file to load when you execute any Java
program so the Java class loader is the
integrated part of java virtual machine
so the functionality of class loader is
to load the class to the Java virtual
machine while it is demanded to execute
a class
Java has bootstrap extension and
application type of class loaders so the
third question in the docket is what are
the memory allocations available in Java
so the answer for this particular
question is Java provides multiple types
of memory allocations but the five major
types of memory allocations which are
most frequently used are class memory
Heap memory stack memory program counter
memory native method stack memory
so the next question in the list is
will the program run if I write static
public avoid main so basically we write
public static word main but in case
imagine if I write the program as static
public void main will the program
execute properly so the answer for this
question is yes because Java does not
follow any specific rule for the order
of specifiers you place in your program
so when you execute the program with
such pattern in your specifiers then the
program will compile successfully also
it will run successfully
so the next question we have is
what is the default value stored in
local variables
so in C programming language when you
declare a local variable or a global
variable or any type of variable then
the first value which is stored inside
that variable will be a garbage value
unless you initialize the variable with
a personalized value for example if you
declare a variable I equal to 0 then you
are storing a value in that variable I
that is 0. if you just declare it as int
I then the value stored inside that I
variable will be a garbage value so
similarly when you declare some kind of
local variable in Java then what will be
the default value stored inside it so
the answer for this question is neither
the local variables or the global
variables or any parameters or any
object references do not have any kind
of default value stored in them
so followed by the fifth question we
have the sixth question
so what would be the output of the
following code segment is the sixth
question so this might happen sometimes
so basically what happens is your
interviewer will throw a question at you
which has a code segment so all you need
to do is decode that code in your mind
and provide the output so this would be
the code that we will be dealing with
so you can see our question has two
printf statements the first one has
hundred plus hundred plus a string which
is simply learn and in the second print
statement we have a string that is
e-learning company plus 100 plus 100 so
what will be the output of these two
printf statements
so the answer for this question is
really simple
so we'll be having 200 simply learn as
the first output and e-learning Company
one zero zero one zero zero as the
second output why
let's check out the code segment once
again
so when you see the code segment once
again so the first printf statement has
100 plus 100 plus simply learn so jvm
here understands 100 as an integer value
and the plus symbol as an addition
operator here so followed by the
addition operator we have another
integer value so what jvm does is it
adds the two numbers 100 plus 100 so
followed by that we have another plus
symbol here so followed by the plus
symbol we have a string value so here
the jvm considers the plus symbol AS
a concatenating operator but not as an
addition operator so that's why the
first two numbers got added and the
result was 200 and the next two values
were concatenated so it became as 200
simply learn similarly in the second
printer statement the jvm encountered
with a string value so it considered the
plus symbol as a concatenating operator
similarly it happened with the second
plus symbol as well so that's the reason
we had e-learning one zero zero one zero
zero as the second output
now followed by the sixth question we
have the seventh question
what is an association
so the answer for this question is an
association can be defined as a
relationship that has no ownership over
the other so to understand this
definition we can consider a simple
example
consider a person associated with
multiple Banks so consider person X who
has got accounts in Bank a bank B and
Bank C and similarly a bank is
associated with person X that is a bank
a bank B and Bank C are associated with
the person X but no one has ownership
over the other a person X who is an
account holder with all the three banks
that is a b and c does not possess any
kind of ownership over the three Banks
similarly Banks a b and c who has the
customer which is the person X but the
banks do not possess any kind of
ownership over the customer
so the relationship between the person X
and the bank's ABC can be considered as
an association
now followed by the seventh question we
have the next question that is the
eighth the question
Define copy Constructor and Java so the
answer for this question is as follows
a copy Constructor in Java is a
Constructor that initializes an object
through another object of the same class
a copy Constructor in Java is really
helpful because when you want to copy a
complex object that has several fields
or when we want to make a deep copy of
an existing object then the copy
Constructor is the one which will help
you out in this situation
so followed by the eighth question we
have the ninth question
what is a marker interface
so the answer for this question is
an empty interface in Java is referred
as a marker interface serializable and
clonable are some of the popular
examples of marker interface
so basically a marker interface is just
another interface but normally in
interface we provide some signatures so
these signatures belong to particular
methods so in normal interface we just
have method signatures but not the
complete implementation or at least
we'll be having some variables but in a
marker interface we do not have any kind
of data manipulating method signatures
any data members nothing they have
special functionality unlike a normal
interface so followed by the ninth
question we have the tenth question what
is object cloning
I guess the word object learning is
completely self-explanatory yet the
answer for this question is it is an
ability to recreate an object completely
similar to the existing object this
process is known as object cloning in
Java Java provides a built-in function
or method that is the Clone method to
clone an existing object offering the
same functionality that of the original
object
so followed by the 10th question we have
our 11th question why is Java not
completely object oriented so this
question might be a little confusing but
it's true Java is not completely object
oriented but what's the reason yes I'll
explain you why Java is not completely
object oriented
so the answer for this question is Java
is not considered as 100 object-oriented
programming language because of the data
types it uses
it still makes use of eight or more
primitive data types which are end flow
double and few others so this is the
only reason why Java is not considered
as completely 100 percent object
oriented programming language so the
next question is
Define wrapper classes in Java so the
answer for this question is in Java when
you declare primitive data types that is
the end flow double Etc then the wrapper
classes are responsible for converting
them into objects or reference types
just as we discussed before Java is not
100 object oriented programming language
just because of the primitive data types
it uses so when you include such
primitive data types then wrapper
classes are the ones which convert them
into objects or reference types for the
ease of compilation and execution of
programs without any issues so followed
by this question we have the next
question
Define Singleton classes in Java so the
answer for this question is in Java when
you make the Constructor of a class as
private then the particular class can
generate only one single object this is
the reason why such type of classes are
called as Singleton classes
so followed by that we have our next
question that says Define package in
Java so if you use some of the popular
Ides that is the integrated development
Enterprises such as IntelliJ or Eclipse
then you might be familiar with projects
packages source files and then the class
file so basically you create a project
first and inside the project you will be
having your Source folder and then you
will be creating your own package using
the source folder and inside the package
you will create a class file and inside
the class file is where you write your
Java program so here the question is
Define package in Java so the answer for
this question is as follows
package is a collective bundle of
classes and interfaces along with
necessary libraries and jar files the
use of packages helps in code
reusability so basically when you create
a specific package inside that package
you will store all the class files that
you will be using in your Java program
so not only class files in case if you
use any kind of connectors or any kind
of Jar files or any kind of dependencies
for your Java program you will include
all those inside the package so that the
requirements and the class files are
bundled together and this helps out
encode reusability making sure that the
program files or the Java files for any
dependencies are not juggling between
one package to the other or one file to
the other so using a package is
basically a good practice
so followed by this we have our next
question
can you implement pointers in Java
program
so if you remember C programming
language we had pointers there
so we use pointers to directly access
the memory
so similarly can you use pointers in a
Java program this is a little tricky
question for beginners but basically
it's really simple
now the answer for this question is
no because Java virtual machine
personally takes care of memory
management implicitly so Java's major
motto was to keep programming simple so
accessing memory directly through
pointers is not a recommended action so
the answer is a big no you cannot
Implement pointers in Java program
so followed by that we have our next
question
differentiate between instance and local
variables
so the answer for this question is
really simple instance variables are
declared inside a class and the scope is
limited to only a specific object inside
which an instance variable is created so
followed by the instance variable we
have the local variable so the local
variable can be anywhere inside a method
or a specific block of code also the
scope is limited to the block of code
where the variable that is the local
variable is declared
now followed by the 16th question we
have our next question
explain Java string pool so the answer
for this question is a collection of
strings in Java's Heap memory is
referred as Java's string pole so for
example you wanted to create a new
string consider your name so your name
might be some XYZ so if you wanted to
create XYZ string then you provide that
particular code to your jvm so what does
jvm do it will not directly create that
particular string first it will search
for the XYZ string in your string pull
if that is already existing in your
string pole then it will provide a
reference to that particular string in
case if XYZ is not there then the jvm
will create a new string that is the XYZ
string
so followed by this we have our next
question that is
what is an exception
so the answer for this question is an
exception in Java is considered as an
unexpected event that can disrupt the
normal flow of the program
so for example just consider that you
are going to write a program for
division operator so after you finish
your program your evaluator might want
to test your code to the extreme levels
so instead of providing a proper number
imagine that your evaluator is providing
a wrong input such as special symbols
sometimes 0 or any other sort of input
so if this kind of input is provided to
your program then your program might
crash so you can avoid this kind of
Crash by using exception handling so
basically you can use try and catch
blocks so you can embed your code inside
the try block and say to your program
that if any kind of wrong input such as
special symbol or 0 is provided by the
evaluator then send a message saying
wrong input or divide by zero exception
so this kind of approach will provide an
output but this kind of approach will
avoid your program from crashing so this
is how exceptions are handled in real
time so followed by this we have our
next question
what is final keyword in Java
so the answer for this question is the
term final is a predefined word in Java
that is used while declaring values to
variables when a value is declared using
the final keyword then that particular
value of that particular variable will
remain constant throughout the execution
of program so sometimes if you include a
normal variable and provide an operation
on that particular variable then the
value of that particular variable will
change after the execution of program
but when you declare the same variable
using final keyword then no number of
operations or any kind of manipulations
Applied onto that variable will not
change the value of that particular
variable so that's the specialty of
final keyword in Java so followed by
that we'll dive into the next question
that is what happens when the main
method is not declared as static
so the answer for this question is when
the main method is not declared a static
then the program may be compiled
perfectly but ends up with a serious
ambiguity and throws a runtime error
that says no such method error so when
you basically declare a main method
don't forget to specify the static
keyword
so with this we finish the beginner
segment of questions followed by the
beginners segment we have the next
segment that is the intermediate level
segment
so the first question in the
intermediate level is what is jdk and
mention the variance of jdk
so the answer for this question is so
jdk is basically an abbreviation for
Java development kit this is a combined
package of JRE that is the Java runtime
environment and developer tools used for
Designing Java applications and applets
Oracle has the following variants for
Java development kit so the first one is
the jdk standard edition which is
normally used by beginners and
intermediate developers next after the
jdk standard edition we have the Java
development kit for Enterprise so this
particular Enterprise Edition is used by
professional Java developers for
developing Java based applications and
Frameworks now the last one is the Java
development kit micro Edition now
followed by 21st question we will dive
into the next question that says brief
access specifiers and types of access
specifiers in Java so the answer for
this question is as follows basically
access specifiers are predefined
keywords used to help a Java virtual
machine to understand the scope of a
particular data member or data
manipulating method within a class or
outside the class so in Java we have
four types of access specifiers the
first one is Public Access specifier so
when you declare a data member or a data
manipulating method as public then that
particular data member or method can be
accessible by any class or object
throughout the package
followed by that we have the private
access specifier so unlike the public
access specifier when you provide the
private access specifier then the
accessibility of that particular private
data member or the data manipulating
method will be provided to specific
classes and specific objects only and
finally we have the protected access
specifier so the protected access
specifier is a bit more secure than the
private access specifier so the access
for this particular protected data
member or protected data manipulating
method could be a little more difficult
to access unless you are going to
implement everything which is present in
that particular package so basically if
you are trying to access the protected
data member or protected data
manipulating method of a different
package then you need to First import
the package into your existing package
so that's how the protect access
specifier Works practically so finally
after the major three axis specifiers we
have the default access specifier so
default access specifier will be
provided by the Java virtual machine so
in case if you declare a variable or a
data manipulating method without using
any specific access specifiers that are
public private and protected then jvm
implicitly considers the default access
specifier so there is no much of a
difference between the public access
specifier and the default access
specifier both have the same
functionality and accessibility so
followed by this question we enter into
the next question that is
can a Constructor written a value
so the answer for this question is as
follows yes
our Constructor can written a value it
basically Returns the current instance
of a class implicitly you cannot make a
Constructor written a value explicitly
but automatically it Returns the
instance of a class
so the next question is explain this
keyword in Java so in Java we do have a
keyword which is called as this so what
does the keyword this mean in Java is
the question
so the answer for this question is the
term this is a special keyword
designated as a reference variable so
the term this keyword is used to refer
to the current class properties like
data manipulating method instance data
member and Constructors so followed by
the 24th question we have our next
question that says
explain super keyword in Java so the
answer for this question is as follows
the term super is a special keyword
designated as a reference variable so
similar to this keyword even super
keyword acts as a reference variable but
the difference is super keyword is used
to refer to the immediate parent class
object
so followed by the 25th question we have
our next question that is explain method
overloading in Java so basically method
overloading and Method overriding Etc
are the concepts of polymorphism so now
let's have a correct answer here
so the process of creating multiple
method signatures using one method name
is called as method overloading
so for example consider that you wanted
to include an addition operation in your
program that performs addition operation
so the first method will be having the
name add and inside the method
parameters you'll be having two integer
types of parameters similarly you wanted
to perform another addition operation
with the same name add so here you will
provide the method name completely same
to the first method but inside the
parameters there is a difference you are
adding three parameters here so when you
pass the values to the add method then
which method to be overloaded that's the
confusion right so should I overload or
should I execute the first add method or
the second add method so this completely
depends on the number of parameters you
pass if you are passing two parameters
then the first method will be executed
if you are passing three parameters then
the second method will be executed so
this is how the method overloading
happens in Java
so the process of method overloading can
be achieved by using two different ways
the first way is to change the number of
arguments so that's what exactly I've
discussed before now the second way is
varying the written type of the method
so with this let's enter into the next
question
can we overload a static method
so as discussed before the values of the
variables or data manipulating methods
will not be changed when we have used
the keyword static in front of it so the
question is can we overload a static
method now let's discuss the answer for
this
the answer is no Java does not support
overloading of static method the process
work through an error reading static
method cannot be referenced so followed
by this we have our next question
so the next question is Define late
binding the answer for this question is
binding is a process of unifying the
method called with the methods code
segment
late binding happens when the methods
code segment is unknown till the method
is called during the runtime
so followed by this we have our next
question Define dynamic method dispatch
so the answer is the dynamic method
dispatch is a process where the method
call is executed during the runtime the
overridden method is called through a
reference variable of superclass so this
process is called as runtime
polymorphism
now we have our next question why is
delete function faster in linked list
than an array so basically linked list
and array are the Java Collections or in
other words it's also considered as data
structure so to answer this question you
need to understand the analogy of linked
list and array so basically an array is
um complete memory block of consecutive
memory locations so consider that your
memory location starts from 100 and your
array has 10 locations so it's a
complete Reserve block of from 100 101
102 to 109 so you have 10 memory blocks
so in case if you wanted to add a number
or a delete a number then you had to
make changes to the complete memory
block but when you come into linked list
you have the memory blocks used from the
memory Heap so basically what you do
here is you basically connect the nodes
through addresses
so in case if you wanted to eliminate a
number then what you do is just to
manipulate the addresses so the address
of the consecutive node will be changed
so that's the only change what you make
so now
this is the reason why the delete
function or any kind of manipulation
function is faster in linked list
compared to array
so now let's have a briefed answer on
this delete function is faster and
linked list as the user needs to make a
minor update to the pointer value so
that the node can point to the next
successor in the list
now followed by this we have our next
question
give a briefing on the life cycle of a
thread
so the life cycle of a thread includes
five stages which are as mentioned below
newly born state runnable state that is
it provides the jvm with a feedback that
I am ready to run now followed by that
the running stage where the threat is
actually running followed by that the
block stage so basically the thread will
be blocked for some reasons for some
intermediate output or something if the
thread is waiting for an input from
another source or as something similar
so that's where the blocked State comes
to existence and finally the dead State
once after everything is processed the
thread is eliminated by gvm now followed
by this we have our next question that
says
explain the differences between
The Operators provided here
so the operators might look similar but
they are different now let's understand
about these operators in a much better
way through the answer so the answer for
this question is although they look
similar but there's a huge difference
between them so the first operator which
looks like 2 greater than symbols
perform the operation of right shifting
so when you provide a binary number or
binary value then the bits will be
shifted towards the right and the second
symbol or the second operator which is
having three greater than symbols is
used to shift out the zero filled bits
so this is the functionality of these
two operators now followed by that let's
have the 33rd question
brief the life cycle of an applet
so the answer for this question is the
life cycle of an appellate basically
involves the following stages the first
stage is the initialization stage next
is the start stage third is the stop
stage fourth is destroy and finally we
have paint
now the next question is why are
generics used in Java
so the answer for this question is
compile time type safety is provided by
using generics in Java so this approach
allows the users to catch unnecessary
invalid inputs at the time of
compilation generate methods and classes
help programmers to specify a single
method declaration a set of related
methods or with a single class
declaration a set of related types
so followed by this we have our next
question
explain
externalizable interface
so the answer for this question is the
externalizable interface helps with the
control over the process of
serialization the externalization
interface incorporates read external and
write external methods so we have
listened to a new term here which is
serialization so what exactly is
serialization
serialization is a process of sending
your Java code or Java project from one
computer system to a different computer
system so basically if you wanted to
execute some kind of java program from a
different location then you serialize
this particular code to a different
location where you actually want to
execute and this particular process of
transferring your code is called as
serialization
now the next question is explain demon
thread so the answer for this question
is the demon threat can be defined as a
thread with least responsibility the
demon threat is designed to run in a
background during the process of garbage
collection in Java the set Daemon method
is used to create the demon thread in
Java programming language
so we have our next question now explain
the term enumeration in Java
so the answer for this question is
enumeration or enum is an interface in
Java enum allows the sequential axis of
elements stored in a collection in Java
now the next question is
why is Java considered as a dynamic
programming language
so the answer for this question is Java
was designed to adapt to an evolving
environment Java programs include large
amount of runtime information that is
actually used to resolve access to the
objects in real time so this is the
reason why Java is considered as dynamic
programming language now followed by
this we have our next question
can you run a call before executing the
main method so the answer for this
question is yes we can execute any code
even before the main method we will be
using the static block off code in the
class when creating the objects at load
time of the class any statements within
the static block of the code will
execute it once while loading the class
even before the creation of objects in
the main method
now the last question in the
intermediate section is how many times
the finalized method is called so the
answer for this question is the finalize
method is called by the garbage
collector so for every object the
garbage collector calls the finalized
method just for once
now with this let's enter the advanced
segment of interview questions based on
Java
so the first question in the advanced
segment is can the keywords this and
super be used together so the answer for
this question is
no this and super keywords should be
used in the first statement in the class
Constructor so the following code
segment will give you a better idea
so you can see that we have used the
keyword super and this in the class
Constructor that is the first class
Constructor
now this is how you can use super
keyword and this keyword together in
case if you wanted to use so with this
let's continue with the next question in
the advanced level
so the next question says explain JSP
page so the answer for this question is
JSP is basically an abbreviation for
Java servlet page so the Java servlet
page consists of two types of text the
first is the static data and the second
one is Java servlet page elements
now the next question is
explain
jdbc so the answer is jdbc is an
abbreviation for Java database connector
jdbc is an abstract layer used to
establish connectivity between any
existing database and to a Java
application
next question is
explain the various direct tests of JSP
so the directives are instructions
processed by JSP engine after the JSP
page is compiled into a servlet
directives are used to set page level
instructions insert data from external
files and specify custom tag libraries
directives are defined between the
following symbols so these are the
symbols that are used to specify the
directives in a JSP page the different
types of directives are shown as below
there are three types of directives they
are include directive page directive and
taglab directive so include directive
includes a file and merges the content
of the file with the current page the
page directive is used to define
specific attributes in the JSP page like
error page and buffer the taglib
directory is used to declare a custom
tag Library which is used in the JSP
page followed by that we have the next
question
what are Observer and observable classes
so the answer for this question is
objects that subclass the observable
class maintain a list of observers when
an observable object is updated it
invokes the update method of each of the
observers to notify that The Observers
that it has changed its state
The Observer interface is implemented by
objects that observe observable objects
might be a little confusing but you need
to read this answer once again you can
pause it and you can read this answer
once again so that you can get a brief
understanding of this
followed by that we have the next
question what is session Management in
Java so the answer for this question is
a session is essentially defined as the
dynamic stage of a random conversation
between the client and the server the
essential Communication channel includes
the string of responses and requests
from both sides typically the most
popular way of implementing session
management is the employment of a
session ID in the communicative
discourse of the client and the server
the next question is brief about spring
framework spring framework is basically
the framework of Frameworks now the
answer for this question is spring is
essentially defined as the application
framework and inversion of control
container for Java basically the chief
purpose of spring framework is to create
Enterprise applications in Java also it
is especially useful to keep in mind
that the central features of the Sprint
framework are essentially conductive to
any Java application
so the next question is explain jca in
Java so the answer for this question is
jca is basically an abbreviation for
Java cryptography architecture so jca
provides a platform that gives
architecture and apis for encryption as
well as decryption jca is used by the
developer to combine the application
with the security measure it also helps
in performing the third-party security
rules it uses the hash table encryption
message digest Etc to implement the
security so the next question is
explain j p a in Java so the answer for
this question is jpa stands as an
abbreviation for Java persistence API
the jpa is enabling us to create the
persistence layer for desktop and web
applications
jpa deals with the following
Java persistence API query language Java
persistence criteria API object mapping
metadata Etc
so the last question in our list is
explain the different authentications in
Java servers so the answer for this
question is authentication options
available in servlets are as follows the
first one is basic authentication so the
basic authentication consists of
username and password provided by the
client to authenticate as the user the
second one is form based authentication
in this particular type of
authentication the login form is made by
the programmer by using HTML
followed by that we have the third type
of authentication that is digest
authentication digest authentication is
similar to basic authentication but in
this the passwords are encrypted using
hash formula this makes digest more
secured and lastly we have the client
certificate authentication the client
certificate authentication requires that
each client accessing the resource has a
certificate that it sends to
authenticate itself this requires SSL
protocol
hello and welcome to python interview
questions my name is Richard kirschner
with the simply learned team that's
www.simplylearn.com get certified get
ahead certainly the questions we're
going to ask in here are very general
with a few specifics towards data
science since that's the main direction
that Python's going in and you'd want to
expand your questions for your interview
depending on the domain that you're
using the python in specifically let's
dive in and get started with some python
interview questions number one what is
the difference between shallow copy and
deep copy and you can see with shallow
copy we have object one which has child
one child two child three and so on and
object two which has child one child two
child three a deep copy creates a
different object and populates it with
the child objects of the original object
therefore changes in the original object
is not reflected in the copy copy.deep
copy creates a deep copy shallow copy
creates a different object and populates
it with the red references of the child
objects within the original object
therefore changes in the original object
is reflected in the copy copy.copy
creates a shallow copy and you can look
at this if we make a change to child one
it's only a pointer so if you make it in
object one and it changes to child one
and object one it will also make that
change in object two number two how is
multi-threading achieved in Python oh
this is a good one with multi-processing
and multi-threading this question is
actually asking you do you know the
difference between multi-processing and
multi-threading and how multi-threading
Works multi-threading usually implies
that multiple threads are executed
concurrently the python Global
interpreter lock doesn't allow more than
one thread to hold the python
interpreter at that particular point of
time so multi-threading and python is
achieved through context switching it's
very different than multi-processing
which actually opens up multiple
processes across multiple threads so
multi-threading discuss the Django
architecture so the Django architecture
and the first thing to know is that the
Django is a web service way to build
your web pages basically and so when you
look at the architecture you can see
here we have a nice model drawn out
where the user initiates the Django
which initiates the URL which initiates
the view what they're going to view and
you have your model and your template so
the model of data whatever data model
you're pulling goes into the template
and then goes back up the pipeline to
the user and the important thing to note
is there's a template the front end of
the web page this is what they're going
to see there's a model the back end
where the data is stored so you can keep
the template and the looks and
everything looks the same but you can
swap out the underlying formation that
goes into that template then you have
your view which interacts with the model
and template and Maps it to the URL and
then the Django serves the page to the
user so your Django grabs it and says
okay thank you for the URL and here you
go user what advantage does numpy array
have over a nested list so numpy's a
module you import all almost always see
numpy import numpy as in p numpy is
written in C such that all its
complexities are backed into a simple to
use module lists on the other hand are
dynamically typed therefore python must
check the data type of each element
every time it uses it this makes number
arrays much faster than lists I would
also add in that numpy has a lot of
additional functionality that you don't
have in lists there's a lot of things
you can automate in the numpy quick flip
over to our jupyter notebook any IDE
will work if you're going to do a set of
interview questions taking a quick look
at code is always important we have our
import numpy as NP we'll go ahead and
import time here's our list list sub for
Iron Range of 100 and what we're doing
is we're going to time it so we're going
to create a list then we're going to
create a numpy zeros array and you can
see here look how quick you can create
this numpy zeros array here we are
appending one zero at a time for a
regular python list and here we are with
numpy they're all zeros and they're all
all of type integer I believe it's
either floater integer on this I'd have
to actually do a type on it and then so
if we take in and we create a tl1 time
equals time and then we do for I and
range of 100 for J in range of 100 L of
I J equals L of i j plus five so we're
just doing a simple calculation on our
array and sub arrays this is an array of
rays and we'll do the same thing with
tl2 tl2 time dot time tl1 equals so here
we have our final time on that and then
we'll do this with an array array op and
this is what I really love a equals a
plus 10 and then you can just print it
right out so you can see right here with
the numpy array I'm doing the same thing
if I run this our time is significantly
different here we have 0.09 and 0.003 so
you can see that the time drops
significantly when you're running this
on a numpy array versus a list array
also important to note these times
aren't going to be they'll change each
time I run it depending on what I have
running in the background so there we go
number 5. what is pickling and
unpickling amazes me how many times I
pickle and unpickle something converting
a python object hierarchy to a byte
stream is called pickling pickling is
also referred to as serialization
unpickling converting a byte stream to a
python object hierarchy is also called
unpickling and pickling is also referred
to as deserialization so if you just
created a neural network model you can
now save that model to your hard drive
pickle it and then you can unpickle it
to bring it back into another software
program or to use at a later time how is
memory managed in Python number six
python has a private Heap space where it
stores all the objects the python memory
manager manages various aspects of this
Heap like sharing caching segmentation
and allocation the user has no control
over the Heap only the python
interpreter has the access you have a
nice little diagram here here's your
program there's your interpreter we have
our Heap memory management on the
garbage collector going off of there
number seven are arguments in Python
pass by value or by reference arguments
are passed in Python by reference this
means that any change made within a
function is reflected on the original
object so you can see here def function
of l l of zero equals three L equals one
two three four function L print L and
you're going to get three two three four
because we've passed l in there so it's
a pointer here we have def function l l
equals three two three four L equals one
two three four function of L print L
because in this function I have assigned
instead of operating on a piece of L the
list I've consigned a whole new value to
that list or L it then at that points
will create a new object so if I make
changes to the object it's going to
change it in the outside the definition
if I use a variable and I assign it a
completely new value like L equals three
two three four that will not show up
when you're outside the function number
eight how would you Generate random
numbers in Python to generate not random
numbers in Python you must first import
the random module the random function
generates a random float value between 0
and 1. the random range function
generates a random number within a given
range and you can see here one is the
lower end tends the upper end and step
two so it'd be one three five and so on
as far as the options in the random
generation number nine what does the
double forward slash operator do in
Python the forward slash operator
performs Division and Returns the
quotient in float for example five over
two returns 2.5 to do a double forward
slash operator on the other hand Returns
the quotient in integer for example five
double slash returns two five divided by
two and you drop the point five number
ten what does the is operator do the is
operator compares the ID of the two
objects and you can see in here where
list one equals brackets around one two
three list one equals list two equals
true and you have the double equals in
Python of course and you can do list one
is list two where list two equals one
two three is false this two is not the
brackets one two three it equals it but
it's not the brackets and if we do list
three equals list one then list one is
list three equals true number eleven
what is the purpose of pass statement
the past statement is used when there's
a syntactic but not an operational
requirement for example the program
below prints a string ignoring the
spaces and so here we have variable
equals simply learn we've added two
spaces in it for I and variable so it
goes through each eye if I equals space
do nothing else print I and then we'll
have the end equals bracket bracket and
they'll print out Simply learn now of
course you would probably write this if
I just does not equal blank space print
but this would be another way you could
do that if you need a placeholder for
that first logical set or that first
area you can also do a function like
this you could do function whatever your
def function name brackets colon pass so
it goes into the function and does
nothing but it's a placeholder number 12
how will you check all the characters in
a string are alphanumeric python has an
inbuilt method is all number which
returns true if all characters in The
String are alpha numeric and so you can
see here A B C D one two three is all
number output equals true and the second
line a b c d the at symbol one two three
the pound symbol is all new output
equals false so really just want to know
about is all new all numerical
alphanumerical number 12 how will you
check if all characters in a string are
alphanumeric so here we go if you know
is all a number which returns that the
characters in The String are
alphanumeric one can also use rejects
instead and so we have Boolean re match
what's important about this is to note
your capital a dash to capital z a
lowercase to dash to Z 0 to 9 means that
that array includes all of those the way
they have it written out plus a dollar
sign and then we have what we're
comparing it to the string we're
comparing to the ABCD one two three and
so we can do an re dot match and if it
matches if all these things if all the
different entities in that array matches
the first one we get an output true and
if not an output false number 13 how
will you merge elements in a sequence
sequence there are three types of
sequences in Python there's lists tuples
and strings python equation makes this
easy if we have a list one and list two
and list one is square brackets one
comma two comma three list two is four
five and six we can simply do list one
plus list two and our output is one two
three four five six if we have tuples
your Tuple is the curve brackets
designates it and again just add them
together same thing with strings we have
simply learn S1 plus S2 equals simply
learn number 14 how will you remove all
leading white space in a string python
provides the inbuilt function L strip to
remove all leading axis from a string
and you can see here space space python
dot L strip leading strip Python and you
can also do strip which relieves leading
and ending of course there's also the
ending set number 15 how will you
replace all occurrences of a substring
with a new string the replace function
can be used with strings for replacing a
substring with a given string syntax
string dot replace old comma new comma
count replace returns a new string
without modifying the original string
hey John how are you John question mark
replace John with capital j o h n one
and then you can see right here hey John
how are you and since we designated with
the one just says we're only going to
replace one of these 16 what is the
difference between Del and remove
brackets on lists Del for delete Dell
removes all elements of a list within a
given range syntax Dell list start to
end remove remove brackets removes the
first occurrence of a particular
character syntax list remove element and
we see a nice example over here if we
delete the list one to three it will
delete the first in this case b one two
it doesn't do three remember that one
two so it will delete B and C and you
end up with a d where if we do remove B
from the list and we have an a b b d
it's only going to remove the first B
number 17 how to display the contents of
text file in reverse order open the file
using the open function store the
contents of the file into a list reverse
the contents of the list run a for Loop
to iterate through the list number 18.
differential between append and extend
append adds an element to the end of the
list you can see right here we have just
one two three four and we have pin four
and we end up with an output one two
three four and extend adds an element
from an interval to the end of the list
and we have here list equals one two
three list dot extend four five six
output is one two three four five six so
if you want to append an array to the
end of another array you want to use the
extend number 19 what's the output of
the below code justify your answer this
is a great interview question because
these are the kind of things that come
up when you're proofing code def add to
list value and list so we have value in
and a list in or List equals empty in
this case an empty list list data pin
value return list list one equals add to
list one list two equals add to list one
two three empty bracket list three
equals add to list a and then we want to
print them list one equals and you can
see the formatting we have a placeholder
list one list two and list three so when
a prints list will one we get 1 comma a
and what you want to notice here is that
list one and list three are equal why
are they equal well when we passed the
information to the add to list we passed
value without passing the list equals
brackets without passing a second value
what this means is that list as we have
it if you don't have a list it'll start
off with empty list which we append the
1 2 the second one list two we appended
a value to an empty list so it's only
going to be one two three doesn't matter
what the list was before we've already
assigned an empty list and then list
three here's the tricky one we're adding
a to the list but because we didn't
designate the list list is a shared
value in other words it doesn't reset it
and we end up with list one equals list
three one comma a default list is
created only once during the function
and not during its call number 20 what
is the difference between a list and a
tuple list are mutable while tuples are
immutable and you can see an example
down here where I have list equals one
two three square brackets denote it's a
list list of two equals four and I print
it out I now have one two four if I do
the same thing with the Tuple I get an
error because you can't change the Tuple
one two three into one two four you have
to completely reassign Tuple to a new
value what is Doc string in Python doc
strings are used in providing
documentation to various python modules
classes functions and methods and so you
can see here we have def for a function
add a b and this is a doc string we have
the triple brackets on there you can add
carriage return in that so that you can
go multiple lines and it says this
function adds two numbers and then sum a
b returns some and so we have down here
two different ways of accessing this
function output accessing docstring
method one this function adds two
numbers accessing dockstring method two
help on function add in model Main this
function adds two numbers and so you can
see the code down here has two very
different in values the second one is
basically a help menu there's our help
menu number 22 how to use print without
the new line the solution to this
depends on the python version you are
using in Python version 2 you can do
print Hi and then you add a comma
afterwards print how are you and you
have Hi how are you in version 3 print
hi comma end equals and it'll add a
space on the end there you can put
different characters in there but
generally just want to put a space put a
space on the End Print how are you and
now we get Hi how are you number 23 how
do you use the split function in Python
the split function splits a string into
a number of strings based on a specific
delimiter so we have string split
delimiter comma Max the maximum number
of splits the character based on which
the string is the split by default is
space so here we have an example we have
a very variable red blue green orange
and we want to split it by commas and we
only want to do the first two so if we
print the list now you'll find it has
red blue and only spread it split it the
first two times and it gets to the third
one and just groups them all together
green and orange if you leave the two
off you'll split the whole thing number
24 is python object oriented or
functional programming python follows
object oriented Paradigm and you should
really know in depth what they mean by
object-oriented Paradigm if you're doing
any interview for scripting languages
python allows the creation of objects
and is manipulation through specific
methods it supports most of the features
of oops which as inheritance on a
polymorphism so you have an object and
you can inherit all the traits of that
object and then add new traits in or
alter some of those traits that's what
object oriented means python follows
functional programming Paradigm
functions may be used as first class
object python supports Lambda functions
which are characteristic of functional
Paradigm so you can and set a variable
to a function as opposed to setting it
to an object number 25 write a function
prototype that takes variable number of
arguments here we have def function name
list so we could have in this case
whatever the list is Def function the
asterisk denotes so we're going to take
multiple arguments of a variable and we
can do for I and VAR print I so if you
send function of one you'll end up with
a one function one two five six it'll
actually print those out one at a time
the first one just prints out a one
because it only sent one variable the
second one will print one another line
25 another line 6. number 26 what is
asterisk args and asterisks quarks args
used in function prototype to accept
varying number of arguments it's an
iterable object death function arcs and
you can imagine it's just a basic list
so if I send add the numbers a comma b
or a comma B comma C it doesn't really
matter it will have that number of
objects in it whatever I send to it and
there's other uses for it but that's
very basic quarks I can actually tell it
what I want to send so used in a
function prototype and to accept varying
number of keyworded arguments it's in
both our iterable objects so you can go
through them one at a time and the def
function chords you can now set like
color equals red units equal two so
you'll see that especially in machine
learning there's a lot of like they'll
have inline equals true that kind of
thing number 27 in Python functions are
first class objects what do you
understand from this this means I could
return a function if you want to move it
from another function I could create a
function and treat it just like an
object I can assign it to a variable I
can pass them as arguments to other
functions number 28 what is the output
of print nay underscore underscore name
justify your answer the double
underscore name double underscore is a
special variable that holds the name of
the current module program execution
starts from main or a code with zero
indentation thus double underscore name
double underscore name has a value
double underscore main double underscore
in the above case if the file is
imported from another module then double
underscore name underscore double
underscore holds the name of this module
number 29 what is a numpy array and we
briefly touched numpy array compared to
a list early in processing speed now
let's go ahead and look at some of the
more specifics a numpy array is a grid
of values all of the same type so if
they're either all float all integer all
string and is indexed by a tuple of
non-negative integers the number of
Dimensions is the rank of the array and
the shape of an array is a tuple of
integers giving the size of the array
along each Dimension number 30 what is
the difference between matrices and
arrays a matrix comes from linear
algebra and is a two-dimensional
representation of data it comes with a
power powerful set of mathematical
operations that allow you to manipulate
the data in interesting ways now arrays
an array is a sequence of objects of
similar data type an array within
another array forms a matrix like we
said here two-dimensional so if you have
an array of three by four that would be
a matrix number 31 how to get indexes of
n maximum values in a numpy array of
course the first thing to do is to
import your numpy as NP you don't
necessarily have to use MP but that is
the most standard use of numpy we create
our array equals an NP dot array of one
two three four five and then if we want
to get our indexes of n at maximum
values in an empty array we can do one
way to do it is to take our array sort
it then do minus in colon that means
we're going to do once you've sorted it
you can do minus in in would equal then
the number of indices so it's not the
actual letter N colon and really this is
about understanding this notation that
we can sort it so it goes from lowest to
biggest and then we can get the top
values for n indexes and then we have
our final set of brackets with the minus
one on there number 32 how would you
obtain the resulting set from the train
set and the test set from below and
let's go ahead and look at the two
different variables we have train set
equals an array of one two three test
set equals a numpy of Ray of arrays we
have 0 1 2 1 2 3. what's important here
is that one it's a numpy so that leaves
a out and then we're stuck with three
other options and I'm going to say that
D is out none of these and let's look at
NP dot concatenate versus NP dot vstack
concatenate would put one set after the
other so you would end up with probably
give you an error because one set is one
two three and then we're going to
concatenate array 0 1 2 and 1 array one
two three the array of arrays onto the
into that what we really want to do is
stack and by the ways you can actually
switch there's variables you can put
into concatenate obviously that can
change this so you could use the
concatenate with a lot of fudging around
but really we're looking for is v-stack
v stands for vertical versus the H deck
which is horizontal and if we do a
v-stack we can simply do train set comma
test set and stack them together and so
we have C resulting set equals np.vstack
train stack test set both option A and B
would do horizontal stacking but we
would like to have the vertical stacking
option she does this again you could add
the axes in and use the concatenate to
stack it the correct way number 33 how
would you import a decision Tree
classifier in sklearn We have
sklearn.decision tree import decision
tree classifier from sklearn Ensemble
import decision tree classifier and we
look at these and they're all import
decision tree classifier that actually
last part happens to be correct and it's
really just a vocabulary knowing where
is the decision tree classifier stored
what module is that a part of and it is
of course part of the sklearn.tree
number c number 34 you have uploaded the
data set in CSV format on Google
spreadsheet and shared it publicly how
can you access this in Python what's
important here is to know that we can
read stuff with pandas so we don't show
it here but you can there's actually a
number of ways to do this what's
important here is to know a couple
things one we have our link generated
from the Google Docs and spreadsheets
and then we can do a string IO dot
string IO request get link dot content
so there's our source and then finally
we know that pandas can read a CSV
there's obviously many ways to read a
CSV but data equals pd.read underscore
CSV Source number 35 what is the
difference between the two data series
given below below we have DF name and DF
location colon comma brackets around
name comma where and then we have DF
equals PD data frame a a b b x x u u
comma 21 1650 33 columns equal name and
age so let's take a look and see what
they're looking at we have just glancing
at the questions they want to know is it
the original data frame or is it the
copy of the data frame and you can see
here that one is view the original data
frame and two is a copy of the original
data frame two is a view of the original
data frame and one is a copy original
data frame both are copies both are
views and if you're working with pandas
you know that unless you specifically in
certain things tell it to do it inline
and a lot of functions don't allow you
that you're always taking a slice and it
is always a copy so C both are copies of
the original data frame number 36 you
get the following error while trying to
read a file temp.csv using pandas which
of the following could correct it so
here's our error Trace back most recent
call last file in input Line 1 and
module Unicode encode error ASCII codex
can't encode character oh I hate it when
that one comes up and we have four
different entries we'll go ahead and
just pretend that D doesn't exist unless
we really can't fit it into one of the
other answers and the first one is PD
read CSV has our file compression equals
gzip well gzip is just an unzipping and
you actually get a zip error on there
the second one is dialect equals string
again not an encoding or coding setup
and then we have encoding equals utf-8
well that would be the encoding error
switching it from the character code
there's utf-8 there is Unicode that's
the most common two that goes between so
really this is about understanding the
difference between a utf-8 coding and a
unit code and the error that comes up
quite regularly with that number c
encoding should be utf-8 number 37 how
to set a line with in a plot given below
so looking at this we have import
matplot Library Pi plot is PLT and you
should know your way around this how to
do a plot in there
plt.plot1234 plot equals show and so
this is a little bit of a vocabulary
test the vocabulary is at width equals
three line width equals three LW equals
three or something else and the
vocabulary word that we're looking for
is LW equals three which stands for line
width in pi plot Library Pi plot Number
38 how would you reset the index of a
data frame to a given list so this is a
vocabulary Challenge and understanding
what re-indexing is re-indexing as we
have the different values here we have
the first one which is reset the index
well we're not really resetting the
index re-index number b means we're
double checking our indexes to the
column and to the main index and so the
values match correctly where re-index
like now brings in a new index outside
of our data frame to a given list so
let's from external and thus the
vocabulary word like is our key word
that it's external and we have a data
frame to a given list number 39 how can
you copy objects in Python the functions
used to copy objects in Python we have
copy copy for shallow copying and copy
deep copying for deep copy number 40
what is the difference between range and
X range functions in Python well this is
a good one we have matrixes and arrays
with a matrix the range returns a python
list object X range returns an X range
object and with arrays an x-ray returns
an X range object X range creates values
as you need them through yielding the
key here is that X range Returns the
values as you need them so it actually
processes it post like if you have for x
or for a variable in X range it is
processing them as you need them zero to
nine it doesn't create an array zero to
nine it just hands you zero then one two
three four one at a time number 41. how
can you check whether a panda's data
frame is empty or not the tribute DF dot
empty is used to check whether a panda's
data frame is empty or not and so you
can simply create a we have down here
importer pandas is PD we create our
Panda's data frame equal to an empty
array and is DF dot empty comes out as
true one of the catches you got to
remember with these vocabularies is with
empty along with some other pandas set
up whether you need the brackets or not
at the end number 42 write the code to
sort an array in numpy by the N minus 1
column this can be achieved using ARG
sort function let's take an array X then
to sort the N minus one column the code
will be X to X to colon n minus two dot
args sort so let's see what that code
looks like we import numpy as NP we'll
create our array our numpy array which
is uh one two three zero five two two
three four so we have three different
entities with three different columns in
there and we go X of X and so we take X
of all the rows first entity well in
this case it's actually the second one
because it's zero one two dot ARG sort
so that would be the second entity or
minus two would also be the same you
could also do instead of one you could
also do minus two there instead of the
one our sort and then we get an output
of the array one two three zero five two
two three four number 43 how to create a
series from a list numpy array and
dictionary so we'll go ahead and input
import our numpy or pandas and have my
list and you see here we have my list
equals list of a b c d e f g over all
the way through so my list now makes a
list of that for array we have NP dot a
range to 26 my dictionary will create a
dictionary with a zip my list my
arguments so I'll just use the numpy
array we just created with my array to
go into the dictionary and the solution
is simple with the PD dot series my list
pd.series my array PD dot series my
dictionary so it's all about knowing the
dot Capital s-e-r-i-e-s don't forget
that capitalization number 44 how to get
the items not common to both series a
and series B and you can see here we
have instead of series A and B we have
series one and two and we have one two
three four five four five six seven
eight the solution is we take a panda
series we have a series U equals a panda
series NP Union one dimension series one
series two so we can now make a union of
them we now have series one Panda series
with an intersection and then we can
remove one from the other series U is
series U dot is in series one so if the
union is not in the intersection then
you know it's a unique value a little
bit of logic going on there and playing
with three different terms to get the
answer we want 45 how to keep only the
top two most frequent values as it is
and replace everything else as other in
a series so again we're working with
pandas because if you're talking series
and data frames that means we're working
with pandas so we're going to import
pandas as PD we'll go ahead and create
our Panda series we're going to do that
by creating a numpy random random State
100 so 100 in the numpy one and then we
have our Panda series you can see here
where random integer numpy random random
integer one comma five by twelve and so
the solution for this is we go ahead and
we've created a PD remember the capital
S Series solution we're going to print
the top two frequencies and that is our
series dot value counts and then we take
series values count dot index of up to
two so we're going to take everything up
to two and then we'll do the series is
in so if it's not in the first two then
it's going to equal other and this would
be something you'd want to write down on
paper if you're if it looks confusing
take a moment pause the video write this
down and see if you can figure out how
the logic came together and try to throw
yourself a couple other little logic
puzzles like this number 46 how to find
the positions of numbers that are
multiples of three from a series and in
here we're actually going to use a numpy
to solve it the first part series lets
you know it's going to be a panda series
and if we come down here we have NP dot
ARG where this is a vocabulary question
series with remember the percentile 3 is
the remainder so if the remainder equals
zero then we're going to generate that
ring where the object divided by three
equals zero has no remainder so then we
know it's a multiple of three number 47
how to compute the euclidean distance
between two series and this one's really
cool because we have our Panda series uh
p and Q and what I like about this one
is they give us two solutions you can go
with and really you should kind of know
both the first one would be yes you know
what the euclidean distance is and that
is we can take the first series minus
the second series squared and then sum
them up and then we do the square root
which is the same as taking the power to
0.5 doing the power to 0.5 is easier
than doing the square root so a lot of
times you'll see that as a switch but
you could have also done the square root
and use the math in there so there's
solution one you should know your
euclidean distance and then solution two
is the numpy solution so we have NP dot
Lin alga.norm that's how we're going to
computer our euclidean distance P minus
Q very elegant and very straightforward
and easy to compute number 48 how to
reverse the rows of data frame so here
we have our data frame we're going to
create a numpy array by 25 shape it five
minus one when this creates a 25 by 25
data frame and so our solution is to do
the DFI location and this is just
understanding how steps work the steps
you have your colon colon -1 so we're
taking all the rows all the columns
minus one so our stepping minus one
going the reverse Direction and then
we're just going to use across all the
different columns on there let me say
that again the first colon is going to
be your row starting row stopping row
step minus one that's all this is about
is it step minus one comma and then all
the columns 49 if you split your data
into train test splits is it possible to
overfit your model and the answer is yes
is definitely possible one common
beginner mistake is retuning a model or
training new models with different
parameters after seeing its performance
on the test set my favorite example of
this is you have your script put
together and you keep hitting the a
re-run button until you get the answer
you want not taking the answer it first
gave you or running it over an array and
recording all the answers to see how
they vary number 50 which python library
is built on top of matplot library and
pandas to ease data plotting the answer
this is Seaborn Seabourn is a data
visualization library in Python that
provides a high level interface for
drawing statistical information
informative graphs and with that we have
come to an end of this session on coding
