science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get get started now today we will try to
build an activity tracker using
Microsoft Excel so I have opened my
Microsoft Excel here you can see I have
some tests so we've all been through
this right you might have n number of
tasks for a day and you might get
confused which to prioritize and which
not to and which is the one which is
having the highest priority and should
be closed within a few hours right we
all face that so for that one reason I
have made this particular activity
tracker for day in Microsoft T so you
can have any number of jobs so I have
added some jobs here so not a particular
names I've just named as numbers number
3 four five we have 15 jobs here and
they respective priorities if it is high
low or medium if it's high you can have
a command like reporting your month- on
Monon report to your manager or your
client and if it's slow you can just
your daily activity like you know uh
regularizing your attendance or writing
an marketing email to your client or
something like that which has low
priority or it's already done it could
be something like that right so some of
the tasks like uh taking an interview or
scheduling an interview for your team
member or something like that which is
uh in progress and maybe yet to be done
and has medium priority because let's
say your interview is in the upcoming
month or upcoming week so you still have
some time to breathe right so it may
have some medium priorities something
like that so you can categorize your
task based on the priority based on the
time constraints and importance right so
high medium or low and accordingly you
can add your command to uh understand
what exactly you need to do within what
time period and what the status and
everything right based on that you also
have another column to uh notify the
status of that particular task so you
can U check if it's done or in progress
and accordingly you can select that
particular option and here you also have
the data validation option where you can
select high priority medium priority low
priority right and here you have the
options so how many done tasks are there
how many in progress tasks are there and
how many tasks are there that needs to
be started yet and based on that if
you're in the safe Zone which is done
and uh some some of the which is in in
progress can be blue so you're in safe
zone right so based on that you can
create a bar graph like this and you can
understand how safe your you are so
maybe it was showing done as orange so
maybe okay so there is some color coding
to be done here not a problem you can do
that so basically that's how you can
create at uh and daily activity tracker
so this is already done and this
particular workbook will be attached in
the uh description box below if you want
this template to use for your day-to-day
task but now let's try to create an all
new daily activity tracker in sheet
number two from scratch so that you can
understand how exactly I've created it
right so without further delay let's get
started I'll just quickly borrow the
column headers from the previous sheet
so we will be needing serial task
priority commands and Status so we will
quickly copy and paste them right over
here so we have copied them and we have
pasted them right here right so uh tasks
you can have a pretty much good length
for that so that you can name the task
and now we're just writing them as uh
job one job two so it's okay to have
minimum L and for commments you can also
have some space de bre where you can
write down some important notes about
your comments right so for now let's uh
add uh maybe like 15 task just like we
did in the previous one let's repli try
to replicate that particular one right
so you can use Flash Fill here so
accordingly it will give you the number
of uh jobs you need so we have uh 15 Tas
which we're trying to replicate the same
one and has you can also use Flash Fill
here job one job two so now select both
the uh cells and here you can have a
Flash Fill logo highlighted so you can
just click on the green box double click
and you have it there and uh stat this
and comments so you can also have
comments here comment one and
comment
to again you can use make user Flash for
that select both the cells and you will
have individual commands for your
individual jobs now what we left out
with the priority and status now we are
going to make use of some data
validation so that we have a drop down
option to select a particular priority
for the task and select a particular
status for the task if it's done in
progress or maybe uh yet to start right
so we're trying to replicate the same
table that we had before so what you can
do is simply select the first cell from
the priority column go to the option of
uh data and here you can see uh the data
tools group and that you can see the
data validation and click on data
validation go to the first one settings
and here you will choose list so you can
either give a source or you can just
write down simply uh
high medium
and low right and those are the options
in case if you have multiple maybe 10 to
15 uh priority things or something it
can be right in case if you're one of
them which has multiple priorities then
you can create a new sheet and you can
write down all your priorities and get
the source range for now I am just
having three so I'll just write them
down here and you have a drop down menu
now you can use the flashold option here
as well just drag them to the bottom
cell and you have them right so whenever
you select an option you have the
priority and similarly before we add the
priority let's also add the status using
the same technique of data validation so
I'll go into Data validation I'll select
rest and here I'll add done in progress
and yet to be
started right so these are my three
options and again I can make use of
flash F and draag them the L cell here
there you go and you'll have the options
now accordingly we'll have some random
priorities uh I'll take high and
alternatively we can have some high
priority tasks like we will also have
other options medium so we will copy
some medium priority tasks and paste
them and we'll also select some low
priority task which can be considered
as in progress or maybe having some time
or maybe done right so we will have them
here and done so we have our priorities
sorted and Status so we will have some
in progress for all the high and medium
so wherever you find medium or high you
can have progress or yet to be started
so we will have some yet to be started
uh high priority tasks medium priority
as well and we will have some tasks
which are already done right so that you
have a Tracker so uh you can make use of
data validation to have some options so
if and whenever your task is done you
can mark it as done and if and whenever
your task is in progress you can mark it
as in progress or yet to be started
right so you can also uh do some
customization to your table like adding
some colors or something like that to
make it look a little better so you can
also have some cage if you want or you
can just go to the view option and here
you can design table something like that
right so you can go to the format table
thing now if you want to highlight your
task like if say if it's in high Market
as red if it's in medium Market is blue
if it's in low Market is green that you
can also do that through conditional
repeat you can also do that through
conditional formatting go to conditional
formatting in home add a new rule SS
that contain only select self value as
specific text and uh type high and go to
format and here you can select any shade
of red and select this one and press
okay and go to conditional formatting
once again select a new rule
and cell that contains and select cell
value as specific text if it's
medium you can go to the format option
and here you can select a color for that
maybe blue and uh press okay and again
go to conditional formatting new tool
and sell that contains select cell value
for a specific text and for low you can
keep it as maybe a shade of green that
will make it look better so that you can
feel that it's comfortable enough there
you go and similarly you can have uh
some colors for your status as well so
you can go to new rule and uh format
cells that have specific text if it's in
progress format it as a shade of blue
okay and press okay for that and go to
condition formatting one again new rule
and Here Sell value should be a specific
text and if it's yet to start mark it as
green sorry not green mark it as um
maybe a shade of red and press okay
there you go and again conditional
formatting new rule go to format cells
that contain cell value specific cell
done mark it as green any shade of green
right I'll select this particular one
and that should be good enough okay
right so far so good now what's
remaining is the tracker for that you
might need this one right so here we
have the three options that we have
place them somewhere over here and now
we will have a ctif function here we
will give a range so the range is this
particular one comma criteria in
progress which is this particular cell
then it'll count the number
you can drag the formula across all the
cells and you'll have the number right
you can add borders to it if you want
there you go and now create a chart go
to insert option and here we have power
graphs and here go to 2D graphs 100%
stack par graph right now right click
this particular one select data and here
you can switch the rows to columns and
there you have it and you can also so
change the positions right you can move
up or down if you want I'll keep it as
it is and press okay you can delete the
chart title and you can delete the
horizontal numbers 0% 20% but if you
want you can keep them so you can also
minimize the size as per your
requests and place it somewhere which is
clearly visible right and I'll move it
to here is clearly visible to me so
that's your activity tracker I can also
remove the uh vertical columns don't
want and that's how it's done and it can
also change in real time if it's done it
will be changing it's completely real
time and if you want to extend this then
also drag this particular cell across
the column and you can change the make
some modifications to the status make
some modifications to your priority add
a new serial number add a new job add a
new comment right so that's how you
create a daily activity tracker in
Microsoft Excel and with that we have
come to the end of this session on how

Microsoft Excel if you have any queries
