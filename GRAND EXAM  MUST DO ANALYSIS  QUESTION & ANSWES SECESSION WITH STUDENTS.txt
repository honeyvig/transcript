foreign
foreign
are you able to see the screen
I just need your response on the chat
box
arrivals are you able to see the
question paper
foreign
one thing
thank you
okay
foreign
thank you
hope everyone is ready so we are going
to start the session
so I hope like most of you know that
today's session is analysis of gd3 right
you're clear right how about that so
this is basically the analysis of GT3
how you need to analyze the question
paper
and how we need to uh
okay I hope my screen is visible to you
I hope you can see my first question
okay okay fine so so the session is
basically analysis of your Grant history
and I hope most of you
okay whoever are attending this
particular session so are done with
Grant history so then only it will be
more effective
so I'll try to write few things and
followed by this is how I I analyze
because analysis of paper or a question
paper after giving exam will be
different by different students and
different by different mentors okay so
now this is how I analyze the question
paper so I'm talking about GT3
uh this exam was done on the following
subjects that is dental and dental
histology
DM
and a few areas of for example
antibiotics
and git system
right so these are the subjects which
are included and guys I just want a
quick response from you okay so among
these subjects which is the weakest
subject for you what do you feel like uh
there were like 200 plus students in the
Life what is the weakest for you so you
have uh
pharmacology
the pharmacology post okay so so I can
see most of you
most of you are answering it as Prosper
okay so so in common okay the first
analysis what you can take is the
toughest subject in the list is prosto
second one is okay A wetterly Memory
based subject is going to be
pharmacology the two only antibiotics
are there okay so these are the two
things that most of the students are
feeling
uh the feeling uh bad or feeling feeling
uh like they need to revise or something
so now I'm going to tell you the minimal
minimal score in this particular
question paper by analyzing the
uh by analyzing the entire question
paper so we'll check all 240 questions
this is not doubt session so I'll tell
you what to be what to be focused on
what to be
what you need to gain
from the question paper uh keeping in
mind few basic things what are the basic
things checklists
I have given you checklist for every
subject okay every subject prologue
class Pro live students you have a
different checklist okay regular offline
students you have a different checklist
uh normal plan year students will have a
different checklist so I have given you
checklist okay keeping in mind about the
checklist so I'll tell whether the
question is within our zone or not
okay so I want to segregate The Columns
in a simple way okay one is
known question known and easy very easy
known and Easy in the sense okay uh you
know the concept and answering this
particular question is very very very
very easy why it is easy it may be
discussed on on the WhatsApp or maybe
discussed in the Pro live class or maybe
discuss somewhere
or maybe you're very familiar with the
question it's a very easy question or it
may be a repeats question it may be from
Dental pulse so these are called as
known easy questions so I'll call it as
known me known easy questions first
column
second column
non difficult questions means you know
the concept but
you don't know the particular line where
the question is being prepared you know
the concept but it is you feel difficult
you don't know you know the concept for
example the first question is on
bleaching bleaching we know about
bleaching
but you may feel difficulty after
checking this question or after
answering this question so this can be
considered as non- difficult question
third one third one is unknown
unknown question
unknown question
unknown but it can be easy question
so you can call it as unknown easy
question and fourth one is unowned
difficult question so these are the four
columns you should have okay in your
mind while you are attempting the exam
and you should never give a try to
attempt unknown difficult questions that
is the fourth column is it clear known
easy known difficult unknown easy
unknown difficult is it clear with the
four columns
right okay so never ever try a question
which is unknown and which is difficult
okay those are the questions which you
have to leave in the examination Hall
okay of course need is telling that try
to attempt as many questions as possible
that's a logic or that is a principle
that I always force my students to do
but there is something that you should
not touch that is called as unknown you
unconcept is completely unknown and even
unknown also the concept sounds to be so
so difficult for example most of you we
are not done with biochemistry like for
example revision or few of you are not
done with biochemistry for example a
biochemistry question is coming in GT3
biochemistry as you have not touched
that is called as unknown but the
question sounds very familiar you have
done two months or one and a half months
back you sounds okay uh I have done it
but I'm not very sure so this is an
unknown concept
which you have done long back no proper
revision but the question sounds to be
easy and familiar so you can consider
this as unknown easy question and you
can attempt such questions also okay so
but in this in this GT3 I am going to
include only non-easy questions only
I'll tell you how many known easy
questions are there so by knowing how
many known easy questions you can
analyze yourself that how far you are
from the preparation how how far you are
from the preparation how bad you are
from the preparation maybe the raisins
may be different maybe you maybe uh you
may be so busy uh during this particular
14 days you may have some other personal
commitments like one of one of your
family friend or one of one of your
course close related is getting married
or you're not feeling well or uh there
are many XYZ stuff like you you may be a
mother you may not have a vigorous
preparation time and compared to many
other students who are doing 14 14 hours
or 13 hours okay so can I know one
question how many of you are doing more
than 10 hours per day preparation
minimum 10 hours more than 10 hours
it's mandatory guys it's mandatory okay
if you are targeting to be in the three
digit rank three days it means thousand
below rank okay or if you're targeting
below that make sure your minimum
working hours should be more than 10 it
can be extended up to any number but
minimum 10 hours should be there so that
you can fetch something better so
straight away without wasting any time
uh I'll be jumping into the analysis of
the paper I myself will be writing okay
writing you can similarly uh split them
into four columns that is known easy
known difficult unknown easy and unknown
difficulty so all your stuff which comes
in the checklist and they are very easy
will be coming under First Column and
I'm going to calculate only the First
Column First Column uh questions from
this particular GT okay and I hope
most of you has given GT1 and GT2 then
they have started GT3 okay if you are
not in the list for example sir I have
given directly GT3 not GT1 and GT2
because my time limitations were not
possible make sure before you give next
Grand exam for example GT4 is the next
exam
so before you give GT4 make sure try to
finish at least GT1 before give GT5 make
sure at least try to finish GT2 so at
least by giving by the time you give a
GT5 make sure one two three four are
done clear this is
sir I was talking to few of you sir I
have some other commitments or other
things in my mind that I'll finish this
and I'll give that no that is not going
to be possible you'll have you'll have
totally more than 25 GTA exams so that's
what that is how I am planning for you
okay so 25 GTA exams is going to turn
somewhere around 25 into
240 you just calculate the number the
number is going to hit somewhere around
5000 to 6000 Concepts or mcqs this is
what my analysis my my plan for you guys
okay so if you postpone now it's going
to be so difficult to give a grant exam
because giving 240 questions analyzing
them properly learning the mistakes it's
going to take time it's going to take
minimum half a day to one day time means
one grand exam is going to eat your one
valuable day if you are not properly
prepared to eat so 25 exams will take 25
days so you have 85 and you they are
going to take 25 minutes you are left or
with only 60 days so that is reason why
please try to finish exams on time
this is very important okay right is it
clear before at least sir I am not done
with one two three what to be done at
least by the time you give five make
sure one two three four are done so I'm
done with only three at least by the
time you give five try to finish one two
three four please please this is very
important this is utmost important okay
so regularly we go for a buffet right
we'll go for a buffet or we are going
for a wedding so in wedding what we have
we have something called as startups we
have something called as main course and
we have something called as an end
course that is called as deserts which
is more important
which is more important main course or
deserts are starters which is more
important
producing which is more important
yes main course is the most important
thing in the so your grand exams and
Analysis of grand exam is something like
a main course I I know that you have
fantasy towards starters or you have
fantasy towards the deserts and
everything I know that but if you do
that it is not going to make preparation
full or your stomach full so main course
is the most important aspect main course
is your mock exams and Analysis of
Market exams these 500 these five
thousand six thousand mcqs plus last 10
years question papers so this is going
to form the main course means you cannot
go
to the examination Hall without
preparing these particular seven
thousand to eight thousand mcqs that is
your 20 25 Grand exams plus last 10
years question papers is it clear this
is the most important thing so I I got
somewhere around 10 to 15 calls today
okay from my old students or their
parents uh many of them are calling a
few professors principals of college
are calling me okay only thing is I want
my daughter or I want my uh I want my
relatives daughter to clear to qualified
exam they want to qualify the exam so
all the people who are focusing to
qualify the exam all the people who want
to stand thousand below first mandatory
main course is mock exams plus proper
analysis plus the last 10 years question
papers arcues is it clear
is it clear so these are the three
requirements of today's session okay
right so now I'll be jumping into the
question paper Okay question number one
resorption after
bleaching treatment is mainly due to
which are the following
is mainly due to which of the following
yes of course few people may be confused
with option b and
option D option A cannot be answered
okay so I'll consider this as non
question but a bit difficult so I'll be
keeping this question in the column two
so I'll be posting this this is what uh
this is what I'm writing I'll be posting
this on the group okay okay you yourself
want to prepare you can prepare just for
your uh analysis I'll be posting so and
secondly what I'm going to do is uh I'm
going to keep a separator exclusive book
for this Grand exams now I'll be jumping
into GT3 so I'll be writing first
question so first question I don't know
it's difficult question known concept
it's about bleaching I know the concept
of bleaching but uh this is something
new which I find I find I don't know how
many of you feel this is a new question
for you so I'm going to write one
sentence or I'm going to write myself I
am going to revise this question too so
here you can see uh you you have
something called as bookmark option you
can see a bookmark option is there so
what I'm going to do I'm going to
bookmark it
if you want to add any particular nodes
to this for example you want to add
something related to the bleaching for
your satisfaction for example I am
adding some notes
what I'm adding H2O okay what is
soperoxyl H2O 30 to 35 percent is
r
100 percent is
by volume
by volume is
so for options
okay
so I'm going to add this and I'm going
to keep save
so now this is added to your notes you
can see you can add your notes also for
a particular question which you are
weaked and now in this in this Dropbox
it is clearly showing that you have
marked 17 you have marked first question
under under bookmark so now when you are
revising you can just revise the
questions which are booking or directly
you can jump for example I am jumping to
34th question so 34th question I felt I
felt difficult so I'm bookmarking it
so now 34th question is bookmark so I'm
going to check Only The Bookmark
questions this is how you need to use
the website about the bookmarking or
about adding your notes and everything
like if you feel like a new point should
be added you can add it add it you have
an option here bookmark or add notes
so first question I'm not going to add
it in the easy part okay I'm jumping
into the second question second question
a junior resident okay this is already
discussed on your WhatsApp uh two days
before exam okay this is a this is a
very easy question so I'm going to add
this in the First Column you should not
go wrong in such questions okay the next
is EDTA percentage of EDTA pH of EDTA
hydrogen peroxide everything two days
before the exam it was discussed very
commonly familiar last question so
I'm going to add one more score Kim's
class three okay I told you right I have
given a checklist of uh classifications
to be done in that Kim's is included of
course I'm going to add this is an easy
question you should not go wrong
so this is come something like uh you
can consider it as in third column or
fourth column like I don't know how many
of you are very familiar with the
general Anatomy or you are familiar with
pedo because this is a combination of PW
plus general Anatomy question so I'm not
going to include this question so you
have to learn like for example you don't
know this you have synopsis please try
to learn and move on this is a difficult
question
next greater education is associated
with we have learned this concept okay
so I am going to add this as an easy
question
of course we have discussed about this
okay gold uh 750 fineness okay I'm going
to add this in Easy questions a big case
based description part is there and the
question is very simple Evolution what
is the time period they have asked we
have learned this that is seven to ten
days so I'm going to add it in the easy
part
then comes enamel infractions these are
minute cracks which we know it's an easy
question
and of course this again a pedo question
which is definitely I'll be categorized
either into difficult unknown or
difficult uh easy okay so this is this
is a very familiar classification uh in
uh in I mean this is a very familiar
thing when you're talking about the
behavior management uh and your child
psychology but I don't know like how
many of you are really done with this so
proper revision is required for this
question so I'll be I'll I'll be not
considering this question so we are done
with 10 questions so out of 10
seven are in our Zone you should go
seven plus right answer still this point
if not then you're going wrong because
most of the seven questions were already
discussed on the WhatsApp already
discussed in different different modes
in different different patterns so you
should never go wrong
okay so again alginate other
classification before two days before
exam I have discussed originate
classification the same question was
given so I'm adding one
actina mycosis is something very very
familiar okay even if you don't know now
okay so you have to learn economycosis
which is very very common and they are
very simple question multiple sinus
openings that's the simple keyword where
you can go for it as economicosis this
is a very easy question
preferable route of behavior management
anywhere child most preferable route is
oral root easy question
this is Ortho I don't know how many of
you are perfect but as it is an ortho
question I'm not considering it as easy
because I am very very liberal in
counting the minimum number of right
answers you should get so this is also
very easy question if you are done with
if you are not done with author then
it's going to come in either column
three or column 4.
danger zone easy
MTA MTA composition easy
sibert's classification easy
Pharmacy easy
I don't know how many of you are
familiar with polishing so I'll consider
this as non difficult or unknown easy
okay so I'm not going to consider this
uh I mean it's it's the easy thing like
if you're in preparation until unless
you are not exposed to this that sounds
odd but it's in a very very easy diagram
based question so in the first 20
you should make 15 plus right answers
you should make 15 plus they are within
your Zone most of the questions are
within your Journal primate spaces
within your Zone
can't get already discussed so many
times within the zone
oh this is discussed three days back
before the is it discussed guys
have you checked it our telegram group
is it discussed peripheral nerve system
develops primarily from
yes it is discussed it is discussed on
your WhatsApp activity if you are going
wrong sir this is embryology I have not
read if you are going wrong then you
should question yourself because this
question as a single liner was discussed
on your WhatsApp so then you should
think that okay I'm I'm not checking out
the telegram questions I'm not I'm
ignoring the telegram question this this
is this may not be in the in the
syllabus but this is discussed this is a
disgust okay so if you are going wrong
this question you are not perfect with
telegram content
this I'm not going to include
this is a very simple common sense
question
how many of you made it right
right I have not discussed this question
directly but two days before exam I told
you what is the unit of blood called as
what is a fist of blood called as what
is Big mop of blood how much it is it is
very simple calculation let's Prestige
everything Common Sense he's telling
that he has collected something he has
used some irrigation he has ex he has
removed something from the section it is
very easy okay I don't know how many are
feeling it is difficult question but all
the things were indirectly discussed on
the group so I am going to add this also
to the questions
uh okay pathology question so I I'm not
including this question in the list
IQ if you're already done with pedo this
is easy question you will not forget if
not uh it's going to be difficult I'm
not including this also I'm very genuine
I'm not including this assuming that you
have not started your preparation
uh this can be either a hematoma or cyst
but uh preferable option is cyst okay
both A and B are right but preferable
option hematoma is nothing but called
assist okay so both A and B are right
but you cannot go for all the above so
option C is eliminated it's a better
option is cyst rather than going for
hematoma
basing upon the uh the findings of the
clinical descriptor part
so I'm I'm not including this also as it
as few of you uh may may think of it as
a controversy
uh this is this is discussed on your
WhatsApp two days before the exam so I'm
including it and so many times given in
the dental pulse also this is something
new
this is something new okay
this is directly from your dental pulse
so I'm including
basis I told you to check included
this I'm I'm ignoring I'm not including
this is direct question
water trees we have discussed two days
before exam
I asked you to check casting defects
uh I think this question was discussed
in the offline and pro-life I don't know
I don't know about the rest okay this
was discussed in offline I'm including
this
this is direct Dental pulse question
this is within our zones I told you to
check out the faces and everything
this was so many times repeated and
logically also you can you can think of
you can have you have so many times seen
amalgam and most of these registrations
on radiographs but I'm I'm going to
include it as unknown easy question with
elimination you can attempt this
question
this is direct Dental pulse question
this is direct Dental pulse question
uh This sounds too lengthy but very
simple question 44.
this is direct Dental pulse question
and one more important thing for example
I hope like you know the answer for
these questions but whenever you don't
know answer and whenever you want to
attempt go for both all of them such
options you can or else you can pick
option which is largest among the list
what is the largest option you can go
like you're in a situation where you
need to attend the questions so in such
conditions it is safe to go for these
answers because there are high chances
that in more than 60 percent of the
cases these answers are going to be
right
nickel easy question
easy question
I told you to read this I posted the
table also easy question
easy question so we are done with 15. so
out of 50 how many are within the column
one is 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
33 34 35 36 37 38 so out of 15 38
questions are within our Zone easy
questions
easy questions they're within the
syllabus also next easy common sense
question
uh if you don't know you can consider it
as known but difficult I'm considering
this I don't know how many of you know
this I don't know basically so that is
the reason why
this is easy question
this is easy question
easy question
easy question
I'm not considering this not considering
this
not considering this
not considering this just it is not out
of syllabus this is already discussed on
the on the WhatsApp I mean on the on the
telegram
this is already discussed on the
telegram
okay I'm not considering this also
this is discussed
Common Sense easy question Common Sense
easy question
collagen types easy question
number of routes easy question sequence
of eruption easy question or veins and
vertices easy question
easy question
how many of you went wrong in this
question
how many of you made wrong
none of you
so if you are wrong in this question
okay so I want you to consider this as
non difficult question you know the font
see Factor everyone in the world knows C
Factor but you are going wrong means you
don't know how to calculate the C factor
for embody okay right and what is C
Factor like you have to calculate it as
like done bonded is the measleside is
unbounded digital side is unbonded and
occurational surface is unbounded and uh
bonded is you have to consider the
entire buccal area as one bonded surface
enter pulpal area is one bonded surface
enter lingual area is one monitor
surface so it is going to be three by
three it is one okay so that is how it
is calculated in one of the standard
book okay so okay of course you can
calculate it as individually also but
this is how they have calculated and
they have closed it but you check out
the option basing upon that you consider
all the bonded surfaces and try to you
don't have such option now you can
consider it as three by three okay so
this is difficult known but difficult
question
largest diameter discussed on the group
this is not discussed recently but
probably I think this is discussed on
your telegram you can you have in
telegram also you have one option
search button will be there you know
that
guys Telegram
you have search button like for example
like a uh somewhere has discussed this
particular symptom h g p r t if you type
and search when it was discussed it will
be scrolling up okay check it out this
discuss this is discussed probably 15
days back
easy question
this is also discussed not immediately
easy question easy question
first generation cephalosporins easy
question I told you to check out
cephalus Burns classification this time
considering it as difficult
is it easy you want me to drop this
question in easy
because I told you right to check micro
hardness macro hardness so micro hotness
is something like which is below 9.8
Newtons or which is below 19 mu mm okay
so this is micro hardness above that is
macro hardness I told you to check out
the tool diagrams I told you to check
out this particular diagram at least now
if you are not if you went wrong please
try to check this easy question this is
going to be easy
I hope you know this very simple raw
basics of antibiotics
maybe known difficult time dropping this
as known difficult
this is easy question discussed on the
group
maybe this a bit difficult so I'm not
calculating this I told you to check out
anti-tubercular drugs
chronic hyperplastic Pulpit is easy
question
MTA disadvantages long second time
handling properties easy question this
is biochemistry so I'm not counting this
this is basically easy question in
Biochemistry but I'm not calculating it
as an easy question
I'm not calculating this also I'm not
calculating this also I'm not
calculating this also I'm genuine I'm
not calculating I told you I told you to
Medical termination of pregnancy the
same question was posted on the group
easy
I told you to check out all the
common points adverse effects of
anti-tubercular drugs so you have to do
this question at any cost
this question was posted on the group
okay this is very simple I hope you can
handle it
this is simple
but joint is simple
this is discussed on the group macro
hardness indications of pit and fissure
sealer's easy question
this is also easy question so we are
done with 100 and I'm just calculating
it first 50 we need to score 38 the
second 50 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37
so 37 in the next 50 so totally now it
is hitting 75 out of 100 first 100 you
have to get 75 plus score
and this proper analysis I I am only the
perfect because I take your I am I am
the one who has taken the last 15 days
uh telegram activity so I know what I
have discussed I know what I told you to
study I know what I have discussed in
the quick revision so I know what are
the given in the exam so you should get
minimum 75 very genuine is 75 plus in
first 100 mcqs
huh is easy easier difficult
very easy question rubber Dam given by

refam facing I'd already check out
anti-tubercular drugs Vancomycin so many
times it is given try you if you know a
proper meaning of uh this colitis there
are four or five questions straight away

16.
foreign
getting 183 out of 240 so I'm making it
as 180 okay in that you have 10 percent
is extra discount okay so I'm removing
18 questions
so 162 means 160 plus with all the
Liberty anything ever 160 is okay for
this question paper
if you are not able to reach that 160 by
following the telegram group for example
I mean let's talk there's nothing bad
here how many of you have ignored
telegram activity
yeah you have given exam but you have
ignored the telegram discussions how
many of you is there anyone who has
ignored telegram discussions 180 plus
students are there
how many of you have ignored telegram
discussions anyone has ignored
it is very important even your final
questions are going to come from the
telegram discussions it's mandatory that
you have to check the telegram
discussions okay they're very very
important okay they're very very
important because they are going to give
you scores they are going to tell you
where you are weak at I'm going to tell
you okay you'll be weak at this Kim's
classification you'll be weak at
vertices you'll be confused known easy
you should never go wrong that's what
I'm telling my analysis of the question
papers I'm telling way which questions
are known and easy for most of the
students you may tell okay Kim so I
never heard Kim sir
you have to because it is known easy
this question is falling known easy for
more than 90 percentage of the students
who are in the competition Zone you
should never go wrong in such question
you may you may you may be least have it
sir I have started my preparation two
days back even if you start preparation
today you should know Kim's
classification because
for the competitors who are in the
competition zone for you ninety percent
is the Kim's classification is known
easy question for come so always a
question should be decided basing upon
the competition Journal so non-difficult
you should fetch it unknown easy you
should fetch it unknown difficult you
have to you have to you should not feel
bad for unknown difficult question
right so I hope like most of you got
some basic knowledge how to analyze a
question paper is it right I have taken
such sessions in offline uh long back
but not in online so this is the first
time I'm taking an online session like
how to analyze
this is how you how you have to analyze
90 percentage of the people like even if
you don't start the preparation even if
you're about to start the preparation
this is how Okay this this question
paper requires minimum 160 plus to be in
the 500 list if you want to be in the
500 this question paper require 160 plus
because
questions are within our zones it is
very easy screwdie shape maxillary
Central and scissors you should not go
wrong in this question because everyone
knows that it's a congenital syphilis
that's an easy question
sir I don't know learn it now now you
learn it read it read all the things
which are given in the congenital C plus
all these notes but make sure once the
same concept or conjunctious if this
based question or syphilis based
question is coming in the next
examinations or next year it is make
sure you should go for the right answer
this is how you have to analyze where
are you going rock please do mark it
for example question number four sir
Kim's classification very tough write
down write down write a write a sheet
write a GT3 question number three Kim's
classification I have to replace so
before going to GT4 make sure you open
this notes or simple very simple way you
can open the website I'm going to mark
it I'm going to Market book Market okay
I'm going to save it and I'm going to
check all these questions and I'm going
to check the underlying Concepts I'm
going to directly because 240 questions
you cannot check it is very difficult so
what I'm going to do I'm going to jump
to the question number one okay question
number one actually question number 34
I'll check question number one eleven I
will check okay this is this is very
important I'll be confused okay so what
I'm doing I'm going to keep it in the
bookmark and I'm going to revise this
revise the 20 or 30 Mark questions
before I go for the next GD so once
you're going for GT4 so GT1 GT2 GT3 for
example there are 25 difficult questions
in GT 125 and GT2 25 and GT3 so I'm
going to reverse all these 75 questions
and then I'll be going to the
GT4 my assumption is whether question is
going to come within the zone or not I'm
least bothered sir will the questions
come from GT3 which will be there in GT4
I don't know but I want to make myself
strong in the weak areas where I am
previously at so if you keep on revising
this okay thick medium heavy extra heavy
super heavy for four or five it is then
it will be recorded in your permanent
memory so you have to convert uh things
from short-term memory to the long term
memory how you can convert a short-term
memory to long-term memories revising
them more than five or six times so this
table has to be reversed so I'm going to
bookmark it similarly for example uh
any any other any other one which I feel
like okay I need to revise so I'm going
to check it I'm going to keep a bookmark
okay so vitamin K factors two seven nine
ten SC okay I'm going to I'm going to
keep a book Market I'm going to revise
this okay so on which you have to decide
okay I want to learn about this
particular syndrome okay so I want to
bookmark it so this is how you have to
uh identify the areas where you are weak
at and uh for example okay I want to
check out this different types of Agents
which are used for palpatomy so I'm
going to bookmark it so you have to make
yourself The Zone where you need to
revise some people like they may they
know they may know everything okay they
may know this so they they will not
revise it it's unnecessary to revise
things which already you you know it
okay right so right is it is it is it
clear so this is how you need to
approach and make sure
you have to revise okay for example this
week you have done 2019 2018 question
paper that has to be revised before you
go to exam not all the questions
questions which requires your attention
questions which requires revision for
example a classification is there and
numbers are there you have to reverse
Market go back bookmark it go back try
to revise only that area
guys is it clear so if it is clear I'll
go to the next part of today's session
I need your response on the box
don't feel bad even if you are getting
300 350 400 because we have 80 plus days
okay even if you improve
one right answer for every two days
means 80 by 2 you have 40 days 40. so
there is scope that you can improve your
score by 40 marks
I mean I'm telling every two days can't
you make one right answer working so
hard 10 hours 12 hours per day can can
can't you improve one right answer at
least for two days
no I'm just asking people who are still
at 300 350s don't feel bad the only
thing I'm asking is you're going to work
12 hours or 13 hours per day okay so two
days you are going to work minimum 25 to
26 hours in 26 hours reading can't you
make one at least one extra right answer
only one extra right answer I'm asking
25 hours can't you make one right answer
no you can make it easily you can make
it for example your scores are 300 now
at least 300 okay consider this 300. so
for example you're making 40 right
answers by 80 days from now so 40 into 4
is 116 and your uh negative marking will
be dropped by 40 so it's going to be 200
so 2 300 plus 200 so your score will be
500 even a student who is at 300 now
feeling bad that you are not going to
call if you are not going to achieve
something there are high chances your
scores can be improved to 500 Plus or
above it the only thing is analysis the
only thing is what to be done the only
thing is what to be revised what to be
ignored what to be stressed this is
important if you can decide that if you
can judge that okay talk with the
mentors
come to these live sessions
okay take some knowledge from the
mentors subject-wise knowledge is there
on the website that's not that's not
that's not an issue knowledge or common
sense where you need to stress to
improve your scores and give a better
attempt in the final exam to get a
better result so that comes over a
period of experience one is trusting
your Mentor second one is you give more
mock exams your you also will get more
experience just imagine you have given
15 mock exams and and your plan to give
the 16 Mark exam how confident you are
how confident you'll be you are just
third mock exam now just imagine that
you have given 15 and you're going for
16 you'll be having more confidence just
imagine that you are giving 20 mock
exams and giving it 21st you will be
more confident trust me this is with
experience as you give more exams you
will be you you will be more confident
and this is going to happen okay right
so I'm done with that
okay so if you have any questions to be
asked personally or
or you can drop it on the message box
you can like if you feel or you want to
be very personal you can drop it on to
my WhatsApp WhatsApp simple drop it on
my WhatsApp I I'm active now on the
WhatsApp I have opened my WhatsApp so if
you have any questions you don't want to
disclose it out you can directly drop me
on the telegram sorry on on the WhatsApp
on my number I'll check and I'll answer
your questions we will not let your name
out okay don't worry
please do message me on the on the
WhatsApp only because I cannot I I
cannot check your uh
Zoom messages as of now
try to post any sort of question please
try to post on the on the WhatsApp I
will definitely try to help you out
yes I got one question okay meanwhile
you can drop okay so sir I have started
my preparation like uh probably a week
back where I was not very clear about uh
your uh I mean your model one also okay
so people who have started preparation
in the last week or last 10 days before
the model one started don't break your
heads you try to focus on module two
only for now okay because module two
will be going for 14 days
module 3 will be 14 days and module 4
will be 14 days okay so for example it
is going to be roughly around 44 days
you have 88 days
so you have you'll be you'll be
completing the three modules by 41st
you'll be having 40 days left over for
your revision mocks and everything and
like it's complete box and everything so
in that take we'll take 10 days for
module one so you'll keep 30 days for
revision and in that 40 days you are
going to keep 30 days for revision and
you're going to take 10 days for module
one and you're going to finish module
one don't worry don't don't assume that
I will not have time for module one you
will have time because I have given x 40
days there in that you are going to take
a week or a 10 days because you will be
on fire in the preparation by that time
so you can use that 30 35 days for
revision and use that seven days or 10
days to finish model one module one
subjects are comfortable subjects indoor
is comfortable most of the subjects in
module one are so comfortable and easy
so it's going to happen don't worry
first focus on module two get get
adapted to this GTS
get adapter to this GTS give get get get
adapted to giving more Grand exams okay
and and and once you get start giving
more exams your scores will drastically
improve over a period of time
all right uh this is I mean that is one
where to see bookmark questions open
open uh open your question paper yeah
open your question but see this is how
this is this is my question paper
open your question paper which is
answered then whatever bookmark you are
going to Mark you can see the bookmark
questions
WhatsApp activity has to be attended
live or only like when you are taking
your wish
but make sure it has to be done
it's not mandatory that you have to eat
everything when it is immediately
prepared but make sure you eat whenever
it is possible but please do eat it
don't miss it okay like good if you
attend it live even if it is not it's
okay whenever you want you can come I
can finish the task make sure whenever
it is possible like what I strongly
recommend is okay it's good if you
attend live but there would be few busy
people okay you have some personal works
okay make sure whenever you're traveling
whenever you're on a on a call whenever
you're on on a place where you don't
have access to the books make sure you
can finish your telegram activity so
that's an answer for those questions
so I got 168 right questions but uh sir
getting 50 55 negative marking in every
exam how to deal with it improve your
right answers as the number of right
answers are going to increase the number
of wrong answers are going to decrease
even if you take shwatha which is an
already is conquer she went wrong in 40
odd questions 40 questions
now you are in the range of 50 to 55 so
try to drop that 50 55 to 40 45 you will
be maybe you you'll be the you you may
be the next single digit ranker
means all India topper will also have 40
negative marking 40 negative marking is
common when it is common when your
scorings are more than 160 170 14
negative marking is accepted
it is very simple you try to improve the
number of right answers and the negative
marking is going to decrease
simultaneously
same answer for the next question sir
how to handle negative marketing keep
more right answers negative marking will
decrease
how should we talk to mentors
now first thing is purpose of talk to
mentors is very important you cannot
simply call uh and discuss which is not
relevant to the preparation I don't
encourage because I am seeing so many
students in this present generation the
taught the the callers they talk
something which is not related to the
preparation also okay that is also
accepted at one level but the purpose of
talk like now you got answers to so many
questions so no now you have a chance
that the mentor is sitting in front of
you you have a chance to ask questions
personally and he's answering it use use
this this is how you're talking with
Mentor he's going to give you a citation
it's not about talking with a mentor
it's about taking suggestions proper
suggestions uh from the mentor basing
upon your situation so this is how it is
going to turn good for you okay you can
call me here you can call me immediately
after the class we can have a talk
how to plan subjects which we are wicked
you split your day that's what I'm
giving I'm telling I'm asking you to go
for more than 10 hours for example 12
hours you are going for 12 hours or 13
hour schedule for example if you feel
like you are weak at a particular
subject you make your daily schedule to
10 hours and give some one hour two hour
to the subjects which you feel you are
weak at maybe it may be subject don't
consider at this level of preparation
and
just a second
yeah you you are a long back student so
at this level of preparation as you are
done with most of the subjects twice on
the schedule so I strongly recommend
don't consider a subject as difficult
consider a particular topics few topics
in a subject as difficult and their
subject cannot be difficult
enter subject will be difficult it's a
dental histology is difficult enter DH
is difficult or a particular Concepts
may be different an animal is easier
Dentin is easy pulp is very easy I'm an
endodontist and I'm attending pulp are
easy for me maybe for me difficult is uh
development for example a periodontist
coming their difficulty is going to be
pulp so you cannot consider entire
subject as difficult okay remove that
from the brain sir enter subject no
entire subject cannot be difficult easy
parts will be there in every subject so
what can be difficult some topics in a
subject are difficult so change the
wording that's going to give you more
uh psychological happiness to get more
confidence
most of my answers are most of my wrong
answers are simple questions which I
have already solve it solve more number
of times you're going wrong in simple
questions you're going wrong in known
questions you are doing big mistake you
are doing big mistake okay for example
you're traveling from your college
to your room or your college to your
home will go wrong
sir instead of taking left I have taken
right sir I went to somewhere you cannot
do that that is biggest mistake instead
of going to your room you cannot go to
others room that's the biggest mistake
so find solve it solve this issue okay
make sure you need to work more on this
means the problem here is you are taking
it as granted
you're taking it as granted sorry easy
question I know this
but exam is going to tell you you're
wrong at this so you're taking just it
as granted that is the reason why you're
going wrong so don't take anything
granted whether it's an easy question
sir rubber dam was given by easy
question I know it should not go wrong
okay so we should never take anything
granted please try to be serious about
that
I am doing my preparation from October
and studying around 10 hours how should
I improve try to improve the time life
is always like for example if you're
earning one lakh per month this year
for example what is this uh December
December 2020 so I'm earning one lakh
per month
do you want to earn same one lakh in
December 2020 for anyone you want to
earn more or you want to earn less or
you want to earn same no normal genuine
question I'm asking
December to December uh December 2022 my
earnings are one lakh per month you want
to earn more or less
so right so this is very simple like we
always should focus on upgrading
ourselves and improving ourselves
we need to improve ourselves okay so
exam by exam we should find to improve
our example sir I'm reading 10 hours for
now at least tomorrow you try to read
more than 10 hours 10 minutes I'm not
asking you to go for 15 or 16. I'm
telling very simple go for more than 10
hours that can be 10 hours 10 minutes is
also more so give a try to improve your
schedules and improve your times
how to overcome numerical mistakes
revision
you know your week at particular point
you should be careful so as I'm
traveling on road again same question
you know that at a particular Junction
there are no lights and the road is
completely lots of ditches everything
are there water is there flooding there
water what we'll do we'll go slow
we'll be careful
same numbers you should be careful
will GT4 be cumulative or module 1 and
module two don't know anything can come
no you are at a preparation phase there
is no boundary for this or give me only
Endo I will do and give me only main
course I lead main course no whatever I
keep whatever is going to come in front
of you you have to solve it so
I'm not going to tell you whether it is
on this basing upon my mood or basing
upon the team whatever we whatever we
feel which is important we are going to
give
I am giving very less time for
Preparation because I need to take care
of my kids home as of now I'm thinking
of to focus only on telegram groups and
mocks what will will this be a good
result no that's what I'm telling you
are preparation has the limitations I
have some limitations okay but I cannot
expose my limitations to you to make
your limitations okay uh srikantha is
not not teaching not talking with that
should not be our limitation so what we
do
I consider my personal life as a
personal life and my professional life
as a professional life if I include my
personal life for example uh one of my
relatives is not feeling not feeling
good
I cannot simply come and tell my
relative is not feeling good
I may not be available for you for the
next 10 days it will not work out
because I am in a responsibility
position same same right so also you're
also in a responsibility position for
handling the preparation so I'm not
telling to sacrifice the health or the
well-being of your kid for the
preparation but I'm telling you there
are few things that you can sacrifice
don't sacrifice your kid okay you can
sacrifice few other things you try to
focus on sacrificing those things and
converting into the preparation and all
the mothers all the mothers I don't know
how many mothers are there who are going
to hear this class live or recorded
version okay preparation is also a kid
you have one kid right now preparation
is also a kid
so you have to take care your
preparation as kid how you're going to
take care of your kids daughter kids
kids and everything so if you take care
your preparation is also a kid
preparation is going to give you
something extraordinary to support you
in the next few years of the life
so I want you to consider preparation is
also one kit and try to allocate more
time you cannot simply stick on to
Telegram and fetch something
extraordinary so if you stick to
Telegram and all these things GTE uh
your GT scores were somewhere around 450
which is very decent okay so there are
high chances and scope that you can
improve a lot but sticking onto telegram
your scores will be in and around 450 to
500 or maximum 550 you cannot go beyond
550. so try to try to get some more time
if not it's okay if not it's okay
whatever you're doing is really good
really extraordinary okay this is
maximum anyone can do you're doing it
within your limitations but you check
out the possibilities where where you
can extract more time and focus on
because preparation is only for this 85
days after 85th day after March second
is there anyone want to read Dental
pulse or want to check out the telegram
discussions
if anyone want to check out the telegram
discussions on May after May 1st uh
sorry after March 1st it sounds very odd
I myself will not take any discussions
the group will be closed okay so point
is very clear that try to extract the
time try to respect the preparation this
process you should respect how you're
taking care of your family you should
take care of this process also
next I am I am the per I am the peep I
am from the people who is 100 days plan
it's difficult to complete whole
syllabus I have completed endocons but
in the next step we are unable to
complete one-fourth of the dental middle
and next we are unable to complete one
half of the pros so it's very difficult
to include 30 minutes accommodation for
subjects other than the subjects that
has been no you we have to do it here so
you yourself have decided that I am
going to do 100 days preparation and I
am going to get a thousand below rank or
500 below rank this is our Target right
this is our Target so if you have such
targets then you need to come out of the
box and you have to work for those
targets it's not mandatory okay people
who are getting all India single digits
or people who are scoring great ranks or
related like take about the top of this
today's examination even that fellow or
a person that that particular he or she
have not completed the syllabus it's not
that's what I'm telling before we
starting the 100 days plan I told you
completing syllabus is not our Target
improving your scores improving your
confidence is the Target no one cannot
complete syllabus here even I am I
myself teaching from last nine years
okay including okay if you include my
preparation it goes somewhere around 10
plus years so I myself are not able to
complete I am not satisfactory in
teaching uh a hundred percent I'm not
having 100 test of satisfactory with a
few students who are from last year
before last year bad students all I I we
try to improve every year but 100 as
satisfaction I never get till the date
that is the reason why I'm still in this
race I'm still showing some interest to
teach to learn because I'm not I feel
like okay I should give more for the
next batch so that that goes with the
preparation
and that to this message is dropped by
my last year student
she was last year also conquer and now
it's also supported so remove that
completing syllabus no one can do it but
achieving rank everyone can do it
everyone will get a rank so I want you
to have a better rank than last year
better scores than GT2 and GT4 than in
GT5 in compared to GT4 this is how our
Target should be
smart videos please take check out this
uh
about the questions for about smart
readers okay so please check out my 100
days video which is there on the YouTube
channel if not ping me after the class
I'll send you the video you should check
that video now Smart Video smart videos
you're 13 1300 smart videos are there
you have 80 days how many videos you
have to do every day you have to do more
than 20 videos every day to finish those
1300 videos which is impossible
how to deal with depression thoughts
focusing on Preparation life is very
simple here
this is very common this is very common
depression mood swings out of focus is
very common why pure anger you are in a
phase where you will face all these
things for example most of you you me
everyone are there in 11th and 12th
standard who used to be there in Sri
chaitanya Nara in uh preparing for
entrance exam we don't have these
depressions at that time why because our
mind is not so mature to have those
depressions our main goal is eat food on
time okay and read and go for routing
and spend this these are the qualities
which I don't know about you but these
are the qualities which I have eat foot
on time gossip with the friends you'll
have good friends circling and all this
space gossip with the friends Sunday
outing you go watch a movie eat Biryani
come back and read these I don't have
any depression here during during 11th
and my life now I have depressions after
joining videos first year is fine second
year is fine third year depression
starts MDS every every time everyone has
depression the only thing is
how to come out of this is very simple
you have to love yourself you have to
love the process now I'm I'm taking some
time talking with you uh after the class
I have so many messages to reply
tomorrow morning I need to uh catch
something and I have to go my relatives
vetting going to relatives wedding is
also depression I have to go I don't
have other options because they're going
to kill me
because they came for my wedding I have
to go for their wedding this is how the
Indian culture is going to work they
came you come if you come then only they
will come okay so I have to go but I
have some work to be done I have to talk
with you so I have so this is also some
sort of depression for me but what I'm
going to do is I allow the process
taking time talking with you interacting
with you I love this process so once you
love the process there will be no
depression sir I cannot allow this
process start loving it at least now
because this process is going to give
you some extraordinary things in the
Life personally and professionally so
once something or someone is going to
give extraordinary things you should
respect that and you should allow that
so start loving yourself start loving
your work start loving whatever you do
you will you will you will come out of
this
uh it's difficult to manage 10 hours
some Maximum eight 800 hours is coming
no problem whatever you do with kids
anything is accepted
you are carrying a kid
and you are carrying
the preparation on the other hand
by this is this is this is an
achievement already I don't mind whether
you get a rank or not all the women who
are preparing with kids who are
preparing with the responsibilities or
men also manuals included in this don't
mind okay you are already an achievers
you're already you have already the
victory okay taking a call having a kids
is is the greatest thing that you can do
you're doing it extraordinary okay but
that's what I'm telling you should carry
one kid which is going to give you a
personal happiness and one kid on the
other hand which is going to give you
professional happiness so you decide
both kids are important okay so you
should give the tea balancing for both
the kids let it be two hours three hours
try to balance your both the kids
one kid personal happiness second kid
professional happiness

number of times simple
subjects like pharmacology how to handle
questions options are very confusing
same answer
Pharma is difficult same answer array
Pharma just antibiotics you have started
to run
why you are breaking your heads only one
topic you have done
out of many systems pharmacology we are
done with only one topic one is git
second one is antibiotics and out of the
10 or 15 questions who came from
antibodies most of the questions I have
discussed antibiotics are very easy to
learn
don't tell pharmacology that
pharmacology is difficult
don't tell pharmacology that
pharmacology is difficult if you tell
pharmacology the pharmacology is
difficult pharmacology is going to be
more difficult it's going to kill you so
tell that
tell pharmacology even if you're
difficult I'm going to I'm going to see
your end then only you can handle those
subjects
how to manage previous subjects between
main schedule
split split into
14 hours is Q 3 hours or four hours to
the previous subjects 10 hours try to
work more Ang people you have to work
more mothers have responsibilities
because they have two kids to handle one
is preparation and one is personal kid
now intense you don't have any kids
right so try to spend more time give
more quality of time
I started my preparation I'm trying
difficult to complete the daily goals
but I am failing to do because of the
college work quota some subjects I am
whatever you can do do it here I told
you to quit the college but still you
have some commitments with the college
then you need to compromise in your
preparation one thing you have to give
more preference and second thing will
definitely compromise I you have to quit
the callers
private callers you can we can manage if
you get a good rank how can I undergo a
few subjects I did not do ortho once the
model is coming first focus on module
two subject don't worry about your ortho
don't worry about your future subjects
or how to handle MDS first year sir that
is not question now now your your next
focus is module two subjects and a grade
score in the module two if you get a
great score in module 2 that is going to
give you confidence that you can
complete entire syllabus and get a good
rank confidence is important I can do it
if you're telling I can do it I can do
it
that is important
what to be done is not important no one
is going to ask you what to be done if
you can tell yourself that I can do it
very very in a very harsh way in a very
very loud if you tell yourself that I
can do it at any cost you will do it
definitely no need of any plans or
anything you can do it
I think I'm a slow reader
there is nothing called a slower
interface Trader I am not Hussein bold
is there anyone who assembled is there
on the group
but once a tiger or a lion is coming I
am going I regularly go for this truck
send everything forest campings and
everything if some animal is coming then
I will run like hell to save my life so
there is no slow Runner fast runner only
Usain Bolt can run no everyone can run
but when we are going to run when the
situation demands we are going to run
okay so don't give a tag to you that you
are a slow reader so there is no option
in your need or any examination come out
all slow readers come this side all fast
Traders go that side we don't have
anything so remove that from your mind
and start working fast
everyone before giving their Theory exam
one day before giving their Theory exam
are excellent Hi-Fi rajinikanth robotic
Raiders okay we finish the syllabus fast
we finish every question fast we go we
crack the exam we come back this is what
we have done in every exam of all the
subjects from First videos to the final
videos just imagine how you used to read
how we used to finish the syllabus so
don't come and tell me a tag fast
address slow reader in last 80 days all
are same Raiders
half of the time has been screwed for
revising the notices I can spend only
limited time for mcqs follow the
checklist is the checklists are posted
for every subject on the group nice
are you getting checklists for every
subject on the group
yes every subject checklist is being
posted so follow the checklist checklist
is going to give you marks
this whatever 160 plus I told you to get
in this particular exam is just a
checklist not doing everything try to
finish the checklist but if you have
that capability or extraordinary power
to do everything that's your wish but
make sure you should not miss the
checklist
how many questions I have started
preparation earlier but still going
wrong with some easy questions revision
is required but after the exam I'm able
to answer the same question that is
realization
so please try to include the revision
and realization properly then you will
get the score how many questions are
considered to be skipped it will be
different for different student
if you're already doing good less number
of questions if you're already doing
that more number of questions there how
we are going to decrease the negative
margin so probably by by finishing 15
grand GTS you will get to know how many
questions you have to skip
and are unable to attempt more questions
how to attempt more questions no you
have to read finish the checklists
that's what I told you I told you 160
questions
you can return 162 questions which is
more right according to me 160 plus is
very more very good very decent but if
you are not able to Once answer 160
question the problem is with your within
your preparation you are not doing the
checklists you are not following the
telegram group you are not following the
mental suggestions if you follow Mentor
suggestions
finish the telegram group and do the
checklist and proper revision 16170 Plus
in this question paper is very very very
very easy
how to plan revision for each model what
should be done first synopsis

have given the checklist for every
checklist

number four five six seven I'm giving
you have to follow the same sequence
please follow the groups
sat in my application long back but when
I'm coming to exam I'm not able to score
my marks are very low I'm not able to

everything were discussed on the
telegram I told you what to be done what
to be revised and the same questions are
coming this is happening for every exam
and this is going to happen for a final
exam also you can ask last year students
you can ask your seniors so please don't
go wrong in those areas
according to schedule some are already
done by me can I focus on other subjects
yes you can
following Mentor suggestions is one or
updating updating or upgrading the
mental suggestions and doing something
better is your wish if you can do it you
can proceed no issues
how frequent we should revise the topic
specific
how frequent we have to reverse the
topics with your wish
your wish topic specific exam is not
going to take much time
it's going to have hardly 20 to 30
questions and revision of the difficult
questions in that will be less than five
or six so revising five or six questions
is not going to take more than five or
six minutes so whenever you want you can
revise it

okay finally don't think too much don't
stress yourself no need to go over
depression's mood offs mood swings for
this the only thing is trust this
process love this process
if you trust yourself love this process
this process is going to be beautiful
and second thing this process whatever
the ups and downs you are going to in
this process will give you more
confidence in handling the upcoming
stresses in the Life PC is not going to
be smoother okay if you're that is the
reason why we always Focus to get a
government Dental College by
why just because of stipend or maybe the
second reason is you'll have more op
okay those are the two important reasons
there is nothing I had hidden or
extraordinary reason apart from that as
an Indian psychology being in India or
being in our culture whenever we see
more money stress will drop down for
Indians
more money less stress for Indians right
so that is the reason why uh in PG if
you have a stipend that is going to make
you happy and decrease your stress a bit
but PG is also stressful life itself is
stressful yeah okay so there's nothing
you can escape from the stress but what
you can do
you can manage the stress you can manage
the stress with stress Breakers you you
have stress Breakers right in your
closet
similarly life also needs stress
Breakers life also needs stress Busters
okay and this is how we are going to
manage the stress because stress cannot
be removed from the life open secretly
how it can be removed go to Himalayas go
join in satguru ashram completely
complete entire life you have to stay in
satgura ashram or go to Himalayas then
you will have no stress but stress
cannot be eliminated but how it can be
it can be managed so this preparation is
going to tell you or give you some
suggestions that how you can manage the
stress so I enjoy the process once you
start enjoying the process then there is
no stress in it okay so we and we love
to enjoy the enjoyment so that is the
reason why when you are enjoying there
is no stress so if you love the process
or if you love the reading process if
you love all these things
then there is no stress here you will
enjoy this you will enjoy the process
then it will be it will be less stress
okay right so
just go with your preparation and try to
give your best okay so try to follow the
voice notices try to follow the
suggestions that are given on the group
people who are following the suggestions
who are sticking to the basics they're
really doing extraordinary in their
exams I'm very very happy for them and
trust everyone who are in in around like
250 300 350s 400s there is lots of scope
lots of time to improve the only thing
is you should be confident come ahead
learn everything from your mistakes if
you learn from your mistakes then only
you can achieve this brand okay bye take
care all the best
