hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this video we
will be discussing deloitte interview
questions
so we will go through different types of
interview questions that are often asked
during the interview process at deloitte
so we have categorized these interview
questions into three types
first will be deloitte interview
questions then there are common deloitte
interview questions that are most
frequently asked during the interview
process
and third will be deloitte technical
interview questions
after that we will understand the
complete interview process at deloitte
like how things work during the
interview process and at last we will
address some of the frequently asked
questions
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our youtube channel and
press the bell icon to never miss an
update
so before moving ahead let's understand
about deloitte
so deloitte is one of the most reputed
big four accounting companies and the
largest professional service provider by
revenue as well as the number of
professionals
the company offers financial advisory
services enterprise risk
consulting tax and audit services with
over 2 lakh 63 900 professionals
worldwide it earned a record of 38.8
billion us dollars in revenue in the
financial year 2017.
as of 2016 deloitte is considered the
sixth largest private organization in
the united states
deloitte has the largest number of
clients among ftsc 250 firms in uk in
2012
according to the reports it also had the
highest market share in auditing among
india's top 500 corporations in 2015.
the company has been ranked first by
market share in consulting for the
fourth consecutive year by gartner
kennedy consulting research and advisory
would delight first in global consulting
and management consulting based on
aggregate
revenue so
as we have understood about deloitte
now let's have a look at deloitte
interview questions
so our first question is what is the
difference between stored and triggered
procedures
so a stored procedure is a defined code
written in sqlpl
which may or may not provide a value
when invoked by calling it explicitly
on the other hand a trigger is a stored
process that operates automatically when
an event occurs
so this is the difference between a
stored and triggered procedure
now moving on to the second question
that is what is back propagation
so back propagation is a common method
of calculating the gradient of the loss
function concerning the weights in an
artificial neural network
it is widely used as a part of
algorithms that optimize the network's
performance by adjusting the weights
now
let's look at the third interview
question that is
what is the difference between a
crossover and a straight through cable
so let us start with the straight
through first
a straight through is between a modem
and a computer
switch or router
whereas a crossover cable is between two
networking devices
a straight through is used for
connecting unlike devices for example
connecting a computer to a switch
whereas on the other hand crossover
cables are mostly used for connecting
similar devices that is between two pcs
a straight through is used for
connecting a router to a hub whereas a
crossover is used for connecting between
hubs and between switches
so a straight through cable is a type of
cat5 with rj45 connectors at each end
and each has the same pin out
on the other hand the crossover table is
a type of cat where one end is
t568a configuration and the other end is
t568b configuration
so these were some of the key
differences between a straight through
cable and a crossover cable
so now coming to the fourth interview
question which is what is smtp
so smtp stands for simple mail transfer
protocol it deals with internet mail and
offers important mail delivery services
on the iptcp protocol stack
most email solution that send emails on
the internet use smtp to send messages
from one server to another
the messages can be retrieved with an
email client through imap or pop now we
have come to the second last question of
deloitte interview questions
what is clustering support
so a clustering support is one of the
most important features that a network
operating system can offer and refers to
the ability for servers to be grouped in
fault tolerant manner
this feature simplifies the process of
upgrading servers by carrying over
running services onto new machines
without any downtime
so this was clustering support
now let's talk about our last deloitte
interview question but after this there
will be a bunch of common interview
questions and technical interventions so
wait until the end
so coming to the last interview question
of deloitte
that is what is the role of ieee in
computer networking
so ieee is the institute of electrical
and electronics engineers an institution
composed of many high qualified
engineers who are
charged of designing and managing a
whole range of electronic and electrical
devices
these includes connectors wires network
interfaces and network devices
now that we have completed all the
questions of deloitte interview we will
move on to the common questions of the
deloitte interview now
so we have compiled a list of seven most
frequently asked deloitte interview
questions responses and advice
we have also included some sample
answers to help you put your best foot
forward and showcase your desirable
talents and abilities to help you move
on one step closer to landing your ideal
job at deloitte
so reviewing some of the most popular
interview questions
asked by deloitte hiring managers can
help you prepare and enter the interview
with a clear head and well thought out
plan of what to say
setting yourself up for success in
getting ready for your job interview may
be as simple as conducting a practice
interview with these commonly asked
questions before the big day
so let us go ahead with the first common
deloitte interview question
what made you apply for a position at
deloitte
so the hiring managers across every
organization ask this question to
measure your interest and learn more
about the organization you are applying
to
so deloitte is no exception
so now
how to answer this question so you need
to prepare for this question by
researching deloitte ahead of time and
becoming familiar with its culture its
mission and professional principles
try to highlight your
expertise at least once factor that drew
you to the company in your response
so as an example
of this question would be like as an
experienced financial analyst i am
dedicated to providing the best possible
service to my clients and the knowledge
they need to make informed financial
decisions
i have been looking for a way to make a
bigger difference in my community and
this position appealed to me because
your company is knowing for its apparent
market success
rapid expansion and inclusive work
atmosphere
so this is how you can answer this type
of question
so now moving on to our next question
which is
what do you know about deloitte
so this question or something similar
will very certainly be asked throughout
the interview process at deloitte
regardless of the position you're
looking for
so to answer this question prepare for
your interview by researching and having
a few significant and relevant facts
about delight on hand so as a general
rule
know everything there is to know about
the company including what they
specialize in what they are
headquartered and when they were created
like that so in response to this
question an example would be
throughout my undergraduate education i
constantly followed deloitte's work and
was intrigued by the firm's recent
development particularly the acquisition
of terbium labs
since its founding in london in 1845
deloitte has developed tremendously also
deloitte is regarded as one of the
largest privately held professional
services firms
and i am confident in my ability to
assist deloitte in continuing to expand
and better the lives of millions of
people around the world
now moving on to the next question that
is the third common deloitte interview
question that is
how did you get into the field of
accounting
so if you are interviewing with deloitte
you are probably in the accounting
sector
this is a common question asked by
deloitte in hiring managers to determine
your professional interests so to answer
this question try to recall the specific
aspects of accounting that drew you to
the area and highlight your devotion to
the job
so an example answer to this question
would be accounting gives me enormous
pleasure
i enjoy my job because it both
challenges and fulfills me while also
allowing me to serve individuals from
all walks of life
my early interest in financial data
analysis and calculating metrics drove
me to this field
now coming to the next question
which is tell me about a point in your
career where you use the negotiation
skills to change the outcome of
something
so during the deloitte job interviews
this is one of the most often asked
questions i would say if you want to
work for deloitte you would require
exceptional negotiation and
communication abilities regardless of
department or function
so to answer this question try to recall
a time when you utilize your negotiation
abilities to close a sale
explain a complex concept to a client or
influence the outcome of a team meeting
you should attempt to demonstrate
excellent communication and
interpersonal skills in your response
so an example answer to this question
would be like in a recent case i use my
negotiation talents to pursue a customer
not to seek financial assistance from a
competitive firm
after listening to the customer's
concerns i addressed them directly
i met with their chief financial officer
extensively resulting in negotiating a
new consulting agreement that was more
suited to the company needs
and in my experience
clear and powerful communication is
crucial in each negotiation
so that's how you can answer this type
of question
now next question in our list is
how do you manage deadlines and tasks
so working quickly and achieving
deadlines are often critical to
employees success at deloitte
passion focused and efficient employees
are significantly more appealing to the
hiring managers
so to answer this question you should
emphasize your time management and
organization skills in response
an example answer of this type of
question would be
with more than three years of
professional auditing experience i have
owned my time management skills and can
easily stay on target while managing
many assignments and deadlines on any
given day
to meet deadlines and accomplish all
activities promptly i prioritize and
plan tasks set goal
dedicate when appropriate and keep the
clear communication with my team
so this type of question can be answered
like this
so
next question would be how do you stay
focused when performing audits and other
tax and legal services
so working with numbers
might become tedious sometimes
but remaining focused is crucial if you
want to work with deloitte
so hiring managers frequently ask this
question to assess your ability to
complete tasks and remain focused on the
job for this question
when providing audits and legal services
expressing your capacity to be
methodological and paying close
attention to detail in a wonderful
approach to responding
so an example answer of this question
would be like auditing and reviewing
figures are two things i enjoy doing
i am hyper aware of the task at hand at
all times
paying close attention to detail and
scrutinizing data for any fraud or any
kind of abnormalities you can say that i
tackle all audits and financial
assessments analytically and rigorously
to keep focused
so
we have reached the last question in
this deloitte common interview questions
so let's discuss the last question now
what can you bring to deloitte
so during the job interviews at deloitte
deloitte recruiting managers frequently
asked this question to further analyze
potential workers talents and
competencies
to answer this question this is an
excellent opportunity to showcase your
finest abilities
answer this question by mentioning any
relevant work experience you have and
highlighting your best professional
qualities an example answer of this type
of question would be like i am convinced
that with over five years of auditing
and tax experience i can help deloitte
expand and broaden its client base while
continuing to provide the high quality
financial services that delight
customers expect
so when auditing limited companies huge
organization in small firms i have a
keen eye for detail
a vested interest in the financial
system and a demonstrated track record
of providing remarkable outcomes so
these were some common deloitte
interview questions
that will act as a valuable resource for
your interview preparation for deloitte
moving ahead let's have a look at some
of the deloitte technical interview
questions
so now we will go through some of the
technical questions which you need to
prepare for technical interview round
so the first question is what is
polymorphism in programming
so we will address this question then
you will have to prepare these questions
on your own as there is a technical
questions and you will have to
understand this question in detail
so first is what is polymorphism
programming so polymorphism is a very
important concept of object-oriented
programming and is often asked in
interviews so you must prepare this
question in order to qualify the
interviews second would be how can you
create and use threads in java
so the course or path followed when a
program is being performed is referred
to as a thread in java you can prepare
for this question in detail as it is
also an important question
now third is what are the similarities
between array list and vector
so here you can learn four to five
points on the difference between both
this list and vector
so next would be what is an implicit
cursor
so an implicit cursor is a topic of
plsql that you have to prepare because
it is also an essential topic if you are
preparing for not just deloitte but any
interview question
is what do you understand about
tunneling protocol in computer networks
so it is a computer network question
that you will have to prepare
after that there is sixth question
so sixth question is what is proxy
server then the seventh question is what
are the pros and cons of star topology
in computer networks
then eighth question would be
differentiate between hierarchical
database models and networks in dbms so
it is also again a very important topic
then the next is what are different
storage classes in c
so it is a concept of c that you will
have to prepare as well
then what is generational garbage
collection in the context of java and
what makes it popular so it is a pretty
famous concept in java that will have to
prepare
now coming to the next question that is
11th
so what are the advantages and
disadvantages of using threads in
context to the operating system
all right now the 12th question would be
what are excess specifiers in c plus you
will have to prepare it and 13 question
would be of dbms like what is the
difference between care and wear care in
dbms
all right now then there is
differentiate between hash join
sort merge join and nested loop join in
dbms so now coming to our last question
that is the 15th question of deloitte
technical interview questions
so that would be explain ddl dcl and dml
statements in sql
so you will have to prepare all these
technical interview questions and you
can prepare some more technical
interview questions but these questions
are being asked in deloitte interviews
so if you want to qualify those
interviews you will have to
prepare these technical interview
questions in
depth in great depth i would say
so now
so as we have gone through the deloitte
technical interview questions we are now
going to discuss the interview process
at deloitte
so let's go ahead
and do it
so interview process at deloitte so it
takes professionalism precision and
tremendous competence to get a job at
deloitte
the way that you prepare for a job
interview can be the difference between
being offered a position and not so in
order to come across as a confident
capable candidate it's important to know
what to expect
what to prepare and answer for a typical
interview question well in advance you
have to prepare those questions in
advance
and also have an appropriate strategy
for how to handle the interviews
so the first step would be a
submission of application
as we can see
the most critical aspect of hiring
process is submitting a polish job
application
so the fastest way to get an interview
and eventually be employed by deloitte
is to submit a detailed edited and
well-constructed job application
job applications can be submitted online
through deloitte's career page but many
workers first apply via college career
fairs or by being referred by current
employees
so after submitting the application then
there would be first interview round
so you will be contacted for an
interview if the hiring manager said
deloitte are impressed with your
application
so within one to three months you should
receive an email or phone call from them
so the initial round of interviews may
be held in person over the phone or over
skype or video conference depending on
the position you are looking for and the
location of the employment
so the initial interview for a position
at deloitte is usually conducted by a
human resource professional and
comprises basic interview questions such
as critical thinking resume based
questions regardless of the role
so a short just a minute round is
sometimes included in deloitte first
round of interviews whereas a job
applicant is assigned subjects to speak
on for like one minute
so after that then after there will be a
second interview round
so if you are aced your first deloitte
interview your work isn't done yet
deloitte requires most new workers to go
through two or three rounds of
interviews before getting hired
so if you are
preparing for interviews or if your
first interview was conducted in person
the second interview could be completed
shortly after the first
so deloitte is recognized for conducting
in-depth interviews with job seekers
frequently asking applications to go to
one of their over 700 globes offices for
a full day of interviews
so deloitte's second job interview
usually lasts about 30 minutes and
includes a behavioral and
situational interview questions
so in case you are seeking a job for a
highly specialized or technical position
such as an engineer or programmer the
interview is frequently conducted by a
senior manager and contains a slew of
situational interview questions
so then there would be a third interview
round
finally suppose you're seeking a senior
or highly technical position inside the
company
in that case you will very certainly be
required to go through another round of
questioning with senior management
partner department director or possibly
a panel of interviewers
after the second interview
so only the most eligible individuals
are invited to the third interview
during the third interview it's very
important to put your best foot forward
because every word will be scrutinized
and evaluated
so the third interview like the second
usually includes additional situational
and job specific interview questions
so once the interview rounds are done
then there would be pre-employment
aptitude testing
so in this test you may be requested to
do an aptitude test to further analyze
your skills to perform the work
depending on the exact post you have
been applying for
so your skill level and your personal
professional experience will be in there
so a quantitative logical and verbal
reasoning section is usually included in
the deloitte's pre-employment aptitude
test to assess your talents
so the test may be more involved for
specific professions such as audit
associate or computer programmer
required applicants to complete a mock
audit answer more math questions or
build a java algorithm
once all these interviews and tests are
done then there would be orientation and
training
so orientation and training in this only
orientation and training will remain in
the onboarding process once you have
received a formal employment offer you
will probably be required to fill
out paperwork consent to a background
check and fingerprints and take an
employment drug test during this stage
so every deloitte's employee regardless
of rank is expected to attend a new
employee orientation which includes a
thorough review of corporate policies
and procedures
so you will begin
your new employment after orientation
with the initial few months usually
being spent in training or no probation
you have to go through a lot
of like one-on-one training or a very
little depending on the position of your
level of proficiency so this was the
interview process at deloitte
now there are some frequently asked
questions regarding the interview
process and round so let's have a look
at some frequently asked questions
so the first question is
are deloitte interviews hard so it makes
no difference if the deloitte interview
questions are simple or difficult the
truth is that the more you prepare for
the interview the more likely you are to
succeed
study rounds questions stages etc
understand the role completely including
what they expect from you the skill set
you will require and the credentials you
will need
so
another popular question would be
where do you see yourself in five years
so tell them you want to learn and
master particular technology
you must persuade them that you intend
to stay with the company for a longer
period you can say you want to improve
your skills gain more confidence and
keep your job in the company and within
the next five years you want to be
acknowledged as an authority in that
field
you can become a seasoned specialist if
given the opportunity
the recruiter is just interested in
finding out how long you plan to stay
with the company and how satisfied you
are with your current position
so this is how you can answer this
question
so next
these two questions are very interesting
like what is your salary expectations so
this is a challenging one you can choose
to quote the exact amount or not but you
must advise them of the percentage
increase you are considering
instead of requesting to a certain ways
demonstrate your commitment to the
position
so our next interesting question would
be what is the starting salary for
fresher in deloitte
so
in deloitte the starting salary for a
fresher is roughly around 4.5 lakhs per
year
all right now moving on to the next
questions
why should we hire you so it is again
very famous question i would say the
interviewer is working to identify
whether you would be good fit for their
organization
as a result you will need to persuade
them you can say something like i can
grab information quickly you can discuss
your abilities skills and past
experiences in this section
as well as how you can bring something
fresh to the rule
all right now
our next question that is next faq
question
what are your strengths and weaknesses
so you can address your strengths by
elaborating on the following points
and you can have your strengths and
weaknesses
you can say that but
in this case i would say like goal
oriented and versatile this is our
strength goal oriented and versatile
then second would be ability to handle
pressure
and our third strength would be strong
communication skills because all these
three skills are highly appreciated in
the
deloitte organization and the following
are the weaknesses that you can address
like self-critical multitasker and
discomfort in taking big risks
so again you can write down or
learn your own strengths and weaknesses
that you know
and
yes now moving on to the next question
which is
how do you handle stress over tight
deadlines
so it is an important question that is
often asked employers are searching for
examples of how stressful situations
motivate you or how you may have prevent
stressful situations by planning and
communicating effectively
to demonstrate your capacity to operate
under pressure
give an example of how you coped with a
difficult situation at your previous
workplace
