hello everyone welcome to the world of
power bi in this tutorial we'll start on
a journey to unleash the immense power
of data visualization and Analysis power
bi is a cutting-edge business
intelligence tool that enables you to
transform raw data into meaningful
insights interactive reports and
captivating dashboards now whether you
are a data Enthusiast analyst or
business professional the basics of the
power bi tutorial will equip you with
the fundamental Knowledge and Skills to
leverage power bi's robust capabilities
so get ready to dive into Data
exploration data modeling and
visualization as we unravel power bi's
Basics and Empower you to make informed
decisions consistently so let's unlock
the true potential of your data together
and having said that if you're an
aspiring data analyst looking for online
training and certifications from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simply learns pose rajet
program in data analysis from Purdue
University in collaboration with IBM
should be a right choice for more
details use the link in the description
box below and with that in mind over to
our training experts what is power bi it
is a business intelligence tool to
visualize your data and share insights
across your organization so when we talk
about bie it came into existence as a
self-service bi tool and it does have
different components which can be used
now before we get into details of power
bi let's understand what are the
different components or what are the
different ways in which you can work on
your power bi now one of the main
challenges when it comes to
organizations or users is that data is
scattered in different places it might
be in different formats and anyone
everyone would want to use that data to
basically perform some calculations
create visualizations or dashboards
which could be interactive and that's
where they would want to bring all the
data in one place might be transform it
so that you can filter out and not load
huge amount of data in your system and
you can work on selective data so when
it comes to power bi it helps us in ETL
it helps us in data modeling it helps in
data storage and Reporting so what are
the benefits of power bi here are some
of the benefits so extract intelligence
rapidly accurately so that's basically
transforming your Enterprise data into
Rich visuals and accurate reports for
enhanced decision making now one thing
we already know that when we talk about
data data in raw format might have a lot
of hidden information if we look at
different data sets which I'll show you
in the process
it might have a lot of meaning but then
the real meaning comes out of the data
if we can create visualizations if we
can create relationships between
different data sets and thus that can
help us in enhanced decision making
Now power bi supports Advanced Data
Services it integrates seamlessly with
Advanced cloud services like Cortana to
provide results for the verbal data
queries as well
when you talk about
seamlessly integrating with existing
applications that's one more benefit of
power bi so it adopts analytics and
Reporting capabilities easily to embed
interactive visuals quickly in your
applications you can build Rich
personalized dashboards so it basically
provides a unified user experience with
customized dashboard and reports that
meet your exact needs it also has a way
where you can have secure way of
publishing your reports so you can set
up automatic data refresh and rapidly
publish reports allowing multiple users
to Avail the latest information across
your organization or across your working
community
so power bi can connect to different
sources we'll see that in a while so
basically you have an option which says
get data and that basically opens up a
window where you can find different type
of data sources such as Excel your CSV
or text Json PDF
getting data from databases or directly
accessing data from databases now before
we get further into understanding how
power bi looks like it would be good
idea to share information in how you can
set that up on your machine so when it
comes to your power bi and let me open
up a notepad here
so for example I bring up a notepad
let's say when you talk about your power
bi components
so you basically have
power bi desktop
and that's mainly your playground or
that's mainly used for any kind of
development activities
you have your power bi server
or you can say service now this one is
where you would make reports
online
and
share
or make them available
[Music]
to different views
now that's one more component of power
bi and then you also have your power bi
mobile which is mainly for viewing the
information I would say viewing reports
so these are the three main components
we can also look at the licensing
information of these so these are the
main so power bi desktop is something
which you can set up on your laptop or
on your machine power bi server is where
you can log in with your user ID and
password and power bi mobile is mainly
to view your reports now how do you set
this up before you can explore or start
working on power bi so here is a link
which you can basically use so if you
look into this so this one basically
says Service cell service sign up for
power bi it says sign up of power bi
Service as an individual normally when
you would want to use power bi you can
use a website called stdp and then you
have basically
app
and let's say
I think it's called app powerbi.com now
this is the place where you can
basically log in now if you see here I
have created an account and if you look
at my account it says auatl dot on
microsoft.com now how do you get this
kind of email because when you talk
about power bi it will expect you to
have a official ID and it does not take
IDs which are from common domains such
as Google or Yahoo and so on so this
particular link gives you an idea how
you can do that so basically you have
what is power bi basic explanation on
that it says signing up for power bi
service so power bi desktop it's a
totally free download and then you have
mobile apps also a totally free download
and here it says
that what kind of email addresses it
supports and if we look into this you
have to either sign up because that does
not accept your private email IDs or you
can go for this one which says enroll US
government organization and this is
where you can basically sign up for
power bi so it basically says try free
if you go to the website say power
bi.microsoft.com or you could go into
this one which I was saying HTTP slash
slash app Dot
your powerbi.com and this is what you
can use or as mentioned you can go to
powerbi.microsoft.com for example if I
open this in a different tab
it takes me to about via Microsoft I can
say start free I can click on this
it says try free but then when it asks
you to sign in this is where some of us
face problem because it does not take
your private email ID now how do you
tackle that what you can do here is on
this page which says learn about
alternate ways to sign up you can
basically open up this link and in this
link it says sign up for power bi with
the new Microsoft 365 trial account and
what you can do is you can basically
click on this link which takes you to
The Office 365 and what you can do here
is you can search for something which
says say 365 E3 and here you have tried
for free
so in my case it is translating okay so
here you have an option which says try
it for free click on this one and then
basically go ahead with your sign up
process now once you do that you can
basically create an account or give a
email ID so it asks you to give an email
ID to check if you already have an
account and once you do that it will
guide you through the process where you
can create an account like I have done
now once you have done that so for
example we can go into my this page
which I said HTTP slash slash app
powerbi.com
now once you have created an account you
would be asked to log in now I can click
and log in here and then basically given
my password and once I do that it takes
me to the power bi server or service now
on the top right it might say that go
for a trial version I have already
selected that and this is a Pro trial
which is giving me validity for 60 days
so this is the service which I can use
now what it means is I can be using my
power bi desktop which would be also
installed so once you log into this page
you can basically click on apps you can
basically search for something like
power bi and that will show up in the
app and you can install and download on
your machine now once that is there you
can basically bring it up so for example
in my case I can just say power bi
desktop and that's the app which I have
installed on my machine and basically
that comes up so that's your power bi
desktop which is coming up and it will
still ask you to sign in so that you can
share your information through Power bi
so you see here on the top I'm already
signed in and here it also shows you
some tutorials and videos which
basically helps you in getting to know
something more or what's new so you can
always browse that so you would have
your power bi desktop which would be set
up
you would also have your power bi
service which would be running and then
basically whatever you have developed on
your power bi desktop you can share that
through the power bi service now usually
when you talk about licensing I can give
you brief insights here so you basically
have your power bi Service as I said
licensing so you have the pro version
which is basically
uh your 9.9 dollars
per user per month
and basically it has some kind of
limitation so it has say Max 10 gigabyte
you can work on uh some features like
incremental refresh is not allowed you
can always look onto the Microsoft
website for more details and in those
kind of cases you usually go for the
premium account if you are a extensive
user and premium account basically is
conditional based so it depends on your
requirements and then basically you pay
for the service what you use so that's
mainly about your servicing now when you
talk about your server and Service as I
said it is basically making your reports
online and sharing and making them
available to different bus so that is
the Highlight so when you talk about
sharing reports that's one of the things
you have and normally detection
that's also possible here you can talk
about automation of reports you have
security that is you can go for role
based or row level based kind of
security implementation and all those
are some of the features of your power
bi server and service so it is good to
know and basically have your desktop and
power bi service set up now once you
have that then you basically have your
power bi now when you talk about your
power bi it basically helps you with
various things so this is how easily you
can have it set up and then basically
you can explore this so for example as I
was saying power bi can connect to
different data sources now I do have an
option here which says get data I can
click on this and that shows me all the
different data sources I can even click
on more if I'm interested in looking
what more power bi desktop tool helps me
to do so it shows me all the different
ways in which you can get the data you
see here the servers so the database
Services your folders your different
formats you can click on file formats or
databases you can look at Power Platform
so if basically you are connecting to a
platform and getting some Services you
can connect to the cloud that is azure
you have online services and then you
have other options so these are all the
ways in which you can get your data when
you talk about visualizations you see a
lot of visualization options here which
can be used once your data is loaded and
I will explore and explain more about
this so you have something called as
insert wherein you can go in for
different visuals or different types you
can also get into say transform the data
now that basically is going to pop up
and bring a power query editor now
that's where a lot of your ETL Works
happen so when you when you do a
transform data it opens a power query
editor which we can use to transform the
data or change the data or modify the
data as per our requirement before
loading all of it into our power bi
so you also have option here which says
modeling wherein we can create new
tables or we can work on our data where
we can manage relationships so as of now
we don't have any data so it does not
show this one is activated but that can
be activated this is where you can view
your reports so this is in short
exploring your power bi we'll see what
are the different options which we can
use here so it basically supports
different kind of data so when we look
at the visualization pane that
basically allows us to create different
kind of visualizations here and we will
understand that so you can basically
visualize on your different data and
create different kind of charts graphs
maps and basically derive insights from
your data now when you talk about data
models that's where you can basically
establish relationships so when you talk
about data models it is basically used
to connect multiple data sources to
build a relationship now we might have
different data sets or we might have
data coming in from different tables
where we may want to basically
get insights or get data from multiple
data sources
for our purpose now in that case data
models to help us so for example if you
have two tables let's look at the
standard tables so you have products
lookup table and you also have the sales
table now usually what you have in any
kind of scenario is if we basically say
you have your data tables so that's
basically where your data resides and
then you have series of your lookup
tables so usually you might have say
your data tables here
and this is what I am talking about
which might have some data for example
let's say sales is one of them you might
have some other data table which might
be for example let's say budget table
or maybe something else and these are
your data tables now at the other end
you might have your lookup tables so
basically you have various lookup tables
and these lookup tables for example
let's say this one is customer
this one is territory
let's say this is product
and let's say this one is a calendar
so these are basically my lookup tables
so we can basically as I said your data
might be coming in from different
sources let's say database or let's say
some kind of files or let's say some
kind of systems what you have so your
data might be coming in from different
places now you might want to transform
the data so this is where I could say
there is your query editor which I was
explaining so you have your query editor
which basically allows you to edit the
data table or basically allows you to
edit the data before it is loaded right
you can hide a column you can add a new
column you can modify your column so
your query editors would be basically
used to work on the data which goes into
your data tables now you might have a
lot of lookup tables as I said so let's
say these are my lookup tables
and these are my data tables so what we
need is sometimes we need information
based on our lookup tables and data
tables now that's where data modeling
comes into picture so basically if I
would want to extract information from
here so I can notice that there is a
product key here and there is a product
key here now this is where we are
already talking about say foreign keys
or we are talking about your
relationships right now when you talk
about relational databases you have
something called as foreign key
constraints which is in in power bi
terms I would say it's not exactly a
constraint but it is more of a filter
propagation instead which is used to
basically connect your different data
sources and you could have basically
cross filter directions you can go for
single or one to one or one too many or
many too many kind of relationships
which basically allows you to work on
the data so we will learn more about
data models when we are doing a quick
demo there where we can talk a little
bit about
normalization and denormalization the
way the data exists right and then you
basically would want to gather insights
from your data so when you talk about
your
two data sources as I said so you have a
products lookup table you have a sales
table now if you would want to calculate
the total order quantity of each product
name which is we are talking about the
order quantity as a information here and
you have product name here now how do
you get that information what we see
here is we would want something like
this or we would want more information
so how do we do that so what we can do
is the order quantity for each product
is basically showing us the same value
now this is because the product and
sales tables are not connected and there
is no relationship between them even if
you would want to take two sources and
just get information out of them
probably I would complain that there is
no relationship established between them
so what we do is we create a data model
so what we do is we build a relationship
between both the tables using a common
key column which exists in both cases as
I said there is a product key here there
is a product key here so that basically
allows us to have a relationship between
these two now that could be one to one
this could also be related to other
tables so it could be one to many you
could have many to one so all those
relationships are possible so product
key is basically used to create a
relationship you see the arrow Mark and
then there is also the star which can
basically mean one to many now when the
product key is used to join these two
tables or from a relationship then we
can look at the product names and the
order quantities which basically gives
me a total now that's the basic use of
your data models now what about this Dax
so basically data analysis Expressions
now that's a a library of functions and
operators that can be combined to build
formulas and expressions and power bi
desktop usually when we work on our data
sources when we would want to connect
them it automatically shows us this data
analysis Expressions however this gives
us extension it basically gives us more
power to work on our data no sometimes
instead of working on Dax or Dax
Expressions it would be good to go for
better data modeling and have the
relationships established better and
sometimes when the relationships are
established you could use your Dax which
basically gives you more power on
working on your data so your values are
calculated based on information from
each row of a table it appends values to
each row in a table and stores them in
the model it increases the file size so
that's what happens now you can right
click on any column to add a new column
and for example in this one it shows
that there was a quantity type
calculated column which was based on the
calculation what we see here on the top
in the in the expression bar which says
what kind of calculation was performed
and that basically gives us the value
for quantity type and that is basically
added here to are existing data
so that's the power of Dax and power bi
so you also have something called as
measures so Dax allows you to create new
calculated columns and measures so
basically here if you see we are working
on AW underscore sales and then we have
selected quantity sold and what we are
looking in the report is we can
basically right click on any table name
to add a new measure here so we have
added what we call as quantity sold as
the measure so values are calculated
based on information from any filters in
the report we will see this how this can
be done and that basically here the
measure does not increase the file size
it does not create new data in the table
themselves in comparison to what we were
seeing earlier that is your calculated
columns so these are your type of Dax
functions so Dax allows you to create
new calculated columns and measures so
you have date and time which basically
allows you to work on date and time data
or Fields you have logical functions
which allow us to create new filters or
add more filters to our data you have
text functions which basically allows us
to say transform the data into a lower
case or an upper case or basically get
the length of a string or concatenate
two fields or basically do a filtering
based on some criterias or replacing
some content you also have statistical
functions which can be used you have
information functions which can be used
so these are different types of Dax
functions which we can use in power bi
so we will learn more on power bi
through a quick demo where we can use
some data sets and those data sets could
be found on internet
although I can also upload that on a
GitHub link and you will
access to those data sets so let's learn
about power bi through a quick demo by
uploading some data sets and playing
with those data sets let's look at a
sample data set and let's upload it
and as I explained while uploading let's
also transform the data so that we can
have selective Fields so selected data
loaded here instead of loading the
complete data set and then let's see how
we can visualize this or how we can use
the information in this data set now
what we can do here is we can click on
get data and then we can choose one of
the data formats which we would be
looking for so for example I can go for
excel and basically
click on this now here are some of my
data sets so let's look into the folder
here and these data sets are also
available on my GitHub link which I'll
share with you later so here we have
something called a Superstore let's
click on this and here I already have a
data set which is global Superstore or I
also have selective data so let's select
this one click on open
now that's basically connecting to my
data source and that will show me what
does that Excel sheet have so it has
different tabs which is orders people
and returns so let's select orders
and that basically gives me a preview of
the data which I have and if you scroll
all the way to write it shows me city
state and then country and if you see
here we do see information of all the
countries now this can be huge amount of
data which may which we would want look
into but say for example my use case is
that I am interested in looking for the
data for United States and as a country
and all it states so we will do that
when we do a transform now we can also
select the returns Tab and that shows me
these three Fields however the first row
should have been the heading of this
particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on transform
data now once you do that it brings you
your toolkit that brings you your power
query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or return
status source as you see here so we see
column one column two and column three
and that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
also do a merge query or append query so
as of now let's just say use first row
as headers and that basically shows that
now my first row has become the header
you also see in the applied steps it
basically tells me if I have changed the
type of the data if I have made any
other changes those steps will get added
here so it basically shows me the name
as it returns it shows me applied steps
where I have changed the type and now I
basically have this information now this
is something where you can change the
type or you can basically set it to a
particular format however we are not
doing anything of that sort right now so
we can do that for any of these columns
so this looks good when it comes to
orders let's click on this and as I said
and I would be interested in selecting
for country as United States only and
let me just work on that data however we
can work on all the data so let me
scroll all the way to right and here I
have the country now there are these
filters which we can use so basically I
can click on this and that shows me all
the countries are selected now there is
also something called as text filters
which we will see how we can use to
select particular data I basically have
other ways of filtering the data so for
example now I will just uncheck this
select all and what I would be
interested is in United States so let's
type it here that shows me has an option
here select this and then basically say
okay
so that should basically now filter out
and it shows me the data is United
States only and then you have different
states and rest of the data remains so
if you look at the applied steps it
tells me that there are filtered rows
now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set
on these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
which says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the changes
which I have performed using my query
editor that is I have transformed the
data so that I can have selective data
uploaded in my power bi now it's doing
that it shows me it is working on both
of these data sources that is orders and
returns so that's done and now basically
if there are any other pending changes
we can just do a close and apply so that
basically has closed and now you would
see the data appearing here so I have
uploaded the data as per my preferences
now if you click on the data tab here
so it basically shows you your data
fields it might take some time to
populate but if you see in the country
field now if even if I click on the
filter it just shows me United States
now that's what we wanted so we have
already uploaded this data in orders you
can always expand the option here which
shows me all the fields which are there
in this might be this is an aggregation
might be that's an order date so this is
again some kind of aggregation we can
change the data types so we are looking
at all the fields in my order stable or
basically coming from the orders data
source I also have returns which shows
me three fields and that shows me the
data which is returned order ID and
region so the column names are applied
correctly as we want and that basically
looks fine now we can also look at your
model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which relates to orders
and returns then that would fail because
it would say there is no relationship
now I can go to the first option which
says report and we have not created any
report here although we can create a
simple report we can look at the data so
we have our orders field now we can
basically pull out some information from
here we can choose what kind of report
we may want to create so for example
let's go for the table option from
visualizations you have various options
here which we can use this is where you
can do a formatting this is where you
can select the fields this is where you
can search and filter out the data you
can also add data fields here so first
let's click on table
and that basically gives me a table now
this table as of now does not have
anything so you can use the filter and
slices
option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have orders here so
this is my orders and I would like to
work on this so let's say for example
country is I can select country as a
field and if you say it shows me country
is all as of now and it says the value
is United States what I can also do is
I'm interested in the states so I have
state now I can basically drag and drop
it here and then the state gets added
here so I can basically say select all
and that should basically take care of
my State field being added here so state
is all country is all now we can
basically look at something else so
might be let's choose sales and I can
just drag and drop sales here here so
that basically says if you would want to
have any kind of advanced filtering
which says filter type so go for
advanced filtering is less than or equal
or you can also go for advanced filters
so that's fine as of now so we have
added some Fields here and that's
basically
my data here so let's go for filters
here
which basically should select all my
fields
now if you see the visualization shows
my country sales and state which we had
either by selecting the fields and
dropping them here or you can in this
section where it says field so you can
for example let me show it again so I
can just delete this I can click on the
table option I can just drag it here I
can basically make it bigger and I need
to add data to this one so it says add
data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested in States
so let's drop that here and let's say
sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can basically increase the font
here we can change the grid color so for
example let's make it for example blue
so I can just select this
and it should basically
allow me to have the grid color as blue
now I can go in for the grid thickness I
can go for row padding outline color so
we can basically make it a little bit
more readable and then we can basically
increase the font size here
to look at the information
and you have other options here so what
would you want to do with column headers
so I can basically have the font color
background color is fine do you want to
have an outline do you want to have a
change in font what is the text size
might be we can make the heading a
little bigger and then basically you
also have the field formatting so all
those could be done you could go for
background and all these things can be
done in formatting so now we already
have our data here and this basically
looks good and this is basically one of
my visuals which I have here and this
has given me some information for sales
and basically I can scroll this I can
also make it bigger
so I could select a particular field if
I'm more interested in looking at the
information for a particular State now I
can add more fields to this
so this is my one of the reports which I
have created now what I can do with this
report is I can basically have more data
fields I can add filters to this I can
basically look into all the data here by
just clicking somewhere in the grid but
somewhere outside if you select a
particular row then that data shows up
here you have an option of focus mode
which you can go for you can look at the
other options which says export data now
if this is the data which you are
interested in you can export it you can
always to show as a table if you are
interested in you can do a sort by
country sales or state so for example
let's do a sorting by state
and that basically gives me the data
which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me
alphabetically this is the information
which I have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a power bi file which has an
extension of pbix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say state
wise sales in
USA
let's say
USA and that basically is my first
report
now
once you have saved this report you can
always look on your machine for example
if I go in here and if I go into this
folder might be I should look on desktop
and this is where I should have saved it
so it shows me first report statewise
that will open up in power bi and we
have created a simple report which we
have basically used by taking our data
now I can also do is I can publish this
if I would want to share this
information so publish this report
online in power bi service you can
basically select
your report what we have here and I
clicked on publish so it says what's the
destination so you can have different
workspaces I will choose the default
that's my workspace I can click on
select now it says publishing first
report Statewide sales in USA to power
bi you can create a portrait view of
your report and you can do all that
stuff so let it publish and then we can
basically look into our power bi server
that's our service where the information
is already shared
or published I would say which can then
be shared with different resources so we
can come here and basically I can look
into the power bi and this is where I
will be able to look into my workspaces
and let's look in my workspace so it
says this is the place where I had
initially downloaded power bi data set
it says your data set is ready let power
bi help you explore your data right so
you can always do this you can click on
view data set
which basically allows you to bring out
your workspace and first report State
why sales now that's the report which we
have published so let's first check in
our desktop if that's done so it says
success open first report in power bi
now I can click on this one straight
away and that takes me to my service now
once it takes me to the service it shows
me the report which we created which we
published and it basically has the
option where I can save it
as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in the
in a website or a portal I can publish
to web
embed this report for Public Access by
anyone on the internet we can do that we
can export it to PowerPoint so we can do
all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are
interested in something specific
you can do a sharing to teams so if you
have your teams or group set up you can
share it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically give
usage metrics report now that can be
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with power bi Pro will have access
to the support recipients will have the
same access as you unless row level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them
look at this report
right you can also allow recipients to
build new content using the underlying
data sets and you can send an email
notification to the user so as of now I
don't have any other groups so I'll not
be sharing it but I have created a
simple report now let's also look at
edit report let's just to see what it
helps us and when you click on edit
report it basically brings up this one
which says your file view it gives you
the filters it basically
allows you to add data fields to this so
it is basically giving access to these
data sets which were in my desktop
it is basically allowing you to give or
create different visualizations now here
we have the data which we are looking at
and if say for example somebody is
interested in filtering the data so you
could do that so you could click on
filter here and that basically applies
this is the filter we have now country
is fine sales might be I can click on
sales and I would say okay let's look at
sales which is more than a particular
amount so we can say is greater than and
might be I can give a number here so I
can say 30
000.
and basically
I can say apply filter
so right now I'm applying filter and I
would look at the values which also
shows me the total value is changed so
you have not only created a report you
have published it and now
from the service you can edit it so I'm
looking at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say first
report underscore
state wise sales and I will say modified
so let's do a save
and the report has been saved
so now you're looking at the data here
so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace here
I can click on reports and that does
show me my previous report it shows me
the modified report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metrics so let's
click on this one and that basically
shows me the report usage metrics which
is generated so views per day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports
and that basically took me to usage
metrics I could be sharing it I can
analyze in Excel I can look for quick
insights based on this data what we have
you can basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me
the data sets which can be used to
create further reports and we have our
data here
so
for example if I click on create report
it basically gives me these data sets
and we can continue working on this so
this is how I have a simple report
created without basically working on two
different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have
and say you would want to add some
Fields so let's go to returns and say
for example I would be interested in
looking at the the products so might be
what I should do is I should replace the
report here instead of country it would
be interesting to look at the product
which we have or basically customer ID
so we can look at customer ID we can
look at the order ID which would be
interesting to see if there is a
particular order what was the sales
which was generated and if there were
any returns which were happening on that
so for example here when I have these
let me cut out country as a field and I
will basically take order ID and place
it here so now if you see my data has
been easily modified so I have my order
ID I have sales and I have statewise
information so you have basically all
the information but this is now order ID
State and so on now what if I would want
to also see
based on the order ID if I say I would
want the returned field
so for example I would want to take this
one and let's drag and drop it here now
that says cannot display the visual now
why is that so if you click on see
details that says cannot determine
relationships between the fields so it
cannot display the data because power bi
cannot determine the relationship
between two or more fields and how do we
fix that so for example if I click on
fix this now it says there is a missing
relationship between these fields use
Auto detect to search for relationships
or create them manually now I can click
on auto detect which will try to search
for fields which exist in both the data
sets or basically I can create
relationships so let's click on create
relationships and that basically takes
me to this page which says there are no
relationships defined
from table to table and so on so I can
click on new
now here it says select the tables and
the columns that are related now I can
say orders now those are my Fields where
you have ordered IDs and it
automatically shows that returns also
has an order ID
field although all the values might not
be same but this is how you can create a
relationship and it says the cardinality
says many to one so you can have
basically many to one relationship you
are saying cross filter Direction is
single so make this relationship active
and it has already helped us basically
identifying the field so I can say okay
so it says now these two tables should
be related or should be connected based
on order ID so
here we have this and let's basically
say close
now once that is done if you see
I have order ID I have returned
I have sales column and I have state and
if you see in returned I do have a value
of yes which shows this particular order
ID had generated some sales and it was
for state Alabama and it was returned
and the value is yes so if you scroll
down you basically see all the values
now we can add different filters where
we can say I would want only yes and no
now this is again an interesting report
so let's go in also into the formatting
and what we can do is we can look at say
the grid option if we would want to
basically say vertical grid and let's
say
on
and it says vertical grid color so let's
select this might be I can try doing a
black here it puts it in the right nice
table format and that basically looks
good so you have
sales returned and so on and this is
basically the order which I am seeing
here so for example if I would want to
change the order and if I'm saying okay
I would like to look at sales and
returned and so on so we can be doing
that we can come here and say for
example I have sales and returned let's
try moving the sales column over here
might be state is
an information which we would want in
the beginning so let me also move the
states all the way here so it gives me
state it gives me the order ID sales and
if there was a return which was
happening on that particular product so
easily I've modified my report now what
I can do is I can just save it
and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and now here
we will also see how you can load some
data and perform some Transformations
and basically get multiple results or
multiple tables or multiple data sets
which can be then further used for
reporting so power bi does give you a
lot of options now here you have an
option as we saw earlier that is get
data or what you can do is you have an
option where you can create new data
also which says enter data now this is
something which can be easily used if
you have relatively less number of
fields so you can basically add more
columns here and you can basically add
values so for example if I would just
call it something like
um scientist ID
okay and then I can say scientist name
and then basically I can say uh domain
and then I can say for example let's say
year of joining and and I can keep
adding the number of columns here I can
delete the columns right and I can give
this and I can say country
so that's it and now we have created
these five countries sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID be
2234 I can give some name so let's give
Peter let's say domain and I can say
biotechnology
I can give year of joining 2011 and I
can say Germany as the country
and I really don't want this particular
column so I can go ahead and delete this
now I can come here and then I can give
something else so I can say this is
scientist ID I can give John let's say
the scientist is mainly working in
physics
and then I can say 2018 and let's say
France
and go back here and let's say
four five six seven and let's say Marie
and let's say she does her research in
uh molecules and let's call it 2001 and
let's say
Italy
okay and you can continue adding data in
this way now you can say if the data is
already here so I can say for example no
I do not want this particular row
I do not want this particular row
so you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so here we
have to give some name so let's say
scientists
okay and then if you choose edit it
basically brings up your power bi editor
which allows you to work on these fields
if you would want to make some changes
now we can make some changes here we can
see what are the number of rows we can
basically perform any kind of
transactions here so this one basically
tells me what is the data type so here
we see scientist ID and this clearly
tells me this is an integer however we
will not want to do any kind of
computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work on this particular
column what I can also do is I can just
click on this and this tells me that you
would want to change it to date time or
you want to change it to some number so
I can just say string because we are not
going to perform any computation here so
on the ID column so let say text and I'm
changing it so it says replace current
add a new Step so selected column has an
existing type conversion would you like
to replace the existing conversion or
preserve the existing so I will say
replace current and now the data type
has been changed it is of a string and
if you see this step has got added here
so it says that the change type
is the kind of transformation we did
here so that's fine now what we can also
do is we have the scientist name but we
don't like the column name here so it
would be good to change this
so there is something called as remove
or remove columns and so on so when you
do a right click it gives you a lot of
options in applying filters or doing
some transformation if I just click on
this one so what I can do is I can look
at the date time
and let's go here so we have an option
which says do you want to change the
type now we could have done that here or
like I said you could choose the time
and do it you can just say transform and
how do you want to change it so do you
want to change it to uppercase well you
can do that and changes all the values
of this one
what I can do is I can again do a right
click and I can choose basically if you
would want to clean up the data or if
you would want to convert to lowercase
you want to capitalize each word so
let's choose that and if you see here
the steps are getting added now to undo
any particular step if I just cancel
this then I'm back to this if I cancel
this I'm back to my original form so you
can anytime undo your changes and you
can basically work on this so we are
working on this particular column now
there are various other options that you
can look at so for example these are
this is some of my data but it does not
have much information it would be good
to load some bigger data set and then
use these Transformations or basically
working on changing the data types as I
mentioned or if you would want to do a
filtering and remove certain fields and
only select particular Fields if that's
what you're interested doing a right
click where I want to create a copy of
this and then basically I can
use that particular copy now what I can
also do is I can add column from
examples I can duplicate column and then
I can make some changes to that so this
is my duplicate column and say for
example you would want uh this one to be
changed so we can say remove duplicates
we can basically if you are doing some
kind of change you want to change the
format here you can do that you can use
for other things like filling up and all
that now I can just call it rename and
let's say
um Alias scientist name right and I can
continue adding columns or I can do some
Transformations and once you have done
with these transactions now this one if
you see it shows as integer but is it an
integer no this is an date format so I
can go for modeling and change the
formats what I can also do is I can
select this and it says it's not a
decimal it's not a fixed decimal it is
date time it is date it is date time and
time zone
right and you can select any one of
these so for example let's make it date
which makes it more meaningful but then
what happens is when you do this it is
going for the default dates or the older
dates so I don't like that so what we
will have to do is we will have to
basically transform this and here we
have transform you have change type so
you have date and time you have date you
have time so let's choose date and time
and if you see here it gives me some
default timing based on these values
which we do not like so again filter it
out but what we can do is we can just
make sure that this is changed or you
want to make it a string because we are
not going to do any computation here so
I can keep it as date but then if I have
more Fields like month and days and so
on then you can do that so here it also
has
the option so when you have selected
this you have an option called transform
and transpose sorry transform also has
various options which allow you to work
on these do you want to do some
scientific calculations do you want to
work on
the date field so as of now it is just
integer so we can use one of these we
can do a group by but obviously we don't
have much data here so as of now let us
retain this I can just change this to
text and that's okay because we are
going to look at this later we can add
more data and work on it so as of now
once we have done all these changes you
can go back to say home and here you
have close and apply and I can basically
say close and apply so the changes will
be applied and then my new table which
we just created by entering some random
data performing some basic
transformations
will be available so if you look into
this one
so that's where my data is it shows me
the columns but there is no aggregated
column as such here you don't see any
summation Mark you just see the field
names or the column names you see the
values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no
or there is no existence of a different
table which you can join these tables or
you can perform some transactions come
back to the data set so this looks good
and we have it here now obviously we
have not created any visualization based
on this which we can and we can continue
working on it so here this is my data
set which is a small table where we have
created some data and we can use it
anytime now let's work on a bigger data
set and see what kind of Transformations
we can do we can then also see on
modeling or basically using some smarter
ways of working with the data
so what we would want to do is we would
want to load some data here so let's go
into
sorry let's go into home let's go to get
data let's use our old store data and
I'm going to take the global Superstore
which is huge data set with all the
countries and the products and the sales
which have happened and we can take this
data but before loading it as I
suggested earlier we should basically
transform the data we should basically
transform the data so that you don't end
up loading everything and you don't work
on all the data I mean unless you really
want to so here I will this Excel sheet
which I'm talking about has two
different tabs we have used it before so
let's use orders let's use returns and
that basically shows me the data what we
have so I can do a load but that's not
what we would want to do so you can do a
load and you can get all the data but
let's go to transform
make some basic Transformations before
we load the data so our power bi editor
allows us to work on this now here we
have
it says this preview may be up to nine
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because that's what
I want so it is basically setting the
first row as header which looks good and
we have some order IDs we have the
returned If the product was returned so
let's look at the filter here so it just
has yes values which we are looking at
so
it says list may be incomplete let's say
load more
and let's see what are the filters here
so either there might be a product which
is returned or it might be blank field
so that is chosen so that's fine we have
order ID we have region which is
basically showing me different regions
here let's look at orders and orders is
again having your row ID order ID order
date ship date ship mode so you have
quite large amount of data here for your
different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now
I can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now
here we have this row ID and if you see
the row ID is an integer obviously we
will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here
you don't have any row ID but here we
have row ID so let's make it uh from
integer let's make it string and I'll
say replace current so that's that looks
fine it's a row ID which we will use to
search but we are not going to perform
any computations unless you want to find
on an average on row ID or anything else
now you have order IDs so what we can do
is we can filter some values
we can rename the field as we desired
right so for example let's go in here
and what we can do is let's go into
a customer ID ship
okay and here you have say State you
have region
okay now at any point of time if I would
want to filter out the values the easier
option is that you can select on this
one and here you can do some text
filtering okay or you can basically
select the values from here so for
example if I say let's get rid of select
all what we will be interested in say
United States and UK that's the data we
want and then I can basically say okay
so it is basically going to filter out
the data which is for United States and
UK as of now now what we can also do is
how about doing some more filtering
before we basically work on this so
let's go in here and we are looking at
United States and UK related data and
let's look at
it is sometimes good that you can
basically
work on the data here so for example I
go into orders now what I would want to
do is I would want to look at
the fields okay and we want to we have
not yet loaded the data so if you look
in the background I just have my
scientists because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields so
can be used for grouping the data so we
will see that whenever you have a data
set you would already know there are
certain fields which have repeated
values which can be used to group the
data and we can do that we can change
any kind of values which are not
going to be computed on so for example I
have postal code I can use this but
again we are not going to find a postal
code which is greater than something
right so integer is not the valid type
let's change it to text okay and if for
example I would want to look at this so
I have done some
changes here
okay and this shows me null so for
example let me just revert this back and
let's make it
a whole number
okay so there are certain columns or
rows which do not have some values and
we can basically get rid of those values
so as of now we can do a filtering here
so let's keep the postal code AS integer
or let's
change it to text do a replace
content and now what we will do is we'll
scroll all the way right might be I'm
interested in technology category so
that's what I'm interested in so what I
can do is here I can do some filtering
so I can basically choose
technology now the easier way would be
since these are categories and there are
only three categories we really don't
want to go and apply text filters here
but if you had something like an office
supply and Office Inventory then you
could have done some text filters so
let's not do some text filtering here
what we can do is I would be interested
in technology so that's the field I'm
interested in so now you are only having
data which is related to technology
okay and you have some product names so
this is where we want to do some kind of
filtering so
we can rename the field we can select
some Fields so let's for example let's
go for
um
any of the field which I think might
have more entries here so for example
let's go for
Canon Wireless or Canon Image right so
let's go for product names and I will
say let's
go here
now I could have done a transformation
but that's not what we want we want to
do some it filtering so let's go to text
filter and here I can say begins with I
can say ends with I can say contains so
let's go for contains
and it says enter the value here so you
would want to keep the rows where the
product name contains something and it
gives you some suggestion
right so where you are seeing in some
values here so for example if I would
have selected this then it applies the
complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Canon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and
what do they contain
what kind of values you are looking for
so you can do that but we will not go
for advanced in one step let's go for
basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copiers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data when you look at the
country we are still focusing on United
States and United Kingdom that kind of
data right so we have filtered the data
we have done some
selection based on the data here and
what I can do is I can then
basically a rename a particular field so
I can do that I can say I'm interested
in uh
um sales which is the data here we can
basically look into the quantities so
sales is something which we are
interested in but might be we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I am interested in sales or I am looking
at if the discount percentage was
something or if the profit was more
right so we can apply different kind of
values here but what we can do is with
these changes because you don't want to
transform and make changes all here
you want to make the changes once the
data set is uploaded so we have selected
some data we have create done some
Transformations we can basically break a
particular column into multiple columns
if that's what we want if we see that we
will do an aggregation based on year or
we will do a aggregation based on the
country or year and Order ID right so we
can break this data into multiple
columns so we can do that but for now
let's do a close and apply
and
let's apply this so that's going to
apply all these changes it's going to
load my data but remember now we are
having selective or selected data which
gets loaded so that should get be
available here so it takes time
sometimes so you have to wait and then
you can go ahead and check here so for
example now I'm looking in tables let's
basically minimize this let's go for
orders and this is the data I have which
obviously row ID if you see so you have
all the row IDs and again again you can
do filtering here but this is where you
have already loaded the data the data is
available and then you can start working
on the columns here so we have this if
you closely see we see this summation
Mark and this basically means that these
are my aggregated columns or these
values are measures which can be used
for calculations so we can see that we
can create our own aggregations so we
can do that we can rename the field as
we have seen
we can filter out the data so we have
all the fields showing up from orders
and let's also look at the returns
which basically has the columns the
order ID and your region so it basically
shows the region here where was the
product returned from and we have this
information so what we are doing is we
when we were doing a text filter in the
previous example
remember it was case sensitive
okay and you have to take care of when
you're doing a text filter you have to
give a field which exactly matches as it
exists in the content now okay this is
the data we have and let's look at the
order column right now what we can do is
we can do some quick Transformations
here and we can basically look for
more data here so
let's say we have some filtering to be
done now I can do a filtering based on
my uh products
so we had all these products but now
let's do a filtering on product and then
products you have copiers you have
machines
so you have mainly two categories right
and when you look at machines it
basically talks about your PC
uh something so let's look for machines
and here we have basically The copier
fields which are more
so I can basically
go for filtering here
and that's the data we have so we don't
want to really unselect any of these
here but what I'm doing is I'm saying
text filter and let's go into this one
now and let's say contains
okay so I'm saying contains and then I
can basically say let's say copier
now that's what I'm interested in
and
show rows where product name contains
copier
okay now you can give a and condition
here so if you would want a specific
copier if you are interested in okay
let's also say
contains and let's go for laser also
laser and let's say okay
so you see the data gets filtered out
here and we have the sales which we are
seeing here so let's go to sales and we
will be interested in anything above 500
so let's go to sales
let's go for number filters let's say
greater than
I will say for example 500 oh sorry 500
okay and
let's say okay so that basically filters
out the data and then I am also
interested in quantity Where I would
want the quantity to be
more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go in
here and you can basically choose what
is the filter you want so you can apply
any number of filters now you have the
filtering here you can always click on
the filter and if you want you can just
do a clear filter and the filtering will
be gone so you have all the data right
and
this is the particular data we have and
here I have say for example
product name now I can keep the filter
because I am interested only in these
values or I can filter out so this tells
me that when we did a and it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filters say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or
so last time we did an end and I'll do
it contains laser
so
let's choose this that gives me more
entries so either the product name has
copier or it has laser it has the
quantity it has the product name and we
have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as looks like the
country name uh the year and then the
order ID so we can basically split it up
so I can select this and here I have
option of
let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select this
if I just right click here
now here it just tells me do you want a
new column do you want to create a copy
of this column okay you want to create
copy table so this is your transformed
data what you have and for example let's
create a copy table
and let's come in here
so you should be able to see your
copy table now so let's go in
and select this one
and what you need to do here is creating
a copy of this or copy table would not
be the right option what we can do is we
can work on transforming this rather
than doing it from here so you have this
option of adding a new column going for
a new measure renaming it right so
that's
okay but what we can do is Select this
particular column let's do a home and
first thing is let's go to transform so
I want to transform the data now let's
select this one and it brings up your
power editor again here we were
interested in orders so we are looking
at our data here
now if you see my country's United
States and UK so you can confirm that if
you look at categories technology
product name has copier and Laser as we
selected so those things are retained so
you have not lost any changes as of now
so this order ID column what we have now
as I said you can be doing a filtering
okay you can select this particular
column and then you have other things
which can be used to transform here like
you want to change the data type you
want to use first row as header you want
to replace some values okay you want to
run some merge queries you want to do
some analytics so all these options are
here now what we can do is while this
column is selected I can do it right
click now there is an option called
transform which is basically going to
help me in changing the data here okay
now I can basically duplicate the column
so I really don't want to work on this
column itself but it would be good to
have
a duplicate column on which we can work
on so I can do a split column here if I
would want to but let's create a
duplicate column so let's say duplicate
column
now that gives me a duplicate column so
we can rename it later so now I will not
work on my original column but I'll work
on a duplicate column and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to basically
transform or split this so again where I
click now you have a split by so we can
say split by by delimiter or by number
or by characters or by position so by
lowercase and uppercase so you can do
all of this so let's go for by delimiter
now if you see it basically identifies
the delimiter which is hyphen or Dash
now you can go for split at left most
identifier right sorry left most
delimiter right most each occurrence of
delimiter and that's what we want to do
you can look into advanced options where
it says split into columns
so do you want to split that into
columns do you want to split that into
rows because that's more or less like
doing a group by and you can say number
of columns to split into so we have here
one two three four values so that looks
good to me and let's do say for example
if I choose three
so eigen joules 3 and then split using
special characters so you could do that
so let's for example let's say okay
and let's look at the data how it looks
like we can anytime delete the data we
can keep it the way we want right so
what we did was
we created a copy of the column then we
did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a 3 as the
resulting column so I have the order ID
okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID year and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says t e c m a I'm looking at the
first one three seven zero zero and
that has in no relation to the order ID
right so we can make sure that there is
nothing which is conflicting with our
entries now once that is done so we have
order ID which can be used to categorize
the data you have order ID which is
basically the year okay and you have
order ID which is basically having some
more value now I can keep this data as I
want so I can basically click on this I
can go for renaming and I can say let's
say let's call it
order
ID
and let's say
IDs so let us in case there is a
particular column and you would want to
look at so
just give the name correctly now order
ID is find so here we will also rename
this one so let's call it
uh order
here
and that's going to be ordered here so
we can again change this to string okay
and here you have the order ID so let's
rename this one
and I have my
let's call order
number
right so we have we are seeing all the
steps which we have added here we just
split the data based on the delimiter
and we have now three new columns which
have got added to our existing data
which was already filtered and we have
done some
splitting up of data by creating a
duplicate and then renaming it right so
if you
go and look at your Transformations now
if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID with a
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on year
right now we have the year field or
order date field here you have the ship
date right but then might be you want to
just aggregate based on year you don't
want to really spend time in aggregating
or extracting the month and day and so
on so my these three columns can be
useful now what I can also do is I can
merge The Columns if I want so we have
split the columns but what I can do is I
can say select select select
so using your control and now do a right
click so you should have an option
called merge columns right now this is
something which is we would want to
merge so let's say merge columns and
let's say do you want to keep a
separator so yes I want to keep a
separator but might be this time I will
give my separator is a uh colon and then
what is the merge column name you want
to create so let's call it something
like
um
order
okay
uh year and then let's call it num
right so sometimes renaming the fields
to a name which makes more sense or
based on your naming convention is good
so let's do a merge and now what I have
done is I have done merging of those
columns so
I split the data I merge The Columns and
now if you see my
The Columns which I had created those
columns are gone because you did a merch
you did a merge and now you have the
fields which are either
uh earlier you had
something which is separated by a
hyphen and here you have something which
is separated by colon right now anytime
if you want you can
unmerge this by removing the step right
and you can get rid of this merge column
so if for example I would do that
so
I have my data back right I have my data
back so what we could have done is we
can select this
okay and then what we can do is like
what we did earlier so you can
basically go for
removing the columns okay you can do a
merge column okay you can select one by
one and create duplicate of those and
then you can merge them right so all the
possible options are there so you can
the best option would be to create a
duplicate of these columns and then
basically merge them as per your
convenience so maybe you can say order
IDs and order number is the pairing what
you want here is something which you
don't want right because we already have
the date field so I can basically say
remove
foreign
and this one is gone now I will select
this and this and let's go for merge
columns and
I want to give a separator which is
might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a symbol and then
what do you want to call it so let's say
order
specs
okay
right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the year into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order specs
right now this is some simple
Transformations what we are doing here
we are seeing the data which we have
okay now what I can do is I can
basically first apply these changes
so that all my changes what I have done
are applied right now once these changes
are done we can basically go ahead and
save this file so I can just say save I
can go for save as I have different
other options so
if you would want to perform keep
performing your transformation then you
can just do this you can add a column
you can view the data so for now our
Transformations are good enough and what
we can do is we can basically
go back to home we can do a close and
apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been transformed
so we have order specs here that's good
we did not do any filtering or
we have the filter left here which
basically tells me that there are these
different fields we have not removed
them but what we are doing is we are
just applying a filter to choose copiers
and Laser Printers
so that's what we have here and this is
good enough now what I can do is once
this is done I can basically save it
so I would want to call it some kind of
report if you would want to create okay
so let's call it
as uh let's say second
report
and here I will say
country
and Technology
specific info
let's save it
and now basically I have saved my data
so what you can do is you can go for
creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that's what you want to do if you want
to go for visualization because right
now what we are seeing is we have a lot
of data here we have a lot of data here
it shows me there are these uh tables or
data sets which we have worked on that
shows me
here in the models but there is no
relationship with them if you're going
to visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here now based on the data what
we transformed if you see we have order
specs
right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
ship date you have aggregated columns
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this and for that
what I can do is let's go for ship mode
now this is something what we have so we
are in this data field
now we have this transform so let's go
back to transform again
and let's choose our orders so that's
the data we have and now if you see here
this is
you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode
so here you have an option called Group
by so I can select this I can go in here
I can basically work on okay get rid of
duplicate values but that's not what we
want to do you want to do a group by so
as I said you can do a group by from
here or you can choose from the
transform option above and you can do a
group by so let's do a group by
now
how do you want to group the data so I'm
saying I want to group the data here
based on shipping mode
or
which is the other column you want to
use to do a group by so let's go for
shipping mode and what is the new column
name right so we want to basically find
out
that you want to go for ship mode but
that's not enough I mean I can do a ship
mode and I can do a grouping by but you
want to just count the rows no that's
not what we want to do so let's go to
Advanced so ship mode is fine so that's
your grouping right but then what we
also want to do is we want to do a
grouping based on
say sales so here for example let's go
for sales
okay and what should we call this so
maybe we can say uh shipment
wise sales whatever you would want to
call so you can basically get the
operation do you want to really count
the rows no we want to basically do a
summing or we want to might be find out
an average price right so let's do a sum
okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on
say for example sales so this is what
I'm going to use for getting a count of
the sales now grouping by might be we
will change this instead of
[Music]
instead of sales we are using a ship
mode what we can also do is let's go for
a segment
and that would be valid grouping so it
will take a combination of shift mode
segmenting group the data based on that
and then get me the sales which is
which is basically let's call it
shipment wise sales
so it gets a sum so let's do a okay
and that's my more relevant data which
I'm looking at so I'm looking at the
ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically having
a combination of two Fields so that has
to be unique and your grouping is done
based on that so now you are looking at
the sales wise and this is something as
an important information what we have so
we have done some transformation and
what you can do is
you can use other ways like you can use
pivot to get individual values from it
you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is instead of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do a paste and I have
done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping by
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based on your segment and
based on the sales so that's what we are
looking for so let's go for the ship
mode and
we go for group by
and here you would want to go for
advanced so ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment
wise sales
so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say okay
and that basically gives you the data
here now
what we have is we have the resultant
data based on the data which is coming
in from here we did the same thing just
one minute back but we worked on the
original data set so what I did was I
created a copy and now I'm working on
this one so I'll say close and apply
and now we are back to our desktop so it
is applying these changes where we have
done some Transformations we have done
some grouping by and what we can do is
once we have the data here we get
anytime look at our data sets or tables
so this is my original one if you see
now I have order summarized I can just
pull out this information I basically
have my returns which we have not really
touched and we have the scientists so we
have all the four data sets here now
what we can also do is let's look into
order summarized and we just have this
data here so this is fine and you can
continue working on this you can
basically merge columns from two
different data sets and then you can get
the merged column
and you can rename it so you can
obviously do that you can basically do a
uncheck
whenever you're working on these data
sets so what you can do is
if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here
and say I want to do some transformation
on it so how did we do it we just did a
transform
and you can go back to transform so you
have this data here and
the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will be
loaded and they will still be available
but this will not affect your
it will not affect your original one so
for example let's say copy and let's go
in here I will do a paste let's say
orders
oh I did a paste I need to
rename this
so let's renaming let's say orders and
here I will say summarized
and I will say us
so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have here
where's my country so let's look for
country
yeah and let's look for Country so here
I will go for only United States
okay that's what I'm interested in and
then I can choose well I am interested
in just Central us so I can basically go
for just the central U.S and I can get
rid of all of these
so now I should have only Central U.S
data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visualization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product name so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have let's
let's not restrict it to region region
would then reduce my data but that's
good enough for us I can just say no
I'm clearing off this filter I'm still
looking at United States but I want to
look at all the regions yeah whatever we
would be interested in category and
that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data
we have copies and machines right and we
can basically keep this now this is fine
I can apply the changes
I can apply the changes based on this
one
and what I can do is I can just say for
now apply
so that's going to apply all the changes
which you have done in orders or summary
or the new one right and what I can do
is now I can choose order and I can say
don't enable this in load
so it says disabling load will remove
the table from the report and any
visuals that use its columns will be
broken we are not creating any visuals
as of now the table will be removed so
that's fine
and now I will say close and apply
so what happens is you are loading the
data based on the changes okay now you
have your
order summarized you have returns you
have scientists but you basically do not
have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so I only have this one I only
have this one and
you have returns you have scientists you
don't have the orders column right now
that particular data set was not loaded
at all because we did not choose that to
be loaded right now while I'm in this
orders which is
let's see here
actually you can drag in yeah
so you have order summary and this has
basically kind of data which I'm looking
for so I really don't need the order
stable so you can do it in steps and you
can aggregate this you can have
aggregated data you can have all the
data which is filtered transformed
grouped by and then basically just load
it and the original data set which you
used that's no more being loaded here
now at any point of time if I really
want
I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue working on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joins right joins you have inner joints
outer joins so you can always do that
you can take two different data sets
might be I'm interested in taking the
orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment wise
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the values
these have the values say for example
the segment column here and the segment
column here can really be used to join
these two tables so if I create a
relationship or if I create a join I can
basically merge the data so this is how
you work on data we will also see some
more examples on might be modeling the
data using some Expressions to work on
the data so we already looked at
creating a report
selecting particular fields and then
publishing the report onto your power bi
service now this is the report which we
had created which says State order ID
sales and then I also added this
returned field and that was basically by
creating a relationship between order
and returns which we can also have a
look in model so this is the
relationship which is created if you
just place your cursor here it tells me
that we have a relationship between
order ID of returns and Order ID of
orders and that basically allows me to
join the data bring it in my one report
now this is basically your data sources
you can look at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you your
report now what we can also do is we can
make it interesting now we would not
want to scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order I ID which was returned
now I can do a sorting I can filter out
what I can also do is I can use this
option which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a field which has no value how do
we do that so basically I can drag and
drop the returned
here as a field which comes from returns
now that basically shows me only the
value as yes but I do know that there is
there are some fields which are blank
now how do I add filter to this so I can
click on this one and then I can click
on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes or you
have the blank field for returned so
what we can do is we can select yes you
will see only
the orders and their IDs and sales where
the products were returned so that gives
me hundred eight thousand one one eight
and I can select blank so that will
basically get me all the orders or
products which were not returned now
this is a simple way wherein I can add a
filter to or a slicer to my report to
basically give viewers a choice of uh
selecting different fields and you can
add any number of slicers you can
basically say I would want particular
kind of information so for example if I
go into orders and we know we have the
state now I do have the state
information here and basically I can if
I would be interested I could filter
this out in my report itself I can sort
it I can look it in a different order
what I can also do is how about bringing
in state here and basically dragging it
here so that gives me the state option
it is giving me a visual which is
basically giving me a geographic
location of all these points so yes that
can be good what I can also do is I can
keep this which basically shows me the
state map might be it can be useful you
can zoom in you can zoom out you can
look at specific information here you
can drag and drop here so that's fine
what I can also do is I can again take
the state and bring it here
and that basically can be instead of my
map I can go for slicer so that gives me
all the values here and which basically
allows users to choose the fields or the
states which you would be interested in
looking at so for example if somebody is
interested in looking at the data for
Georgia just select this one and you see
the map automatically shows you where in
the map that's the place and it shows me
all the sales for Georgia State now I
can also basically select yes and that
shows me which were the orders which
were basically returned so that gives me
a quick overview of statewise what is
the geographical location if the orders
were returned or maybe I can just click
on blank and it shows me the
non-returned orders I can again go here
and uncheck the Georgie option and that
shows me all the states now once you
have done this this looks like a
comprehensive report which can be useful
for the viewers for your management team
and so on so we can just do a save and
that basically is saving my report so I
have this report now what if I publish
this report so I can just do a publish
and when I publish it says okay
workspace so let's say select
and then it says replacing this data set
may impact two reports you already have
a data set named by this one view the
impact I would say replace or I will say
view impact so that basically takes me
to the power bi service because
sometimes we may have some reports which
we have already uploaded and updating an
existing report might basically affect
my existing report so it basically shows
me the impact analysis it shows me one
workspace there are two reports they are
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here and let's look into my
power bi so go back to your desktop and
I'll say no I don't want to replace so
click on cancel so I do not want to
publish it or it might be what I can do
is I can try saving it as a different
report so let's say save as
and now I will basically say
additional
filters
okay let's save it
so now you see the name on the top
changes to additional filters and now
it's saved to publish this and now I can
go ahead and publish it select your
workspace
and basically it says this is the report
being published with our additional
filters with a map which gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my power bi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and might be it's a
good an option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of power bi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built
now once the insights are ready it will
let you know what we can also do is we
can come in here click on
view data set
so you see now it shows your additional
filters and here you have option where
it should be showing your report so
let's say View and view is fine so
and if it doesn't show up sometimes it
might breaking taking time for
refreshing so you can always go here and
then you can click on your report
and that should get populated
so this is the report these are the
filters which I have gives me an option
of choosing all the states and basically
allows me to edit the report and look at
all the information here meanwhile we
can see here it is still trying to
gather some insights from the data and
now you see there are some insights here
so it says sales which is coming up and
a subset of your data was analyzed and
the following insights were found so
you're looking at sales by ship mode so
it says standard class second class
first class and same day so there were
different shipping modes in our data and
that's what it shows me the sales which
one had the majority it shows me the
profit so which city or state had more
profit so New York City has noticeable
more profits here average by shipping
cost by sub categories so there are
these different subcategories which we
can look at such as copiers and machines
have noticeably more shipping cost
profit by product name
and you can basically look at the row ID
and quantity so this is where you're
looking at a regression analysis you're
looking at row ID and quantity so there
is a correlation between row ID and
quantity so these are two different
variables or fields which are related
you're looking row ID by category
the row ID so it says California has
noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a correlation again
between two different variables average
of shipping costs now we would have
taken a lot of time building all these
visualizations but Power bi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is what you
are interested in you can focus and look
for more information based on all the
fields it has given you good amount of
insights which will help anyone who is
looking at this particular report so
that's your quick insights here and we
have this information
now once you have this information this
is basically where you have your focus
mode so it says subset of your data was
analyzed following insights were found
you can
basically say download
and here you have other options which
allow you to work with your power bi so
let's look at this one so this is where
we have our report and we can continue
exploring it more
one more interesting feature which power
bi has other than having your insights
ready to use which is basically in your
workspace and you can basically use
these insights what we are looking at
various options here
and basically you have this option where
it says spin the visual if you are
interested in a particular Insight you
can always pin it which you can always
go back and look into what you can also
do is you can also click on edit report
here now that's a report which has
already been published
to your power bi service not yet shared
but that can be shared or that can be
subscribed now once you click on edit
report it has option of reading View
mobile layout you have basically an
option which says basically options for
navigating through the data set you can
go for how visuals on the canvas
interact with each other
you have all these options and one of
the good options is ask a question so
you can always click on ask a question
and that basically says
some suggestions now you can open this
and it says okay ask a question about
your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report has
only four Fields so it has State order
ID sales and returned with some filters
but what about you looking at how many
ship modes are there so it is already
looking at your data so if you click on
this one here and you can see what are
the different fields what we have and
you have ship date and ship mode so this
is one of the fields which it is showing
you to ask a question now what you can
do is you can say how many ship modes
are there let's click on that let's ask
this question it says four ship modes
and do you want to add this to report
yes you can you can let it be as it is
so you can basically keep this question
here and here you have an option the
visual is showing number of ship modes
when you place your cursor here if you
see here turn this q a result into a
standard Visual and let's do that and
basically it is saying number of ship
modes
right so now that's the power of your bi
power bi which has basically allowed you
to ask a question and quickly add a
visual to your report now what we can do
is we can basically save this or you can
say save as and give any different name
so might be I'll just say save because I
would want to have this information and
the report is saved so in this way you
can basically not only create smart
visuals you can not only relate
different data sources using data models
or relationships you can add maps you
can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say
um
what is the
highest shipping
cost and that shows me some suggestions
let's select that and that shows me the
value
which is great and I can keep it as it
is I can basically convert this to a
visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and you would want to see the result
here might be you can move this
somewhere here
and that gives me some kind of question
which was asked and we can do a save
and that's my report which has been
saved in my bi service the data set is
still there you can basically go ahead
and share this if you're an aspiring
data analyst looking for online training
and certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learns pose rajat program in data
analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below and
with that in mind over to our training
experts data modeling in power bi
now today we will discuss how to create
relationships and different kind of data
models within power bi based on the
structure of data you're importing
okay so what topics we are going to
cover today we are going to talk about
different types of data modeling and the
most important part
and aspect of data modeling is the
cardinality the cardinality which you
basically decide after reviewing the
nature of data and after we've imported
it what kind of cardinality you have to
basically highlight right and there are
different type of cardinalities which
you might have heard earlier also if you
are from PL SQL background like one is
to one one is too many Etc we will we
will talk about that
now what are the different types of data
modeling now dimensional data modeling
is one of the most popular and most uh
you know widely used uh modeling in
dimensional data modeling you have
Master data uh like for example customer
data date store data product data so
these are like you know less frequently
changing data sets so there is an
organization right and you have set of
customers their email ID phone numbers
Etc that will change less frequently as
compared to the sales transactions
because transactions are happening every
day every minute so sales is a more fast
changing data set in dimensional
modeling which is in the terminology of
data is also called as a fat and
customer store product which are like
more of static data and less changeable
data is sometimes called a diamond
patient so this is a typical dimensional
data model which is typically used uh
sometimes right and then there is
another model which is relational model
this is a typical model which we have
been using in database design like you
know primary key foreign key
relationships so for example you have a
customer who has purchased a product so
probably he might have the customer
might have the details of the product
which is processed and you will make a
join between customer and product table
and even you can make a join between
product or product type or customer or
product type customer table will also
have a key to the product type so this
is less conducive for reporting but it
is more of a transactional relational
model but of course this is also
feasible but from the power bi
perspective when we talk about reporting
and visualization this is the most
extensively used dimensional data model
and they this is what we are going to
see in our example now so what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna show you certain data
sets first we will prepare and create
certain upper data sets and then we will
Import in our sample power bi file and
then slowly slowly we will create the
relationships
now one important thing which you need
to understand that in power bi if you go
to Power bi there is an option that that
power bi Auto detect new relationships
after data is loaded and import
relations from the data source on first
load so for example if you are importing
the data from a database where you have
already defined the primary keys and the
foreign key relationships so uh that is
the first option which power bi will
Auto detect and secondly if suppose you
are importing two different kind of data
sets one is Excel one is csb and if
power bi detects a common column key
columns it will auto detect a
relationship which you can go and later
change modify manage in your
relationship
menu manage relationship menu in power
bi which I'm going to show you okay so
if I open a power bi and this is where
the option lies go to file
go to options and setting options
data load
and these are the two options which are
by default check you can uncheck it and
auto and manually prepare relationships
there's no limitation to that but if you
uh keep it checked then power bi will do
its job to detect the relationships okay
now coming to the next important factor
cardinality
now before I start playing around with
my data and start showing you certain
relationships it's very important to
understand these four types of
cardinalities one is many to one right
so basically
many to one means that many orders
contain data of One customer so per
order one customer is there so from
customer to order or product or delivery
address it's a one-to-many relationship
and from the other side from order to
customer perspective it's a many-to-one
relationship
okay
second other cardinality is one is to
one one is to one relationship is only
applicable when you are saying it's an
extension of the current table so for
example in one table you have employee
details and you are extending the
details of the employee in another table
like employee address employee ID so
that is like one is to one there is no
multiple records of a single employee in
the address table only one employee ID
exists right
now one is too many as I said is the
reverse side of many is to one okay so
in customer table only one customer
record exists per customer and one
customer can place many orders for
multiple products and can also have
multiple delivery addresses so that way
this is a typical one is to many
relationship we will be seeing this
example also in our sample data set
and last is the many-to-many
relationship now many to many is a very
typical example so which I'm going to
show you practice practically and in our
case we will see that like for example
you have placed an order for a
particular product uh you know but there
are multiple fulfillments which has
happened so suppose you made order for
10 products but at the back end when the
company is fulfilling it is first
fulfilling the first two products then
the rest three so basically you the
Fulfillment is happening in batches so
one order
ID might have a multiple fulfillments
for the same order ID so there will be a
multi many to many relationship which
I'll show you practically so now with
this background let's
start importing our data now the first
important thing which we need to import
is the Master data so first I'll import
all my master Dimensions which is uh
which I'm gonna you know use in my
example so first is the customers table
customers data
so this is the customer details the
customer key prefix first name last name
birth date marital status and gender
some redundant columns are also present
but we'll remove it
so my customer data is loaded now
today's session is all about this
section of modeling so we will keep our
Focus over here
okay now some columns probably some
blank columns are there I can select
them and say delete from model
yes
okay so now this is my customers data
with the relevant columns and the key
per customer customer key
now there's no relationship in this
model right now right because only
single table is there and the associate
data is only imported now let me also
import my another important master table
is the products
select the products data product key
product sub category product SKU product
name model name product description
color size so just see all the relevant
information only specific to the product
is available so I report it
okay now see there's no relationship
between product and customers directly
because until unless a customer makes an
order places an order for a particular
product there is no join right so now
between these two tables the most
important now another table which will
now make sense is the sales order table
sales table
now I I'm assuming that power bi have
Auto detected the relationship now you
can see that because I've already uh
ticked that check box now let's see what
power bi what relations power bi has
Auto detected let's first say check the
relation between customer and sales I'll
double click this
join now what it has done is it has
created a join of many to one
between sales and customer so what does
that mean is that one customer has can
place many orders right and that is that
it is detected by the quality of the
data and the data sampling which power
bi has done you can also reverse this
relationship here I can select customers
and I can select sales now it has become
one too many so that you can also do
manually so that is what I said whatever
power bi is detected it is up to the
description of power bi internal uh
configuration and algorithm but you can
go and change it so this is now you can
this is by default active so we want to
keep it active One customer many sales
orders cross filter Direction means that
only from customers to sales is the
filter applicable not reverse I'll come
to this with my another example but
first let's
change the relationship so one is too
many means from One customer and many
sales orders
similarly let's see what has happened at
the product site
of the relationship
similarly power bi many sales orders for
one product you can for simplicity's
sake you can say products
sales
product key is the join now just focus
one more thing please also see the the
column on which the join is is the grade
column grade out column product key is
also here and product key is also there
and it is what we wanted so one is too
many relationship from product to sales
table and act
now looks fine this is something which
is looking logical and probably now we
can
proceed further to create a report
now let me explain the cross filtering
with an example
now for example I want to check in a
report
that what is the count of products which
uh which a particular customer has
ordered
okay so what I'll do is I'll select the
product count of product name
now if you see
the and for each customer in front of
each customer name the count is coming
as 293 293 it is getting repetitive
because because there is a one-way
filter Direction filter between
customers and sales and sales and
products right so this join
is single sided it means that from
customer to product you can't find a
relationship because it's a single side
cross filter right what does this if I
change it to both it means that it is
equal to a join between product and
sales and every product detail now is
appended to the sales table so if I want
to make you visualize this you need to
go here
I'll first open my sales table
we can also open it here let's make
click it says okay now if I click OK you
can see the single arrow is changed to
Double Arrow it means it's a it's a both
site filter
So when you say a both side filter it
means that implicitly within power bi
you can imagine that all the product
columns now will get appended because of
both ways filter you have applied and if
you go to your report now see the change
of the numbers now 40 20 so the total
count of products across all my
customers come out to be 293. now the
report looks uh correct if I change the
relationship from back to single between
product and sales then you can't make a
join between customers and products
basically you can't derive the product
count from the product table see this
if you have to live with it then you
would have to go to the sales table get
the product key and get the value of
count of product key but that is not
correct
okay
so if you want a report in which you
want the count of product name
and even if you want a count of distinct
product name so this will not come
correctly you would have to go and
change the
direction of the filter which is from
single to both so this is a typical
example they where you want to use a
two directional filter
now let's proceed further and import
other data set in order to give show you
another example
now I want to show you an example of
one is to
1.
so I have another table which is called
customer details so the key in this
table is again customer key but only
email address annual income total
children education level Etc other
details of the customer is there
so I'm loading the customer details now
you see it has Auto detected a one is to
one relationship
what is the meaning of one is to one
means One customer key only has one
entry in customer details there is no
multiple entry so if you click this
button
it's a one is to one and the cross
filter can be both or single doesn't
matter because one customer will have
only one value you can make this as
active okay and if you go to the
customer report table you can now easily
associate a
email address with the first name you
will get one is to one
record
so now you can see that with one is to
one relationship
with the first name I have Associated
the email ID and for each email ID
there is a Associated first name method
so this is an example of
one is to one relationship so in this
example what we have explained is that
for each customer there is an Associated
customer detail right uh so you have the
first name email address education level
homeowner occupation and total children
count
so in this report what we have done is
uh if you click over here so the first
name and the email address okay so
there's a one is to one relationship
and then
and if you drag
the customer key
report takes time to render and even if
you can
so this is the reporting output you have
the customer key first name associated
email address and the count of product
names uh which the customer has ordered
now this is an example of one is to 1.
now I want to show you an example of
many too many now for that I'll import
my
fulfillment data set
foreign
data set there is a column for
order number so basically what I'll do
is I'll drag order number from here to
here
okay so now what has
um
uh Power bi detected
I will do one thing I'll select sales
over here
fulfillment over here and order number
to odd number
okay so it's a many-to-many relationship
so it means that per order I have
created multiple batches to fulfill that
particular order now
many-to-many relationship is a
definitely a candidate for both ways
cross filter detection uh a Direction
but you can you can check that but
definitely uh Power bi shows a warning
that this relationship has cardinality
to many to many and this should only be
used if it is expected that neither
column contains unique values okay so we
know that fact that's why we are
accepting this relationship as many to
many because we know there are multiple
order numbers over here in the sales
table which are mapped to the multiple
order numbers in the Fulfillment table
we'll click ok
now you want to keep uh the uh
uh direction as both ways or One
Direction that is up to you the way you
want to map the report so I can double
click over here
and you can even click so now you can
select from which way single filter you
want from fulfillment to sales or sales
to fulfillment I'll prefer sales to
fulfillment and click ok
okay now we have our all our different
kind of relationships over here uh which
we have tried to shortlist one to many
many to one one to one which is uh this
example and many too many
now if I show you further relationships
which you can keep on adding like for
example I have uh uh the example of
territories
now in which particular territory the
sales was done
map it over here
okay so now it's a typical one is too
many relationship because territory is
my master table uh where I have a static
list of continent country region and it
is mapped to the uh territories which
are for in which my orders have been
placed so it's a typical one is too many
so that way you know you can keep on
adding data then you have
uh details of returns
now this is another transactional table
which is about the orders which have
been returned rather than being you know
returned by the customers so you have a
product key
and so automatically power bi has
detected a relationship between the
product key and the product uh table
right and even if you can join the
territory key in which territory the
return has happened
right so mostly the most common
relationship which you will observe is
the one is too many because
as I told earlier the most common
relational model is the dimensional
model uh the static data the slow
changing Dimensions the scds are the
master tables and the most frequent
changing are the fact tables so if I
talk about a typical dimensional model
the Fulfillment table sales table and
the territory stable sorry uh the
Fulfillment table sales table and my
returns table are the fact tables of my
data model
now we will discuss about calculated
columns now so far what we have done as
per our last session is that we did data
modeling on the different data sets
which we had imported in power bi like
products sales data returns fulfillment
customer details uh and customer Master
data calendar details Etc so in the last
session we prepared a data model and
established the relationships between
these different data sets like one is to
one one is too many many to one one is
to one Etc and we saw the examples now
once our relational model is prepared
our data model is prepared now our next
activity is to create certain additional
columns which we want to derive basis
the data which we have imported
so for example I'll start with my
product data set now in my product data
set I want to introduce a column which
basically
categorizes that if any product which
has a color uh you know red black or
gray I am going to tag it as a colored
product rest I'm gonna say not a colored
product right so all these are like
example of byte type product skus so for
that now in order to introduce a new
column you just need to do what you need
to select the table in the data grid go
to the table tools and say new column
okay so column will get appended to the
rightmost part and you will start seeing
a uh formula section typical to like you
get in your Excel now I'm gonna say that
the name of my column is going to be
byte type color okay and I'm just
creating a if condition if
product
color
is equal to
black
okay
or
or if it is equal to red
or if it is equal to
Gray
then
say yes it's a colored product I'll say
no
okay so now you can see this is the
product color red and black they are
saying byte type color Yes blue is no
multi is no etc etc so this is a classic
example of an if and else condition
based conditional column
okay so you can create such columns now
second column custom column which I want
to create is I'm going to call as
discount
now this is the pricing of my products I
want to associate certain discounts
which I am ready to give to my customers
this is the product category like what
is the pricing of the category again I'm
going to use make use of if else but in
a nested way so if I am saying if my
product
price is less than 100
then I will give
zero percent of
uh zero percentage of discount so 0 into
product price just to keep it consistent
now I'm saying
else
if less than 100 and 0 else I'll check
again that
if
the price is
less than
500 then I'm ready ready to give one
percent discount
on the product price
else
I'll move further so like this I have
created a formula
so what I'm saying is if product price
is less than 100 give zero percent if it
is less than 500 then give one percent
less than 2000 then 1.5 percent less
than three thousand then two percent and
otherwise else less than three thousand
if a two percent else three percent
right now after this column is created
now you can check right so this C the
product price for this particular
product it is less than 100 so that's
why there is no discount it is uh
between 100 to 200 then this has been
given a one percent discount so like
this all the discount call up is now
calculated now this column is available
just like a regular column in my product
table
now after this I'll go to my sales table
now in sales table I want to
identify and uh
create a column called as cost
there is no product cost column over
here so that will be derived
so let's create a column
called as cost
and it is derived by order quantity
into now the cost of the product
is in the product table and I know I
have already created a relationship
between product and sales table
so I just need to select the product
cost column now only keyword which I
have to use in power bi is the related
keyword so this will pick up the
relation
and now for this particular sale order
the cost has already been derived so
this order number this is the cost for
which the product has is the costing of
the product for this particular order
foreign
now I'm gonna create another conditional
column over here called as
order status
I'm saying if
any order whose order quantity is
greater than 2
then for my organization it's an urgent
order
else it is a
normal order
oh sorry
I
must do it
so this is my
order status column and I have my order
quantity
urgent or normal
so any order which has order quantity 1
is normal any order which is having
order quantity as greater than
2 is
urgent you can see this
so there's a
this whole power bi
uh tabs and sheets allow you to also
review the data what you're doing so
it's very convenient
now
I have my sales data now what I want to
bring within the sales is my discount
column so here also I want to bring the
discount which I have created
so I'll say discount
[Music]
will be order quantity
into
related
product discount right so the discount
calculated column which I had created
under products I'll bring over here
now I am creating the order level
discount so if you see for this
particular order these are 25 uh
uh you know for 25 rupee discount at the
cost is 100 000 rupees okay
and what is the order price now so I
have taken the order cost the discount
now I have to create a column call as
price order price so that will be
again order quantity
into related
price which is per product
price and
okay so now I have the cost the discount
and the price right available with me
now I want to
calculate the total
uh
total revenue total profit and loss
right
per order how much
so first I'll calculate per order how
much revenue I am generating so now I
have to generate a column called as
Revenue
revenue is price
minus discount
so 1700 minus 25
1700 minus 25 2071 minus 42 and if I
want to calculate the profit per order
then it is
Revenue
Minus cost
okay so now you can see you know typical
custom columns calculated columns which
we have created are all playing around
with the number numeric values numeric
data primarily and trying to give
inferences into per order cost discount
per order price revenue and profit so
typical calculation columns which I have
prepared in front of you
now let's take a look at other different
variations of custom columns I'll create
certain columns for text based custom
columns calculated columns using Text
data
so I'm now moving towards my customer
table in which I have customer key
prefix first name last name birth date
marital status and gender
now I want to create a new column in
which I want to derive the age of each
customer as of today right so I'll use
another function a date function called
as
date div
now date div so I want the difference
between the birth date of the customer
and as of today
in years
okay so this customer as of today 68
year old one is 74 68 57 Etc so this is
one derivation of a calculated column of
age
let's take another example now this is a
text based column where I want to
derive the full name of the customer
now here I'll say first
lowercase in lower case I'll concatenate
the prefix
then ampersand
space
ampersand
first name
Ampersand space
ampersand
last name
and closing brackets
Etc
full name
okay so this is an example of full name
in low cases
now another
calculated column conditional column at
the customer level
I want to identify a flag which says who
is my Target customer base is the
demographics shared over here Target
customer
so I'll say
if
the marital status is equal to
m
and
total children
hurry
and total children annual income
so okay so let me change the logic a bit
so marital status is M and
age
is
less than
50
these customers are my Target customers
okay so I would say
yes
else no
see this
he is a marital status is married Logan
Diaz and age is less than 50 else
everyone so if I try to filter
so these are the my Target customers
69 out of 1178 so this is just a
conditional column but a logical
condition an example which I am trying
to highlight over here
okay now
let's look at certain calendar
date oriented columns calculated columns
very typical like now I have a simple
date column now I'll keep adding certain
columns which are you know which help
you which will help you understand how
we can uh
you know do some calculations on the
dates so like for example I want a date
which is 12 days after the current date
the date in the column so just simple 12
Days After
select the date and add 12.
now if you see the date format you can
go and change the format at the top
and if whatever you feel like like this
now see 12 days after first Jan 2015 is
13 Jan 2005. you can go and change the
format and other details
let me also show you if I go to my cost
and other columns I can go and change
the format this is like a currency cost
is currency so I can go and
select the
change the currency type and you can
even show the dollar value or whatever
currency type it is
so for numbers you can do currency or
text or dates you can select the format
so this is available at the column tools
level
now in customers
like we had our
column of full name so now what all
things are available format as text okay
data type text so very minimal options
are there with date you have options of
the date format
now next
I want a column which defines the expiry
date okay so eight months prior
to the
expiry date with this which is coming up
in eight months so I'll create a column
called as eight months expiry
and then there is a e date function I'll
use that I'll use my
date in the data set
comma I'll say eight so now this date
column will append eight months to my
actual date and again I can go and
change the format
correct
now another important column like I want
to know the date name
so I'll use a function called as
format
and I'll select my calendar date column
and I'll say give me the DDD
format of it
so it will give me the day name the day
the day name of on that particular date
next
years in between
so I want the years in between the
today's date and the date of my calendar
so equal to
diff
the calendar date
comma today
comma year
end
seven years 2015 to 2022
then last date of the month
so if I want what is the last date of
this particular calendar month
I will use a function EO month which is
there available in the
power bi so I'll say
last date of the month
equal to
e o month
then
just select the calendar CSV date
comma
0 in months and enter
change the format
then similarly start of the month
so I'll use a function called start of
month
so for for all January dates end of the
month is 31st Jan and start of the month
will remain first of Jan
change the format
foreign
next I want to know what is the weak
number of that particular date so now
there is an inbuilt function called
week number week num and just pass the
date and you will get
the weak number first week of the year
second week of the year Etc
now another very
good example is whether the weak
day is a weekday or a weekend right so
what is it's a weak type okay
so I'll check I'll put a if condition
and there is a function called weekday
and I'll pass the calendar
if it is less than 6
it means it's a weekday else it's a
weekend
so all Saturday
and Sunday D news will come as weekends
or else everything else will come as
weekly
so these are very different variations
of different column types calculated
columns which is a very important
utility and uh and any Bravo bi project
you will definitely be ending up
creating n number of calculated columns
to derive your numbers to prepare your
reports but it's important to understand
what all things we can do that yes there
are n number of functions available in
power bi uh but uh what I have tried to
Showcase over here is some important
functions but basis your utility basis
your problem statement you can look up
for a relevance function in the power bi
dictionary
now with this
introduction to calculated column this
is the base for us to now get into our
next session where we'll be talk we will
be talking about creating Dax measures
and Dax functions we will be using power
bi Dax functions which is much more
powerful than simple uh calculated
columns where you can do more uh complex
calculations uh you can calculate totals
and then use them in the reports so for
that we will look up into our next
session if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learns pose rajat program in data
analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below and
with that in mind over to our training
experts how to connect different data
sources with power bi so in this session
today we will see how can you connect
different type of data types data sets
like Excel PDF CSV Etc to import in
power bi for your data visualization
needs so what's in it for us today we
will be learning how to connect to data
different data types data files like
Excel PDF then what are the different
data importing modes and then I will
also show you practically different sets
how to import them in power bi and use
it for your visualization purpose now
what are the steps to connect to data so
now we will go directly into Power bi
and try to import one by one few most
commonly and popularly used data sets
which are most commonly used in a
day-to-day activity rest of course there
are power bi supports n number of data
sources but we will do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our power bi
now this is my power bi and first I want
to show you that how can I import data
directly from a web page and import the
data now it is asking for a URL in order
to import data so what I have done is I
have created a Google Excel sheet with
simple data with rows and columns and
what I have done is I have shared this
sheet as published to web
okay so you just need to say publish to
the web the link as web page and
say done it's it's automatically
published and say link so copy the link
which you have published on the web copy
this link
and then go back to your tableau paste
that link over here and click ok
Now power bi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the web
you need to wait for a while while it is
reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables I'll select this one now you can
see it has it is showing me a preview of
the table which is there on my
Google sheet right it has 11 rows so it
has all showed all the 11 rows so now I
can go and transform this data because I
can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks clean
okay so first is I need to remove the
first row which is the
remove the top rows
okay and then I need to use the first
row now as a header so you just click
this option use first row as headers
that's it so now if you see my row ID
order ID order date shifted all my data
is now ready so I can say close and
apply
click apply changes
now this is an example of web data
import you can go and preview your data
right now uh the biggest advantage of
this data connection is that it's a live
data so for example I insert another row
let me change the order ID
some some I've sub change some basic
stuff and I
it's Auto saved
control s now I'll go to my tableau and
I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my
power query editor I click refresh all
and I got my new row which is there in
the live data I got that fetched from my
okay I got that row the row number ID
number 12 so I have to say close and
apply
now you can see the new row the row
number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web-based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data
now let's try to import data from a text
file
now I've already prepared a text file
called
sub categories Dot txt
now let me just open it in a notepad now
it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go back to my
get data option
and I'm gonna select text slash CSV
option
and I'm going to select option mod
product subcategories.txt
okay so now power bi has identified that
it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers
Etc right and I can now directly load
this file
okay so now once the data is imported in
power bi
it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I am doing right so in my
presentation when I am talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import out data
import can happen through different ways
okay
one is direct query mode in which I
create a live connection to the database
which I'll also show you uh using MySQL
and Ms SQL server and also you can do a
composite mode in which you can have
data imported from Excel plus you can
have direct query modes so you can have
multiple uh modes to connect and create
a composite data model and that's what
we are doing right now in our practical
so what we are doing over here is one we
have imported data from the web second
we have imported data from a text table
now after doing text now our next task
is to import from CSV let's try another
one so now I have imported product
subcategory now I'll import
a CSP file so again I'll choose the
option Text slash CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what it is it
so this is a list of all my products
product key products of category Key
Products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm gonna import
that
okay so now it is identified the
delimiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I load it
okay so now my products are there
product sub categories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created as Excel mode now so
now Excel I am using to import my
product category
so now I have to click on the option of
import data from Excel and I'll say
product categories
select the sheet load
and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
Power bi it is a composite data model
now another very important data type
which you can import is the PDF also
right so what I have done is I have
created a PDF called customers my
customers data is lying in a PDF so what
I've done is I've created a PDF
which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birthdate marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set
which I have created in PDF so what I'm
gonna do is
I'm going to select PDF now
and import customers.pdf and see it has
recognized my table on page one which
I'm gonna load
okay
you can rename this as PDF
table
okay so this basically
these are the different type of
data
types we have imported PDF Excel text
CSV and web page
now let's take a look at another
interesting data set which you want to
import is the my SQL Server data set
so what I have done is I've already
installed MySQL server on my local
instance and there's already
schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables already
prepared over there like Department
employee Etc so my goal is now to import
this data or create a live connection
with this data set
now in order to import
my SQL database Connection in power bi
you need to First
download a
connector MySQL power bi connector so
you need to go to this link
and then
click on download and install the MySQL
connector based on the operating system
you have you click on download and
install it
after you have done this go back to
Power bi
and then give
the IP address of the database in my
case it's there in this local machine
and the schema which I want to import is
SQL live tutorial so I'll give the name
click connect
okay now it's connected so now it is
asking me which particular tables you
want to create a connection with I am
choosing department and employee
and I'm just loading them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in MySQL okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between power
bi and MySQL now I want to do the same
thing using
SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so I
have also installed Microsoft SQL server
on my machine
and I have used the SQL Express so this
is the name of my server
so which I'll copy the server name
and
go to get data
select SQL Server
and for now database is optional I can
say direct query click ok
now it is showing me what all tables I
can import so in my SQL Server tutorial
in my SQL Server I have
I have these three tables customers
employee attrition Olympic events so I
can use probably the customers one which
is
foreign
in my SQL Server okay so I can preview
it and load it
so now you can you can preview the data
in uh Power bi that is this is the data
so I can rename his customers from
mssql
and this is from
MySQL
and
okay so now
this is not the only data
sets you can import now if you take a
look at the options which power bi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import from
okay so we can just take a look at the
categorization on the left hand side
first there are five ways like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import an entire folder
and within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF power key or even SharePoint
folder which is itself in Microsoft
Technology then different kind of
databases SQL server and MySQL we just
saw but it's not only limited to this
you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgres
SCI base teradata and then sap
databases Amazon redshift Impala vertica
Snowflake and N number of databases
which are there in the market today
Amazon
Etc
then it also allows you to connect with
its own power platforms power bi
platforms data mods power bi data flows
dataverse Etc Azure there are different
kind of storage
mechanisms in Azure and Azure itself is
a Microsoft Technology uh so it has a
compatibility of a lot of azure uh based
data storages like Azure SQL database
blob storage uh Azure data breaks right
Azure HD insights path so if you have
those kind of services running on your
observed cloud services you can even
import them over here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social networking uh
you know feeds that also you can import
and then other miscellaneous are also
their web-based hive R script python
script if there's something to import
get data from uh Google Sheets like we
saw one example in our video right now
so there are multiple options available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you
um in our subsequent sessions we will
see how to create relationships but just
giving you a glimpse that whatever data
you are importing power bi Auto detect
certain relationships and it will create
for you but then you can go and manually
also change so this is the composite
data model which is getting created in
the back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried once it is imported into uh
Power bi then there is no limitation of
how you use it you can create
visualization across different data sets
and then create your
standard reports
so this is the example of importing data
from web importing data from a database
from a PDF
and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do what whatever transformation you want
to do you want to uh make joins merge
the data so for example if we go back to
our power bi and if I go back to my
transform data section
now as I have now different data sets
available with me I have I can do any
kind of you know operation
transformation on the data right uh
so like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the column
right all those Transformations whatever
I do in the back end gets captured in
the applied steps section right
this is the customer data you can create
uh you can merge it you can append it uh
you know with other data sets right
let's for example I want to create a
merge data set of my categories and
subcategories so I can say mer selectors
two data sets and say merge queries as
new
and
I can select product categories and
products are categories select
product category key on both the sides
and then they do a left Auto Zone so
whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to as
category
sub category
table it's a it's a merge basically it's
a join between category and subcategory
now I have a common table right and I
can close and apply
so imagine I have created a
new table which is imported created from
one data set is which is Excel page
another data set which is text based
see this category subcategory table so
now I can use it
the way I want in my visualization
reports so that's what the presentation
says right that once you have uh the
imported data you can shape you can
combine you can adjust you can do
whatever transformation you want to do
and create your visualization let's also
learn about Dax expressions and that's
basically your data analysis Expressions
so it's basically collection of
functions operators and constants which
can be used in formulas or Expressions
to calculate or return one or more
values now we can basically add a new
column so we can do that or we can also
create new measures now usually there is
a shorter way of doing it you can go
into modeling and here as of now nothing
is highlighted because there is no data
uploaded we see just a new table what I
can do is I can go to home and I can
let's get our data but this time I'll
take the simple data although we can
work on the same earlier data set which
relates to IP addresses and all that so
that also can be done and to learn we
can take up this particular data
which is global Superstore which we have
used earlier now here I can select
orders I can select people and I can
also select returns now what we can do
is before loading we can just do some
quick transformation on this particular
data so that opens up my power query
editor so here if you remember we have
worked on this this is returns so what I
can do is I can basically go in here I
can say use first row as headers now
that's one transformation which I would
want to do let's go into people and it
basically has person and region we will
still do the same thing use first row as
headers so that gives me the name of the
person and the person belongs to which
particular region you have then your
orders data set and here things look
fine so we can select different
countries we can select different
product categories we can basically work
on your different use cases here like we
have seen earlier picking up a category
as technology picking up a sub category
and we can also create
models based on these three data sets so
this looks perfectly fine to me so let's
go ahead and just do a close and apply
and let's have our data quickly loaded
now as I have explained earlier it is
good to do transformation enough data
wrangling so that your data is not huge
when you're loading it because then that
will slow down your queries slow down
your visuals slow down your reports and
so on now this is the data we have and
say for example I would want to work on
a visual so we know how we can do that
so I can basically click on my orders I
can look at the aggregated columns such
as discount might be postal code might
be profit and it depends if you have
basically not changed the data types now
if you see here postal code and
summation really does not go well
probably this has been as this has has
been loaded as a data type which is
integer but profit and quantity looks
good row ID sales look good so we can
work on Dax Expressions now here if you
go into the modeling it says do you want
to create a new measure you can create a
new column that will get added to your
Visual and here when you are looking
into the table you can click on this and
this also gives you an option of
creating a new measure or a new column
new quick measure and you can work on
Dax so when I said Dax let's quickly
look at what or how Dax looks like talk
about Dax the simplest way to understand
is knowing the basic syntax so usually
you first have some kind of measure name
so for example we can say average about
something we can say okay let's say
average sales so that becomes one of my
measure which I'm interested in
calculating now how do I calculate that
so for that I use an operator so which
shows here so that's your operator which
you are going to use and then you use a
Dax function so Dax has or power bi has
a lot of functions which we can use so
for example I would use a function like
average which we can choose from the
drop down as we start typing in now this
one
as a function then needs a referred data
table so basically let's say I would be
interested in orders so I can select my
table or my data set as you say and then
you can choose a particular column so
from orders I would want to do an
average on say sales and I can key in
the column name here
and that basically is my simplest tax
expression so we can have a complicated
way of looking at it or we can basically
say okay I would want to find out
average sales and I would want to might
be look into a particular City or where
I would say it is per City so maybe I
could say average sales and then I could
say by city or by year or I would want
to look into a particular year if we
have the order date so we can say
greater than a particular order date
so we wouldn't want
how our sales have got affected after a
particular date and that depends on the
situation so I can do that and here I
can say greater than
order date now for that obviously we
have to use the operator and then I
would want to calculate so I can
basically say calculate
now this is what I would want to find
out so I can say calculate and then in
calculate I can say let's take the
column which we are interested in so we
can pass in something like
a measure here so for example I can just
say average sales this is what I want
but I will give a separator here to
filter out the data and then I am going
to use my order date
for example I can basically say let's
take orders
and in that I am taking order date
and then basically this order date has
to be greater than or lesser than
something so here you are specifying
your data set your table and the column
you are giving a filter here and that's
basically your tax expression so your
Dax has different functions so when we
talk about these functions like as I
said you are going for the average or
you are going to calculate something so
you have what we uh usually mean
or we use is your predefined formulas
now that can perform calculations by
using specific values called arguments
so which are in particular order and
structure so always remember that when
you talk about Dax this always refers a
complete column or a table now there are
different categories of functions which
we can work on so you have date and time
such as date difference or finding out
now or finding out a later time you can
use something like time intelligence
which is dates between first date and
last date you can go for information
functions which contains custom data you
can have logical functions mathematical
functions statistical functions text
functions you have basically working on
parent-child relationships so there are
different function categories which can
be used
and as I said we can go for creating a
new column or a new measure and we can
use this Dax for our data analysis now
let's see how we do that
so say for example I have my order date
now I would want to work on this so
let's select say for example go to your
data set and you have a lot of data here
so you can basically go for all this
data here which shows me complete
information of the different columns and
you can choose which columns you are
interested in which columns might be you
would want to cut short so for example I
have order ID I have row ID might be I
don't want Arrow ID so I can choose if I
want to delete this and you can say okay
I would want to delete this now these
are some changes which you are applying
and now if you see there is no
row ID what we see here as a field you
start with your orders
ID you have your category you have your
order date shipment and here you have
your segment
and for example we have country region
Market category subcategory product name
sales and then you have your quantity
discount profit and all of this now what
we can do is I can basically add
something here so this is the data which
we have and what we can do is we can
continue working on this
so let's click on home and here you have
ways to transform the data you have a
new measure you have quick measure you
have new column and you can try out
these so for example I can go into new
column and that basically says okay what
is your column called now I can say for
example as I was explaining let's go for
average sales
so let's call it average sales now
that's what I'm interested in now I need
to use an internal function so let's
type in AV and that shows me okay so
there is an inbuilt function called
average we can use this one so you can
just hit on enter and now it says okay
which is the data set you are interested
in now based on the reports based on the
data sets I've used earlier it shows me
options of different tables what we have
or different data sets what we have so
let's choose orders so this is what I'm
interested in you can go for double
click and that gets selected and now it
says okay you want average on sales but
which is the column which you would want
to use so we can go for category we can
go for Country we can go for customer ID
all of these are your different columns
so for example I I can go for something
like country and that basically gets
selected now I can complete this by just
closing the parenthesis
and that's basically my dags function so
my DAC function is ready and if you want
you can add details to it so if you
would want to continue your function you
can always do a shift enter that takes
you to the next line if you do not want
it you can go back you can add a comment
by saying Alt shift and letter a and
then you can say my first Dax function
and you can give in some information
depending on what kind of function you
are creating and that basically allows
you to create the function so this is
done now let's hit on enter and
basically it will say the function
average cannot work with values of type
string and and that's right I mean we
basically chose the wrong country I mean
you cannot have an average on Country so
that's not right I should use something
where I have to take a numeric value so
for example I will replace this so I
will say I want average sales
and here I can choose what should I take
so for example let's go for sales
and that's
what I would want
so it says order sales and then hit on
enter and it basically has populated my
new column but then it is basically
taking average sales and it has taken
average sales overall now we have not we
have just selected a column we have not
given any filter so it just gives me
average and it populates every row with
this one
now this is fine that we have added a
column it has the same average value and
that basically gives me sales on average
so as I said your tax function always
references a complete column or a
complete table and then basically it
adds the value now let's see how we can
use this if you notice the field or the
column has got added here let's get into
visualization and what I can do is I can
basically choose one of the type of
visualizations so for example if I
choose this and say for example I would
be adding this average
sales and that is the data I would want
to look into so what we can do is we can
just say okay I'm interested in this
average sales it shows me the function
and we can add it here now this is just
giving me the average sales overall now
that really doesn't make sense let's
look at this one or plot a graph so it
gives me what is the average sales and
it gives me some visualization so we can
create visualization like this based on
our column now what we can also do is we
can go back to our data and we can go
for different functions so as I said you
can create a function that adds a column
now let's go for something else so I
will say average sales and I would be
interested in say a particular product
now we have average sales and that is
the measure which we can use so for
example I would want to find out
um
wherein the year or let's look at the
date field here so for example we have
country as France
it is telling me City it is giving me
customer name it gives me a segment so
let's choose a different field and we
can filter by that so for example I'll
say average sales by
or whatever name you want to give let's
say segment now what I will do here is
instead of using this average
so I will go for something like
calculate now I can go for calculate I
can go for concatenate so let's go for
calculate and we know that we have a
particular column so let's go for this
one which is let's open up a bracket
here so let's go here let's give our
column name so that could be your
average sales so let's look at what was
the column name and we have average
sales with A and S S capital so let's go
for average and then let's go for sales
now this is what I want to do but on
what so let's choose this and here I am
going to now choose
orders so and then we have to basically
look at the column which has the segment
value
so segment now this is what I would want
to use and then we can try giving a
value to this so you have segment as
corporate so for example
let's say let's go for
so it says calculate give an expression
which we have already given that's your
average sales or we can basically give
the expression what we did earlier and
then you go for a filtering value so I
am saying order segment and let's go for
something like corporate now that is
going to be my segment let's close this
one so here's the example what you do is
you give your measure name so that says
average sales by segment you can do a
calculate now here you have to pass in a
measure so for example I am saying
average and I'm saying take an average
for
sales that is
give me an average value of sales but
what I'm interested in is when the order
segment is corporate so I'm giving a
filter here and then it gives me average
sales by segment so that's the column
value here and it is basically filtering
out based on the segment being corporate
so segment is our particular column here
which is showing up somewhere
let me see where is my segment column so
we have your product
now I have
let's search for Country City postal
code customer ID and since we have
chosen order sales it is giving me this
average value and you can
choose a different column or you can
they say profit is greater than
something else so I would be only
interested in those values and you can
continue adding things to your tax
expression
and this is how you can do here so
basically what I did was we were using a
measure which is average order sales I
said my segment has to be corporate or
basically you can just say segment has
to exist so you can say a Boolean value
like equals true now I'm saying orders
profit has to be greater than 100 and
I'm only looking for my average sales by
segment where profit is greater than 100
segment is Corporate and now this has
calculated the value so you basically
see here so it tells me 286 if you look
at the profit value so it is greater
than 100 what I can do is I can even add
a filter here so for example I can say
greater than
and let's give some value here so for
example let's go for 100 and let's see
if it has done the work so you see all
the average values where it is greater
than 100 and then we have to also look
at our other values we can filter it so
segment has to be corporate and let's
apply the filter here so I will uncheck
I'll say corporate now this is what I'm
interested in so it tells me the
corporate is sector now you see the
sales value which is already showing up
here which we have we have average sales
by segment which we is telling me that
you have corporate segment and it gives
you where the profit values are greater
than 100 now we have this Dax here we
have applied we have the filter and what
we can do is we can go to quickly
visualization and what I can do is I can
and choose this
I can add it here and then that saves me
average sales by segment however we can
go for different kind of visualization
which can give us more meaning here and
look at the data so this is how you can
simply use your tax Expressions now this
is a simple quick session where you are
looking at the Dax expression so when
you look at this symbol it means it is a
Dax expression so you can obviously
double click on this one and that shows
you what is your Dax expression now as I
said I have given two filters here so
always remember once you have given a
measure you give your first filter and
then you can give any number of filters
you can just order it in a different
line that should be fine let's say
average sales by segment okay so let's
say average
sales by
segment okay profit
greater than 100 so I can give some kind
of name which basically identifies my
column and that gives me the value now
if you see here we have applied these
filters and that's why we are only
seeing the relevant data which is profit
which is a particular segment and you
can create any number of Dax expressions
like this using some inbuilt functions
so anytime if you would want to see if
your Dax expression is working fine what
you can do is for example I can say test
function okay now I would want to create
a function and then I can basically
choose the available functions as I said
you have logical functions you have
statistical functions you have
mathematical functions you have
information functions so you have all of
these options here and you can choose
one of these so for example we were
going for average you have and and or
for example I can directly go for and
but that would not make sense in the
beginning you can go for absolute value
of something so for example let's choose
absolute and now I want to work on
orders so I go for orders and here I can
say okay I'm looking at orders but I
would be looking at sales value I do I
would want the exact value so I can
choose this one right and here now once
I am creating a function so I can be
selecting eight different column so this
is basically one column now you can add
calculation you want to do but this
basically says unexpected expression
because this is a new dag for a new
column so what I can do is I can take
this out from here I can go ahead and
create a new column and then or a new
measure so I can do that and it works
perfectly fine now I can save this and
we can call it whatever report you would
want to call so let's say super store
with new Dax
and you can share it you can publish it
you can continue using it in your
reports so you can create any number of
functions as such and then just save it
so for example I have set of Dax
functions and I can upload it on a
GitHub link so here for example if I go
in here and if I click on Dax so that
tells me the different kind of
visualizations I have based on the
standard data so it depends on my file
which is which should be existing here
so I can go in here and this should
actually work but the location has
changed and I just click on open report
I can do a browse report I can go into
Power bi content and here let's look
into this one and just say open so that
will not only load the report it has
different visuals and different visuals
with the stand the data set which comes
with Microsoft and it basically has
different kind of visuals and each of
those visuals again have different tax
functions so you can use these also so
what we have learned is working on a
store data set working on some threat
hunting data sets working on our own
created tables and these are some of the
pages what you see here so this is based
on the data which comes in with AWS and
you can always look into one of these
and you can search if you see here look
at this icon and it tells me okay this
looks like attack function and let's
double click on this one and that shows
me the function what you are doing so
you're creating a function called age it
uses State difference it works on dim
customer table on the birthday date and
you would want to basically find out the
date difference between now and the
birthday and you would want the year so
this is the data what you have you can
obviously choose this you can look at
the result of this and you can see the
visuals so these are some simple tax
Expressions you can create a lot of data
expressions like this now this is
here you have date function so I can
choose which are the tax functions which
are existing here I can just load
themselves for example this one is one
of my other data sets and then you can
play around with the data here
so this is how you create your Dax
expressions and this is just this was
just a quick demo on going for some
simple tax Expressions you can create
different kind of visuals
and you can then save those reports you
can publish it to power bi service and
and you can then gather insights based
on this so this is how you work with
power bi wherein up you can use Dax you
can use power bi service to gather
insights you can use desktop to work on
loading your data transforming your data
in different ways and then basically
analyzing it if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learns pose rajat program in data
analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below and
with that in mind over to our training
experts now let's understand what power
bi dashboard is power bi dashboard is a
single page visualization to tell a
story here on the screen you can see
there's a dashboard which has been
published on power bi service there are
multiple charts and graphs that you can
see the visualizations on a dashboard
are generated from reports and each
report is based on one data set a single
page dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles and each of these tiles
are pinned to the dashboard by report
designers today we'll be covering the
following dashboard that you see on the
screen it will be a three page report
where we will be analyzing the
superstore sample data as you can see
there are three tabs now let me move
over to our data set so our Superstore
sample data set is in the form of an
Excel file you can see there are
multiple columns you can see there's
order date shipment date the mode of
shipment customers first name and last
name the segment to which the customer
belong to country of the customer the
city state and if you go towards the end
you can see that the different product
names the sales quantity sold discount
and the profit so the report that you
see here and the one which we are going
to create might vary a little in terms
of the color formatting and the spacing
so you need not worry about that now let
me go ahead and bring up a new workspace
so I'll go to file click on new this
will take some time to bring up our new
workspace now it will ask you for trying
the free version or if you want you can
go ahead and sign in I'll just close
this so here is our new workspace before
creating the dashboard we need to make
some changes to our Superstore data set
using the features of power bi desktop
first we'll extract the year month and
quarter values from the order date
column I'll go to get data tab click on
Excel as my source I'll locate my file
it's on desktop click on open this might
take some time to load the data set I'll
select the orders sheet you can see the
preview of our data here I'll go ahead
and click on load this will take some
time to load the data set on to power bi
desktop I think we have successfully
loaded our data set you can check that
by going to the data tab so here is our
data set first let's make some changes
in the format of the order date and the
shipment date I'll click on the order
date under the modeling tab
we have this data type and the format
I'll click on the drill down option
and the date and time now let's choose
the first one which is in the format of
ddmm yyy
and click on it
as you can see our order date column has
been changed to that particular format
similarly I'll select the ship date
column
go to the format option under date and
time I click on the first one
here you can see even the ship date
column has been changed to that
particular format now let's extract the
month values from the order date column
to do that right click on the order date
column
select new column
so this will create a new column if you
go to the end so there's a new column
rename this column as month and since we
want the month value from the order date
column I'll search for order date
dot since I want the month I'll select
month now if I hit enter
it will give me the month values from
the order date column
similarly if you want to get the quarter
values from the order date
right click select new column
rename the column as quarter
and choose the order date column
followed by the quarter name hit enter
so you can see you have a quarter column
and it has all the values of the quarter
to which that it belongs to now let me
go ahead and create one more column
this time we'll create a new column for
the order year this time we'll extract
the order year values so let me rename
it as year we'll continue with the same
procedure I look for the order date and
then select the year
hit enter
so it gives you only the year values on
which the order was placed
now let's find which day of the week was
the order placed so we need to use the
weekday function and give the order
data's parameter followed by which day
you want the week to start with I'll
show you how to do that so I'll click on
order date
then select new column
let's rename this column as day of week
I'll use the weekday function of power
bi you can hit tab to finish I look for
my order date column
comma
I'll choose 2 here since I want my week
to start with Monday and end on a Sunday
hit enter
so you can see we have the day of the
week column
so the idea to create this day of V
column is to find out if the order was
placed on a weekday or a weekend now let
me go ahead and create one more new
column
let's name this column as
weekday
or a weekend
I'll use an if clause
and pass in my parameters for logical
test I'll use the day of the week column
so I'll search for audios
and then look for day of week if this
day of the week is equal to 6 which
means if it's a Saturday or I'm using
the or operator
if the day of week is a Sunday that is 7
then it's a weekend
else it's a weekday
close the bracket hit enter so you can
see we have our weekday and weekend
column so moving ahead another thing we
can do is we can find the total number
of days it took for the shipment of the
product this can be done using the
dative function of power bi so let me
show you how you can do that I'll click
on any column right click go to new
column let's rename the column as
days for shipment then I'll use the date
div function
I'll give my starting date which is the
order date so I'll search for
order date
followed by the second date will be our
shipment date which is ship date and the
day
I'll hit enter
so you can see here it gives us the
total number of days it took for the
shipment of the product now let's create
a full name column where we will
concatenate the first name and the last
name of the customer let me go ahead and
do that
I'll create a new column
let me rename the column as full name
then I'll take the first name
from the orders table use the Amber send
followed by a space using inverted
commas followed by another Ampersand and
the last name
I hit enter
you can see we have a full name column
if you go back so there were two columns
in the name of first name and last name
now we have merged both the columns into
a single column named full name and you
can see the first name space and the
last name now let me give the sales
column
a currency value so I'll select the
sales column
here
under General
if I go to currency I can see there are
multiple currency symbols
choose whatever you want for this video
I'll take dollar English United States
you can see our sales column is now
represented by a dollar value similarly
let me make some changes to the profit
column as you can see there are multiple
decimal values for each profit so let's
standardize it
so I'll select the profit column and
this is where you can standardize it now
it's Auto so let me make it two decimal
places
so our data is ready now let's go to the
report View and start building our
reports
before that
under the model view you can see the new
columns that we had created you can see
there's weekday weekend this year
this quarter column month column
the same you can see under the report
view as well under fields you can see
these are the columns that we created
days of shipment day of week
quarter
month weekday or weekend and year now we
are under the report view first let me
go ahead and create a text box
so under the Home tab you have the text
box
I'll select that
let me stretch it a bit
we'll give a title
sales
dashboard I'll select this and increase
the size to
let's say 28 we make it bold and Center
align it also under the visualizations
tab under background
will add a background color to this text
box let me select this blue color and
let me make
the font as white
so now we have our title ready
so under General you can decrease the
height of the text box let me make it as
70
first let us create a new card from the
visualizations panel so under
visualizations there is an option to
create new card I'll click on it
let me resize
I'll move it to the top
we'll see the total amount of sales or
the total revenue that was generated
from the sales after selecting the card
I'll choose sales onto fields
so here you can see it gives you the
total sales that were made so which is
nearly 2.3 million dollars
if I go to the format tab under data
label
let me switch on the border under title
you can give a new title for example
total
Revenue hit enter
now you can
increase the text size to say 15 and
Center Line it you can also change the
color of the sales value so under data
label under colors you can choose
whichever color you want
similarly let's create one more card to
find the total number of units that were
sold I'll copy the same card
Ctrl C Ctrl V
I'll move it a little below
now I'll remove the sales column
from the fields and add the quantity
column onto fields
again
under title I'll edit this title as
total
quantity sold
let me create one more card
where we will see the total amount of
profit that were made I'll select this
I'll remove the quantity column
and add profit
under the format tab
under title
I'll make this as
total
profit
hit enter
stretch it a bit so that you can see the
total amount of profit that were made
now
let me add a slicer
wherein
will have the order date column
so I'll add the order date column onto
fields
so you can see here we have the order
date column and
under slicer header
let me increase the text size
to 15
and
let's switch on the border
you can also give a title to the slicer
so under the format tab to go to title
switch it on
and we'll give a title text as
slicer by
order date
scroll down I'll Center align it and
increase the text size to 15.
now if you want you can also change the
date colors
to Blue so under date inputs then go to
font color and select any blue color
now let's create a line and stack column
chart to visualize sales and profit by
each year each month and each quarter so
from the visualizations tab let me
select line and stack column chart
I'll resize this
after that let me add the order date
column onto the shared axis
we'll drag the sales onto column values
and underline values I'll take the
profit column
so here you can see we have the sales
and profit by each year
the bars represent the sales and this
line represents the profit it made for
each year let me go to the format tab
and
make some changes to the data colors let
the color of the profit remain the same
but the bars I'll choose a custom color
give a hexadecimal value like
196273
hit enter
so we have successfully changed the
color of the bars power bi has an
interesting feature where you can drill
down the sales by each year each month
each quarter or by days so let me show
you so on the top it shows you go to the
next level in the hierarchy so if I
click on this here you can see the sales
and the profit that were made for each
quarter in every year
quarter four for every year made the
highest amount of sales and the profit
similarly if I drill down further you
can see let me expand it you can see by
month this is for each month
over all the years how much sales were
made
you can check November month give us the
highest amount of sales and
December month gave us the highest
amount of profit
similarly you can still go to the next
hierarchy here you can see
the sales and the profit made for each
day over all the years so day 17 made
the highest amount of sales
and day 23 gave us the highest amount of
profit if you see the lowest sales and
the profit you can see order day 25 gave
us the lowest amount of profit
and similarly you can see day 29 gave us
the lowest amount of sales
now you can also go to the format tab
and switch on the data labels
so you can see here in 2014 we got
nearly 49.5 K profit and nearly 0.48
million dollar sales similarly in 2015
we had nearly 61.6 K profit and 0.47
million sales and so on
now let me go ahead to the format Tab
and
switch on the border let me now create a
clustered column chart for sales by year
and quarter so from the visualizations
let's select clustered column chart let
me resize this a bit
and under access
will add the year column
so I'll drag here on to access under
Legend I'll take the quarter column
and under values I'll choose sales
so you can see here the sales that were
made under each quarter for each year
this picture clearly says quarter 4 for
every year Meet the highest amount of
sales and quarter one
made the lowest
let me go to the format tab
and I'll go to the data colors let's
change the colors for each of these
quarters we'll be using hexadecimal
values so under custom colors for
quarter one
let me select hexadecimal value as
follows so for example PF D6 D9
similarly for Quarter Two
I'll select 6D 9 ba6
for quarter 3
and finally for quarter 4
I choose a little darker color
so here is how our clustered column
chart looks like and we can see the
sales by year and quarter
now let me go ahead and
let's add a border now
we'll analyze the seals by each state so
for that we'll use field map so I'll
click on field map
let me resize it
now let me add the state column onto
location
and the tool tips I'll
add the sales column
let me expand it so you can see here we
have the map which shows the sales by
each state
now let's do some color formatting to
this
I'll go to the format tab click on ADD
colors
and blue is the default color there is
an additional option
where you can use conditional formatting
so I'll use that so it gives you the
option to choose your color between
maximum value and the minimum value you
can also choose this diverging option
where you get a center value or a mid
value as well now for the minimum value
I'll choose a color again I'll use a
custom color it will be similar to a
green color
red okay then
let's use some orange color for the mid
value range for example EB
and similarly for the maximum value
we'll use a little darker color which
looks similar to red
click enter so now we have defined our
color scheme
let's click on OK
let's zoom out so you can see the states
which are in green color meet the lowest
amount of sales while those which are in
orange or in red meet the highest amount
of sales so in this example you can see
California had the highest amount of
sales similarly New York is next is just
below California with the amount of
sales followed by Texas we'll go back
let me also
add a border to this similarly you can
also select the profit column or the
unit sold column to see the units or the
profit that were sold by each state
so let me now go ahead and create a
donut chart in the donut chart we'll
analyze the sales and profit by each
segment
so under visualizations I click on donut
chart
so under Legend I'll add the segment
column
under values I'll take the sales column
and
we also want the profit so I'll take
The Profit column onto tooltips
so you can see we have our donor chart
prepared and you can see the sales and
profit by each segment
let me expand this the donut chart
indicates consumer segment made the
highest amount of sales and profit while
home office segment made the lowest
I'll go back
let me go to the format tab
and we'll make some formatting to our
data
let's change the color of all the
segments
choose custom color
let's give a color
coding as
1558c
similarly we change
the color for corporate segment as well
let's take a gray color
and finally we'll change the color for
home office as well
I'll also switch on the border
so we have our donor chart prepared now
let's move ahead and create a pie chart
to analyze the profit and sales by each
category of products so under
visualizations I'll select pie chart
I'll drag the category column onto
Legend
under values I'll take the profit column
and under tooltips I'll take the sales
column
so you can see we have a simple pie
chart that tells you the profit and the
sales that were made by each category
as it's evident category technology made
the highest amount of sales and profit
while Furniture category made the lowest
amount of profit and sales
I'll go back
under format I'll change the data Colors
Let's go ahead and do that
I'll use custom colors and give
a hexadecimal color value
similarly for office supplies I'll take
another hexadecimal value
and finally we'll change the color of
the furniture category
also
let's give a border
so we have a pie chart prepared that
tells you the profit and sales by each
category of products now we are done
with our first sales dashboard so I can
go ahead
and rename
this tab as
overall sales
next we are going to analyze the sales
profit quantity sold and all of these
by taking region and the state as
filters so we'll continue with the same
drill first I'll create a text box
so under home menu I'll go to text box
I'll stretch this
I'll give a title to this page for
example region
and
and State
level analysis
let me make it bold
and
I'll increase the size to 28
make it Center aligned
will make the text
as wide
and
the visualizations
let's give a background color
I choose this blue color
so let me go ahead and create three
slicers a region slicer a state slicer
and a ear slicer so under visualizations
I'll click on slicer
let me resize
move it on top
and
for region slicer I need to add region
onto fields
so you can see we have a region filter
now
let's do some formatting to this
under slicer header
let me make the font color
white and
let's give a background
let's say blue
and let me increase the text size to
say 15.
you can also choose a font family
let's go for calibri
and
you can increase the size
of the items let's increase the text
size
to
say 15.
and
let's give a border
so now you have the region slicer ready
let me copy paste this
next
we'll create the state slicer so I'll
remove region from here and add
State onto the field
you can see we have the state slicer
ready similarly
you can also go ahead
and create a ear slicer
but you can analyze the sales and profit
or quantity by year
I'll remove State from here
and
I'll drag the ear column onto field
you can see we have all the four years
from 2014 to 2017. now sometimes it
might be difficult for you to scroll
through all the values present in a
slicer for example in the state slicer
you can see there are multiple States
and if you want to filter your report by
a particular State you have to always
scroll down or scroll up and check
manually where the state is so power bi
gives you this feature where you can use
the search option so if I click on this
you can see there's a search option
select that so now
in the search bar you can search for any
state you are looking for for example if
you want to search for California state
you can just type on California so you
have just type calc and it shows me
California that's an important feature
that power bi gives you
so let me now go ahead and create a
simple table where we will see the
quantity and the profit made in each
City so under visualizations I'll select
tables
let me resize this
so under values first I'll add the city
column
followed by
the quantity column
and
The Profit column
let's do some formatting
so under column headers
let me change the font color to white
and let's add a background
let me increase the text size also
let's make it 15
similarly if you scroll down under
values
let's increase the text size
to 15 as well
and
let's choose the font family let's take
consoles
so here
you can see all the cities
the quantity
sold in each City and the profit that
was made in each of these cities
let me add a border to this
so now you can filter each of these
cities by region or by state
for example if I choose Central
as my region
it will give you all the cities that lie
in the central region
similarly
you can also search for any state for
example
I am taking Minnesota
so under Minnesota
you can see all the cities and the
quantity as well as the profits made
let me now uncheck the filters now let
me go ahead and filter this table
in terms of profit so I'll sort by
profit
you can see
we have our cities sorted in terms of
profit
so New York City made the highest amount
of profit followed by Los Angeles and
Seattle below you can see the total
units that were sold and the total
profit that was made from all the cities
so you can also filter down the quantity
sold and the profit made by each year as
well as by region and State
so let's see
suppose I am choosing
East as the region
so under East it tells you the states
that are present
let's
go for Delaware
and let's select 2016 as my year
so you can see
the cities that lie under delivery state
and the quantity as well as the profit
the made in 2016. similarly let's select
Massachusetts as the state and let's
go for another year for example 2017
you can see all the cities that are
present under Massachusetts the quantity
sold and the profit that was made below
you can see the total quantity and the
profit
let me uncheck all these
now moving ahead let's analyze the sales
by each state and the category of
product for this
will create a clustered bar chart so
under visualizations I'll select
clustered bar chart let me resize a bit
under access
I'll take the state column
I'll take category onto Legend
and under values
I'll put the sales column
so you can see here
we have the seals for each category
under each state
for example California state made the
highest amount of sales under technology
category and it made the lowest amount
of sales under office supplies
by scroll down you can see all the
states
and the sales they made
for each category
I'll go back to the report
now let's use some filters
you can filter here for example if I
want to check
the sales by each state and category for
2015 I can just
click on 2015
and it will tell you the sales that were
made
now
let's do some formatting to this bar
chart
I'll change the colors for each of the
categories
similarly we change the color for office
supplies
and finally for the technology
so now we have our bar chart ready
moving on now let me add a border to
this bar chart
okay
so now that we have seen our sales by
state and category let's now check the
profit by year and category for that
we'll create an area chart
I'll resize this chart
now
under axis
I'll take the year column
under Legend
I'll take the category column
and
the values
I'll take profit
so we have our area chart that depicts
The Profit by each year and the category
to which the product belonged to
I'll go to the format Tab and under data
colors
I'll choose some colors
let's change Furniture to this blue
color
I'll take office supplies a red color
and Technology I'll use a green color
so now you can use the filters
for example you can check the profit
that was made by each year and category
under east region
so you can see here
in 2017 technology meet the highest
amount of profit while furniture at the
lowest
similarly
let's
check for South Region
so you can see in south region in 2016
technology meet the highest amount of
profit and
furniture made the lowest in 2017 office
supplies made the highest amount of
profit and Furniture was the lowest
I'll uncheck this South Region filter
similarly you can also see the sales by
each state so under State slicer you can
choose whichever State you want and
check the profit it made by that year or
category
for example I'll choose Connecticut
so you can see the profit Connecticut
state made in each of these years
I'll uncheck it
let us move ahead and now let's see
profit that was made and the quantity
that was sold by each category and
subcategory of the product so for this
I'll choose the line and clustered
column chart so I'll select from the
visualizations now
under shared access
I'll select the category column under
column series I'll take the subcategory
column
under column values
I'll choose profit
and
I'll choose quantity
under the tooltips
so now you can see
The Profit that was made under each
category and the subcategory
for technology category copiers
subcategory meet the highest amount of
profit the quantity sold was 234.
similarly
if you check for furniture category
we didn't make any profit for table
subcategory
and as well as for bookcases
under office supplies paper subcategory
made the highest amount of profit
now let me go ahead and add a border to
this
fine
moving ahead now we will see the sales
by each segment for that let's create a
funnel so from visualizations I'll take
the
funnel and
I'll drag
segment onto group
and the sales column onto values
so you can see here
the sales that were made by each segment
this picture clearly depicts that
consumer segment with the highest amount
of sales next was corporate and then
home office
now
let's do some color formatting so the
default color is this blue
I'll click on so all
now we'll give individual colors to each
of the segments
using custom color
let's give a hexadecimal value
similarly we'll change the color for the
corporate segment
and finally for the home office segment
now let me go ahead and give a border to
it
so if you want to analyze the seals by
segment and for
a particular region or state or any
particular year you can do that so let's
select
for each region
and
let's take New Jersey as the state
for year 2014 suppose
so you can see here corporate segment
meet the highest amount of sales
followed by consumer and home office
let me uncheck
these filters
so our second report is ready where we
analyzed the sales quantity profit at
Region level state level and by year so
I can rename this
as
as region and State
next we will analyze the sales quantity
profit in terms of categories and
subcategory of products so let me first
copy this text box
and create a new tab
I'll paste that text box here and
change the title to
say
category
and
sub category level analysis
first
we'll create a
slicer
where we will take
the category as filter
so if I want I can directly copy it
from my previous tab
and change the fields so let me copy
this
and paste it here
I'll sync it
and let me remove the region field and
add
category onto the field
so you can see
we have the three categories here
let me copy paste this again and
let me take the subcategory now
so I'll select this
and
I'll track subcategory onto the field so
here you can see we have all the
subcategories and above we have the
categories
let me resize this a bit
with that now let's analyze the sales
and profit by region and segment
to do this we'll use a tree map so let's
see how you can build a tree map under
visualizations I have tree map let me
select it
and move it to the top
and expand it a bit
now
under group
I'll select region column
under details I'll take
segment
I'll take the sales column under values
and let's take profit
on two tooltips
so if I expand this
you can see the sales and profit by each
region and segment for example in the
west region you have consumer corporate
and home office
as the segments and you can see consumer
segment meet the highest amount of sales
and profit while home office made the
lowest amount of sales and profit
similarly you can check for the other
regions as well
now
let's give a border to the Stream app
and
under data colors let me change the
color of the regions
scroll down
custom color let me let me choose my own
color
let's take this as a gray color
and finally
for the best region
so now you can select individual
categories and subcategories to check
the sales and profit by region and
segment for example
if I select
Furniture as my category
you can see the changes that were made
to the tree map
you can also select office supplies and
see
how the sales and profit changes
similarly you can also go ahead and
select whatever subcategories you want
and then check the sales and profit by
region and segment with that let me now
create a pie chart
to see the quantity and the sales by
each segment
so I'll go and select a pie chart
let me resize this
if you want you can increase the size of
this tree map also
so let me go ahead
and select segment onto the legend
under values I'll take quantity
and
sales under tooltips
so this pie chart
depicts the quantity and the sales that
were made by each segment as you can see
consumer segment meet the highest amount
of sales and had the highest quantity
sold
while home office had the least number
of quantities sold and the least number
of sales
let's add a border
and
change the data colors
similarly I'll change the color for the
corporate segment let's make this
green
and home office
I'll take the following color
move this a little to the right
now let's build a scatter plot to
analyze the sales quantity and profit by
each subcategory
so under visualizations
I'll select scatter plot I'll resize
this
so I'll add
sub category onto Legend
then I'll add sales onto the x-axis
quantity sold onto the y-axis
and under size
will take the profit column
if I expand this
you can see the sales quantity and the
profit that was made for each
subcategory of products you can see here
subcategory phone has given us a
significant amount of sales with less
number of quantities sold and it has
given us a good amount of profit also
similarly subcategory shares has also
given us good amount of sales with close
to 2356 quantities sold and a good
amount of profit if you see this one
which is subcategory paper it gave us
less amount of sales with more
quantities sold while it gave us good
amount of profit though so you may
promote phones or for example chairs to
sell more since it gives you more amount
of profit with less quantity sold
let's add a border to this
you can use the category filter suppose
if I choose for furniture
and expand this
you can see
under Furniture subcategory Furnishings
give us the lowest amount of sales with
the highest number of quantities sold
but it gave us a decent amount of profit
subcategory tables give us a decent
amount of sales with lesser number of
quantities sold but didn't give us any
profit
subcategory chairs give us the highest
amount of sales and also the profit
I'll uncheck this
let's now create a line chart where we
can see the profit by each year and
quarter so under visualizations
I'll select line chart let me resize
this
so under access
I'll take year
and a legend
I'll take the quarter column
and under values
I'll take the profit column
so now you can see the profit that was
made
each year and the lines depict each
quarter
so if you check for 2014 quarter four
meet the highest amount of profit while
quarter 2 made the lowest amount of
profit while quarter 1 made the lowest
amount of profit similarly if you see
for 2016 you can see
quarter four meet the highest amount of
profit
while quarter One Meet the lowest
if you check for 2017 you see a quarter
three and quarter four almost meet the
same amount of profit while
quarter 2 made the lowest amount of
profit
I go back
now you can filter these by categories
also suppose if I see for technology
you can check the amount of profit that
was made in each year and in each
quarter for technology category
let's add a border to this
likewise we'll now create another line
chart that will depict the sales by each
year and quarter so let me copy paste
this
I'll drag this to the right
now I'll remove
profit from values and add sales
let me uncheck this also
so here you can see we have the sales by
each year and quarter
now if you see for 2014 again quarter
four meet the highest amount of sales
and quarter 1 in 2014 meter lowest
you see for 2016 you can see 2016 also
record me the highest amount of sales
and quarter One Meet the lowest
and go back
so our final report is ready where we
analyzed the sales quantity sold the
profit at category and subcategory level
I can go ahead and rename this as
category
and subcategory
let me save this now if you want
you can also filter it by subcategories
for example if I select
chairs as my subcategory
so for chairs you can see the sales that
was made by each year and quarter
so in 2017 quarter four made the highest
amount of sales while quarter one made
the lowest amount of sales for cheers
similarly
you can select other subcategories also
for example
let me take
some other category like
machines
let's see the profit now
so for machine subcategory you can see
in 2014 quarter four meet the highest
amount of profit while
quarter 3
meet the lowest amount of profit
now if you check for 2015 you can see
quarter 3 made the highest amount of
profit in shares while quarter 1 made
the lowest amount of profit
let's uncheck this
so now we are almost done building a
report using the Super Store sample data
set
so we have our three reports ready you
can see the first one was overall sales
the second report we created
by taking region State and the year as
filters so we had a region and state
level analysis and finally we analyzed
the sales quantity and the profit sold
by category and subcategory so I have
arranged all these graphs and charts so
that it looks little better now let me
go to this publish option on the top so
that we can publish this report onto the
power bi Dash code
so I'll click on publish
and save it
you can select the destination here I
have only one destination which is my
workspace so I'll choose it and select
so there you go publishing to power bi
it was successful
I'll close it
and let me move to my power bi service
I'll refresh it for once
so under my workspace
you can see we have the dashboard report
So Below you can see there are three
tabs that we created the first one is
overall sales
the second one is sales by region the
third one is by category and subcategory
now to put this reports onto the
dashboard I need to pin each one of
these visualizations
so
let me pin one by one
so it asks where would you want to pin
it to I'll select the existing dashboard
or better let's create a new dashboard
let's say
power bi
Dash code
spin it
close this
similarly let's spin the remaining ones
I'll select power bi dashboard again pin
it
let's spin everything
so this slicer you can't pin it
let's do the remaining ones
same will do for the donut chart
as well as
for the pie chart
now
now if I go to
my dashboards
and select power bi dashboard
you can see
we have a one page
dashboard here
you can resize all the charts and graphs
let me resize it
and move it to the top
so we have our first canvas here which
tells you the overall sales the profit
and the units that were sold over
different states different segments
and by categories so one of the
important feature that power bi service
gives you is that you can ask questions
about your data and it will tell you
what the exact solution is for example
you can see here you have a field where
you can ask questions so for example if
I type
total sales
and hit enter
so it tells you the total amount of
sales that were made which is 2.3
million dollars similarly if I want to
find out the total
profit I can search for it here
hit enter it will give you the exact
amount of profit that was made let's do
something else for example if you want
total
profit
by
say here
I'll hit enter it gives you a nice line
chart where you can see the total profit
that was made over all the four years
next suppose I search for total
quantity
sold
by
segment
see it gives me a bar chart where you
can see the total quantity that was sold
and it gives you a list of options where
you can find out the total quantity that
was sold by city state order ID first
name last name and many others so
consumer segment had the highest
quantity sold
let's see for something else for example
if you want
the total
sales by
say subcategory
I'll choose the first one see you have
all the subcategories and the total
sales that they made so it's a very
interesting feature that power bi gives
you
go back
now if you want
you can go to the report menu
and if you want you can pin the other
visualizations as well
so another important feature about power
bi dashboard is that you can derive
insights from the visualization for
example
if I click on these dots there's an
option you find view insights I'll
select it
so on the right you can see Power bi has
itself given us some insights from the
data and the visualizations we have made
in C sales by year and quarter
the sales by day of week and quarter
sales by shipment mode where you can see
the standard classic Mode made the
highest amount of sales
you can also see the sales and count of
City by year
and many more
if you're an aspiring data analyst
looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply learns pose graduate program in
data analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be a right
choice for more details use the link in
the description box below and with that
in mind over to our training experts
which manages the data flow and turns
data into actionable information
it can create a wide range of different
visualization to interactively present
the data and showcase insights
Tableau has the feature of drag and drop
which allows its users to create
interactive visuals quickly
it can also build interactive dashboards
with just a few clicks
so power bi was originally designed by
Ron George in the summer of 2010 and the
initial release was available for public
download on 11th of July 2011.
the key components of power bi are power
bi desktop power bi service power bi
mobile apps power bi Gateway and power
bi report server
Tableau Software was founded in 2003 in
Mountain View California and the Tableau
desktop 1.0 was released in 2004 on 1st
of August 2019 Salesforce acquired
Tableau Tableau products include Tableau
desktop Tableau server W online W
visible W public and Tableau reader
now let's see how expensive these tools
are
power bi is way less expensive than
Tableau Software power bi professional
version costs less than 10 dollars per
month per user the yearly subscription
comes around hundred dollars
power bi premium is licensed with
dedicated Cloud compute and storage
resources and is priced at
4995 dollars per month
on the other hand
table Tableau is more expensive but the
pro version of Tableau comes at more
than 35 dollars per month per user
the yearly subscription costs around
thousand dollars Tableau Creator costs
around 70 dollars per month while
Tableau viewer is priced at 12 dollars
per month if you are a startup or a
small business you can offer power bi
and then upgrade to Tableau if the need
arises
now coming to Performance
power bi is easy to use it is faster and
performs better when the volume of data
is limited power bi tends to drag slow
when handling bulk data
but Tableau can handle large volumes of
data easily it is faster and provides
extensive features for visualizing the
data Tableau doesn't limit the number of
data points in a visualization or
enforce row or size limitations
so you can have a complete view of your
data tableau's wide range of built-in
analytic capabilities allows you to
spend less time worrying about manually
creating calculations designing
visualizations and formatting dashboards
now let's discuss the user interface of
these tools
the user interface of power bi is highly
intuitive and it can easily be
integrated with other Microsoft products
power bi interface is easy to learn and
understand
it is user friendly and allows you to
operate better power bi desktop provides
three views which you can select on the
left side of the canvas
the first view is of the report View
where you can create reports and visuals
the next is the data View
in this view you can see the tables
measures and other data used in the data
model associated with your report
and transform the data for best use in
the reports model
and third is the model view in this view
you can see and manage the relationships
among data in your data model
Tableau has an intelligent interface
that enables you to create and customize
the dashboards according to your
requirements easily
it has an inviting workspace area that
encourages you to experiment with data
and get smart results
the workspace area has different cards
and cells toolbar sidebar data source
page status bar and Sheet tabs
with that let us now talk about the
different data sources that power bi and
Tableau can connect with
another important feature of power bi is
that it supports various data sources
but has limited access to other
databases and servers compared to
tableau
some of the examples are Microsoft Excel
text or CSV files folders Microsoft SQL
Server access DB Oracle database IBM db2
mySQL database postgre SQL database Etc
Tableau Software has access to numerous
data sources and servers such as Excel
text file PDF Json statistical file
Amazon redshift Cloudera Hadoop Google
analytics Dropbox Google Sheets Google
Drive and lots more
now let's talk about that ease of use
power bi enjoys a slight Edge in terms
of ease of use because it is based on a
user interface that has its roots in
Microsoft Office 365.
which most end users are already
familiar with
Tableau provides some essential
advantages for exploring and visualizing
data in detail Tableau is also
incorporating natural language
capabilities into its software
this will help us in finding solutions
to complex Problems by understanding the
data better
next let us understand how power bi and
Tableau differ in terms of programming
support
power bi supports data analysis
expressions or Dax and M language for
data manipulation and data modeling it
can connect with our programming
language using Microsoft Revolution
analytics but it is available only for
Enterprises level users
compared to power bi
Tableau integrates much better with our
language
Tableau Software development kit can be
implemented using any of the four
programming language such as C C plus
plus Java and python by connecting to
these programming languages you can
build even more powerful visualizations
now coming to the most important
category which is data visualization
power bi provides an easy to use drag
and draw functionality it provides
features that make data visually
appealing power bi offers a wide range
of detailed and attractive
visualizations to create reports and
dashboards
using power bi service you can ask
questions about your data and it will
give you meaningful insights
tab blue also allows its users to
customize dashboards specifically for a
device it delivers interactive visuals
that support insights on the Fly
it can translate queries to
visualizations and makes you ask
questions spot Trends and identify
opportunities no coding knowledge is
required to work on Tableau as Tableau
provides inbuilt table calculations to
build reports and dashboards
now talking about machine learning and
how they are different from each other
power bi enjoys the advantages of
Microsoft business analytics that
includes platforms such as Azure machine
learning SQL Server based analysis
Services data streaming in real time and
mini Azure database offers
it helps to understand the data and
analyze the trends and patterns in the
data you can also forecast the data to
make future predictions
table Tableau supports the features of
python machine learning this enables it
to perform machine learning operations
over the data set
finally let's talk about customer
support
Microsoft power bi is relatively younger
in the market than Tableau and hence it
has a smaller community
while Tableau has over 160 000 active
users participating in over 500 Global
user groups and over 150 000 active
customers participating in the Tableau
online community
next on the screen you can see the
Google trends for both the tools over
the last five years from 2015 onwards
as you can see Tableau is a clear front
runner and is more popular these days
with high search volume
now talking about the Gartner magic
quadrant for analytics and business
intelligence platforms
so for 13 consecutive years Gartner has
recognized Microsoft as a magic quadrant
leader in analytics and business
intelligence platforms
and it has recognized Tableau as a
leader in business intelligence after
Microsoft
you can see there are other popular
tools such as click hotspot seasons
sap and Salesforce
