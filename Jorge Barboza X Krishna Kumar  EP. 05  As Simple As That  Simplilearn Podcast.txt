story so welcome George thank you for
taking time to speak with us and we look
forward to hearing your story please get
us started with your early childhood and
on where you were born and how was the
journey in the first few years and we
very very fascinated about your whole
story and I'm sure I find this very
interesting and our Learners will also
find it very interesting g g thank you
so much for having good morning to you
over there I hope we have time because
if we're going to start with my
childhood it's going to be a long
conversation but a good one a good one
um I I started actually very different
from what you would expect for someone
that went into uh the music industry I
am not musician uh my my experience in
the music industry is uh with video
production uh so um I I I didn't start
it like that it started when when I was
a kid when I was in fourth grade so nine
years old I started showing interest in
in
computers uh um my father I I asked him
to get a computer for me which in
Venezuela uh was a very expensive
investment at the time
so he put me one condition and the
condition is that I needed to learn to
use a computer before I can own a
computer and I was completely F which
year was that which year was that oh
this was for grade I guess it was in the
90 exactly 90 91 something like
that I had a similar experience in I'll
say in 87 888 so I used to travel from
my home to my school so I used to walk
it was about 3 kilomet walk in the
morning and there was an over Bridge
Road on that over there was a big
holding where a boy and a girl were
sitting in front of computer and having
compan compan was a health drink that
was very popular those days so that that
used to fascinate me a lot on what this
device is then I heard it is computer
because there was no internet during
that time so I was always very
fascinated that can I get an opportunity
to really have something like that but I
had not seen anybody having it so I
never went and asked my parents also
that can I have it till we went into a
college set in front of a computer cool
so we have that in common right uh it's
something that kind of attra doing where
we're little kid um and yeah that that
was my father only condition I needed to
learn how to use a computer before I I
can have one uh so I started looking for
trainings and courses when I was n years
old in
Venezuela uh and I found one and the
only problem with that that was that I
was nine years old and they wouldn't
allow me in so my father went with me
and he kind kind of negotiate with the
people in charge that if he comes with
me and we both make the
training then I I could do it and that's
how I got into computers so that's how I
started in computer after that I have a
coing who lend me a couple of books to
do algorithm and programming using
basic so uh fifth grade I did my first
coding in little programs where the
computer ask you for a PR and you fill
it out and then you use it so little s
uh um that got me all the way into like
computer science
engineering uh that part of it right uh
it it wasn't until I got in college that
I started showing interest on the Arts
um
ER the the music industry
so it it was a kind of a different route
like I I I
started understanding that if I was
going to be a full if I was going to
fully develop myself I needed to balance
my mathematical logical nerdy side with
my artistical side so I I started going
into a theater I start doing theater and
there I met uh two friends who were my
partners when we started the
company
that that learning computer to going
into theater so what fascinated you to
get into music industry and hence you
going to the theater was there any
trigger point on at that at that
point can it was kind of backwards I
mean I was interested in music but ER I
notice that I was a very logical person
everything in my actions were more were
more drive by Logic than by emotions and
I wanted to get in touch with that part
and balance it out and that's why I I
came in theater um trying to develop
that part a little bit more because if
you think about it like no no good
software is only designed by an engineer
right you need a lot of people and with
a lot of qualities and a broader range
of faculties to actually create
something that is effective and usable
and that people will feel happy to use
right agree the greatest example is
Steve Jobs right he was not an engineer
he was not a computer guy but he was he
the best product manager that or a
software creator that anybody can think
of right so I agree correct correct so
developing that emotional part and how
to connect with people was something
that I needed to do if I wanted to grow
so so that's why I in enter in theater
and in theater I met these two partners
uh and they were in in touch with the
music industry uh they we we actually
formed a company over there and the
company was supposed to uh provide the
music industry with h what we call at
that time multimedia software basically
a way to promote their artists with some
CDs uh with
ER you know you can see their videos
listen to the music uh different images
and all that the the only problem was
that I was in in a town called Maro
Venezuela and the the quality of the
video production and the standard for
photography wasn't really up to the
standards to International standards so
we could be able to Market this out so
we decided to take it over and that's
how I started working in production and
that's how I jump from ER developing to
going into uh producing music videos
producing photo session for different
artists ER it started locally it started
in my city then ER the product reach out
like National wise and we get to start
with ER bigger personalities over there
ER and it was not only the music
industry it was also commercials and
different everything that has to do with
video production photography and
multimedia a little bit that was the the
time where macromedia flash was kind of
in bog and er we use it a lot uh to
create multimedia as director with
macromedia also
so uh that is how I jump into the the
music industry when you growing up what
was your primary language like you were
doing this all this video music
production in Spanish or when did you
learn English or English is is quite
common in Venezuela I don't know so how
is
it um I I took English lessons for about
three years in Venezuela every
Saturday ER I was like about 6 hours uh
doing engl English lessons and I always
joke about it because I say I learn my
English back in Venezuela and I master
it and then I lose it when I live in
myami for 10 years nobody speaks English
over there so I couldn't practice it at
all uh which place is it Miami in Miami
yeah yeah mean what do they speak they
speak again Spanish yeah they all speak
Spanish is it's really really weird that
you find somebody who speaks English uh
over there in Venezuela in sorry in
Miami
okay so uh you already got yourself
established in the music and Commercial
industry producing multimedia for even
bigger artist and that one of those
videos uh got you win Grammy so you are
fairly successful I'll say very
successful in Venezuela so what
triggered you to say that okay now I
want to move out of the country and and
come to United States what was the
trigger point why would you do that if
we already doing pretty well there well
I I kind of wouldn't like to get into
the details because Venezuela is a very
uh politically heavy and conflictive
Country uh at the moment and when I live
over there so it's probably not a light
conversation to have but okay fair to
say that the situation over Venezuela
was H really complicated for everybody
um after I came here it got even worse
and I have my wife and uh my one year
old kid um any opportunity that I got to
try to make it out of the country was
accepted and that opportunity came with
that a work so that help me out you
looked at only United States as as a
possible destination to go and work
outside Venezuela or or you evaluated
other countries and then finally decided
that maybe us is the best place to be
yeah I I see I didn't look at at any
other opportunities I only look at
United States and that's because I have
already a friends here uh my partner in
the company actually came here six
months before I came and started working
so we started developing like that kind
of commercial relationship between some
artists back there in Venezuela and here
in the states so it was The Logical move
I
think so on on that front J so you came
to us on what is called o Visa right
many people also call it Einstein Visa
because Einstein also came to us people
with outstanding abilities right tell us
something about more more about it
because large part of our simply learn
Learners are all outside US large part
of course us is a large part of our
audience but most common visas are H1B
L1 but o is not that popular so what it
takes to get how did you get to know
about it because I understand that not
many people even know about that there's
a category like that that exists
yeah I I actually didn't even request a
Visa I request directly a
resident and it's an e one it's special
abilities ER and to get that there are a
couple of way of doing it one is to get
an international recognized from h a
larger Academy or something that is
really outstanding um the other way to
do it is that you can do like re be a
really high achiever in any area and
have a way to demonstrate that that's
the case uh you can get it with a
compiling certain requirements that the
united state governments does in in my
case I was lucky enough and I was really
really lucky to get this award it's it
it got us full by surprise really uh
even though we were really happy with
the product and we knew the quality that
we were putting it it it was a surprise
we we were competing with Warner Brother
Sony like really really big fish in the
pot and uh we we could make it so er for
me it was just this and to demonstrate
to the United States that I was you know
a participant on the video what was my
function why uh it was a role to make it
happen so it's it's not easy uh but if
you collect the right information you
you will be able to do what what is this
category called eb1 eb1 yeah sounds good
so good things happen with good people
so we put the good amount of effort with
good intention own the award so now
coming back to your enter into United
United States which year was that that
was in 2008
2008 okay 2008 was not the best of the
time when it comes to Global Market I
think just subprime crisis and there was
like all kinds of unemployment and all
kinds of negative things on the economy
and I think it continued till pretty
much 2010 so how was it coming to us
such a costly place to raise family and
live in how did you manage those those
years like did you get a so you directly
came on eb1 so you got a Into You Came
as an immigrant with an ability to work
in us so you didn't any any restriction
as such to work on a certain time
certain type of work right yeah kind of
like I was able to come in and I was
able to work legally probably three to
four months after I came in so not that
big of an amount of time but even that
land of a time to live with your wife
and your kid in the states without any
other income is is complicated it's
really hard
uh we managed to do it we like you know
adjust our belts and were able to do it
without ER having to to resort to
anything too complicated thank God we
have the support of my family back there
in Venezuela uh but that time we have
something that was called like family ER
I don't know how to say this in English
but it was a way that
Venezuelans can send money over here to
the United States and we were able to to
use that uh so there were a lot of
advantages and disadvantage of coming
that year and the main disadvantage is
what you mentioned right there was no
job ER available uh the the music
industry suffer as much as the rest of
the
industry ER so it was complicated for me
to find my Niche or my space on on on
that moment in time um the the probably
the only good side of that is that I
have a property back there in Venezuela
ER my house my home over there that I
could sell for a relative good good
price at that moment and since prices
were low here I was able to buy
something over here with that so it kind
of compensates a little bit the the the
bad moment uh but
uh like I mentioned that that was a a
hard moment for all the
industries but I found that it was
easier for me to get work as a
freelancing in software engineering that
it was for me to get into production I
didn't have the same resources and
contacts that I have back in Venezuela
so uh I started doing a little bit of
freelancing for uh websites and uh some
uh SML companies that needed you know
little adjustments on the side managing
content how are you finding those works
like you were using platforms like eans
and upwork kind of platform how do you
make yourself available for small
businesses to contract you yeah in part
I I don't know if upor was at that time
but I use on in similar it used to call
El that time it be part okay so yeah in
my in my
yeah it might have been elans uh yeah I
use different digital platforms to find
job and also for reference from some
friends I get to to get into some
different positions and it was funny
because sometimes I got gigs like doing
camera work or something like that I I I
I must confess I was a producer back
there in Venezuela but I didn't did the
operations of camera working I
contracted cameraman I contracted the
the people the team for the project
right so I started working on that
because I have the basic knowledge for
that and some of that those gigs tell me
hey do you know somebody who can like
put these videos on the website and yeah
I can do it for you and that way I I
started going back to my roots let's say
great point is that also shows your like
agility because I think one of the
things so we are in the business of
upskilling and reskilling people and one
common trait that we see in all those
people who are very successful in their
career Transitions and and and doing
very well in life is that there are they
are not even they are not hard hard
fixed in their mind that I am so and I
want to do so they're always open to
experiment and take up whatever comes
their way as long as it helps them meet
their objective in your case it was like
surviving in us before figuring it out
what you do right so so I think that's
that's that's a one common tra that I
see in all the of Simply land that I
speak to so you said that you you landed
in Miami and now are you are in Atlanta
tell us about that that why Miami and
why Atlanta later on because these are
two different kind of places within us
right very different culture very
different things that they are known for
yeah absolutely I I mean ER when I
started working on I started working
like my official title as was web
development with a company for a while
over there in Miami
uh um my family was growing my
mother-in-law came to live with us uh we
have our daughter like er they have five
years of difference so my kid was five
years when we have my my daughter so the
the apartment the condo that we have in
Miami was started to feel a little bit
small uh and I started looking for
options and when I do when I try to find
some place to live I I don't evaluate
only what my needs are but also I try to
evaluate that is a good investment
because
basically a home ownership over here is
one of the most important Investments so
you need to think really well about it
what what you're going to do uh and we
found an area on on Georgia nearby
Atlanta which prices were low at the
time uh and it allowed me to get the
house the house that you see here on the
background uh where we have spaces
enough to raise a family to raise the
kids uh they have really good
schools uh and it was overall a good in
investment it it was a
really I I don't see any failure on that
part because the the market only went up
uh we doubled investment it was Prett
good uh so when I decided to in Miami
also you're working remotely here also
you're working remotely so it didn't
impact you on that front actually in
Miami I was working I was working on
location um uh but I I have kind of
earned back my confidence that the
company I work with I have served them
ER really well I have good relationships
with the owner and with the rest of the
people over there and when I told them
my plans they told me hey if you want to
work remotely just go ahead and do it uh
the company like the marketing
headquarters that is where I would work
was there in Miami but then all the
locations were abroad they have
locations in Dubai they have locations
in Greece Thailand ER Spain so I
basically serve all those locations and
it was for them the same that I serve it
from myami or I service from here so
that's that's what happened with that
work I continue working I work
remotely probably two to three years
before the pandemic started so I was
really used to
it CED so Jo I think that's great to
know about your journey and your
decision- making criteria that sounds
good and you you have a great house we
can see from the background for sure so
George I moved to United States about 5
months back and I find that there is a
big lag of support system around you
finding or do getting work done that you
think is a trivial work is not trivial
here right from putting a nail on your
wall to maybe getting your car service
to somebody coming and cleaning your
house if you're busy with work all that
needs to be planned and worked upon so
when you move to from Venezuela to
United States you had your own struggle
with your study income then you had
family to take care of and then
upskilling yourself so how did you find
time between all these different
priorities
I think something you mention is very
important that the support system that
around you in in my case my close family
was really supportive ER first of all so
I have a wonderful wife which has helped
me a lot and support me um uh I'm the
lest man alive for having
her she was very very paying very much
attention that
you know if I feel stressed hey let's
stop for a moment cut it out let's take
a moment for ourself and enjoy it so I
can balance out the stress of all this
over here uh um er I I try to manage my
time very very carefully uh
I I don't sleep that much which is not
healthy uh I'm trying to improve in that
but I do have tried to have more hours
during my day and I started early and up
late uh probably something that got from
production since I was the the producer
on on all those projects I was always
the first to be there and the last one
to go out so I used to hard 16 hour a
day work uh so it's it's something that
you know you try
to put the energy manage your time
and sleep when you
can got it I don't recommend really
people to sleep less because you are
blessed that you can be healthy with
with less sleep but yeah I've have seen
some of my friends also they manage with
four five hours of sleep and still
wonder how because I need 78 hours of
sleep every day otherwise I don't feel
energetic the next day so tell me what
are your hobbies like how do you how do
you like um Do Re recharge yourself with
so much going
on there are probably three hobbies that
I have uh one is video editing that got
from the previous work I love editing I
love set pacing especially music videos
because you know you get to experiment a
lot and I play around with different
scenes and effects and people are more
open-minded with what you do over there
that's one scene the other scene that I
like to do is write I like to
write I have
reading a lot of short
stories a couple of features I'm working
right now with one of my of my career
Partners in a feature that I I love is I
think is an important topic and that is
a story that needs to be told so that's
one another thing that I
do uh to take my mind of what is
technology I just submer that story and
try to make it the more entertaining as
possible
[Music]
so I have publish a couple of stories
yeah in Venezuela I publish one and over
here I publish another
one so I have H that in writing but I
write more that more than
ER stories or Tales or novels I write
more screenplays so I have ER like about
three CH screen plays that plays really
good in some
contests rain dance John fins in La it's
it's quite a hobby um then I have some
features that is now more complicated
but is what I'm trying to get into as
far as my writing hobby goes and then
the sir hobby or the sin scene that I
like to do is cooking particularly
grilling or smoking
so nice good I'm sure that your family
loves anybody in your family loves
cooking and for others I think that's a
great I will say then you are a great
asset to
everybody that's something that that you
is really really needed so George tell
me one thing um do you miss your country
because you grew up in Venezuela and do
you message to people who are right now
there and maybe they are having a dreams
and plans similar to you what will be
your your message to
them well first yes of course I miss my
country uh it's a beautiful place with a
beautiful people um er my brother and my
father still lives there so I miss him
most of all my mother she got a
residence we get to ask for her uh so
she spent some months with me some
months with my sister that live actually
on
Houston um and then she spent some time
in Venezuela back with my brother so er
at least we have that uh I used to miss
the food a lot but now
so many Venezuelan has gone over that we
have a lot of different places to go
with different food from Venezuela so
that's a good uh
scene but I would love to go over there
ER and spend some time there the most
complicated part is with the kids since
they don't have the the documentation we
will need to stay quite a while so we
can put all that in rule with the
Venezuelan government my message will be
look for what you're are interested in
and try to be the best that you can on
that and the marketplace right now is
open worldwide so if you are in
Venezuela you have an advantage over me
life there cost way less than it what it
cost here but you can earn the same
salary that I got here working remotely
from there so put your heart on it and
ER I'm sure you can make a good life out
out of it so saying that now internet is
a Level Playing Field and especially in
tech there is a lot of ability to do
remote jobs so you can pretty much be in
Venezuela and earn American salary right
with a venal cost that's a great so tell
me before you took this simply learn
program like what what was your approach
to continuously keeping you updated
about what's happening in the industry
and acquiring those skills at what point
of time you started realizing and
started working on it was it the first
program that you took on the Internet or
where you have done this kind of
programs in the fast what has been your
thought process on that on that front
yeah I I took one more program back
there in Miami ER that was in location
was for mobile development uh uh I took
it in part because I wanted to learn a
little bit about that area I haven't
been able to touch that when I was in
Venezuela on college or anything so it
pick my curiosity and starting learning
about that I got the chance to actually
implement it when I was working with
this company over there in Miami uh we
develop their mobile app and it was a
nice
experience ER but besides that basically
I I was part of some meetup groups where
uh some developers just get together and
talk about their project
so that kind of help me out sometime I
volunteer for some of their projects to
help them out with song s and it help me
expand a little bit my knowledge on
certain areas um also it give you the
opportunity to ER try things that you
not normally have the opportunity to do
on your regular day-to-day work
day-to-day work gets to get sometimes
I'm not saying this is my experience now
right now I'm working in a good but
sometimes when you do the same work and
I did my most estable work was for seven
eight years almost eight years so it get
to a point it was automatically so I
needed some more challenges and I
volunteered for some other projects and
that was the way that I tried to keep up
to
dat got it so so that was your in
general approach and that all sounds
great that Meetup are definitely a great
resource to meet people who are in a
similar industry and with a different
kind of experience I think that
definitely works through it at least
entrepreneurship I've seen that there
are many such platform that I personally
really look forward to getting to those
event because you get to know what you
what you are not even thinking in that
direction because many times we research
and has a and have a point of view based
on whatever past experiences that we
have and suddenly you meet somebody who
is working in the same industry with a
very different kind of experience can
open up avenues that you have not
thought about it so a great idea so tell
me about this program that you did with
simply learn like at what point of time
you started researching started
realizing the need to do on such program
what was your Evolution criteria and how
did you decided to work with a a simply
learn CCH program yeah absolutely I
think I just mentioned the mobile
application and I think that was
probably the starting point for me ER to
get to know the lack of knowledge or the
gap of knowledge that I have regarding
uh cloud computing and the technology
and how that would be a
to help me to improve what I was
offering um
so I started looking for all the
alternative all the options that I have
to actually fill that that void on
knowledge that I that I
had and I I did quite a research I think
it was probably I don't know six month
of research before I finally decided ER
but I I check all the reviews that I
could I met with different self
representatives from different trainings
courses uh I contact I reach out to
people in LinkedIn or different places
that have done some other ER trainings
and definitely I can say the simper was
the on that check all the boxes of what
I was looking for uh and I I
seeing I got it right with because it
was it was a really good experience for
me
um I it was just what I needed it it
allows you like I said when you go to a
me and you volunteer for with some of
the people over there you get the
opportunity to try since that you cannot
do it at work um simple Le what was like
that but kind of on steroids because I
got access to the labs I got access uh
to really really uh good trainers
uh I
remember there was one trainer called
Shannon Shannon Bennett if I'm not
mistake it uh we we have we talk in a
moment during a work problem that I have
I reach her out and she answer me back
send me some documentation so I can tell
it it was a really good experience and
not only for that moment not only like
you know most of the trainings you
fulfill the the activity but and that's
it you don't get any other support but
with simple learn I I got that extra
mass of getting the support outside the
the limits of the training and I I
really appreciate that oh that's great
to know thank you for sharing your
feedback so tell me Joor in particular
see one of the goals that we also have
is that when we do this live cohort
Based training you get similar minded
people with a similar kind of objective
into one common platform where you learn
from an instructor you learn by doing
some Hands-On project give labs for you
to practice offline while while you're
not in a class one of the objective also
is is is to network with people from
across the globe did you find anything
on that sort useful in your class where
you could connect with people from who
are not from United State or maybe
they're from United States from but from
different state not from Georgia and so
on sure sure I mean like the people
that was part of the cohort were all
around the glove I seen there was people
from I don't know different places
Ukraine I was one that I remember there
were people from Latin America from
different different places and with
different backgrounds different stories
uh we we all have in common the interest
for technology but I can say that they
were so much of a variety of backgrounds
I I seen one person was coming from
cosmetology
um to do this
training uh so that speaks to me why why
was that person from cosmetology trying
to do a Technical Training again they
want he or she wanted to sift the area
yeah yeah she she wanted well I guess
first she have an interest in technology
besides the her career in cosmetology
and she saw the
opportunity that the industry is growing
like crazy I I haven't seen this
diminish not even a little bit even with
like all the ER scenes that are happen
in theory when you seeing all this
layoff and everything there is always
open positions for for everyone um uh
this this girl she was going from
cosmetology to Student Computing ER
cloud computing uh and you can see like
she was really starting she didn't have
like a lot of knowledge on let's say
programming or coding or that kind of
stuff but she could to like a solid
project a solid Cloud project using the
basic technology over there ER on the
lab so it it was experience that I mean
and this is something because I after
the training I I've been reach from some
of the ER some other people asking me
about uh simple learn and I tell them
well I I see you can get out of it even
if you don't come from a technology
background if you come from a technology
background you will like super like get
a lot of value out of it because you can
see you you get that mindset of oh now I
can use this to do this instead of what
I been doing
normally uh but it was helpful I I can
see like people that have no knowledge
at all get
it started really quick got it that's
really great to know so what happened
after the training did you switch your
job did you get some kind of hike when
you move to a new role did it meet your
objective on that
front yes yes absolutely I I wasn't like
I think I was in two weeks after I
finished this when uh a colleague that I
has worked before in niiki be told me
hey if you finish this training because
I I think I posted it on LinkedIn or
something we're looking for someone that
help us do a migration from ashure to
gcp do you think you can take that over
and
that's I got a position uh it was a
contract for a year to do that to do the
migration and setting the basis for the
new application that the company was was
about to to launch so that was great
and I mean I mentioned that I have
worked for seven to eight years with the
same company then this opportunity comes
up and you know I I I was really
thankful for the company they allow me
to work remotely and everything but I
really wanted to grow in my career and I
feel that I have reached the top that I
could do over there so I took my chances
and take the contract and I basically
double my salary just you know from this
switch Yeah that's a great doubling a
salary is a big achievement through a
six month training program so you made a
very strong point that while you were
going through the training you posted it
about LinkedIn that here is a program
that I'm doing so that opened up
opportunity for you even before you
completed the program so I think that's
a good message that we should give to
our other Learners also that don't wait
for it to get completed just let your
network know because you don't know who
is going to get who is going to notice
and who's going to come
for to you for next opportunity because
generally at simply learn what I see my
team only incentivizing people to share
their completion saying that I
successfully completed but maybe it's a
great idea to talk about the entire
Journey not only the completion so
thanks for sharing that I think we'll
definitely suggest all other Learners
also to do the same not to me George
that while you have done the program you
got the required outcome and all sounds
good are there areas that you'll suggest
for us to improve like you think that if
you add those additional component or
additional areas or programs can be even
more helpful for people who are coming
with that objective what will be some of
those suggestion from your
perspective uh I'm trying to think about
it really hard because I
I I mean I got exactly what I needed
from it uh I seemen
that an area that maybe I would say
there was like some
selective ER
trainings uh within the company that I
didn't get to make
er basically because I didn't know when
those selective would start so a bit of
the improving that communication with
those I get to complete the full course
but the selective I was interested in a
couple of those and
I I didn't know when they started or
when they ended so I L track
also in in simple learn defense I
started working with that company and I
needed to focus on you know getting to H
polish ER my
abilities ER focusing on on what the job
was so I didn't pay too much attention
to see if something like that happened
but I think that something I I could say
say maybe can be improveed the the
communication for those aspect not not
the formal training because I got
everything that I needed I knew the
schedule I knew exactly where everything
was but for the selective I I think I I
lost track of when those started when
those the electric programs that we
offer which is not the Core Curriculum
that the communication better I think
fair point I think we'll make a note and
tell our team that works on that
communication so just now I want to get
to another important point that you that
you that you briefly spoke about which
is layoff so you mentioned something
about layoff but my question is that
right now as we speak we see a lot of
take layoffs happening when some of the
larger companies who who were like kind
of sought after companies that every
techi wanted to work for they are in the
process of optimizing um their Workforce
and in a way it is keeping a lot of
people on a on the fence that should I
really prepare to build a career into
technology when and this technology
Giants are not hiring what will be your
what has been your experience working in
technology looking at other industry
like you have looked at music industry
as an example what would be your message
to anyone who wants to either grow
within the technology uh industry or
wants to make a sift into the technology
industry what would be at this point of
time I would say learn and put in
practice everything that you learn as
fast as you can fail fail fail a lot
fail as fast as you can because uh we
need to fail in order to actually
succeed and made a product that is
successful uh and is the only way that
you get to learn
ER I and the why I say this is because
right now the industry is in a point
where it's requiring from everything
that partic everyone that participates
to have a WI a WI
knowledge of the industry so you don't
only need to know coding in one language
you need to learn how to automatize
testing how to deal with all the
infrastructure changes H how to deal
with so many different areas and is what
is expected right now so you need to you
need to learn it you need to try to
implement it to fail and to keep failing
for a while until you succeed so you can
Master ER different the
different areas that that is needed
right now and that's just the reality of
the of the industry probably the the
same reality in any industry that you
want to succeed right now you need to be
multitasking and show passion for what
you do and put all your hair in need and
people and managers TS to be forgiving
for honest mistakes uh
so just keep try and keep doing it keep
working on it then you will succeed for
sure so you still think that it's a
great industry to come in and build
career right absolutely
abely I'm not I have not seen any te who
is
jobless correct I've seen people from
other sector or other competencies they
struggle to find job for some time but I
have not seen even in the worst of the
time people are getting laid off from
one company and they immediately getting
picked up by another company so to my
message to all the Learners has been
that don't postpone your learning you
never know how fast you can get into
again that market where you five jobs
will start chasing you because
technology is needed right everything is
so powered by technology that you can't
imagine life without technology correct
correct and there is like the goals of
AI show in the face and I don't seem
that's going to catch up in quite a
while um I for example like I seen the
previous company we use copilot to help
us out with coding it was better to
deactivate it and do the code but
yourself because it's it's not there
yet it's getting good but believe me the
human ER mind and or capacity for
engineering is not going to be replaced
anytime soon so it's it's a good option
I I think it's the best time to to take
it
over in my view George I think on the AI
topic my view is that an AI powered
human will be will replace a non AI
powered human AI going to make you more
more like it's like what happened with
computer without computer right for the
longest time there was no computer in
the world but when computer came it did
a lot of job it automated a lot of stuff
so people who knew how to make use of it
they became more successful and they
contined to become more successful now
ai is also a very important topic and
you being a techi we all hear AI is
changing the world and of course it is
changing in very many different ways so
how do you think about upscaling on AI
right are you are you learn going
through YouTube videos or again going to
Meetup what what is your personal AI
strategy that how do you Embrace AI in
your work well right now I'm luy enough
to work for a company that offer me
support in training so we have quite a
wide variety of tools for the trainings
that we are doing in there er um
they barely started the AI programs I
would say about a couple of months
ago so we're starting working on that I
basically tried to put one hour of my
day to dedicate to learning and that's
not only AI is just basically learning
different tools but AI is one of those
tools that I dedicate sometime of the
week to try to
improve so you're doing on the job
learning you're looking at the TOs and
trying to see if it can be useful for
the work right that's that's really
great to know so so George when reflect
back back your journey from growing up
in Venezuela to where you are I think I
see a constant pattern that you are
always questioning the status quo right
you have we doing something and you're
always trying to push yourself to learn
something to do and questioning that
what more I can do and how can I grow
what what can I how can I become I'll
say more successful than what I am today
so keeping the same thing in mind how do
you see your career maybe next two year
five year what is that you're aiming
for um I say I first of all I I like I
like getting my hands dir the in C so I
ER right now
I'm in a tech lead position but I don't
see it as a techly position I'm a
software engineer I like to work out it
and I love to do it one thing that I'm
planning to do and probably something
that I I could do in the future is to
create a a my own company that actually
support uh some other of the industries
I have experienc in ER like I mentioned
I work for eight years on on an industry
that was a hotels and restaurant
industry
um there's a lot of need over there for
companies that support their technology
backbone um and that's still in plans
but it's something that I would like to
achieve so the the entrepreneurship work
that you're doing in Venezuela is was
again coming back to you that now that's
I think once your like day-to-day needs
are met you want to do you want to
question you want to like push yourself
to do more right so that's a again
that's a great common thing that I have
seen in all people who are very very uh
successful so um George looking at you
and your background I wanted also wanted
to hear your views because this is
another area where I see lot of Learners
are not
um decisive so they don't make the
decision so so clearly in their mind
which is a midcareer people you have 15
20 years of experience and you are stuck
in your career you're stuck in doing a
certain kind of job you are not growing
up you're not getting higher
responsibility pay is not increasing
because costs are increasing and the
confidence that I can do some kind of
program that will add skills to me that
can help me fast track my career the
hope is also not there because I think
that their past experience is what
defines them in future what they learn
is not necessarily going to help them
meet their desired goal what will be
your message to
them I think my message would be take a
chance take an opportunity trust in
yourself you you you can make it uh I I
actually delayed a lot uh to take this
this step in my career and I delay it
because I seem probably my experience
with migration and trying to find
something stable and to get it ER you
know to get it my family to be
comfortable enough uh was on and other
part of me was loyalty to the people
that actually gave me that chance and
allow me to to grow with them ER was one
thing but it's important that you invest
in yourself is important that you H take
a deep a deep look into what are your ER
opportunities uh what are your strengths
and what are your weakness and I always
focus on well this is my weakness what
I'm going to do to solve that situation
and there is always going to be a
weakness so I I'm never bored I'm always
trying to strengthen that part of me
that is a weekend at that moment so
trust in yourself um cross that
bridge got no that's a that's a great
point I think you need to trust I agree
there there's nothing guaranteed so
maybe that you do a program and that
does nothing but for sure doing nothing
will lead you nothing but doing opens up
some chances so I think that's a great
point so thank you Jo I think it was
lovely speaking with you I'm sorry that
it had to get delayed a couple of times
so thank you again for taking time 11:00
p.m. there in Georgia so it must be
quite late for you right it's a little
bit late but thank you so much for
having me I really appreciate this
chance to talk to you uh and have the
chance to actually thank you face to
face for uh you know all this that you
are doing I I really appreciate it a lot
thanks Geor
