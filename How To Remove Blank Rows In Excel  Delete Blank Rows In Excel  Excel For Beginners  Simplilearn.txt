hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to eliminate blank rows
in excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to eliminate rows in
excel
now let's get started with the practical
move
now we are on our spreadsheet and you
can see i have some sample data on my
spreadsheet and it does have some
blank rows
now how do i eliminate these blank rows
so one step is you can you know select
the entire row and try to right click
and delete it
again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if i want to select multiple
rows
then i'll be
selecting some rows with data as well
which might be a little troublesome in
the future now let's try to use the
easier way now for that go to the find
and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
ok
now hold ctrl key and press minus key
and you will have an option of deleting
the cells now select the entire row now
we are selecting the entire rows with
blank data and press ok and the cells
will be shifted now this was simple
but let me show you another example
so even here we have some blank rows but
in between those blank rows for example
take cell 17 or cell d17 or row 17 we
have some data testing
and here in the employee id we have some
data in a26
and again in b39 we have some data that
is first name
right in such scenarios how do i
eliminate data
so we have a simple logic for it so all
we need to do is add another row which
is to count the number of cells in the
row
now that can be
count
now here equals to the function is count
a
let's tab
and
the cells will be from
a2
to
g2
press enter now you have 7
so now we are basically calculating the
number of cells so if you apply the same
to the entire
data set
let's drag it
and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the empty columns right
now let's do some formatting if you need
let's try to add filters
ctrl a ctrl t
and now table will have filters and
headers
now here you can see the drop down icon
click on that
now instead of select all what you can
do is select zero
now you will be highlighted with all the
rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is
the same way
control minus
and there you go
now
clear the filter
now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows
so all the rows that had some amount of
data are retrained and all the data or
all the cells or all the rows which do
not have any data which are completely
blank they have been eliminated so
that's how you eliminate blank rows in
excel with that we have come to an end
