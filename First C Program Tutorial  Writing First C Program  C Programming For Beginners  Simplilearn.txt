hey everyone i'm harsanya from simply
learn sting and i welcome you all to
this interesting session on the first c
program
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and
press the bell icon so you'll never miss
any update from simply learn
without further ado let's get started
with the agenda for today's session
as a part of the first c program let us
execute a simple hello world program and
a program to perform arithmetic
operations such as addition subtraction
multiplication and division
so with this let's get started
to run the programs we will use vs code
editor
first let's name the file with dot c
extension
go to file click on save as
and name the file with dot c extension
and to execute 4c program hello world
let's include the header file
hash include
hddio.head
in c programming hash include is used to
direct the compiler to load the header
file in the program
hddio.h is a header file that stands for
standard input output various functions
such as printf scanf are defined in
standard input output header files
next void main
main is a function from which every c
program execution begins and void
specifies that a function does not
return a value
curly braces indicates the body of the
main function that is the start and end
of the statement
inside the main function let us print
hello world
so for that printf function is used to
print the output
printf
hello
and semicolon at the end of the
statement indicates that the current
statement is terminated
now let's save the program ctrl s
and let's run it
as you can see here hello world is
printed successfully
let's try to execute one more program
using arithmetic operators in c to get
hands on with it
so for that let us declare and
initialize variables inside the main
function
that is int
a is equal to 10
comma
b is equal to 10
comma c
you can name the variables and assign
values as per units
now let's perform the addition
operations on variable c and b and store
the result in c
c is equal to a plus b
using printf function let's display the
value for addition operation
printf
a plus p
is equal to percentage d
comma c
whatever is inside the double quotes
will be displayed as an output
and percentage d is the format specifier
used to display the integer value of
variable type int
and backslash n is called an escape
sequence which denotes the newline
character
now let's perform the other arithmetic
operations one by one on the same
variables a and b
c is equal to a minus b
and print a function to print the result
of subtraction
next let's multiply using multiplication
operator
c is equal to a into b
print a function to display the result
of multiplication
and then division
c is equal to a divided by b
let's save the program ctrl s
and run it
the results for automatic operations are
printed successfully
as you can see here a plus b that is 10
plus 10 is equal to 20 next a minus b
that is 10 minus 10 is equal to 0 and
then 10 into 10 is equal to 100 and a
divided by b that is 10 divided by 10 is
equal to 1.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the first c program i
hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time this is
