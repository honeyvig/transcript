hello everyone welcome to simple learn
in today's session we will be learning
about coordinate geometry did you ever
think of Bridging the Gap between shapes
and equations and found yourself
clueless well not anymore buckle up
because simply learn brings you an
interesting tutorial on coordinate
geometry coordinate geometry also known
as cartisian geometry is like a SE map
for this battlefield it lets us
represent geometric shapes using numbers
and algebraic equations pretty cool
right today we'll learn how to set up a
coordinate plane which is basically a
grid system where every Point has a
unique address so are you ready to
become a coordinate geometry Master

welcome to session three coordinate
geometry in this lesson we are going to
explain the fundamentals of coordinate
geometry and its users Define coordinate
plane and coordinates of a point and
coordinate geometry examine the distance
and slope formula used in coordinate
geometry and list list the various
coordinate geometry formulas and their
components introduction to coordinate
geometry coordinate geometry coordinate
geometry is the study of geometric
figures by plotting them on coordinate
axis it is the branch of mathematics
that assist in presenting geometry
figures on a two-dimensional plane and
learn the properties of these figures
figures like straight line curves
circles ellipses hyperbola and polygons
can be easily drawn and presented to
scale in coordinate
AIS it also AIDS in algebraic
computation and study of the geometric
figure attributes using the coordinate
system the starting point of the
coordinate system are 0 degrees of green
witch longitude and 0° of Equator
latitude coordinate plane a cartisian
plane divides the plane space into two
dimensions and is useful for easily
locating the
points it is also referred to as a
coordinate
plane the two axes of the coordinate
plane are horizontal X AIS and vertical
y
AIS these coordinate axis divide the
plane into four quadrants and the point
of intersection of these axis is the
original zero Comm
0 any point in the coordinate plane is
referred to by a point x comma Y where X
and Y values are the position of the
point with reference to x axis and y AIS
respectively coordinate plane
properties the origin Point O is the
intersection of the x axis and the Y
AIS and has coordinates 0 comma 0
the xais to the right and to the left
are positive
xais and negative xais
respectively While y AIS above and
below the origin o are the positive and
negative Y axis
respectively the point presented in this
first quadrant has both X and Y as
positive values
while the point representative in the
second quadrant is a Negative X and a
positive y
value and is plotted with reference to a
Negative X and a positive y
AIS the point present in the third
quadrant that is Nega X and negative Y
is plotted with reference to a Negative
X AIS and a negative y
AIS and the point in the fourth quadrant
is presented as a positive X and a
negative y value and plotted with
reference to a positive X AIS and a
negative y
AIS a coordinate is an address which
helps to locate a point in space
coordinate geometry
formulas coordinate geometry formulas
distance formula the distance formula is
used to calculate distance between two
points which is the length of the line
segment connecting them consider two
points A and B having coordinates as X1
y1 and X2 Y2
respectively to find out the distance
between point a and point
B we can use the formula as Square < TK
of X2 - X1 2 + Y 2 - y1 2 where X2 - X1
is the change in
X or you can say the base of this right
angle
triangle and Y2 minus y1 is the change
in y or the perpendicular distance of
this right angle
triangle to find the distance between
point A and B we need to get the
hypotenuse hence D the slope
formula the slope of a line often known
as its gradient
is a numerical representation of
steepness and the direction of the
line it is the difference between the
change in
X and Y coordinates change in X and
Y it can be calculated by taking any two
consecutive points or by using the angle
that lying on the positive xais
forms which is
this the slope of a vertical line on an
angle Theta with xais
vertical is m equal to tan Theta key
takeaways coordinate geometry is a
discipline of mathematics that studies
geometric figures using the coordinate
system and assist in algebraic
computation the coordinate plane splits
the plane space into two Dimensions by
having two axis that further divide the
plane into four quadrant
with the origin 0 comma 0 being the
point of intersection of these axes the
distance formula is used to find the
distance between any two points in the
coordinate
plane the slope of a line is the
numerical representation of its
steepness and directions the midpoint
formula is used to find a point that is
halfway between two points in a
coordinate
plane we have reached the end of this
