understand what are ads and its purpose
ads short for advertisements are
messages created by companies
organizations or individuals to promote
products services or ideas these
messages are designed to reach a
specific audience and persuade them to
take a particular action such as buying
a product signing up for a service or
supporting a cause ads can be found
anywhere on TV radio website social
media platforms Billboards newspapers
and more the main purpose of ad is to
inform and influence people so here are
some key purposes of ads first awareness
so ads help create awareness about a
product service or idea when a new
product is launched companies use ads to
let people know it exist for example if
a new smartphone is released ads will
inform potential customers about its
features and benefits then comes
interest so ads aim to spark interest in
the target audience by highlighting the
unique selling points and the benefits
ads can make people curious and eager to
learn more the interest can lead to
further research such as visiting a
website or reading
reviews then comes the desire so
effective ads create a desire for the
product or service they appeal to
emotions and show how the product can
solve problems or improve the customer's
life for example a car ad might
emphasize safety features making it
potential buyers feel that owning the
car will protect the
family then comes action so finally ads
encourage people to take action this
action could be making a purchase
signing up for a newsletter or visiting
a store Google ads have clear calls to
actions like buy now sign up today or
visitors so in summary ads are powerful
tools used by businesses to communicate
with their audience they create
awareness generate interest Foster
desire and encourage action
by understanding the purpose of ads we
can better appreciate how they influence
our decisions and behavior in our
everyday's life now with so much of our
time spent online advertising has taken
a new form let's dive into Facebook ads
a powerful tool that leverages the
massive audience of Facebook to reach
people exactly where they scroll we will
explore how Facebook ads work and how
they can be used to Target specific
demographics and achieve your marketing
goal
goals so what is Facebook ads and how it
works so Facebook ads are like online
Billboards that businesses create to
reach people using Facebook and its app
like Instagram and messenger so these
ads can pop up in different sports such
as your news feed where you see post
from Friends stories where shorts
temporary posts are there and the
marketplace where people buy and sell
items so businesses can choose from
different types of ads such as single
images videos carousal with multiple
images or videos slideshows and
collections of items to best fit their
goals like getting you to visit their
website or buy
something so businesses use these ads to
get your attention and encourage you to
do something like visit their website
buy a product or sign up for a service
because Facebook knows a lot about what
you like and do on its platforms it
helps businesses shows ads to the people
most likely to be interested in them
this way if you love Fitness you might
see ads for new workout gear and if
you're into cooking you might see ads
for the kitchen gadgets it's a way of
business to put their messages right
where you likely to see them while you
are spending time online making it easy
for you to discover and learn about the
new products and services that might
interest
you all right let's understand how
Facebook ads work so first targeting so
one of the standout features of Facebook
ads is their Advanced targeting
capabilities you can Define your
audience based on a wide range of
criteria such as demographics that is
age gender education level or job title
then location that is Target users in
specific cities regions or countries
then there is interest interest like
Hobbies favorite activities and interest
example sports music then comes the
behavior in Behavior there is purchase
Behavior device usage and other user
activities so this precise targeting
ensures that your ads are shown to the
people who are most likely to be
interested in your product or service
maximizing the efficiency of your ad
spent then comes ad creation so creating
a Facebook ad involves designing the ad
content and selecting the format here
are some tips for Effective ad
Creations that is visuals use high
quality images or videos that capture
attention then message craft a clear and
compelling message that highlights the
benefits of your product or service then
there is call to action that is CTA
include a strong CTA like shop now sign
up or learn more to guide users on what
to do next then come next that is budget
and bidding so you set a budget for your
ad Campaign which can either be a daily
budget or how much you want to spend per
day or a lifetime budget that is the
total amount you want to spend over the
duration of the campaign so Facebook
uses a bidding system where you bid on
how much you are willing to pay for your
ad to be shown to your target audience
the platform that works to get the best
results within your budget so it works
like that then comes the ad placement so
you can choose where you want to put
your ads to appear so Facebook offers
automatic placements where it optimizes
your ad delivery across all its
platforms
that is Facebook Instagram messenger
Audience Network or you can manually
select specific
placements so basically this ad
placement things works like that then
comes the performance
tracking so Facebook provides detailed
analytics and insights into how your ads
are performing you can track metrics
such as like Impressions how many times
your ad was shown then clicks how many
times people clicked on your ad then
conversions actions Takens by users
after seeing your ad then cost per
action that is CPA the average cost of a
desired action this data helps you
understand what's working and what is
not working allowing you to make
informed decisions about your ad
campaigns then comes the
optimization So based on performance
data you can make adjustments to improve
your ads this might include tweaking
your targeting criteria changing your ad
creative or adjusting your budget
continuous optimization is key to
maximize the effectiveness of your ads
and achieving the best return on
investment that is Roi all right now
let's understand this with the help of a
demo example all right so this is
basically the structure of Facebook ads
we have gone to the campaign and yeah
let me explain to you guys what all
things are there so first of all we have
this campaign tab so this section list
all of your ad campaigns then we have
this create Button as we can see so if
you click on this you basically click on
this to create a new campaign then there
is campaign list as you can see so this
uh shows the campaigns you have created
with columns for and as you can see
there is on and off toggle button is
there so this toggle is used to enable
or disable a campaign basically so this
is why it is used and this campaign
names that you have created you can name
your campaign as per your choice
then there is delivery status as we can
see so status of the campaign example
indraft or Etc is the delivery status
basically you can check that then comes
the bid strategy as we can see so uh it
basically tells us what bidding strategy
we have used and then comes the budget
as we can see so this budget is the this
is basically the budget settings for the
campaign that you have put and then
there is attribute setting attribution
setting is uh how conversions are
attributed so results reach Etc it
basically tells us performance matrics
of each campaign all right so this is
basically the structure now we'll click
on this to create a campaign create on
click on create as we can
see these all uh metrics are there
awareness this is basically an objective
so you can decide the objective and if
here we'll see this is account inform
needed so you can link your account to
it then here we can see buying type
basically uh this is a method used to
bid for ad placements uh auction as we
can see auction here basically means
your ads compare with others for
placement based on your bid relevance so
it's like that now comes the uh campaign
objective so uh the purpose uh basically
of uh first we can see here is uh
awareness
so for the awareness its purpose is to
make people aware of your brand or
product it is used best for new
businesses or products that need to
build recognition as you can see here it
is written as
well brand awareness so then comes the
traffic so uh the purpose of traffic is
to drive visitors to your website or app
and the uses basically it is used for it
works great for increasing website
visitors or getting people to download
your app so increasing the traffic
basically it helps all right then comes
the another one that is the engagement
so the purpose of Engagement is to get
people to engage with your content like
comments likes and shares and its use is
it's basically ideal for increasing
interactions with your post or growing
your page followers if you want to do
that that you can go for engagement next
is as we can see leads so the purpose of
leads is to collect contact information
from potential
customers
so it is used by those who wants to get
the information from their customers and
then put the mails or generate some data
or just give some promotions to those
particular
individuals and its uses it's basically
useful for generating email signups form
submissions or you can say gathering
information about potential
customers then comes the ad promotions
as we can see so purpose of AD
promotions is to get more people to
install and use your app so its use is
it is more focused on increasing app
downloads and user activity within the
app all right now there is sales so as
you can see so in sales its purpose is
to increase sales of your product or
Services as simple as that and its use
is it is basically it basically targets
people who are likely to purchase your
product aiming to boost your Revenue so
each objective helps you focus your
advertisement efforts on the specific
business goals ensuring your campaign is
aligned with what you want to achieve so
you can select among these objectives as
per your choice so in basically uh
Facebook ads there are two ways to buy
ads as you can see auction and
reservation so basically uh for auction
you compete with other advertisers by
bidding for ad spots so for this price
change based on the competition giving
the flexibility but not guaranteed costs
then other one is reservation so you pay
in reservations you basically pay a
fixed price for guaranteed AD Sports
making it predictable and stable it is
ideal for big
campaigns all right
so in my suggestion you must always
start with the awareness campaign so we
click on
continue all right so the new layout for
you guys as you can
see so here as you can see this is the
new awareness campaign so this is the
main folder for your campaign inside the
basically inside this folder you can
have your ad sets and ads all right now
then there is new awareness ad set as we
can see so this is a subgroup within the
campaign here you define your target
audience budget and schedule then comes
the new awareness ad so this is the
actual advertisement that people will
see so you must have the image carousal
or video ad before doing all these
things so you must have your ad in hand
because you have to do all the things
here then you have to add or upload the
ad basically all right now so I've told
you about all these three now comes the
main area that is the campaign name so
basically this is the campaign name you
can select your own campaign name and
you can name your campaign here for
example it's named like new awareness
campaign but you can change it and make
it any campaign name like that so as per
your choice then there is special ad
categories as we can see so uh the
purpose of special ad categories here is
this section is where you clear if your
ad belongs to special categories like
credit employment housing social issues
elections or politics so these
categories have specific rules because
they are selective topics all right so
uh the benefits are basically declaring
your ad category helps ensure your ad
follows Facebook rules preventing it
from being rejected so this is what
special ad categories is so basically
this all layout lets you set up the
basic details of your campaign now let's
understand about each one of them let's
first name this one as any random name
we'll name
it uh K
joggers anime
jogers so this is the template name
according to me let's
add campaign as
well all right now you can keep the rest
as it is is like you don't have to
change anything else like you can change
the uh objective over here if you want
to again uh we can leave AB test in this
as well and we can just click on
next all
right so as we can see this is the new
layout for you
guys all right so this is new awareness
ad sets and this is ADD set name so this
is where you can name your adset
basically uh let's name it
anime
joggers add
set one all right so uh like you can
name as per your choice the purpose
basically this is where your uh name you
put the name of your adset and uh you
can create a template to reuse the
settings for future headsets as you can
see create template if you want to
create create a template to reuse the
settings for future then you can do this
all right now here is as we can see uh
performance goal underwareness so this
is where you set what you want to
achieve with this adset here it's set to
maximiz the reach of ads meaning you
want as many people as possible to see
your ad so it is pretty simple as well
as we can see here we have they have
written in maximiz reach of ads we try
to show your ads to as many people as
possible then maximize number of
Impressions we'll try to show your ads
to people as many times as possible okay
so uh they can show people number of
times many times to a single person also
they can show all right then there is
maximize ad recall Li so we'll try to
show your ads to people who are likely
to remember seeing them all right so you
can select this as per your choice it's
your own choice uh you can select so
that is be like this only for me
maximize reach of ads then comes the uh
under Facebook page as we can see here
we have uh it is written demo so here uh
you select the Facebook page that the
ads will be associated with so in this
case it's set to demo one that I named
my page for the video purpose I've I've
created a page like demo one so it is
naming that so if you have more page
like more than one page then you can
select from here all right uh after that
there is as we can see cost per result
cool as we can see all right so this is
optional yeah so here you can uh
basically uh set the target cost for
achieving your desired result for
example how much you are willing to
spend for every thousand people who see
your at this helps control your spending
all right
now there is budget and schedule so here
is daily budget so uh you set how much
money you want to spend per day on your
ad here it's set for 200 per day and
this means Facebook will try to spend
200 rupees each day to show your ad to
people the maximum amount it might spend
in a day is 250 uh and the maximum
weekly spend is 1,400 you can change as
per your choice and then there is what
we call schedule here you can see so uh
the date and the time when your ad
campaigns will start here it set to 11
June 2024 so you can CH you can change
it as we can see uh this is the date
that it is not selecting you can select
14 now it is not showing the error so
yeah so uh the date and time is when
your campaign will start here it's set
to like 14 June and the time is also
mentioned and the end date as you can
see set an end date you can click on it
you can choose to set an end end date of
your campaign meaning uh when it will
stop running all right now as you can
see budget and scheduling here you can
see so it allows you to schedule when
you want your budget to increase during
specific times like holidays or special
sales period so this feature helps you
allocate more money to your ad during
times when you expect high traffic or
sales optimizing your spending then
there is AD scheduling as we can see so
the purpose determines then your ads
will be shown here it sets to run ads
all the time so it's like that you can
choose to run your ads continuously or
only at certain times of the day all
right now there is audience controls as
we can see so it allows basically uh to
set criteria for where your ads should
be
shown so you can specify the locations
demographics and other details about who
should see your ads uh and here as we
can see the location is set to India you
can edit it as well as per your choice
so yeah we have set it to India you can
search for locations browse it the map
will open and like that then uh
Advantage Plus audience as we can see so
Facebook's technology automatically find
the best audience for your ad if you
provide an audience suggestion Facebook
will prioritize showing your ad to
people matching that profile before
expanding to others you can save the
audience for future use
all right now coming to the placement
thing as you can see advantages plus
placements so here it lets Facebook
decide where to place your ads for the
best performance so Facebook system will
automatically place your ads across
different placements like Facebook
Instagram Etc based on where they are
likely to perform the best this helps
optimize your ad performance without you
having to manually select the
placements all right now let's try to
move on to new awareness
ad let's understand
it so here as you can see ad name here
you can give the name to your ad example
we'll
give anime
jles add
one all right so you can name your ad
over here then there is create template
again you can create a template to reuse
the settings for future ads so here we
can see the partnership ad so it allows
you to run ads with other brands or
businesses featuring both identities in
the ad uh this is useful if you want to
collaborate with other companies or
creators then under identity we can see
uh the name of our page that is demo one
so Facebook page basically uh over here
it selects the Facebook page that the ad
will represent our page name is demo one
so that is why it is showing demo one
this ensures this ad is lined to correct
business page all right now as we can
see uh Instagram account you can see uh
and AD setup is also there all right so
uh choose the Instagram account to
associate with the ad like you can
select your business profile on the
Instagram ad uh with it and you can
either use your Facebook page or connect
with a different Instagram account then
there is AD setup as we can see create
ad so choose to create a new ad all
right so uh select the structure of your
ad like single image or video one that
is one image or video carousal that is
the multiple images or videos that
people can swipe through then there is
collection that means a group of items
that open into a full screen experience
so it's like
that all right now after that there is
uh you can see add creative so uh it's
selects the media that is the images or
videos and texts for your ad then the
media placements are there as we can see
these are the media placements meats and
streams stories and reads Facebook
search results so uh choose where your
ad will appear either it's feeds stories
or search results you can also you have
the option to add music to your ad
depending on the Play Store so as you
can see add music so you can select
among these all right then there is uh
what we call primary text and even
details as you can see primy text so uh
the main text that appears in your ad
you should put it over here and uh this
text is what people will read when they
see your ad basically it is recommended
to keep it under 125
characters all right now event details
talking about the event details so uh
include the details about an event such
as the name date and time uh this helps
promote events and allows people to get
reminders all right then there is
languages and tracking this is the
language so uh language basically add
translations to reach people in more
languages this helps uh make I repeat so
this helps make your ad accessible to a
wider audience by providing it in
multiple
languages then comes the tracking all
right so as we can see tracking over

action of people take after seeing your
ad and type of events basically website

website then app events action people
take in your app then offline events
