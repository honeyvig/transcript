now dax in excel is a sophisticated
formulas type language that comes in
handy while working with relational data
and extracting information via dynamic
aggregation functions dax in excel
stands for data analysis expressions
dax functions are completely familiar to
the general and default functions that
are available in excel
now tax allows users to perform slightly
escalated and advanced and custom
calculations upon various data types
like character data date time time
intelligence functions and many more and
in tax there are a variety of functions
such as backstable valued functions bax
filter functions dags aggregation
functions time intelligence functions
date and time information time logical
parent and many more
now in today's session we will look into
one such type of tax function in excel
that is dax date and time function in
excel
now without further ado let's get into
practical mode
and we have started a microsoft excel
inside excel we have opened a new blank
worksheet now navigate to data option in
the toolbar and in that go to
the powerpivot window
now we have entered the powerpivot
window and inside that you can see the
option of get external data click on
that and you can see a variety of
options that is you can get the external
data from a database you can get from
web servers that is from
data service and you have also other
forms of data sources and existing
connections for now we will take other
forms of data that is a microsoft excel
data which is in our local system
select next now provide the location of
your folder just browse
and we will select dax employee data
open
and there you go we have our data
connected to our power period window
click on next
and there you go you have the selected
table and views click finish and you can
see the data getting imported into your
powerpivot window
there you go by default if you want to
add any tax related functions into your
powerpoint window you'll have an
external added column over here which
looks something like this if there is
not an external column you can also add
the column it's not a big trouble now we
have some data here that is the employee
id employee name designation of the
employee department of the employee
salary
and joining date etc
let's expand this view and see what's in
what's more in it
so this column is the date of birth and
this column is the employee joining date
right now we have so much of data now
let us imagine that we want to calculate
the retirement age of all the employees
so now let's rename the column to
retirement
date
so we have our new column that is
retirement date now we will make use of
dax date time functions to calculate the
age and find out the exact retirement
date of that particular employee so let
us imagine that every employee will
retire after the age of 65 so we have
our date of birth of every employee and
the joining date of every employee now
we'll come up with a tax detent time
function and calculate the age and then
we will find the retirement date of that
employee
now every tax function starts with the
same method or the same way as the
simple excel default method starts that
is by starting with an equals two and
then
we will find e data
e date
and
and now our first parameter that is the
start date that is the employee uh
the date where the employer joined the
organization so our sheet name is sheet1
now our joining date is in the f7 column
select f7
press tab to select it and comma
now how many months so each and every
year will have 12 months so 12 months
into the age that is 65 star 65 and now
you can close the uh function and press
enter and then you will find the
retirement date of that particular
employee
so there you go so we have the employee
date that is employee retirement date
for all the employees so the first one
that is jack has the retirement date of
19 february 2085
and similarly jennifer has her
retirement date at 15th of august 2084.
so that's how we use the dax functions
in excel so this is one of the several
dax functions in excel that is dax date
and time functions in excel now with
that we have come to an end of this
