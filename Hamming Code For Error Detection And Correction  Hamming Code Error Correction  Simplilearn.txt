with the increasing data transmission
and exchange between multiple network
devices for information purposes the
probability of an error or damage
occurring to the original datab bit is
highly possible to overcome this
situation we use certain networking
techniques to detect and correct the
damage to the data one of which we'll be
discussing in today's
session hi guys and welcome to yet
another interesting video by simply
learn but before we begin if you are
watching Tech videos subscribe to our
Channel and hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update from us now without
further Ado let's take a look at the
agenda for today's
session to begin with we will look into
what is Hamming
Cod then we will look into terms related
to the humming
code and in the end we will look at a
working exam example of Hamming
code let's
begin the haming code method is a
network technique that is designed to
detect errors and corrects datab belits
which are transmitted during data
exchange it was first implemented by RW
Hamming hence the name Hamming
code this network technique is
implemented because during data
transmission there are often cases where
data loss or data damage occurs to
recover or detect the damage in the
original data we use Hamming
cod in the next slide we will look into
some terms that are related to the
working of Hamming cord the first one
being redundant
bits these are the extra binary bits
that are added explicitly to the
original datab bit to prevent damage to
the transmitted data and also to recover
the original data in case of a damage at
the receiver
end in the next point we will look into
some formula related to redundant fits
and how to add them in the Hamming
code the formula related to redundant
widths is 2 R more than equal to m l r +
1 where M refers to the datab bits in
the data and R refers to the Redundant
bits let's take an
example in case m is equal to 4 that
means the data bits used are four we
need to find the value of R using the
above formula let's deduce the value of
redundant
bits 2 R is more than equal to 4 + r + 1
2 ^ R is more than equal to r + 5 so so
using this let's use r equal to 0 if we
use that we will get a value 1 that is
more than equal to r + 5 but that is
wrong then using r equal to 3 that is 8
is more than equal to
8 this way we conclude that the Hamming
code would be 7 bit data because the
value of R is 3 and M is 4
now let's move on to the next term
related to Hamming code that is par bits
the par bit is the method to append
binary bits to secure that the total
number of counts of one in the original
data is either even number or an odd
number let's take a look why do we
exactly use parity bits they are used to
detect error in the original data which
occurs during the transmission of data
through this method we can detect the
error at the receiver end and also
correct
it let's take a look at different types
of parity bits
available first one is even parity bit
in this case of parity type the total
number of ones counted is to be even in
the
count in case the count is odd then the
value of parity is one
otherwise the value should be
zero similarly the other parity bit is
known as odd parity bit for this par bit
the total number of ones counted in the
original data should be
odd if that is the case the value of
parity bit should be zero and in case
the value of once in the original data
comes out to be odd then the parity
value would be one
now let's move on to the next setting
that is the working example of the
Hamming code let's take a
look let's begin with the steps to be
followed to solve a Hamming Cod
issue the first point being the position
of the parity WID is determined using 2
to the^ n term where n represents the
number series 0 to n assigning the
position for parity bit using this
method would be more clear during an
example for the second point we have the
remaining positions represents the datab
bit now let's try using the value of
parity bit for n is equal to 0 that
means 2 to the^ 0 is equal to 1 so all
the bits with one in the last position
are used to determine the
value of the parity bit to better
understand the assignment value of par
bit please focus on this mentioned
table in this table we can take a look
at the last position that is n is equal
to0 and see the mentioned
number for P1 we can use a value 1
because n is equal to Z and the last
position value is 1 then is number three
because the last position bit is one
then and similarly for number five
because n is equal to 0 and the bit
value is
1 so these three parity value can be
used for n is equal
to0 similarly let's take a look when the
N is equal to 1 that means 2 ^ 1 is
equal to 2 so all the bits with one in
the second position are used to
determine the value of par
bit now let's take a look at the table
to identif ify the numbers related to
this parity bit value the first one
being two due to the presence of one bit
in the second position then we have P3
presence of one bit in the second
position similarly the next would be
number six due to the presence of one
bit in the second
position similarly let's take a look at
when n is equal to 2 that means 2 to
the^ 2 is equal to 4 so all the bits
with one in the third position are used
to determine the value of parity
bit and this would be four five and six
number please read the points very
carefully because next we will solve an
example to better clarify all the
concepts let's move
on the given example is the datab bit to
be transmitted is
1011 and we have to solve this using the
Hamming code method so the first step
would be applying the Hamming code
method and identify the given number of
data bits that would be four according
to the question so the number of parity
bit would be three where the value would
be 1 2 and four according to the part of
P
expression that means we will get
something similar to this this
representation is in datab bits
format where the first position is for
P1 parity bit the second for 2 to the
power 1 that is 2 P2 and the third one
is for 2 to the^ 4 that is P4
parity and let's put the value that is
to be transmitted in the remaining
positions that would be P1 P2 1 P4 1 0
and
1 using this bit value we will deduce
the value of P1 P2 and P4 for data
transmission in this case we are using
even parity for the example that means
the number of ones should be
even let's take a look for P1 we have D1
D3 D5 and
D7 as mentioned in the earlier
slide so the value would be P1 comma 1
comma 1 and comma 1 according to the
datab bits Available To Us by the
question that means the value would be
one because the number of ones for P1 is
odd so to make it even the value of P1
would be one
similarly for P2 we have D2 D3 D6 and
D7 using the same method we will
get P2 1 0 1 so the number of ones for
P2 is even so the P2 value would be
zero next is for P4 the value is D4 D5
D6 and
D7 where P4 4 has 1 0 and 1 that means
the number of ones is even so again P4
is equal to
0 now using this we get the new bit that
is to be
transmitted that is 1 1 0 1
01 after Transmission in case let's say
at position five an error Ur and the
value of one is converted to
zero to detect this error at the
receiver side we will use the Hamming
code to begin with we will use the
parity value to cross check the original
data bit that means let's do the parity
bit method for this received data so for
P1 we have D1 D3 D5 and D7 so the number
of ones is odd that means the value of
P1 should be one to make it even then
for P2 we have D2
D3 D6 and
D7 so the number of ones is even that
means the P2 value would be zero now
let's move on for
P4 that would be 4 D5 D6 and D7 number
of ones is one that means odd so the
value of P4 would be
one now let's take a look at the results
that we obtained using this
method foremost this shows that the data
transmitted is damaged and we can detect
the error position using this method
that is using the value of parity BDS
obtained where this will lead to 2 to
the power expression that means 2 ^ 0 +
0 + 2 ^ 2 that means
five that matches with the Assumption we
took now to correct this error we can
use the position that we obtained that
is five and replace the zero value with
one
bit by doing this we will obtain the
original
data with this we have completed all the
topics to understand the hemming code
method if you have any questions
