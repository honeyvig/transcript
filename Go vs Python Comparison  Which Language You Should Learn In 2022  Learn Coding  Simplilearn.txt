everyone
welcome to this video tutorial on golang
vs python by simply learn in this
session
we will go through a brief introduction
to both the languages golang and python
after knowing both the languages we will
compare them on various parameters
further we will discuss disadvantages of
both the languages so hey everyone i am
abhisar auja from simply learn and
welcome to this video on golang versus
python but before we begin if you love
watching tech videos subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never

now we will look into what is co-link
go also known as golang is an open
source programming language developed by
google co-programming language was born
due to the complexity of managing the
infrastructure and code bases within
google
go was designed by robert grissmer rope
pike and ken thompson
it is a statically typed compiled
language
not only that
go supports concurrent programming that
is it allows running multiple processes
simultaneously
this is achieved using channels go
routines etc
and moreover you can run your first code
without any setup on the playground
provided at golang.org
now let's get an introduction about what
is python
python
it is a popular in-demand general
purpose programming language with
straightforward syntax
python was developed by guido van rossum
in 1989
and was released in 1991
python's name was taken from the popular
bbc comedy show
monty python's flying circus
now
we are familiar with both the languages
let's get down to comparing them
we will compare both the languages on
various parameters
firstly we will compare on the parameter
paradigm
go is a multi-paradigm programming
language it is procedural functional and
concurrent language
whereas python supports four main
programming paradigms that is imperative
functional procedural and object
oriented
let's compare the two on the topic of
performance
when we talk about performance go is
fast the performance is similar to that
of java or c
go is 40 times faster than python
to have a check we will compare the
performance of the languages by solving
three complex problems that is the
mandelbrot equation and body problem and
binary
it is to evaluate memory usage and time
spent to solve the problem
we have chosen these three problems as
they are considered the best way to test
the memory management and performance of
the language
here you can see the stats of both the
languages
you can see that co lang takes 6.23
seconds and uses 30 108 units of memory
whereas the python takes 253
point 19 seconds
and 60
410 units of memory to solve the
mandelbrot problem
binary tree problem go takes
29.02 seconds and uses 4 lakh 98
160 units of memory
whereas the python takes
79.03 seconds and uses 4 lakh 47
324 units of memory to solve the problem
for n-body problem go takes 23.5 seconds
and uses
1641 units of memory
whereas the python takes 765.3
seconds
and uses
7944 units of memory to solve this
problem
this clearly shows
that golang has outperformed python when
it comes to performance let's compare
the two on the topic of scalability
the whole purpose of developing golang
was scalability
this is why golang has
inbuilt support for concurrent process
channeling that is concurrency
on the other hand python has a hard time
with concurrency but it can execute
parallelism through threats
let's understand the concept of
concurrency and parallelism
concurrency means that an application
runs more than one task simultaneously
but only one upfront and rest in the
background if the computer possesses one
cpu
the application may not progress on
multiple tasks simultaneously but more
than one task is processed inside the
application
it does not finish one task before it
begins the next
you can see the plot of concurrency here
here different tasks are running but
only one is running at the front and
others are running in the background
now we move to parallelism
parallelism means that an application
runs its task into smaller tasks
that can be processed in parallel that
is on multiple cpu simultaneously
let's see an example of a team of
technicians building a monitor
concurrency allows multiple technicians
building different parts of the monitor
but they share one common workbench for
assembling the parts
only one technician can assemble at the
workbench at a time and other
technicians operate on their parts in
the background
with parallelism
you can have multiple workbenches
where technicians can be building parts
simultaneously
so it's obvious that a language has
support for concurrency it is perfect
for big and scalable programs
let's move ahead and compare these two
languages based on their applications
golang is mostly used for systems
programming
due to its inherent support for
concurrency golang has also found ample
use and acceptance in cloud computing
and cluster computing
golang has also seen a lot of
recognition
and use in artificial intelligence and
data science
due to its powerful and easy to use
libraries go can set up a web server in
a matter of seconds
go is also used in microcontroller
programming robotics and games
on the other hand python is widely used
in web development data analytics
artificial intelligence and deep
learning
this can be mostly accredited to the
insane libraries available in python
that make the life in the set fields a
lot easier
let's compare the two on the topic of
execution
now let's understand how go and python
are executed
golang is a statically typed language
whereas python is a dynamically typed
language both python and golang use
interpreter and compiler respectively
now we will understand what is
statically typed language and
dynamically typed language
in a statically typed language variable
types are declared explicitly for the
compiler so that even trivial bugs are
caught easily
whereas in a dynamically typed language
the interpreter implements type
inference hence some bugs may remain
because the interpreter interprets
something incorrectly
it implies that python a dynamically
typed language limits the programmer
when he intends to build a really big
program at the same time go can handle
both types of programs
let's get on to the libraries in both
the languages
in golank you would have to write your
code to search through data tables
and if you want to implement machine
learning it would be a huge short to
develop in go but this doesn't mean
golem falls short in any terms while
developing go google choose the most
important libraries as a part of their
inbuilt co-libraries
we can see here that gom library
it helps in converting data between
incompatible type systems we can see
another library that is cli
it was developed for building command
line apps for go
gokut
it is github's popular library for go
related microservices
authorization boards
it is an easy way to implement
authentication and authorization in your
web systems
while the number may not be as
boisterous as pythons the covered usage
fields are almost identical
they have built-in libraries for web
development database handling concurrent
programming and encryption
yes python is almost 16 years older than
go
which results in much larger community
and online support
the python libraries in particular are
vast exploring data tables can be easily
done with pandas and machine learning is
simple with tensorflow and pytorch
this type of support can get anyone
writing code from the day one now let's
get to the next point of comparison that
is readability
while developing software you will
generally work as a team with tens or
even hundreds of other developers at
such time code readability is the major
factor to consider
golang has strict programming rules it
doesn't allow unnecessary variables to
be defined or unnecessary libraries to
be imported
this implies a definite way to perform a
task leading to a better understanding
of code while working in a team
golem syntax is not friendly to
beginners but it's not as unforgiving as
c or c plus plus
on the other hand
python sure has fantastic readability
but there are probably 10 different ways
to say the same thing in python
which mostly leads to confusion whenever
the script is big while working in a
team
so we can see a simple example of
finding two numbers that is 7 and 9 in
both the languages
in golang there's a definite way to
write a code whereas in python you can
write in different forms but the
readability is really fantastic
now we will consider memory management
as a next comparison
olen provides with great memory
management whereas python offers no
memory management
which comes in handy while running the
complex problems which we have seen
above while comparing performances
that's it for this comparison for now
now we will look into few drawbacks of
go language
firstly it is not a generic language
till now go does not have any generic
support
this is due to the repetition of codes
for the same type of operations but with
different data types moreover some data
structures cannot be implemented due to
lack of generic support
next is fewer libraries and frameworks
there are no major frameworks for
goal-link developers
other languages such as ruby has ruby on
rails python has django and php has
larval
the next drawback is it is still in the
development stage
being in the development stage golem
developers are finding it hard to make
out of its libraries in case of doubt
there isn't much assistance through the
go community or online support
we have looked upon the drawbacks of go
language now we will look into the
drawbacks of python language
here you can see that it is weak in
mobile computing hence it is not used in
app development
the python uses the underdeveloped and
primitive database access layer
you can also see that there's a absence
of commercial support for python
and as python is dynamic language it
shows more errors at runtime
with that we have come to the end of
