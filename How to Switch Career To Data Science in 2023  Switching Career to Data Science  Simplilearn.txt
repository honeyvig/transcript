data science has become an indispensable
part of every industry today now whether
it is technology marketing Finance
health care and gaming or even other
sectors like manufacturing Logistics
retail pharmaceutical Aviation education
Etc data science is being leveraged to
make informed decision in other words
you can say they are driven decisions
and Achieve goals to gain invaluable
sites from complex data sets so firstly
let us understand what data Sciences
data Sciences are interdisciplinary
field that combines statistics
mathematics programming and domain
knowledge to extract meaningful insights
from large and complex data sets to
drive decision making and solve complex
problems it involves collecting cleaning
analyzing and interpreting data to
uncover patterns make predictions and
information decision making processes
now let us understand what is the need
for data science now data science is
essential for businesses and
organizations to unlock the value of
Data Drive Innovation make data driven
decisions right and gain a competitive
advantage in today's Adidas economy now
let us take an example here consider
Airlines which is an area where data
science contributes in a big major way
now we know flights get delayed due to
weather conditions because the weather
is not predicted in time and the demand
of passengers is not probably seen ahead
of time for all these unique data
science now they could be improper route
planning and some customers might miss
some flights that Akin needs data
science right similarly it could be due
to incorrect decisions in selecting the
right equipment so which plane they
should fly in which route that's the
equipment is being mentioned here if
it's not planned properly you might end
up in a situation where plane is not
available and similarly choosing an
incorrect flight might lead to unplanned
delays and cancellation now the list
goes on and on and on so if you use data
science properly all of these or let's
say most of these problems can be
avoided and that will be help in
reducing pain for both the Airlines and
also for the passengers now we can do
better route planning so that there are
less cancellations and less frustrated
people now we can also use Predictive
Analytics and predict any delays that
there are so that some of them can be
rescheduled ahead of time and there are
no last minute hassles as well now data
science can also be used to make
promotional offers and the last but not
the least is what kind of plane should
be used or different patches of pains
that should be used in different routes
for better performance and many more so
I hope you understood why we need data
science with this example so this is
what data science equips you with so
this is what you can do with data
science right by asking the right
questions and exploring the data set and
modeling that data using various
algorithm in order to make a proper
insights from the data and communicating
with the data and finally visualizing
the data into a proper manner let us now
move ahead and see what does a data
scientist or a role of a data science
requires now a data scientist is a
professional who uses their expertise
and statistics programming and domain
knowledge to analyze and interpret
complex data sets they collect clean and
pre-process data apply Advanced
statistical techniques and machine
learning algorithms to identify patterns
extract insights and make data driven
decisions now data scientists also
develop predictive models perform data
visualization and communicate findings
to stakeholder so if you look at the
flowchart here we have a data that is
being taken from The Real World which is
the raw data which is being processed
and analyzed and which is in turned
developed into a meaningful data in
order to derive insights from it so they
work closely with cross-functional teams
let's say including software Engineers
business analysts to understand the
objectives you know Define problems and
propose data driven Solutions
additionally data scientists may be
involved in designing experiments
conducting testing and continuously
improving the data model and the
methodologies to enhance data analysis
and decision making process so now comes
the main question right how to
transition your career into data science
or how to switch your career to data
science field well don't worry we have
