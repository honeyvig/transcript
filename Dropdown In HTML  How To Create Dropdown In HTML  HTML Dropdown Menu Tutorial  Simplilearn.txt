hello everyone welcome to this tutorial
on drop down menu in html by simply
learn
in this tutorial we are going to learn
how you can create a drop down in your
navbars using just html and css
so without further ado let's get started
so we are on our sublime text editor i
have the dot html and dot css file ready
so let's start by adding the standard
boilerplate
let's give it a title
link your css file to the html file
now inside the body i'll add the ul's
we have added this hash so that when you
click on this home button it won't
redirect you to anywhere
so just save the file
and we'll go back to our page
so you can see we have this home here
okay so let's add some more
so just copy paste this
and we'll name this section about
now inside this about i'll require some
submenus
so inside this i'll open another ul tag
we'll add sections such as steam
clients
career and legacy
and we'll close the allie tag here
okay now save the file and go back here
and refresh
now we'll add some more
so
here
we'll add the li for contact
okay so inside this contacts i'll add
the sub menus
so well
and i'll
copy this code and i'll edit it here
okay so inside the contacts i'll need
email
phone
let's click
twitter and this will be my linkedin
okay
now we'll add some more sections
name the services
and this one will be my news
okay
so this looks fine
a little bit of alignment
yeah
so you can see
we have this home about contact services
and news and inside this we have the
submenus
okay we forget to
add here
hash inside these pictures
just mention hash
everywhere
okay save the file
go back and refresh
okay
so you can see we have this html ready
now let's go back to the css and design
these
drop downs
so first inside our html
select the body tag
we'll add one background image so just
the background looks
more
attractive
so i have an image file saved so i'll
jpg so save
go back
and refresh
yeah you can see we have this black
thing uh we'll shrink this image
so we'll keep the background size to
cover
and we'll keep the font family to arial
yeah okay
so for the ul tag
we'll keep the margin to zero
we'll keep the padding to zero as well
and we'll set the list style to none
okay now
we'll design the url li part
so we'll keep the float to left
width will set to 200 pixels
we will set the height to say 40 pixels
um we keep the background color
[Music]
to something darker say
keep it dark grey
keep the opacity to 0.9
line height 40 pixels
keep the text aligned to center
and font size to
20 pixels
save the file go back and refresh
okay you see we have the background
image in the place we have this snap bar
in the place
and all the drop downs are here
okay
now it's time to design ul
li and k
so for this we'll keep the text
decoration to none
color let's keep white
and we'll set the display to block
save the file and go back
now we'll add the whole effects for this
drop downs
okay
so ul
ally
a.4
will keep the background color
for the hover
to say
anything you can circulate select light
silently
save
let's see how it looks on the page
refresh
yeah it's look good
now the final part of this requires this
to shrink inside just when you hover
over this so the drop downs will appear
okay
so we'll set this ulli
li 2
display none
and we'll add the hover effect over li
so that when we hover the drop down
appears
save
go back and refresh now you can see all
the drop downs are
inside
this
when you hover over it and the drop
downs appear
okay
