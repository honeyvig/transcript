ERS YouTube channel in today's article
we will discuss how to create more cups
in figma and some helpful hints for
making the most of this powerful tool
the use of more cups which enables
designers to check out their concept and
receive feedback early in the
development process is essential in the
design process and figma is an excellent
tool for generating more cups since it
gives you a lot of customizing choices
and capabilities
so without any further delay let's move
ahead for our session but before we
start if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel then click on the Subscribe
button and hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update from Simply enough
to create more cups in figma
in today's session we will see what more
cups are moving forward we will see how
to create mockups in figma
what are mookups now let's discuss what
more cuts are and proceed further for
the same
workouts are merely designed that
represent how a service or product will
seem in the future
anything from websites and mobile
applications to the basic thing like
packaging may use them before devoting
excessive time and money to a particular
design mockups allow designers to test
their ideas quickly additionally they
allow designers to gather early clients
or other stakeholders commands which can
assist in enhancing the finished product
we will see how to create more cups in
figma
figma is an excellent tool for
generating more cups since it gives you
a lot of customizing choices and
capabilities create a new file in figma
and choose the mockup template from the
list of available templates to start
creating mockups you can create more
cups in figma by accessing hundreds of
Premium artboard Studio mockups
component within your figma files with
only a button press quickly convert
figma frame into a realistic product
mockups so in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you the best way to start
practicing designing apps and websites
in figma you can quickly download
mockups plugin in the figma rather than
saving your figma design and switching
to another software to build a mockup
although numiles plugin alternatives are
available in different styles they are
all easy to use and can be integrated
into bigger projects
so just go to Google
cardboard Studio
or right click on the get started for
free
right I guess that makes just quickly
create an account
as I have already made an account so
I will go to the setting then
integration
okay then click on the setting to reveal
the API key and you will be shown an API
key and then copy this and come back to
the figma and paste here in right now
here you can see you can reveal the API
key over here and you can paste it over
here
so right now maybe it's not making any
sense but when you launch this plugin
you are going to see more data that
shows input API keys right so just go
over the website create an account
create your API key and you have to copy
and come back over your figma and paste
that API key right and it may look like
a little stressful but it will take a
long run it's going to be an actually
I'm beneficial to you all right so now
you have a lot of vocals right so we'll
click on write button and
you can have the buggy over here and I
will show you yeah it will take a bit of
time okay now I'm going to search or I
can select only free items okay let's um
use this let me click on this
okay let's use this so yeah you can
click on the lookup item you actually
presented with the two or the three
screens depending on the kind of workup
you are clicking so first you have to
move up by yourself your item you are
not going to make any change to this one
so you can plug this so you're not going
to move that and or you're not going to
touch in this so you're not going to
edit this you can even go as far as you
can lock this like right I have done and
so this is what you're going to make
changes to whatever
changes you are going to implement
Implement sorry we'll put here it will
reflect on this it looks like magic
right so let's create a design for the
full delivery uh for the first splash
screen first let's change the color for
the background
um let's take a light color maybe
yeah this is fine
and so we will give the effect to this
we will change this color Also let's
take the sky with the gradient and I'm
going to get the gradient effects of it
sorry
after this first I'm going to make a
border we will select a line from over
here
yeah again I will press the keyword L
and I'll meet the bottom
so similarly I have drawn all the four
borders I am going to make a bit little
bit
think
let's give this black color
so this is how it will look after giving
a border now we will put a text as the
name of our food delivery app so we will
give a name
we will make the size a little bigger
than this
36.
let's make it bold
with different color only let's take
dark blue
right
now we need
to make a button with the name get a
meal so we will
um keep one rectangle over here
and with the text
let it be a little small with small 16.
okay
24 yeah fine
we'll align it in a bit I will change
the colorful there is also
yeah fine
for making it looks a little good or we
will put one pitch over here so so for
that first I will make a rectangle
but in which I'm going to insert the
picture
suppose I already downloaded the picture
so this is how it will look and now for
making this little good we will put one
icon over here related to the food so
I'm already downloaded when I can yeah
so this will look like this after
putting this icon over here
so
we will make it in alignment
thank you
so after importing all the items and
customizing a frame click on the render
button first we have to choose the
screen that is the slash screen so we
will enter this and it will reflect
whatever your design is going to render
the item in that perspective and the
changes are going to be made on this
same
would be rendered on the item after the
render button is click on the consent
visible in the screen see
now for the next we will see
now we will see something different when
the user will log into the app
and the next screen will be like how we
are going to design
let's make a different
let's take this one
so we are not going to make any change
in this and I'm not going to edit this
but this year
first I will pick the line and now I'm
going to copy
the line
sizes
three four yeah now I'm gonna open this
on the resizes also
you want to copy this and
so it will look like this
next thing I want to add a text and that
that text should describe or what you
want to select your mean different
locations maybe from your workplace or
something like that so we will going to
add a text over here
size it with before
I will change the design Let It Be Sammy
or medium
and we change the color for this will
keep
right
yeah and we will change the color of
our region
so after this there will be the
varieties for choosing the view so I'm
going to add one more text like choose
your view
sorry
I know it says this whole
um with a little smaller angle before
like 16 you're fine and I'll change the
color for this also
let's make it medium
and I will change the color for the text
Let It Be
about blue only okay fine this is fine
I'm going to align it again
remove this
okay
there will be the location so I'm going
to put oven polygon
in the name of location so we'll change
the color for this let it be green color
yeah fine
so if you want to search your meal there
will be a search button also for that I
have an icon
yes it seems like this and we are going
to put different different four
for icons
for that we will take rectangle
align it
yeah like this and now I'm going to
quickly add the four different icons
that I already downloaded as we are in
the choosing page uh voice icon will be
active and another three will be on
offline so we will keep them in dark
color
so it will be visible like this
so we are going to add the items on the
food that we are going to select there
will be different options so let's do it
so first I'm going to take n Square
and one Circle
or we will use rectangle later we will
keep the circle over here and we'll
select a picture of the food that we are
going to insert over this so first and
having surgery which I have already
downloaded from the Google I am going to
shift this rectangle over there
so I'm going to give a circle with the
green and it is in our favorite list I
am going to give a heart over there
change the color with the green as it is
vegetarian
so it will be like this after that we
are going to give the name of this meal
so quickly I'm going to give the name of
this meal
I'll resize this
and another text for the price
it could be in the metallic and the size
bigger
hello
yeah so similarly we are going to make
the different
rectangle suppose like
air
all right let's copy the first one maybe
the similar size
yeah now we are going to render this so
that we will go in the plugin again and
we are going to select this
yeah so it takes a little bit time and
we are going to proceed it to reflect in
the screen so it will be like this so
whatever we are going to make a change
in the first screen
and and that will be select on our book
of three
suppose we take another
say this one
let's try to put this screen
over here
I'll let it be like this
so this is for this hookup screen so I'm
going to enter this and it will come
over this also
let's quickly plug in and open add Lucas
item and I'm going to render this
yeah so it doesn't overlap but it is
showing the same screen that I have used
before and yeah I didn't make any
different screen for that and it is
overlapped but in this it is not it is
showing
so similarly whatever the changes we are
going to make in this will reflect on
the mocha power screen suppose
I will choose this
anything like or any other shape
that state star
give it a color with
I'm going to render this screen
and this is going to reflect over here
yeah after importing the items and
customizing the frame click on the
render button and your design is going
to render on the item in that
perspective or any changes that you are
going to meet on the same frame would be
rendered on the item after the render
button is clicked on consecutable so
this is how we create a mockups in figma
