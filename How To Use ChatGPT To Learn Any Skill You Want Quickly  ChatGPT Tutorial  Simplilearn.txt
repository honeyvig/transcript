chat J as a virtual guide offering
advice and insights across a variety of
areas such as writing coding business
Science Education design art data
science culinary arts content creation
and language learning you could ask him
as a mentor for all these areas so now
we'll write a prompt for the chat jpt to
act as a mentor and here we will choose
an area for copyrighting you can choose
any area you want to learn whether it be
coding data science business any design
articles or any culinary arts or content
creation so here we'll write an prompt
that you are an
expert at
copyrighting and I want to
be or we can ask
him you to be my
mentor and guide me
learning through the
process so you could see that the J gbt
has started generating its response and
it has accepted the prompt and it is
acting like a mentor here so you could
see that it's great that you are
interested in copyrighting and I would
be happy to guide you through the
process and I will share insights and
tips to help you develop your skills so
you could see that he has provided the
road map for the copyrighting so the
first is understanding the basics then
we have study grade copy then learn
copyrighting techniques and we have all
the points here so you could also ask
him that make this road map and help me
learn the skill into like what time
period you want in 8 months 3 months and
you could dedicate some time according
to a day so you could ask him that I can
dedicate around 5 hours a day and that
would be 5 days a week and I want to
learn this skill in eight months so this
CH GPT will guide you through that
process also so I'll show
you I can
dedicate 3 hours a
day and 5 days a
week and I want to
learn this skill in at
least 3
months so provide me the road map
map for
it so you could see that JT has taken
the response The Prompt and it has
started generating the response here so
with a dedicated schedule of 3 hours a
day 5 days a week and aiming to develop
a solid foundation in copyrighting
within 3 months so here's the road map
for you so month one you would be
understanding the
foundation and he has also categorized
the week 1 and two and the week three
and four so what skills you would be
focusing on and what you should learn so
the first thing we asked CH was to be
the mentor for any skill because chj has
the property or has the forte in all the
skills mentioned and then we have asked
Him to guide us with the accountability
or just give us the road map that we
want to learn the skill in these months
so you could also ask him that
additionally could you outline the
essential topics and skills that I
should focus on to prepare myself for an
entry level position so if you want to
take any entry level position in
copyrighting you could also ask
him so for that we'll write a
prompt
additionally would you outline some
essential
topics that I should focus
on for an entry level
job in
copyrighting so you could see that CH
jpt has started generating the
response so here the response comes that
the first topic is copyrighting
principles and in that we have
understanding of Aida model then the
unique value proposition and then the
the list goes on with all the necessary
skills and then you can start the
learning process by asking him that we
will start with the month one and the
week one and two schedule and I want you
to be my mentor and please provide the
information that I would be learning so
chat J will start all the processes and
provide you with all the content for the
week one and two so we'll write a PR for
that
now
provide
me with the
content first
month and being
specific will start
with week one as you could see that it
has started with the day one that is
Introduction to copyrighting and it has
also declared the objective here that
what we will be learning for the day one
so the activities would be to read that
would be the start with an introductory
article or book chapter on copyrighting
so you could also ask him like what
resources I can use to learn
copyrighting or you could just ask him
that what are the topics that I would be
covering in day one so
let's stop this response and ask
him provide me the topics
I shall start
with on day
one you could see that now he is
generating the topics so that is what is
copyrighting the role of a copywriter
its responsibilities skills required and
the introduction to aidm
model and now we'll ask
him
I will
be starting my Learning
Journey
today so provide
me all the necessary
content starting with the first
topic that is what is
copyrighting
so you could see that it has started
generating the response and first we
have the definition then the evolution
of copyrighting then the purpose of
copyrighting and then the significance
of copyrighting and
marketing so you could definitely learn
from here and you just act as a prompt
engineer or just you have to write the
prompts and the chat chip will guide you
through any skill or any like any field
you want to learn and one more thing if
you want to condense any information
that if you have any article about
copyrighting only so we have a plugin
with the chat jpt and you'll provide the
link to chat jpt and it will condense
all the information and provide you the
summary for the article or you could
provide any YouTube link or any article
link for that we have the plugin here
that is web pilot so for that we'll open
a new window for web pilot and here's
the window you could paste any link so
we'll open simply learn website for this
simply learn
articles and I will show you how this
works so we have the project manager
salary article we'll copy the
link get back to the web pilot paste the
link
and now we'll ask the chat
can you
summarize this
article for
me you could see that the web pilot has
started and it's asking for the
permissions you could allow it for once
or you could allow it
anytime so you could see that it is
generating the summarized response for
you so accordingly you could use any
resources and you could also ask the
resources to the chat jpt that I want
the top resources available online for
my copyrighting journey so I will show
you what prompt you can use for that and
before that you could see that it has
generated the summarized form so you
could have a hold on these
things now moving on we can have the
knowledge assessment also that is you
have started The Learning Journey of
copyrighting now you want to assess
yourself so you could ask the chat jpt
to assess me with some questions and I
will show you the prom for that also
okay getting back to chat jpt so this
was the web pilot
plugin so here we are the J and you can
ask him that you are
my
mentor and now
act as a copyrighting
teacher now you can ask me
questions ask me a question and I will
give you an answer and you could also
ask him that after answering my question
then you can give me another response or
you can assess my answer and after that
you can ask me another question and this
goes on till five times so let's write a
prompt for
that ask me
questions assessing my
copyrighting skills and you could also
mention the days like if you have
covered one or two days and you have
covered some topics you could ask him
that you can assess me with the
questions accordingly with the days I
have covered or accordingly you could
mention the days that is day two with
the respect of the road map you have
provided copyrighting skills ask me
questions assessing my copyrighting
skills and I
will give you the
answers analyze
them and provide me the
feedback for the
same and make that
questionnaire
questionnaire
of five
questions and ask me one by
one so learning any scale with chj is
just a scale of prompts it's just a game
of prompts you just have to write the
prompt and mention chat jpt as any
teacher or mentor and he will guide you
through all the processes you could see
that he has asked the first question
that is the Aida model that is explain
the Aida model in your own words and
provide a brief explanation or the
example of how you would apply it and
one more thing you could also ask CH JY
to make the concept clear or to make the
concept as a story or make it
understandable to a six-year-old child
so he will conclude or condense the
information into a form that it will be
easily available or learned to a Layman
language so this is how you could assess
your skills while being on a Learning
Journey so it will act you as a mentor
as a teacher as an assessment technician
or as an assistant and now we'll start
with another Journey that would be
resource identification for learning so
for Learners with specific preferences
that would be visual auditory or reading
based chat gbt can recommend tailored
education resources like video tutorials
for visual Learners and to support their
Learning Journey you could ask the chat
DY for these also so for this we will
write the prompt I want to learn how to
learn copyrighting and I a visual
learner and prefer to watch videos can
you give me five resources I can use to
help or learn so similarly we'll write a
prom for
that so I want to learn
copyrighting
and I am a visual ual
learner so could you provide
me to five
videos to learn through the
process so you could see that J jbt has
started generating the response for this
prom and as a visual learner looking to
dive into the world of copyrighting
videos can be a fantastic way so he's
searching the videos on
YouTube and it has also provided you a
path so how you could search them with
the main keywords there so for the
particular topics he has provided the
response so introduction to copyrighting
you could search the keywords that would
be copywriting Basics copywriting 101
and if we talk about the Aida model he
has also provided the keywords to
research that is Aida model explained
applying Aida in copy so this is how you
could ask chat jpt for other resources
also so now moving to the next one that
is anticipating learning challenges so
by quaring chat jbt about common
obstacles and learning a new domain
individuals can prepare for and navigate
through potential challenges more
effectively optimizing The Learning
Experience so you could ask chity that I
want to learn copyrighting and I'm
learning copyrighting with you and you
acting as My Mentor so what ways will I
fail so please tell me common things
that people do wrong when learning this
skill so this will have a handson that
you won't repeat those mistakes that
people do so we'll ask the chat and see
what response it will generate for
us you could ask him as I'm
learning copyrighting with
you so in what
ways can I fail
and
please tell me common
things
that I can do
wrong and learning this
skill so you could see that it has
started in the response
and the first point he has mentioned is
not understanding your audience and the
pitfall and he has also provided the
solution here so you could use this
prompt for your copyrighting journey as
a smooth and The Buttery pace so you
won't be repeating those mistakes that
other people do and it will conserve
your time and you will be on the track
to learn any skill so as we have done
for the copyrighting skill you could do
for any skill that you want to learn
that could be culinary arts business
data science coding coding in any
language you could ask him and you could
also ask him while writing code that you
can act as an assistant and help me
write the code but don't provide the
code to me if I am stuck anywhere you
could help me break it out or debug it
so with this guys and with these promts
