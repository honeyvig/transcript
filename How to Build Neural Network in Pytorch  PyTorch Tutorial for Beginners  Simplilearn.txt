the ability to process and analyze
digital images has become more crucial
as their use has increased the
capability to automatically recognize
and classify images allow programmer to
create models with various users
including self-driving cars and facial
recognization among many others Because
deep learning makes it possible to
create highly accurate models it has
completely changed how image
classification is done the relevant
features in an image can be easily
learned and extracted using a deep
learning algorithm overall deep learning
based image classification has grown to
be hugely popular framework because of
its Precision adaptability and because
it has the potential to build extremely
powerful models for various applications
hey everyone you're watching simply
learn and in today's video we're going
to be learning all about pyot and how to
build a neural network using Pyon if you
love watching videos like this do hit
the Subscribe button to never miss any
updates from Simply learn so now without
any further delay let's start with the
Pyon installation if you want to become
a machine learning expert consider calch
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning by simply learn and master
those necessary skills check out the
link in the description for more details
but before we dive into the installation
process directly let me explain you what
is pyo and why pyo is popular machine
learning framework well Pyon is a
machine learning framework used for
image classification and neural net
Network processing it is a py toch based
open source machine learning
implementation based on the torch
Library it is the most popular AI
Library it is the most popular AI
Library among industry and academic
researchers worldwide it increases the
machine learning framework adaptability
it will also offer High implementation
speed for deep neural networks therefore
a well-liked machine learning framework
is byed because of its AE of use
adaptability and Powerful capability it
also provides a wide set of tools and
libraries for build machine learning
models and additionally py enables the
modification of computational graphs
making it simple to test out various
models and architectures as well as to
debug and improve existing models so now
to install Pyon first make sure that
python is installed in your system and
to install python for programming visit
the link python.org so you can just type
python so you can click on the first
link go to downloads from the menu bar
and click on python do 11.2 to download
for Windows so just click run Python and
install it so once installing python
check if it is successfully installed
using the following command in the
comment prompt so to check just open
comment
prompt hope my screen is visible so here
you can just type python uncore
version and it must display python
version and if you get the python
version then we are good to go the next
step is unac
installation so open new tab type
anakonda okay so to install anakonda
visit the link anaconda.com
and here you can just scroll down and
you can see here green button download
for Windows just
click so as you can see it will be
downloaded here
so once the anakonda is downloaded open
the file and click on
next okay so click on
next and then next click on I
agree select just me
recommended and click on next
next choose the installation uh
location click on
next and then just click on install or
you can select add uh Ana 3 to my path
environment variable yes this is
important and then click on install so
once you click on install it will be
installed
successfully uh I'm not going to install
since I have already installed in my
system and to check whether the anakonda
has been installed successfully check
anakonda version in the comment prompt
or with the command like Kore version
you can also check in uh anakonda
prompt so first let's check python
version for version
okay so it has displayed the counter
version that is ready
3.1.0 so we have now install an AA and
use the command prompt to check its
version and once you get the cond
version the following step is to install
pyot for that open the new tab and to
install pyo just type your
pyo and click on this first link that is
p.org and here just scroll down
and here you can see this so select uh
according to our systems requirement so
suppose you want to select this py to
belt so click on Staple and then uh your
OS so as per your system if it is Linux
or Max or windows so this is Windows so
I'll click on Windows and then package
go with the K or pip so I'll go with the
condom and then language Python and
compute platform so if your system is
having GPU then you can go with Koda
else you can click on uh CPU okay and
whatever command here you got run this
command on the prompt so you can just
copy
this you can just
copy and paste it
here so I have already installed
it I'll just show you how to P yeah you
can paste and give enter so all the
required uh files will be
downloaded and to check whether the pyto
has been installed successfully run the
following command that is
condam
listor f
pytorch and give
enter so here if you get the pyo version
after running the command that means pyo
is successfully running and you got your
pyo name version build and channel so
now we have learned to install Python
and pyou following this let's build a
neural network for beginners so hope
you're clear with how to install python
anakonda py to and now we are good to
get started with building neural network
so using fashion M data set we are going
to create a convolutional neural network
to predict data set classes you may be
wondering why we are using the M data
set rather than any other so let me tell
you that the M data set is the first one
on which the researchers attempt to
develop and test deep learning models
for image classification task using crn
the fashion M data set can be used to
train image classification models and
has grown in popularity as a way to
evaluate how well Machine learning
algorithms and models perform and the
fashion mem data set is commonly used in
CNN or convolutional neural network it
is a type of deep neural network that
perform image classification and
processing task it consists of several
convolutional layers that are designed
to automatically extract useful
information features from the input
image data and the first step is to
input all necessary libraries so let's
input them One By
One
Import
nump as
NP then
import
pandas as
PD just import
Matt
plot
Li dot p p l
o as
PLT so this is to show the
image next
import torch
Vision first let's import torch and then
import torch vision
tor. NN as
NN this is
from torch
dot
autograde import
variable
Tor
Vision import torch
Vision
dot
transform transforms as
transforms from
to do
utils do
data
import data set comma data loader
from SK
La
dot
matrix
import confusion
Matrix okay once we are done just
execute
this as you can see it's running so wait
for
it
okay so next step device configuration
so use the GPU for the computation if
available otherwise you can go with the
CPU so to check that you can just type
device is equal to torch do device
if
available Cuda if torch
Cuda dot e
available let's go with the CPU
so let me give this in the double
quotes let's
enter so next using the Paras Library we
will now read the two CS uh CSV files
that is fashion M train. CSV and fashion
m is test. CSV and then store the data
in the train CSV and test CSV
respectively so for that you can type
Trainor
CSV is equal to pandas that is
pd. read uncore
CSV and said that you can give
fashion
mnist train.
CSV and same goes with the
test testore CSV is equal to PD do read
uncore
CSV
leave
fashion
Mist
test. CSV
okay next type um Trainor CSV it will
display the train CSV files so to to
display the files train
underscore
CSV and same goes with the test
underscore
CSV okay and you got the output
so now let me brief you on the fashion
mess data set so it is a collection of
images of clothing items such as dresses
quods t-shirt Etc so the fashion MNS
data set of gray scale images is divided
into test and train data set where the
train data set consists of 60,000
examples and test data set consists of
10,000 examples along with that the data
set consists of 10 classes representing
different type of clothing items like
t-shirt tops trousers pullovers dresses
CS sandals shirts sneakers bags and
Ankle boards in which each grayscale
image is of size 28 into 28 pixel a
total of 784 pixels so here you can see
in train data set we have
60,000 and in test data set we have
10,000
examples so as shown on the screen this
is what each pixel has a single Pixel
value that indicates the lightness or
darkness of the each pixel value with
higher number indicating darker pixel
okay so the training and test data set
consists of 785 columns here you can see
785 columns so with the integer for the
uh this pixel value ranging from 0 to
255 so the class label make up the First
Column so this is the class
label so which represents the piece of
clothing and the remaining column
contain the pixel values for the
associated
image so I I hope it's
clear you can see here we have 10,000
rows into 785 columns and here we have
60,000 rows into 785
columns so in Next Step create a user
defined class with the name fashion data
set for creating a data
set class
fashion data
set and inside data
set next create a method to initialize
the variables so let's give
Devore underscore in
it
self comma
data comma
transform is equal to
none so initially it's none then
self
dot fashion
mist is equal
to
list of data do
values self
dot
transform equal to trans
transform next let's give
label and
images and then using
for I in self.
fashion underscore mest
table do
append
of I of
zero then same for
image do
upend I of one
here uh this iterates over a data set
called fashion name list and appends the
labels and images to two separate list
called label and image
respectively and next we can give
cell do
labels is equal to NP that is numi do as
arrays label
s do images is equal to MP do as
array of
image dot we are reshaping the image
reshape
-1 28 by
28 comma
1 do S
Type float
so here dimension of image is given that
is 28 by
28 and whereas 28 and 28 is height and
width and the color channel is one so
here we got the color Channel as well as
the size of the image so we are going to
reshape the size of the
image and then next create cre U Get
item method to written the images and
labels
diff underscore
get
item self comma
index then
label is equal to
self do
labels of
index then
image is equal to self.
image so images of
index then
if self do
transform is not
done is not
none image is equal to self
dot
transform
image it should
return image and comma
label so and then create the length
method to return the number of items in
a data set so once it Returns the image
and labels next create the length
method so give
depore
length of
cell return
return length of self.
image image is length so let's execute
uted then load the data set so for that
train
data is equal
to F transform okay it's a fashion data
set train
comma
transform is equal Al to
transform transforms.
compos
of
transform transforms.
to
tensor and same with the test data test
data is equal
to data
fashion data
set give test it be the same so you can
just copy the same thing here give comma
and paste it here and with that let's
give um train
loader is equal to data
loader of train
data comma bat
size is equal to
100 and next test
loader is equal to data
loader
train
data comma bat size is equal to 100 so
here the transform argument here as you
can see the transform argument is used
to apply transformation to the input
data and then the train loader and test
loader are data loader objects that are
used to load data in batches during
training and testing so whereas this
batch size specifies the number of
samples to load in each batch so here I
guess we have given Trainor
CSV and here also testore
CSV so now let's run it and next
download the data set from Fashion Mist
so Trainor set we are downloading the
data
set
dot
Vision do data
set data sets.
fashion
mest double column dot this is
the root path folder
data
comma download
is equal to
two comma train is equal to
false comma
transform is equal to
transforms dot
compose transform
transforms. to
tensor so let's copy the whole sentence
here copy the whole code
and we'll do the same for test set so
test data set so here maybe you can
remove
this yes and here we have test
data set so we have given test
data and
then a torch vision. datas set.
fashionist data download true and here
train false transform is equal to
transforms.
compose okay let's give
enter true is not
defined okay let's give it in caps
compost
so here we had made maybe spelling
mistake okay here give
s and now let's run
it yes okay all right next let's give uh
train loader
train loader is equal to
torch do
U do
data do data
loader train
data
comma bat
size is equal to
100 same thing let's do it for the test
loader as
well paste it and change this to test
loader is equal to torch utils do data
do data loader and here let's give test
data and then B size is equal to 100 run
it
next give the function def output
undor
label of
label output
mapping is equal
to enter all the labels
here from 0 to 9 so totally we have 10
so we are giving from index 0 to till 9
so in the place of zero
give t-shirt first we can give anything
let me give
t-shirt or
top
comma
one croser
comma in the place of two give
pullover three let's give
trust four
quote fifth let's give sandals
then
six
short comma
7
sneakers after sneaker let's give back
and
n9th anle
vot let's make it capital
P all right
and
then give
input input is equal
to label
dot item
of
if
type
label is equal equal
to torch dot
tensor else
label then
return output
mapping of
input okay
so this function converts the label that
is inputed into a text label that
corresponding to it and either a tensor
or a scalar label may be used as a input
parameter and
then we are giving
a is equal to
next
iter frame
loader of Z
do
size so here it must give the output of
tensor
size so let's give so we got tenser dot
size 100a 1A 28a
28 and
then uh let's bring the length of the
train data so for that let's give length
of train
data and it is
60,000 so then let's display the image
using the method imp show for that let's
give image comma
label is equal
to
next of
Itor
rain
set then TT plot do imow method
image
dot color mapping is equal
to
GRE
Print Lab
so let's run
it and here as I discussed before the
image Dimension is given 28 by 28 and
the color is gray so here you can see 28
by 28 so if you want to try different
color maybe you can go with Autumn here
I can
type
Au t mnore r let's check which
color so yeah this color and you can
also go with another
color you can just type v i r
i d i
s so yeah so for now let's give
G and let's run
it okay next print the torch size so for
that give demo loading
is equal
to torch dot
utils
do data
dot data
loader Trainor
set
comma bad size
is equal to
10
patch equal to
next
wrer demo
loader images comma
label labels is equal
to patch
print type of
image images
common type of
labels again
print
images dot
shape comma
labels dot shape
so here we got torch
size okay here let's give bad size to be
100 also
yeah so you got
it and then uh the code prints the type
and the shape of the image and label
tensor and next let's print the
image not one image let's print the all
the images so for that you can give
grade is equal to torch
Vision dot
utils
dot make
cre
images comma
n
row is equal to
10 then plot.
fer pick
size let's
give 15 Comm
20 then
plot using M
show
method in that NP
dot
transpose
read
comma 1 comma 2 comma
0 Let's print the
labels and is equal
to
space using for I comma
labels in
enumerate
labels so finally
print
output underscore
label
of labels
and is equal
to comma so here I remove this and give
it
here so now let's run
it okay here let's give it
10 run
it also run this piece of code yeah so
here you
got all the 10 uh rows so here you have
ankle boot t-shirt top t-shirt or top
and then we have uh again uh top dress
t-shirt pullover sneaker pullover sandal
and
sandal so uh here you can change the uh
size of the figure maybe if you want you
can give 5 by
10 so it become smaller in size
yeah so let's let's keep it 15 by
20 and let's run
it so every training and testing example
is given one of the labels listed below
it can be any one from here so next make
a model class that inherits the pyo nn.
module class for
that give
class
fashion
CNN of nn.
module next
diff in
it of
self
super
fashion
CNN comma
self
do
inate
method then give self do layer
one is equal equal
to NN
dot
sequential NN Dot
convolution
2D in
channel in channels is equal to
1
comma about
Channel channels is equal to
32 comma C kernel size let's keep it
three and then pading is equal to
1 n then
batch
nor
B of 32
comma NN do re
e
l
u function this is activation function
and then we
have n do Max
pool
2D of Kernel
size is equal to 2 comma strip is equal
to
two and then let's give self do layer
two equal equal
to NN
dot
sequential
of and
N do
cono let's SK it capital c
here 2
in do
Channel channels is equal to 32
comma
output
channels is equal to
64
kernel size is equal to 3
comma
NN batch
Norm 2D of
64
comma
NN dot
[Music]
r e l u this is the activation
function n then do
Max of
two make sure you're giving the correct
spacing because spacing is very
important when you're working in Jupiter
notebook
so let's give underscore here
so here this piece of code defines a
convolutional neural network that is CNN
with two convolutional layers followed
by a batch normalization here we have a
batch normalization so the first
convolutional layer that is here this
one is the first convolutional
layer uh so here it it takes a gray
scale image with one input Channel here
we have the one input Channel and
applies 32 filters of size 3x3 with a
padding of one so keep the input image
spatel Dimensions so finally a Max
pulling layer so here we have also a Max
pulling
layer with a kernel size of 2 2x two and
this stride is two uh this is applied to
reduce the spat resolution of the output
by half this reducing the number of
parameters in the sequen subsequential
layers so here in the second layer
so this is a second convolutional layer
here uh it takes the output so what
happened here is takes the output of the
first layer as input and apply 64
filters of the size 3x3 and there are no
pading so in short I must say that it
makes a model class that inherits the
Pyon NN module so this is the NN module
class so it is actually a super class
for all neural networks so in our case
we have taken the fashion CNN so our
neural network is composed of the
following two layers so this is one
layer and this is the second layer so uh
there are two subsequential layers Each
of which is having the following layers
a convolutional layer with a kernel
again I'm repeating the kernel of 3x3
and padding is one in the first layer
and there is no padding in the second
layer so padding is zero in the second
layer and there's a one stri is shaped
by both the layers and we have the ru is
acation function and then we have a Max
pulling layer with kernel size 2x two
and stride is two and then also a layer
for batch
normalization I hope it's
clear so
next type
self do
FC
1 is equal to NN
dot linear
linear in
feature in features is equal to
64 into 6 into
6
comma out
feature equal to
600 then self
drop is equal to NN
do drop
out
2D
0
25 then
self.
fc2 is equal equal to NN Dot
in
feature in features is equal to
600 out
feature is equal to
120 then again self
dot fc3 is equal equal to
nn.
linear in
feature is equal to
120
comma out
feature is equal to
10 then we have def forward
method self comma X
out is equal
to
sell dot layer
1 of
X then
out is equal
to self dot Layer Two
out then out is equal to out.
view out
size size of
zero
comma
minus1 then out is equal to
self do
fc1 out
and then out is equal
to self of
Rob so here it should be
out
sell.
drop then out is equal
to
cell.
fc2 of
out equal
to self do
fc3 of
out return
out so
here this code defines a neural network
model with three fully connected layers
these are the fully connected layers
three fc1 fc2 and fc3 and two
convolutional layers that is layer one
and layer two here we have layer one and
Layer Two and the forward method
specifies the order in which the input X
is passed through the layers of the
network here we have the input X so the
input X is first passed through the
layer one and then uh Layer Two after
passing through the convolutional layers
the output is flatten using the view
method this is the view method here uh
this is uh to be compatible with the
fully connected layers and finally the
output of
fc2 um is obtained and then pass through
the fc3 to obtain the final
output so we have run this
code next create an instance of the
fashion CNN model so let's give it here
itself model
Al to
Fashion
CNN
Mod Dot to
device error is equal equal equal to NN
Dot
Cross androp
by
loss and then
learning underscore
rate is equal to
0.1 and then
Optimizer is equal to
optim
dot
Adam model
dot
parameter parameters
of LR is equal
to rate
then print
model so here we got the
output and
next let's give number
of
eort is equal to five so an OS means
training the neural network with all the
training data for once so we have given
here
five and then count is equal to
0 then
L then we have
itation
list next accuracy
list you also take prediction
list followed by
labels
for
eort in
range
of eorts
for
image for images
comma
labels
in train
loader
images comma
labels in train
loader sorry
images comma labels
do
images let's give equal
to images dot to device we are moving it
to the device all the labels and
images
comma labels. two
device next train
is equal to
variables images
dot comma 1 comma 28 by
28 so this means that there are 100
images in the batch each with a single
color channel that is one that is gray
scale and each image is 28 by 28
pixels and a
label labels is equal
to
variable
labels then
output output is equal to model of
train loss is equal
to error of
output outputs comma
labels so here initialize
um next is to initializing a gradient
for that let's use
Optimizer do
Z
create so what we doing is here
initializing a gradient as zero so there
is no mixing of gradient among the
batches
then so next step is propagating the
error backward so we are giving loss
dot
backward and then optimizing the
parameters
Optimizer dot
step then
count
plus equal 1 it also means count is
equal to count +
1 if
not
count percentage
50 so it's same as if count per in 50 is
equal equal to zero so to
Total = to
Z correct is equal to
Z and then testing the model for that
we'll take for image
images comma
labels in
test
loer images comma
labels is equal to images do to device
again moving
out moving to the
device labels
do to
device label
list dot
append

format format of
count comma l. data comma accuracy
in The Next Step let's visualize laws
and accuracy with
iterations so plot Dot
Plot
HRA list comma loss
list lot PLT dox Lael
first mentioning number
of
iteration then PLT lot.
viable X and Y uh in place of Y we are
giving
loss and plot now we are supposed to
give title for this the graph
title it should be first let's do
iteration versus loss next iteration ver
versus accuracy so for that let's give
iteration versus
loss and then plot finally plot do show
wait for it to
run so let's run
it so as you can see we got iteration
versus loss graph and here also even
this piece of code is executed and here
we got the output iteration 5 loss and
accuracy percentage we got so we got the
highest accuracy is
92%
next so now let's plot for iteration
versus accuracy for that PLT dot lot
plot
iteration comma
accuracy
list then give
PLT do X
label so X label will be our number
of
accuracy then plot for y label y label
and here will be the
accuracy then plot the
title our title will be
hydration versus
accuracy finally plot
the show that is in
or give iteration
list okay and here we got
the
output so when you compare this here we
have 500 to 3,000 iterations right so
here you can see from 500 to 3,000 we
have and then
loss when we take the last iteration you
can see here the loss is
0.24 so when you can see here the loss
that is
0.24 so here almost here it will be like
0.24 so then what we have accuracy is 92
so you can see here
accuracy 92 92 is somewhere here so you
can see accuracy is 92 so the same way
it's showing all the iteration loss and
accuracy of the label
check the first also so suppose uh take
iteration 1,500 so somewhere here
1,500 the loss is
0.25 right so loss we will check in this
graph iteration versus loss so 0 was
0.25 so 0.25 will be somewhere here so
you can see here 0.25
and
then okay here
0.25 and then accuracy is
90 so yeah this point is the 90 so this
is how it is giving us iteration versus
loss and iteration versus
accuracy
plotting and in the next step
so now we will examine the accuracy in
each fashion M data set class so for
that
class underscore
correct is equal to
0
for underscore in
range in range of
10 then
total 0
point underscore
in range of
10 with
t Dot number of
grade for
images comma
labels in test
loader images
comma
labels is equal
to images do2
device comma
labels dot two
device then say test is equal
to
variables of
images then
output outputs is equal
to model
model of
test then we give
prediction
predicted is equal to torch
dot
Max Max of
outputs of
one c equal
to is equal equal
to
read
for I in
range of
100 then is equal to labels of
I then class underscore
correct of
label Plus or equal to C of
I do
item and
total underscore
correct of
label Plus or equal to
1 for I in r
often
print
accuracy
of column dot 2 f
of
percent then give dot
format
output underscore
label of
I then
[Music]
class I
into 100 /
by total
corrent so now run
it so as you can see the output each
label accuracy is checked so so we got
the accuracy of each and every label
that is t-shirt trouser pullover dress
coat sandal shirt sneaker bag and ankle
boot and the accuracy of ankle boot is
98.2% so this is my deep learning
implementation in the fashion Ms data
set using pyo and I got
98.2% on the test and to improve it
modify the layer architecture or
parameters and with that we come to the
