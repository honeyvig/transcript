in the evolving landscape of 2024 a
breakthrough in learning methods emerged
transforming the way individuals like
Alex approached mastering python this
approach not only facilitated a deeper
comprehension of python but also
nurtured problem solving skills critical
in the tech industry moreover Jad G's
capability to provide instant feedback
and debugging assistance was
instrumental in Alex rapid progression
Alex story exemplifies the
transformative potential of AI in
education and before we move on guys
just a quick in for you if you're one of
the aspiring anml enthusiasts looking
for online training and graduating from
the best universities or a professional
who elicits to switch career in ml from
the experts then try goinging a short to
Simply learns postgraduate program in a
ml in collaboration with P University
and IBM by enrolling in this
certification program you will gain
expertise in skills like generative AI
prompt engineering chat GPD explainable
AI machine learning algorithms
supervised and unsupervised learning
model training and optimization and just
much more on the list you can find the
course Link in the description box and
print comment so let's get started so
the number one step for learning python
fast with chat JB would be setting up
your learning environment for python
with charj so let's see the number one
step so when starting your journey To
Learn Python with charj the first step
is to set up a learning environment that
is conducive to your learning style and
goals this involves preparing both the
technical setup like choosing the right
integrated development or ID and
configuring chat jpd to best serve your
learning learning needs here's how I
will show you so the first step would be
choose an ID or online compiler for
writing and testing python code select
an ID such as pycharm Visual Studio code
or an online compiler like replit so
these tools offer syntax highlighting
code completion and debugging tools that
make learning easier and the next step
would be install the python and
familiarize yourself with the interface
so spend some time getting comfortable
with the ID or online compiler and
create the first program that would be
hello world program to get handson and
the next step would be configuring chat
jpd so you can customize the chat gbt I
will show you guys so to make chj your
personal python tutor you need to inform
it about your current level and what you
aim to achieve this customization helps
chat gbt adjust its responses to fit
your needs so I'll show you where you
can do that so you have to click on the
profile section and go to customize chat
gbt and here you could type
that I'm a complete beginner to
programming and want to learn python
from scratch so can you guide me through
the basics in a simple and
understandable way so you could write
that or what you want to write like if
your level is intermediate or you want
to learn just Advanced topics you could
write
accordingly and you could also set
learning goals here so after customizing
the chat
jity you could move to the next step and
and by setting up the learning
environment thoughtfully and customizing
chat JT to act as your personal tutor
you are laying a solid foundation for
your python Learning Journey remember
the keys to start simple be consistent
with your practice and not hesitate to
ask CH GPT for explanations examples or
new challenges to keep your learning
process active and engaging so let's
start with the number two point that
would be starting with the fundamentals
so once your learning environment is set
up the next crucial step is to grasp the
fundamentals of python so this found is
essential for building more complex
programs later so here's how we'll see
that so you should start with
understanding the Python Basics and
starting with the Core Concepts so begin
with python syntax variables data types
operators and control flow and have an
Interactive Learning with chat jbt use
chat jbt to break down these Concepts
into manageable explanations don't just
read interact by asking questions
requesting examples and trying to solve
suggested problems so accordingly I will
show you some
examples I will write a prompt so
starting with the basic syntax and
variables we will ask CH jity can you
explain python syntax and how to declare
variables also could we provide a simple
example of variable
assignment so let's ask
[Music]
him
[Music]
so you could see that chat jpt has
started processing our prompt and it's
replying
so you could have an interactive session
with chgb in any case or in any response
you seem to be doubtful you can just ask
him or just point out like where you are
having a doubt just have a conversation
and it will clear your doubts so you
would see that it has amazingly answered
your prompt and this is the basic Syntax
for variable assignment and the rules
for the variable names and accordingly
he has given the examples
so similarly you could ask different
prompts to learn the basics of python
that could be what are different data
types in Python can you give examples of
each and explain when to use them or
like when learning control flow you
could ask him how do I use IFL
statements in Python and please provide
an example scenario where I would be
using conditional logic and now coming
to functions you could also ask him the
great examples or the simple functions
that could be used in Python and the
importance of
functions so let's write a prompt for
the
function so let's ask him what is a
function in
[Music]
Python and why it is
important so could you
show could you show me how to write
a simple
function so you would see that JT is
generating the response and you know
like how we have customized the chat jpt
and that to in that we have added the
prompt for a beginner level programmer
so he will answer you accordingly as you
will move or progress with the advanced
concepts so it will also answer you in
an advanced manner so the chat jpt has
given us the response and you could see
that he has given us the definition of
function and why functions are important
and the basic syntax of function and the
moreover a great example that is adding
two
numbers and it is explaining the code
line by line and on this topic that is
explaining the code or debugging the
code the chat J is a go to man so you
could ask him any code or you could put
any code and it will debug the code and
guys after learning each concept ask chj
for small coding exercises to reinforce
what you have learned so practice is key
to understanding and you can ask the
chat jbt for small questions and for the
debugging purpose learn to debug simple
errors or you can ask chity to
intentionally introduce a common mistake
in examples and guide you through fixing
it so this will also help you learn
python so after learning the concepts we
can move on to the next step building
projects so after laying a solid
foundation with python fundamentals it's
time to apply your knowledge through
projects projects not only consolidate
your learning but also challenge you to
solve real world problems so we'll see
how you can ask jgb or choose the right
project for your resume or for your
career
purpose so first point would be interest
and complexity so pick projects that
align with your interest and are
slightly above your current skill level
to ensure learning growth and use chat
jbt for ideas if you are unsure where to
start chat jpt can suggest project ideas
based on your interest and skill set so
let's write a prompt and ask J gbt for a
suitable project so we'll ask him that I
am
comfortable with python
Basics and want
to create my
first
project so can you suggest
me
some beginner
level project
ideas that would help me
grow so you could see that CH jpt has
started generating its
response
and you could see that it is breaking
down the project and once you get the
project idea you can ask CH to help you
break it down into manageable task so
you could make it through the beginner
level only and this makes the project
less daunting and more structured and
for the research and resource part you
could ask the chj to provide learning
resources code Snippets and explanations
you don't need to ask all the code you
could ask him that you can provide code
Snippets or where you get stuck you
could just ask him or just provide the
code he will debug for you and provide
the code
Snippets and you could see that the list
has been provided by chat jpt and number
one the list is calculator then to-do
list application then we have budget
tracker simple blog weather application
quiz game web scraper content aggregator
password generator flashcard app for
Learning and if you want to break down
these projects you could ask him what
skills would I need to build these
projects or the particular project and
he will have a list for you so you could
go through the list and if you are
comfortable that you have handson on
these skills you could proceed with that
project or else you could ask him to
explain those Concepts and then you can
proceed with that project and once you
have a working version of your project
ask for feedback chj can give you a
basic review but also consider sharing
your project in coding communities and
you know like the continuous Improvement
is the key use feedback to refine your
project and learning is an iterative
process and for the feedback purpose you
could also write a prompt that I have
completed a basic version of my python
web scraper project and you can provide
the files to the chat gbt and you can
ask him can you provide suggestions for
improvement or additional features or
for the performance optim ization you
could ask him how can I make my python
script more efficient and faster and you
could provide the code after that so if
you have used many for Loops or the
nested Loops so the chair GPT will
answer you with the optimized code so by
building projects you not only reinforce
your python skills but also gain
practical experience solving problems
and working on real world applications
and each project will enhance your
understanding and challenge you to think
critically and boost your problem
solving skill remember the goal isn't
just to complete the project but to
learn and grow through the process and
use J jbt as a resource for ideas
troubleshooting and guidance to bring
your python projects to life now moving
to the next point so the next step for
your Learning Journey would be deepening
your knowledge so once you are
comfortable with python Basics and have
completed a few project it's time to
deepen your knowledge this phase
involves exploring more complex topics
learning Advanced libraries and
understanding best practices in
programming with python and let's see
how you can explore them so we'll now
explore Advanced topics that would be
explore specialized libraries so python
strength lies in its extensive libraries
for different fields such as Jango or
flask for web development pandas and
numpy for data analysis and tensorflow
or py torch for machine learning so
we'll see the best practices and design
patterns and first we'll have a prompt
for the library exploration so we can
ask the chat gyy that I'm interested in
machine learning can you explain how to
get started with tensorflow in Python
and suggest a beginner project so let's
ask him and let's see but it respond to
us that I'm interested in machine
learning can you
explain how to get
started with t of
flow
and suggest a pner
[Music]
project so as chatut will be responding
to us we could have some other problems
also that could be what are some
pythonic best practices I should follow
to write clean and efficient code so
after you have learned the concepts and
build a project now you could go on or
move on to a best pythonic practices
that could help you write clean and
efficient code so you could see that
Chad jity has provided us the
response that is first it has provided
like how to install the tflow library
then explore tensorflow Basics then dive
into neural networks with tensorflow and
then work on a
project so this is the road map to learn
any library and for every step you could
ask chj that can you provide more
information about the step one that
would be understanding the basics of
machine learning so it will have a full
handson and you could follow up with the
chat jity in a conversational way and
you could have more complex prompts to
deepen your knowledge that would be I
want to build a recommendation system
using python so how do I approach this
project and what libraries will I need
and you could just brainstorm before
moving on to a complex project and chat
J will guide you and help help you
brainstorm on that particular project
and if you want to do open source
contribution and there also you can ask
help with the chat JP that would be like
we can write a PR for that that could be
how can I find python open source
projects suitable for beginners to
contribute to and what steps should I
follow to make my first
contribution so these steps will help
you deepen your knowledge with the
python so guys let's move to the next
step that is practice and feedback so as
you progress in your python Journey the
importance of practice cannot be
overstated it cements your knowledge
sharpens your skills and prepares you
for real world challenges so you could
have chat GPT in your pocket and ask for
the daily challenges that would be
regular practice is essential so ask CH
jity for daily or weekly coding
challenges that push your boundaries and
cover a wide range of topics so let's
have a prom for that that would be for
the daily coding challenges so we'll ask
him can you provide daily coding
challenge to intermediate python
developers focused on data structures
let's see but it will respond to us so
can you
provide a daily coding
challenge for intermediate python
developer
focused
on data
structure so let's see what coding
challenge it provide to us and you could
also ask him about improving existing
projects that you could share the
repository link also that you can upload
on GitHub and ask him that I want to add
new features and Implement them so can
you help me with that and you could
like make a list of the suggestions or
the new features and chat G will guide
you through that so you could see that
chat jbt has proved us the response that
is the challenge is merge intervals so
you could see the problem statement here
that is given a collection of intervals
merge all overlapping intervals and for
Simplicity and interval they have given
us and consider to overlapping with
another interval that is C comma D and
they have given the example input and
the example output
and they provided us the guidelines to
go through the question and then we have
the challenge code template it has
provided you the code template so you
don't have to start fresh you could just
add your code in the provided function
here so this is how you could use chare
gbt for practice and feedback that are
the twin pillar of mastering Python and
by engaging in regular coding challenges
seeking constructive feedback and
continuously improving your work based
on this feedback you'll not only sharpen
your technical skills but also cultivate
a growth mindset remember every piece of
code you write and every piece of
feedback you receive is a stepping stone
to becoming a proficient python
developer so now moving to the next step
that is adapting learning strategies so
as you progress in your python Journey
it becomes crucial to adapt your
learning strategies to stay effective
and motivated this involves
personalizing your approach for Learning
and incorporating new models and
leveraging tools chat jpd to address
your evolving needs so here's how we
will refine those techniques that would
be identifying our learning style so the
number one is personalized learning so
understand whether you learn best
through Reading coding watching
tutorials or solving problems so tailor
your study sessions to match your
preferred learning style for maximum
retention so for that you could have a
prompt and ask chj that I learn best
through Hands-On projects so can you
suggest interactive python tutorials or
python based learning resources so chaty
will be there for you and answer your
prompt so let's go for this PR that is I
learn
best through handson
projects can you
suggest
interactive python tutorials
or Project based
videos for my
learning so you could see that it has
started generating the response and you
could have challenges also with the chat
gity that is you could ask him that
gradually increase the complexity of
topics or projects as I am becoming more
comfortable with previous content and
for that also you could have a prompt
that would be I have mastered basic
python syntax and want to challenge
myself more can you suggest intermediate
level or advanced level topics or
projects so this is how you will be
growing in this journey and you could
see that it has started providing the
response with the python tutorials with
intermediate
projects and you could see the list here
and with this step you would also ask
him that here's how I have been learning
python so far so can you suggest
improvements or new strategies based on
my current progress on my current
prompts or the answers so you could ask
the chat J that at what level I am and
how I need to grow more and what's my
current progress so you could see guys
that it has provided all the additional
resources that is if you want some other
projects you can move on to GitHub and
kaggle for the data sets notebooks and
competitions with the community
and now moving to the last step that is
staying motivated and engaged so
maintaining motivation and engagement is
key to sustained learning in Python
Programming so here's how to keep your
spirits high and remain focused with
concise strategies and chat jpt for The
Learning Journey so set achievable goals
so break your Learning Journey into
small manageable goals celebrate each
achievement to keep the momentum and you
could ask the prompts to chat jpt also
that would be you help me set small
weekly goals for improving my python
skills so he will give you a fullprof
plan where you could follow that plan
and have your Learning Journey on a
smooth
process so you could ask him that can
you help
me set
small weekly
goals for improving my python
skills
so you could see that chj has started
generating the response and it will give
you very like the basic and the
achievable road map that would be week
one you could cover the python Basics
week two and follow this and keep
updating chat jpt that I have completed
my day one day two and at the end of the
week ask him that I completed my week
three and then you can deepen your
knowledge with the question round and
the daily challenging round with chj so
you could see guys that it has proved us
the prompt and this is all the road map
that you could follow on and have a good
Learning Journey with Chad JT for python
or any language you want to learn and
