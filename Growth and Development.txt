hi everyone I'm back here so now I'm
going to explain few important topics in
relation to growth and development of
our products so first of all dealing
with growth so basically in this in this
particular topic we need to learn about
individual scientists and what the
tagline they have given for growth so
all the many clinicians have defined
growth in a different phase there is no
universally accepted definition of
growth and these are the following
clinicians which has given or defined
the growth
so please do just have a look okay
don't try to mark up some you you try to
identify the keyword and try to remember
the scientist M so preferably an
increasing in size is called as growth
was given by good scientists so such
questions are most common in this
particular area so please do make a note
about these lines and the scientist
names like simply give the line ok
increasing in size change in the
proportion and prokhor so complexity
which is called as growth was given by
which scientist is a most probably asked
question in this area the next comes is
in most of the cases the growth is just
an increasing in size but there are few
cases where you can see growth can be
regression the best example is the
thymus gland okay which decreases in
size as a synchronous the next comes is
the development okay so these are the
two scientists which has given or
defined the development okay one is
referred to all naturally-occurring
unidirectional changes in the life of an
individual from a single cell which is
as I got initially that is the fusion of
the sperm and OVA which is a cheese
ladder converted into a multifunctional
unit that is the body okay
so todd has given it is progression
towards maturity the next comes is the
differentiation it is changed from
generalized cell or a tissue to more
specialized kind of tissue during the
development initially if we see your
embryonic cells they are generalized
cells later by the stimulus these
generalized cells are differentiated
into different types of cells and each
cell has its specific function similarly
like you we are like dental students
once we are done with BDS it is
something like a generalized thing so
once we are done with the dead videos we
will go to the next level that is MDS
where we are going to convert it to some
speciality okay so this is something
called as differentiation means
converting a generalized stuff into more
specialized stuff okay this is a good
good area where you can see a number of
questions which were previously repeated
an examination point to feel and of
course this is a for Marx question for
us in the university exam ok so growth
doesn't takes place uniformly at all the
time okay it varies at few in a
particular duration of time you'll have
an enormous growth in a particular
duration of travel you'll have less
corrupt okay
there seems to be a period where there
will the acceleration of growth followed
by there will be sudden increase in the
growth or or a slight increase in the
growth it's not constant okay so that
area where there is a sudden increase in
the growth is called as growth spurts so
these are the areas which we have in our
life where there will be an over a
singles one is just before birth and
second one is one here after birth and
the third one is mixed dentition for
boys it is 8 to 11 for girls it is 7 to
9 and pre-pubertal growth spurt that is
in the guys it is 14 to 16 in the girls
it is 11 to 13 years so what is the
clinical importance of this particular
age this particular is is most of your
functional and orthodontic appliances it
is better they show a better response
during this particular age group so
that's the reason buy most of your ortho
treatment are done before the pubertal
growth report the pivotal growth both of
your auditory orthodontic treatments are
done because it encourages or it
responds well for your for your
treatment outcome and for example if you
are planning any surgical Corrections
that includes the maxilla and mandible
they should be carried out only after
completion of these most of your
permanent surgeries in the maxilla and
mandible are done after the growth of
maxilla and mandible preferably after
fourteen to sixteen years of is the next
comes is differential growth as already
discussed growth is not uniform okay it
doesn't grow at the same rate throughout
the life different organs has different
growth and different amount of growth
difference in the size difference in the
time and everything these things are
well explained by these two curves okay
one is cephalo Cardinal curve or
cephalocaudal gradation growth and the
second one is Simon's growth curve so
we'll discuss in detail okay this is the
cephalic what it means how the growth
will be from head to the table okay how
it varies okay this particular growth
simply means that there is an axis there
is an axis in the body in the body there
is an axis in the body which helps in
determining the growth which helps in
determining the growth of an individual
a comparison of body proportions
prenatal postnatal is going to give an
idea of this particular hypothesis for
example if you take the individual
preferably at two or three months of
internal life
had octopus 50% as you can see had
occupying 50% is of the total body
length particularly around three weeks
of through two to three weeks of
internal and life but as at the time of
birth if you see at the time of birth
this is at the time of birth okay
the occupancy of head dropped down to
30% is when it is converting into adult
when it is converting into an adult it
dropped down to 12% this means at three
weeks of three months of Internet and
life the head occupies 50% is where as
at the birth it occupies 30% is okay and
coming to the next level at at at the
puberty at the A's of adult it occupies
only 12% this so there is a decreasing
in the occupancy of the body surface
area or the proportion of the head run
compared to the internal life to the
adult
similarly if you take the the lower limb
okay lower limb in the uterine life the
lower limb is rudimentary okay it
doesn't how your lower limb doesn't have
any aspect it is considered as
rudimentary but as increases the lower
limb occupies more than 50% is you can
see it here it is rudimentary where it
occupies the 50% is this is not only in
in the in the particular tone of the
entire body even if you want you can
compare this okay you can see this okay
there is and growth evidence even in the
head and the face even in the head in
the face at birth okay at Birth the
cranium is is in LA you can see by this
is at Birth the cranium occupies a major
content okay
a major content when compared with the
face which is also less
but as is increases your face will
increase in the proportion when compared
to that of the cranium so this is can be
seen in comparison of the cranium to
that of the face also the next comes is
this this is the growth curve okay
the growth curve so there were few
diagram based questions asked in
relation to this growth curve also they
have simply without giving a title they
have simply label it as a this has B
this as C this as the simple so they
have simply given this diagram and they
have asked you to identify identify
which tissue growth in the particular
growth curve is B or C or T such
question sir can be asked and given once
in the aims examination - okay so let's
go deep into this so this particular
growth or the body of the tissue can be
categorized into four types okay
so type one is lymphoid type 2 is neural
tissue and the third type is either
genital or jungle general tissue and the
fourth one is Kjetil okay you have four
one one is lymphoid tissue second one is
neural tissue third one is general
tissue and fourth one is serrated so the
curve is projected on that it starts
from the birth and it's up to the adult
so what is going to happen because I can
ask questions so lymphoid tissue
pulsates rapidly in the late childhood
and reaches almost 20 percent is sorry
almost 200 percentage of the adult size
when compared to the adult size for
example if you take this lymphoid tissue
this is your lymphoid tissue it grows
grows grows increases in size and it
become 200 times of the adult one this
is that ultra so when compared to the
adult one at late childhood it will be
become 200 times more
this adaptation is basically to protect
because lymphoid and the lymphocytes are
basically to protect the child from
infection so child require more lymphoid
tissue to protect them from infection
and compared to the adult the next comes
is the neural tissue neural tissue grows
very rapidly and reaches the adult size
at six to seven years okay you can see
this neural tissue is growing animosity
and reaches a value which is almost the
same of adult okay at 6 to 7 years of s
this is 6 to 7 years of a is the neural
tissue grows to the size of adult the
next comes is the general tissue okay
you can see the general bond going
steeps again increases so coming to the
general tissue general issue or a
visceral tissue consists of muscles
bones and other organs these tissues
exhibits an S shape we can see an S
shaped here a shape growth okay up to I
mean up to 2 to 3 years of is followed
by a sudden slow growth between 3 to 10
years you have a you have a constant
growth here again further increases okay
so your your general tissue is a shape
growth curve first it increases and has
a constant value again it increases
coming to the genital tissue up to
puberty your genital tissue will be of 0
something like very very less growth
okay but however the growth rapid at the
puberty and reaches the adult size I
hope you are very clear with this curves
okay so most preferably they can ask
your diagram based question just by
giving ABCD and they may ask you to
identify which tissue it is the next
important aspect that we have to make a
note he support this okay
so if you take the mechanism of the
growth of a bone bone can grow either by
deposition the the remodeling of bone is
a combination of deposition and
resorption okay
the position means depositing of bone
resorption means this option so
combination of these two is called as
bone remodeling okay and the second one
is the change that occurs in the bone
okay that change the changes that the
bone deposits entries resorption can
produce the following changes one is
changing the size the second one is
changing the shape the third one is
changing the proportion and the fourth
one is changing the relationship of bone
to the adjacent structures so all these
are most commonly seen so here in this
content you have to learn about two
different terms one is drift and second
one is displacement and displacement is
again of two types one is primary
displacement and the second one is
secondary displacement so coming to the
drift the drift is nothing but a
cortical drift most of the bones grows
by interplay of bone
deposition and resorption so whenever a
combination of deposition and resorption
occur there will be result in the
movement of the bone towards the deposit
area that is a positive area so this
change this change of displacement is
called as cortical drift okay the next
one next one is the important term that
is displacement so as already discussed
displacement can be either primary or
secondary primary displacement is
basically due to the growth of the old
structure which is leading to the
displacement the best example is the
growth of the maxilla the maxillary
growth because of the growth at the
tuberosity reason the growth at that
shoe broster is
is what is doing it is pushing the
mandible forward and downward so this is
primarily because the movement or the
primary displacement is basically due to
its one growth and the secondary is if
the bone get displaced as a result of
the growth and the enlargement of the
adjacent bone because of the addition
bone if it is get displaced then it is
called as secondary displacement the
best example is the growth of the
cranium here the cranium is getting is
grown and and it is pushing the mandible
forward and downward so a magazine
laughs our word and downward this moment
is called as secondary displacement so
please try to differentiate the primary
and secondary displacement because these
are the areas which are really focused
in the recent aimed section the next
important aspect is about this okay so
this is they can give you a diagram
based and loss principle and loss
expansion principle okay here a v-shape
one the inner surface of the v-shaped is
deposition and outer surface of the
v-shaped is the desorption okay simple
very simple and most of the structures
in the body they follow this V principle
ok the inside is the deposition the
outside is the resorption and this V
pattern is followed in number of reasons
okay you can add these examples because
these examples are most commonly asked
that is the base of the mandible second
one is ends of
long bones
and the third one is mandibular body
and the fourth one is the the palate
okay so these are the areas where you
can see this type of the type of
expansion or V type of bone formation in
the growth okay I'm done for now
so we'll be continuing in the next
session
