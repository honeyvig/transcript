so let's start by knowing what is search
console
google search console formerly known as
google webmaster tool is a web service
provided by google developers
google search console is mainly
responsible
for optimizing a website for its
visibility
indexing website
detecting crawl errors etc
after understanding what is google
search console
now we need to focus on why search
console is an important part of search
engine optimization
a website's technicalities are directly
or indirectly related to search console
consider you have created a website for
your business
but from past few weeks your website is
not visible in search result pages here
search console comes into action
there is a possibility that search
engine crawlers are not able to crawl
your website
thus it is not visible in the search
result pages
to make crawlers crawl your website you
will need to optimize your website using
search console
some other technical aspects of search
console includes
fixing indexing problems
sending the updated content or pages for
indexing
generating search traffic reports
generating alerts
if there are any issues
related to indexing or any other issue
gets the list of sites linking to your
website
keep the track of mobile usability
amp pages
and more
so now it is the right time to
understand how search console works
but before we begin this topic
have a look at the range of courses
of digital marketing and search engine
optimization from skillup by simplyland
you can get the link in the description
box below
so now i have a question for you
what will you do at first
if your web page fails to appear in
search result pages
well let me know your thoughts in the
comment section below
stay tuned with this video
even though if you don't have the answer
right now by the end of this video you
will surely able to answer this question
so let's get started by knowing how
search console works
to understand the working of search
console it is necessary to have a
detailed knowledge about how search
engine works search engines mainly works
in three steps crawling indexing and
ranking
let's have a look at each step one by
one
so first let's start with crawling
search engines are hungry for content
and so they send web spiders or web
crawlers also known as robots or search
engine bots to discover new content or
any updated content
content can be an image a web page a
video or anything else present on the
web this process is known as crawling
now let's know about indexing
as soon as the crawler discover the
updated content or new content
these web crawlers start storing the
urls of the content into the search
index or web index
this process is known as indexing once
the content is indexed it starts
appearing in the search result pages
when a user enters a search query the
most relevant results
are taken from the index
and displayed in the form of most
relevant to least relevant in the search
result pages this process is known as
ranking
now that we have gained knowledge about
how search engine works here i have a
question for you
choose the correct option with respect
to working of search engines
you need to choose the option
for all the steps of how search engines
work
option a indexing crawling ranking
option b
ranking indexing crawling
option c
crawling indexing ranking and option d
crawling ranking and indexing
let us know your answer in the comment
section below
now let's get started by learning how
search console actually works
search console is a primary source of
information
that helps search engine bots to crawl
index and rank the pages of your website
thereby allowing the website owners to
monitor the health of your website
all you need to do is
integrate search console with your
website and get the ownership
allow the search engine birds to crawl
your website
and index the pages
also don't forget to submit your website
site map to search engines submitting
site maps helps the crawler to discover
more pages of your website
thereby understanding your site's
architecture
we will know how it is done in the
upcoming part of the video
also you need to keep an eye on the
errors suggested by search console and
solve them else it may harm the ranking
of your website
now let me remind you that all the
reports that are generated in search
console are based on the activity of the
web crawlers on your website
now let's understand various parameters
and terminologies from search console
to get a complete understanding of this
webmaster tool
so without any further delay let's start
understanding the basic terminologies of
google search console
and how they work
and improve your website's health
the first one we have is performance
reports
google search console provides two types
of performance report search reports and
discover reports
let's first understand about search
reports
search reports help to analyze the
search performance of your website
search performance reports include
metrics and dimensions
so let's first focus on metrics
here there are four types of metrics
as you can see in this image
the metrics include the total clicks or
i must say clicks impressions
average ctr and average position
impressions provides the data on how
many times your websites appears in the
search results
as you can see here
the graph shows the number of times this
website has appeared in the search
results
the next metric we have is clicks
clicks provide the data on the total
number of times users clicked from the
search results and reached your website
the graph below shows the number of
times the users have clicked from search
results and they have arrived on any
page of my website so suppose if here is
a number 200
so we can definitely get an idea
for very number of dates number of dates
provided on the x-axis which shows that
how many times
the user has clicked and arrived on the
website and the number where is in
varies from between like 200 200
uh 250 300 and in between 250 to 300
and the next metric we have is average
ctr
average ctr or click-through rate is the
percentage of impressions that results
in clicks
in the same manner the graph below shows
the average ctr for various different
dates
the next metric we have is
average position the average position
represents the data about the average
position of the sites in the search
results
it is possible that your website is
ranking today at number one position so
it may rank tomorrow at three some other
day at four some other day at nine or
ten and again it may rank to the one so
this data actually provides the detail
about the average position
uh which your website frequently ranks
at
so that is if it is ranking at one two
and three in between one two and three
positions so the average position may be
two
now understanding about the dimensions
dimensions are the data attribute that
defines who did something on your site
or from where
here is the list of dimensions on which
the dimension performance reports are
generated that is
the countries pages queries
devices search appearance and dates
the dimension country suggests the
country from which the search came
as you can see here from the
left column you can get the list of
number of countries from the right side
you can get the idea about the clicks
impressions ctr and position that is all
the metrics related to that query uh
from which the search came from or from
that location
or whatever the activity has happened
from that location
next we have is the dimensions pages
pages show the pages clicked by user or
a page that is viewed on a search
so
this this actually you get the reports
from the search console in the form of
the links where you get the link which
is the exact page
that is viewed on the search
if there exists duplicate pages on the
site then only one canonical page or
canonical link will be displayed by the
search engines out of the number of
duplicate pages so basically canonical
links are those links
uh like if there are suppose
there is a one original page and there
are two three duplicate page of the same
page so what happens uh
the original page gains the canonical
link and
this page has more value than the
duplicate pages
so whenever the search engine will crawl
your website all the duplicate pages may
be ignored and all its
link juice or link equity or anything
will be
completely taken for the original page
moving ahead to queries
queries provide the query string that
users search on the google search
console
so suppose there is a website say
suppose uh
let's talk about the simply learn
website so suppose a user may
add as java course and simply learn
websites appears at second or third
position
so this query
says suppose user clicks on the website
and reaches the website this query java
course on simply learn or java course
will add in the search console
showing that the user has reached to
your website using
this query java course
and again all the list of the queries
appears towards the left and all the
matrixes for that query like clicks
impressions ctr and its average position
is appeared towards the right in the
search console
now talking about the search appearance
search appearance helps in grouping the
data as per the search result type or by
the feature
so you can get here the number of search
appearance and again the same matrixes
uh with respect to the search appearance
criteria next let's move towards the
dates
dates groups the data as per the dates
according to the public time zones now
let's have a look over the discover
performance report
now here you must be thinking
about how the search is different from
discover
yes search and discover follow different
approaches
users enter a query to find a required
information with search
whereas
discover shows the content based on what
result will be best match for your query
as per the google's automated system
now coming to the discover performance
report as per google's guidelines
discover performance reports are visible
only if your website has a minimum
threshold of impressions in discover
now moving to another important
parameter of search console which is url
inspection
url inspection is an interesting tool in
the search console
this tool allows you to inspect whether
the url is indexable or not
some main functions of this tool
includes
checking the current status of the url
inspecting live urls requesting indexing
for a url
viewing pages rendered version
viewing crawled pages
viewing tested pages
etc in order to check the index status
of url
open the url inspection tool
and add the complete url
for which we need to know its indexing
status
now to understand the results check the
present status
if it shows that url is on google as you
can see in the screen
this means that url qualifies google's
criteria and is eligible to appear in
search results
if it shows url is not on google
then the url does not qualify the
google's criteria
and is not eligible to appear in search
results
you can check more details like url
discovery crawl and indexing information
from the page availability tab
click on the crawl page to see the
information about the http request and
response
if you find that the link is disabled
just hover over the page to check the
reason
now coming to the live url test
it is helpful to test the live url and
check if it is capable of being indexed
it proves helpful
when you update your page and want to
compare it with its latest indexed
version just to bring it to your notice
a live test will only confirm whether
the google crawler can access your page
for indexing but it doesn't assure that
your page will be included in the google
index
altogether with the help of index
coverage report one can find the list of
urls which includes the urls google has
found on your website the urls that have
been indexed and identify if any
indexing problem have occurred
next we move ahead to understand about
the site maps
a site map is the file that contains all
the information of pages on your website
this helps search engine crawlers
to crawl your website and understand
your website structure
and helps them to index the pages more
efficiently
more the crawler indexes your pages
higher the chances for the pages of your
website to appear in the search results
with the help of site maps you can
provide information about various
contents like pages videos images etc
as you can understand a site map plays
an important role in indexing process
you must be curious to know how we can
create and submit a sitemap to search
engines
before we understand this process make
sure that all pages of your website are
linked in an appropriate manner with
each other thereby maintaining a healthy
site structure
a site map can be created in xml format
rss format or in text format
it can be auto generated or created
manually as well
most commonly used
site map is xml
following is an example of an xml site
map
this is the simplest version of the site
map that we are representing here
you can submit a site map to the sitemap
reports in the search console
however site maps can also be submitted
through
robots.txt file
let's understand about
robots.txt file
so let's understand the robots.txt file
in short
robots.txt file notifies the web
crawlers
about the urls that they can access on
the website as there are lots of search
engines
there exist different web crawlers thus
there is a possibility that some web
crawlers may not obey the instructions
from the robots.txt file
it is necessary to know how to use the
proper syntax as different crawlers
understand syntax differently
thus there are chances that some web
crawlers might fail to understand the
instructions from the robots.txt file
a page can be indexed even if it is
disallowed from the robots.txt file if
it is linked
to other site
next let's know what enhancement reports
are
all the rich results status reports are
displayed under the enhancement tab
so let's know more about rich results
these type of results are known as rich
results in serps so basically rich
results can be any search results other
than the traditional blue links for
example image results carousels etc
you can check whether the pages from
your website support rich results or not
using the rich result test tool provided
by google developers
now understanding the rich result status
report the enhancement tab contains
separate reports for rich result type
some rich result report types are listed
below that are
breadcrumbs education q a event faq
fact check guided recipe
how to
image license
job posting
learning video review snippets etc
rich results status reports consist of
summary page and details page
the summary page mainly consists of
errors useful items found on your
website
warnings etc the details page consists
of the information about the issues
when it was detected item type when was
the page last scrolled etc
before we understand how to fix error in
search console it is important to
understand the status of each page as
reported by search console
each page has any of the following
status error
warning excluded and valid
if the status of the page is valid it
means
the page has successfully indexed
the status of the page appears to be
excluded
if one purposefully wants the page not
to be indexed
or a page is blocked by robots.txt
file
for example setting the meta tag to no
index
warnings majorly appears
when the page of your website is indexed
but there are some issues with the page
which needs your attention
and have to be resolved as soon as
possible
if the page's status is error
then
there is a need to pay a detailed
attention over the issues in the page as
these issues prevent the page from
getting indexed
let's discuss about the errors in detail
and how we can fix them
some popular errors from the search
console are listed below
that is the redirect error
server error submitted urls blocked by
robots.txt txt
url marked as no index
submitted url is a soft 4.0
for not poor or page not found error
so let's first know about the redirect
error
some redirect error
that search control shows up are the
redirect chain that was too long
redirect rule
redirect url that exits maximum url
length and bad or empty url in the
redirect chain
so all these error means that the
redirections are not working properly
and so there is a need to fix them
so suppose for example you have added
too many redirects
from one page to another
so in this scenario
search engine bots find it a waste of
time to crawl again and again to the
same redirections and at that time the
search engine crawlers or search engine
bots ignore those urls or redirections
so in such cases you need to fix those
redirection to a single url
the next we have is server error
the server returns 5x error when it
fails to fulfill a valid request this
error mainly conveys that something is
wrong with your website server all you
need to do is reach out to your hosting
services
and inform them about the issue and make
sure it gets resolved as soon as
possible
the next one we have is submitted url
blocked by
robots.txt to resolve this issue you
need to remove the line of code from the
robot.txt file that restricts
google from crawling the respective page
the next we have is url marked as no
index
when a url is marked as no index it
sends the signal to crawlers that this
page is not meant to be crawled or this
page is not meant to be indexed if you
want this page to be indexed check the
metadata and remove the no index
attribute
to allow the crawlers to crawl the url
now let's understand about the error
submitted url is a soft 404
and 4.4 or page not found error
whenever a web page load server returns
a 2 0 0 signal showing the success
status code
sort 4 note 4 is a condition
in which server returns 2 0 0 success
status code and the page note exist
errors simultaneously
this is considered to be a bad user
experience
this error can be solved simply by
redirecting this page to any relevant
url
or the home page of the website
talking about 404 or page not found
error
this error mainly occurs
when you delete the page from your
website but the url of the page still
exists in the site map
this error can be solved by simply
removing the url
or removing the 4.4 url from the site
map or redirecting the url to a new page
this will help to avoid the further
errors in near future
we will have a detailed look at other 4x
errors in the upcoming videos

search console
