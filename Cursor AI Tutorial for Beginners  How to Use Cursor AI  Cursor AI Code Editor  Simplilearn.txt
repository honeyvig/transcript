today I will tell you a story of a guy
named Leo Leo a young software engineer
with Big Dreams he loved building things
mobile apps web platforms and even small
games but coding was tricky even for
someone as skilled as Leo no matter how
much experience he had he kept running
into bugs and inefficiencies that made
his applications crash or run slowly he
would spend hours staring at his
computer screen debugging line after
line of codes trying to figure out where
things went wrong one day Leo heard
about cursor AI a powerful code editor
that could help him code faster and
smarter and like regular code editors
cursor AI didn't just highlight errors
it understood the code deeply it could
analyze problems suggest better
Solutions and even write sections of
code for him feeling curious Leo decided
to give it a try he opened cursor Ai and
loaded his project which had been stuck
for days due to a tricky bug almost
instantly Cur flagged the error in the
code and suggested an efficient fix not
only that it also recommended a cleaner
way to structure his code making it
easier to read and less prone to Future
bugs Leo followed the suggestions and
his app started running flawlessly in
fact cursor AI helped him optimize the
entire project making the application
faster and smoother than before Tas that
would usually take hours like debugging
refactoring and testing were now
completed in minutes before I tell you
that you too can code in minutes like
Leo just for your

the AI driven future do unlock your
future opportunities and take the next
step in your AI journey in this video I
will let you know what cursor AI is and
your ultimate guide to use it as a
beginner so let's jump into the video
let us understand what is cursor AI
cursor AI is a smart coding assistant
that speeds up your workflow by
suggesting code completions fixing bugs
and optimizing code in real time it
supports multiple languages helps with
code reviews and even generate
documentation making coding faster
easier and more efficient for developers
of all levels well after we have a basic
understanding of cursor AI let us
Explore More I will first take you to
the browser and in that you need to
search for cursor
Ai and the first official website that
will appear is www.ccs.com
you need to click on it and obviously
download it it is a free and you need to
sign in as you are using their model so
it is very important to log in before uh
exploring their model after you download
and install it I will show you what
screen you're going to get yeah this is
the visual representation of cursor AI
the code editor and it somewhat looks
like vs code code if you have seen vs
code before it almost looks like this
this is basically your project section
and yeah obviously file edit selection
view go run and everything so initially
it is very important to start with the
basics so obviously you're using a new
application for the first time it is
very important to learn the uh cursor
settings so to see the cursor settings
for that press command shift plus P
command shift plus P yeah see it will
direct you to a menu bar on the top of
the application and search there as
cursor settings see it is already
available so cursor settings so
basically cursor setting has four types
of settings General models features and
beta so initially start with this
General uh account basically it the
account shows like through what GMail
account you have logged in and um
currently I'm using this Pro trial and
it is basically of two weeks I guess for
free and after that if you want to use
it then you can use it like upgrading to
Pro and after that there is vs code
import uh this is basically for uh like
if you have vs code in this in this
particular laptop or um system you're
using then you can obviously import the
type of uh like um extensions or key
bindings you have there you can
generally import it and after that comes
rules for AI this is basically the
section where you can like tell or
instruct the cursor AI what are the
things you want or even what are the
things you don't want like for example
you working on a particular project and
you only want to like use a particular
language then you can just type there
like I will show you use
only
reactjs so basically you can write there
and it will automatically get saved but
obviously I won't be using that and
after that comes the a very important
part there is a privacy mode it is
already written if on none of your code
will be stored by us if of we may save
prompts or collect Telemetry data to
improve cursor so obviously I don't want
my data to get to them so obviously I
have enabled it if you have no problem
in showing your data to the cursor soon
you can obviously disable it then I will
show you about the
models this is basically the section
where you can see what are the type of
models API models you're using or in
getting used and even you can even add
your own model and see like open AI API
key anthropic API key Google API oh wow
this is nice Azure API key they're
almost there let's come to Beta this is
basically a section where if any of the
new features like uh get upgraded in
cursor I then you can obviously see it
over here and uh it is like a default
setting is disable so let it be like
don't have to uh do anything so after
you have seen the cursor uh settings I
will take you to see the actual uh
presentation where you can actually code
more faster than any of the editors so I
will take you to see a magic so let's
start so I will cross
it I will now show you why cursor AI is
the next code editor for that press
control shift I and you can see the
composer it is named as composer you can
write your any instructions or comments
that you want cursor AI to execute so
basically you can give prompts like
create a particular website for me using
this this this so I will let you
understand with an example
create a simple Retro
Game
using
HTML
CSS and
JavaScript I hope it does an
enter see it has even started to build
this
game pong style retro style pong game
using HTML CSS and JavaScript okay it
has already made
index.html and it has been building with
uh JS I mean JavaScript okay it has only
used HTML and JavaScript okay I want it
to
use
use CSS
2 for
better
appearance obviously CSS is the thing
you need
to okay it has already started
link okay here's a code for the
game okay maybe some confusion has
occurred
okay okay it has used CSS as
a
okay it has not made a different file so
I wanted to make CSS as a different file
I want a
separate file for
CSS okay now
see it
has actually executed what I
said
okay now after you have got
it you can just accept
all and see if it is actually working or
not so let's start accept all after that
you can close this composer window and
you will find that uh files already in
your project section
see it is there if you want to like Run
the game and see if it is actually
getting and the code is running or not
and the uh game is playable or not you
need to download uh one extension
yeah here uh like live
server yeah I have already installed it
you need to just install it and you can
you are ready to
go let's come back and right click on
the index. HTML and open with live
server okay see it's nice oh wow move
your mouse up and down to control the
left paddle first to 10 points
first to 10 points win
okay this is nice so I want basically my
game it is uh glowing yeah so I want to
use one
th so see if it
can let's see after the game is
basically Med you can just use your
imagination or your creativeness on how
you can design your game so control
shift
I
yeah the wow the game is nice I don't
know why I'm appreciating but yes you
need to appreciate because it did so
much work for you wow the game is nice I
want
you to
use Harry Potter
theme I think everyone knows Harry
Potter and and I don't I wanted
basically to use Harry Potter
thing in the
game and
submit so it has
started formulating it I think it is
nice now okay accept
all and now you can cross it and let's
see open with live
server wow see
oh it is nice see it is almost green and
yellow the type of that is used in Harry
Potter and everything see it is nice and
it is also written golden snitch wow it
is nice so basically you can do anything
you can even use a particular type of uh
like font you can do anything let's see
how we can improve it control shift I
yeah this is
nice can you just
use the font
style used
in Harry
Potter movie I hope it does
enter I
understand yeah it is trying because of
the copyright maybe it fully can't but
yeah it is trying let's see accept all
cross it and right click and open with
live
server
okay maybe there a difference there
there is a difference I can see
fine it is
nice ah so in this way you can just
command it and do anything you can even
like attach files I guess you can over
here you can just uh um use adate and
you can uh like upload files folders
code web like the you can uh you can
adate web and you can even uh tell uh it
to take a picture from the website and
replicate it use that that for reference
and anything so it basically depends
upon your designing and your
creativeness how you want to make it and
it will just code for you this is the
power of AI so you can do anything over
here I believe it will help you to code
much much much faster so this we have
