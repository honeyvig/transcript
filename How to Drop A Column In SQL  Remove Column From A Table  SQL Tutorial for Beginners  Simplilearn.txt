table
now let's quickly take a look at the
syntax that we will be following to
execute this particular command
the syntax is as follows we will be
using the alter table keyword then the
table name way we want to eliminate the
column followed by that the drop column
keyword and the column name now let's
get back to these equal workmans to
execute this particular command now here
on the SQL workbench and you can see we
have five different columns over here
and we have the phone number column
which does not have anything now we will
try to eliminate this particular phone
number column since we do not need that
for our purposes now the command is
really simple as discussed before we
will be using the alter table keyword
and the table name and the drop column
keyword and the phone number which is
the column name now let's quickly
execute this particular command and see
the output there you go now the column
phone number has been successfully
eliminated now let's run the select
command once again and see the new table
there you go the phone number column has
been successfully eliminated now with
