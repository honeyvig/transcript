video we will see how to install express
js on windows machine but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
channel already make sure to hit the
subscribe button and press the bell icon
so you will never miss any update from
simply learn
so without further ado let's begin
first we need to download node.js
because express is a framework of
node.js
so without installing node
we cannot run express in my system i
have already installed node.js
you can search for node.js
node.js
now here
you'll find downloads
you can download node from here
and install it
but if you find any difficulties
downloading node.js you can click on the
link in the right corner to see how to
download node.js
now let's see the version for node to
verify here i am using visual studio
code you can go and search it and simply
download vs code
after opening your visual studio code
it will look like this
here
you will find a terminal click on it
the terminal window will open
here we will write node
hyphen b
this will show us the latest version of
node.js
now we need to update the npm which is
node packet manager this bundle consists
of all the repositories and packages
required for development purposes to do
that
npm install npm globally
nvm
install
npm
hyphen globally
this will download all the npm packages
globally now let's create express
for that first we need to create a
separate folder where we will keep all
the modules and files of express.js
let's clean this
tls
you can open the terminal by clicking on
the shortcut also by pressing control
and backtick
that will open the terminal for you
let's make a folder
mkdir
this is a command that is used to create
a folder on the terminal
then we will write our file name i will
write express
by
simply learn
enter
here you can see the file name expressed
by simply none has been created
you can also click here
and enter your file name
m.js
press enter
as you can see a new file has been
created
now we need to install a package manager
that is npm
we will write a npm command
open your terminal again
write a command
npm
init
enter
enter
version enter description and
description you can write express
tutorial
by
simply learn enter
enter
enter
hit repository if you have your git
repository you can add yours enter
enter
author
we learn
license enter
press yes
after this
you can see npm created a json file
now we will finally install express.js
we will write
npm
install
express
enter
now as you can see our express is
installed in our system
let's open the app.js that we have
created earlier
now
we will create a express application
with the help of express functions that
we can do by requiring the express
modules let's create our first program
first
constant
express
require
express
in this line we are requiring the
express module
const
l name equals to
function
express
dot get
to get the file
request response
to get the request and the response
of the user
function
we will need to pass callback function
here
let's write
response send
this message
will be shown
in the server
welcome
to
welcome to simply learn
now here
we will write a port number where the
message will be shown to us
at dot lesson
four thousand
you can write anything
here also
we are passing the callback function
console.log
in console.log we will see the message
in the console
listening to port
number
4000
close this line
save this
let's run it open your terminal new
terminal
now to run this file
we need to go to the express
folder
cd
express
by
simply learn
we are now in a simply learn folder
now
the easiest way is to write the file
name
write node
space
the file name app.js
enter
now you can see it is printing our
message listening to port 4000
now we will see a message on the server
open your chrome
type
localhost 4000
press enter
and here we go a message is successfully
displayed welcome to simply learn
