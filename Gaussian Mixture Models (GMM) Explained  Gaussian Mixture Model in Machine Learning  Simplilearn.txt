a gajan mixture model also known as GMM
is a statistical model used to describe
data distribution it assumes that the
data can be represented as a combination
of multiple gajin distribution models
each with its own mean and variance in
practice this means we can model complex
distributions such as the distribution
of test scores or income by combining
multiple simple distributions such as a
distribution of test scores for boys and
for girls using GMM to model
distribution allows us to capture the
complexity of the data and describe it
more accurately this can be particularly
useful in machine learning applications
where we often deal with complex and
high-dimensional data sets so let's gain
a deeper understanding of gajan mixture

below now let's get to our video and
learn just what a God mixture model
is a gajan mixture model is a
probabilistic model representing data as
a mixture of multiple gajan
distributions it it's a mixture model
because it assumes that data points are
generated from a mix of gajan
distribution each associated with a
certain
probability in GMM each gajan
distribution represents a component or
cluster within the data the model
assumes that the data points within each
cluster are erated from a gajin
distribution with its mean and
co-variance the GMM which is known as
gajin mixture model combines these
component distributions with mixture
weight to form the overall probability
distribution of the data so now let's
see the key components of gajan mixture
model number one is the number of
components also known as clusters the
GMM assumes that the data is a mixture
of a specific number of G distributions
also known as components or clusters the
number of components is typically
determined in advance or estimated by
using techniques such as model
selection next we have gajan
distribution each component in the GMM
is represented by a gajan distribution a
gajian distribution also known as normal
distribution is a bell-shaped curve
fully described by its mean and
co-variance the represents the center of
the distribution and the covariance
determines the spread or
shape third is mixtures weights the GMM
assigns mixtures weights to each
component representing the probability
of selecting that component when
generating a data point these weights
must sum up to one the mixture will
determine the collaboration of each
component to the overall distribution so
using a gaj and mixture model involves
estimating the model parameters
including the means covariant and
mixture weights this is typically done
through an interactive optimization
algorithm like the expectation
maximization algorithm the EM algorithm
alternates between estimating the
responsibilities of each component for
each data point and updating the model
parameters based on the
responsibilities the algorithm continues
until convergence where the parameters
reach a stable State once the GMM is
trained it can be used for various tasks
for example it could be applied to
clustering by assigning data points to
the most likely component or cluster it
can also be used for density estimation
where it estimates the underlying
probability distribution of the data now
let's see some real world examples where
gajan mixture models can be used gajan
mixture models also known as gmms are
versatile tools that find applications
in various world world scenarios they're
particularly useful when dealing with
large data sets where identifying
clusters is challenging gmms excel at
efficiently discovering clusters of
gajan outperforming testing algorithms
like K
means now here are some practical
examples of how gajian mixture models
can be applied the first one is medical
data set analysis gajan mixture models
can single out medical images or
identify patterns within data sets by
clustering patients based on similar
symptoms gmms can assist in detecting
diseases subtypes predicting outcomes
and revealing correlations and
previously unknown patterns in large
scale patient
records next we have modeling natural
phenomena gmms are suitable for modeling
natural phenomena where gajan
distribution are observed in the noise
this modeling approach assumes an
underlining unobserved entities or
attributes which measurements are taken
at Central points across multiple
observation sessions next we have
customer Behavior Analysis gin mixture
models are valuable in marketing for
analyzing customer behavior and by
leveraging historical data gmms can
predict future purchases enabling
businesses to tailor the market
strategies and become more
efficient next is stock price prediction
bu mixture models find applications in
finance especially in analyzing stock
price time series they can identify
challenge points within the data helping
detect turning points in stock prices or
other Market movements that might be
obscured by vulnerability and
noise next we have gene expression data
analysis gmms are employed in gene
expression data analysis they can be
utilized to identify differentially
expressed genes between two conditions
and determine which genes make you
susceptible to specific phenomena types
or disease
States now let's see the implementation
of a gajan mixture model to do this we
have a small demo I've have taken the
iris data set okay in Python there's a
gajan mixture class to implement
gmn load that Iris data set and then we
are all good to go so the first thing
we're going to do is import our number
NP which is a library of python okay so
we'll write import
numpy as
NP in the next line then we have to
import uh Panda so we'll write
import
Panda
as
PD and after that we'll import map plot
lib we right
import and
plot
lib do
py
LT as BL
T
okay all right that looks good
now we'll write uh
[Music]
from
andas and we'll import
Port data
[Music]
frame
okay after that from psyit learn which
is sklearn we will
import data sets so from sklearn
do import data set
okay and then from SK
learn Dot
[Music]
mixture and
import caution
mixture now we'll load the iris data set
so for that we'll write Iris
equals and then data set that we just
now imported from sklearn we'll write
data sets do
load because we need to load that data
and we'll write this
uh function
sign after that we'll give
it variable X and
iris.
data
brackets so the semicolon we just wrote
is for everything like like all the data
when we have to show all the data we'll
write this imagine there is an array of
seven things 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
okay and you want everything of that
array so if we use this
keyword and if you want to say out of
that seven if you only want five we'll
write that here comma then we'll write
two so what this will show is only five
0 1 2 3 4 okay now we'll
write uh D which is which is pd. data
frame and you'll see we get the data
frame from
X it will just declare so this is for
the uh to turn the data frame for like
turning my data into a data frame okay
now we have to plot the data for that
we'll write uh plot.
scatter and then we'll write d
of
zero of
one okay then we'll
say plot
Jo so now let's see if this works or
not okay so it's showing me one error
let's see okay I got it my
mistake now let's run it again shows mat
plot lib error
again let's
see uh
like spelling mistake here okay let's
give it a try again and another
error
okay gosh and mixture should be a
capital everything looks fine this time
so now you can see the data now you see
the data of these flowers iris flowers
you can see it's like everything is
mixed and you can't identify which one
is which and you can't identif the exact
things that you want to see in this
data so for that gajin mixture model
comes in so with this method we'll see
the difference between the things that
we want to see in the
data okay so we'll click on the plus
sign and we write GMM equals caution
mixture the sign and soon yeah soon it's
showing us again in
then components equals
three so we'll find the GMM model for
this data set and with three gajan
distributions so that we can see the
different colors for every data set in
this so we'll give
gm. fit and the data
frame all the
data and now we will just assign a label
to each sample okay so for that we'll
write label
equals
GMM dot
predict the DAT data now give this data
a
label and we'll make that
D
label
equals okay
and going write
D
zero and we'll give this d0
label so we can identify it later and
know which one is our
data
so we'll again right labels
equals 0
okay this one is for
zero and we'll just copy this and paste
it three times yeah so because we have
said three components if if we wanted it
to do more than that we could as well so
we would just have to change these
values now to D1 and
D2 and then here also we have to change
the values or the output will not look
like we want the output
to okay so now that we've assigned the
labels we'll move uh
forward and we'll plot three clusters in
the same
plot okay so for that we'll write plot
do
scatter from
d0 comma d0 and then
one we'll make
this red
you have to write this so the color will
be shown on the
screen okay so then we can just copy
this
line and paste it one two and three so
we'll change the value here of D to D1
and
D2 and then we'll change the color too
so let's make
it uh
blue and green okay everything looks
good now let's execute
this
and you'll see what I missed
here have to change color of this so
let's make it
yellow now we'll execute
it
okay there you go
and then just take a look here now you
can see we have the output and you can
clearly see the difference in the data
which was previously shown like this
where we can't see the data for what it
is but now with the gge and mixture
method we can see all the outputs in
different colors so we can say that this
method helps us very much and then we
could print the coverage log like hold
value and number of iterations needed
for the model
okay so we need to execute a little more
code to get the value of
that so for that we'll write print gajan
mixture model
lower
bound and then we'll
write uh
print
GMM do iter
yeah okay now let's run this and now you
have the output data and it's the value
of that output so hence there are like
uh seven iterations for the log like
hold to cover it so in summary uh the
gajan mixture model represents data as a
mixture of gajan distribution model the
model parameters including the number of
components mean covariant and mixture
weights are estimated using techniques
like the expectation maximization
algorithm uh the mixture model can be
used for clustering data in two groups
and estimating the probability density
function of the data so with this we've
