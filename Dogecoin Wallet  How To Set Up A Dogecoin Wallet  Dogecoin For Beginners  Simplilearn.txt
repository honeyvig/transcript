blockchain technology also it provides
its users a completely unknown
decentralized and secure environment

dogecoin address which is a long area of
characters that starts from capital d
followed by any other capital character

and voila buy dodge coins so that brings
us to what is dogecoin wallet
a dogecoin wallet is something where you
can stop store receive or send dogecoins
technically it is very similar to a real
live wallet
dogecoin wallet consists of its public
and private key connecting it to the
distributed ledger over the dogecoin
network
you can use your wallet's public key
which also functions as your coin
address for your bank account number for
dogecoin where anyone can track the
transactions made by maintaining the
anonymity of the user
the private key of your wallet is used
to approve transactions in the ledger
your wallet's public key is used to
receive doj coins from other users on
the other hand your wallet's private key
is only used to send torch points to
other users in the network so what are
the types of dogecoin wallet
doch coin wallet is of two types
digital dot coin wallet
and physical dodge point wallet digital
doj coin wallet is accessible through
the web and you can also download it
according to your handset or operating
system
on the other hand physical dojo and
wallets are pretty expensive and less
accessible
so moving on let's see how to create a
dogecoin wallet
to create a coin wallet for yourself you
will have to go through the following
steps
step one choose the correct wallet
dotecoin core wallet and multi-touch

wallet as reference
step 2 download and install the dogecoin
wallet in your handset

this wallet for your windows

very bottom of the home page of your
wallet there are two options

dogecoin so popular
despite being in tough competition with
other strong cryptocurrencies like
bitcoin dogecoin has never missed an
opportunity to be in the limelight
dogecoin's popularity is mainly
attributed to its vast and dedicated
community other than that social
platforms like reddit and twitter also
promoted dogecoin to a great extent due
to its fun factor and the whole joke
story behind it

elon musk also started taking an
interest in dogepoint and posting

media handles which increased the craze
