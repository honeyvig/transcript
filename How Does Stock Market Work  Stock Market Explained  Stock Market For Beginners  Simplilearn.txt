prior to the era of colonization many
people began exploring the ocean and the
cultures residing across them history
highlighted this era as a golden age of
discovery which led to the development
of international trade via sea voyages
dutch east india company was the first
to launch this business of exploration
they employed hundreds of ships to
acquire and trade gold porcelain spices
and silks around the globe but running
these massive operations wasn't cheap
unfortunately the company lacked funds
to support these trips at the beginning
and hence they publicly invited private
citizens to invest money in their ships
in exchange for a share of ships profit
the company held open bidding events at
the docks so that any citizen could
easily invest their money
this strategy enabled the corporation to
finance bigger excursions boosting
earnings for both the company and the
astute investors
within a few years this approach grew
increasingly popular among other firms
since with this business model common
people easily supplemented the money
crunch faced by the companies
with this approach the dutch east india
company became the richest organization
the world has ever seen holding a value
of 7.9 trillion dollars
this unknowingly invented business model
by the dutch east india company is
referred to as the stock market today
however the modern stock market is
increasingly more complicated than its
original incarnation and difficult to
comprehend
so to help you with that today we bring
you this video on the modernistic stock
market
with this video you are going to learn
everything about the stock market what
it is and how it works in details
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn first of all let's try to
comprehend what is a stock or share
market
imagine a very small business for
instance a t stall
let's say alex owns a very good t stall
and he is killing the market by making a
lot of money on a daily basis it's been
a month since the business has started
booming and now alex is thinking of
making it even bigger by launching a new
tea cafe
the capital he has is not enough to do
so thus he approached banks to ask for a
loan the bank said it was too risky for
them to invest in his idea right away
alex then approached rich investors but
they weren't buying either
he then realized that he had one more
option he can go public giving anyone
who wants the chance to invest in his
business through something called the
initial public offering or ipo
investors pay a small amount let's say
twenty dollars to own a small part or
share of alex's business
with money obtained from ipos alex is
doing his best to grow his tea empire
in recent months his sales started going
above and beyond the roof so it's time
for him to pay respects to his investors
he can share some portion of the profits
with his investors
this shared profit is called a dividend
it's not necessary to share the profit
but it does help to get people excited
about his company and more likely to buy
his stocks like charlie
charlie was out of the country on ipo
day but she thinks alex is the smartest
person in the whole world and i know
this tea cafe thing is going to be huge
so she offers to buy some shares from
one of the original investors for twice
the price she paid for them she thinks
if alex keeps this up i can sell these
shares for even more later on
that's the share market it's nothing
more than people purchasing and selling
little pieces of companies based on
their understanding of the piece's
future value
it's just in real life this phenomenon
is happening thousands of times a second
all over the world
there are numerous stock markets across
the world but the new york stock
exchange is the biggest kahuna of all it
was founded in 1972 under the buttonwood
tree on a wall street road of new york
city
today it's a monstrous empire where
shares of big traditional companies like
ibm walmart png visa and jp morgan are
traded nasdaq is a sibling of the new
york stock exchange founded in 1971.
it doesn't have any physical presence
all the nasdaq trading happens
electronically
here tech giants like apple microsoft
amazon and tesla make and grow more
bucks
moving forward we will understand how
the stock market works and to do that we
will first have to understand what
indexing is
all the stock exchanges across the globe
contemplate a whole bunch of share
prices to formulate one clear number
this statistically mapped clean number
is what we call the stock market index
or stock index
for example the s p 500 and dow index
the s p indexing tracks the 500 largest
companies of both new york stock
exchange and nasdaq while the dow only
follows 30 companies that seem most
important
but the dow and s p are trailblazer
indexes but they are only applicable to
stock exchanges in america
other countries have their own indexes
dedicated to stock measurement
india has bse sensex and nifty 50. the
uk has london's ftsc 100 index
germany has dax and the list goes on
all these stock market indices determine
the overall market performance at a
particular instance
once the day's bidding procedure starts
everyone can invest their money into the
market by understanding this financial
state
also in the stock market everyone gets
an equal opportunity to play this gamble
of buying stocks
those who buy the stocks become
fractional owners of the businesses
their investments help the company grow
and as it becomes more successful the
company's stock index value rises
causing more individuals to become
interested in purchasing their shares
as the demand for the stock increases so
does their price
increasing the costs for prospective
buyers and raising the value of the
company's stocks people already own
for the company this increased interest
helps fund new initiatives and also
boosts its overall market value by
showing how many people are willing to
invest in their idea
however if the company loses its value
for some reason the reverse can also
happen
let's say some hazardous content shows
up in alex's tea product in this
scenario all the investors including
charlie will start selling their shares
at the present cost in hopes of making a
profit before the company loses more
value
as the stocks are sold and demand for
the stock goes down the stock price
falls and with it the companies market
value
this can leave investors with big losses
unless alex's company starts looking
profitable again
this teeter board of supply and demand
is influenced by many factors companies
are under the unavoidable influence of
market forces such as the fluctuating
prices of materials changes in
production technology and shifting labor
prices
the investors can also get anxious about
changes in leadership bad publicity or
large factors like new laws and trade
policies
or even they would be interested in
pursuing their other financial goals by
taking out their money from the stock
market
all these variables cause the day-to-day
noise in the market which can make
companies appear more or less successful
and in the stock market appearing to
lose value often leads to losing
investors and in turn losing the
company's actual value
the opposite of this is also true the
possibility of high future returns could
encourage people to invest in risky new
ideas
that's the whole idea of the stock
market as a whole
in simple terms the stock market drives
companies to make good decisions so that
they have more money to give back to
shareholders as well as to grow more
money and create jobs which is
eventually a greater good for both
investors common people and the
country's economy
human confidence in the market is a key
factor that can trigger everything from
economic booms to financial crises
and tracking this fluctuating behavior
of the market is quite difficult that's
the reason why most people promote
reliable long-term investments over
trying to make risky quick cash
however in today's age of tremendous
breakthroughs professionals are
continually developing techniques to
improve their chances of success in this
very unpredictable system
as more individuals learn about this
complicated system they will be able to
trade equities support businesses they
believe in and achieve their financial
objectives
the first step to do so is getting
invested the world's biggest stock
market tycoon warren buffett whose value
is over 117 billion dollars suggests
buying an s p 500 low-cost index fund to
get you started
index fund in the usa is a kind of fund
that puts a little bit of your money in
all companies in the index
the other option is to give your money
to professional investors who will try
to beat a stock market for a certain
investment percentage fee
in india this kind of investment is
known as mutual funds
experts will carry out your investment
tasks so you're basically hitching your
wagon into the stock market with us
that's all we have about the stock
market today we hope this video was
