Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on
creating a fully functional e-commerce
application using react Tailwind CSS and
Redux with the help of Chad GB in this
tutorial we are going to leverage the
powerful capabilities of Chad GPD to
assist us in building modern responsive
and future Rich e-commerce application
you will learn how to set up your
development environment we will start by
setting up the essential tools and
libraries required for our project
including react Tailwind CSS Redux and
react router we are also going to design
the application layout using Tailwind
CSS we will create a visually appealing
userfriendly layout that includes the
header navigation bar product listings
shopping cart and checkout Pages we are
also going to implement the State
Management with Redux we will use Redux
for managing Global State ensuring our
application is scalable and maintainable
you will learn how to set up slices for
handling user authentication product
data and the shopping card we will also
create reusable components and
throughout this tutorial we will build a
variety of reusable components such as
product cards form inputs buttons and
models to enhance the modularity and
reusability of our code for fetching and
managing data we are going to use react
query so that we are going to fetch data
from a backend API and manage the server
State efficiently we will also learn to
handle loading States caching and
synchronization with react query with
that said guys watch this video till the
end if you want to learn how to make an
e-commerce application using chat GPD
craving a career upgrade subscribe like
and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we move on just a quick
info guys simply learn has got a
post-graduate program in Ai and machine
learning in collaboration with P
University and IBM you going to learn in
demand skills such as machine learning
deep learning NLP computer vision
reinforcement learning generative AI
chat GPT and many more so hurry up now
and join the course the course link is
mentioned in the description box so
let's get started so guys this is a
website which we are going to create
with the help of chat GPD so you can see
all over here we have the navigation bar
which includes home about products card
okay so suppose I want to add this
product okay this is a lamp and say I
want to add in this quantity say three
and if I click it up you can see there's
a notification which is coming up and
it's saying item has been added to the
card now we can also go and check the
card but before uh proceeding for check
out you need to also log in so suppose I
have not created any account so let us
create an account so say this is a mail
ID and say let us take some demo mail ID
and here is some password
and you can say email is already taken
so let us give some random mail
suppose name atate 1 2 3 and say the
password is 1 2 3
4 okay now let's login so it's saying
email must be a valid email so I have
also put like we can say checkpoints
where if the proper validation of the
input field is also given so name adate
name 1 123 atate
gmail.com now I hope so it is going to
work so email or username has already
been taken so let us change our username
so username name 1 2 3 and let us try to
register so you can see all the input
validation has been done so let us give
some
big
okay now you can see it has completely
logged in okay so you can save the
password
now let us go to our
repeat so you can say I'm trying to log
in all over here and it's been logged in
okay so now you can see if you click on
our products you are going to see the
products part like there's a chair
there's a glass table king bed size and
all these are the cards of the product
so basically this images have been taken
from a link okay I will mention you the
link and you can do it and inside this
you can also search the given product
suppose say I want I want to grade lamp
or say chick chair
okay if I type this and uh if I try to
search it
you can see this is coming up you can
also select the company suppose if I
just see all over here so the company
name is luxora okay so you can type all
over there in the check box okay so
where the search button is coming up and
you can say all these companies are
there and with the help of that you can
search it you can also do the Sorting
from A to Z Z to a high to low okay so
this is all we are going to build using
reactjs DWI CS s Redux and also use some
State Management and with the help of
tailb CSS we are going to create a fully
responsive webite now let's get started
so guys let us open our chat GPT and
write a prompt so guys the first prompt
that I want to create is that
say I am
creating a
tutorial or you can say I'm creating a
website using
reactjs and it's
an
e-commerce
website so we'll with the help
of or by using V okay Tailwind
CSS and
Redux now
the next thing what I have to tell the
GPT that can you help me outline the
agenda of this project like including
the main features and functionality okay
so this is the first thing and you can
see all over here so it says like
install and configure wheat integrate
tailin CSS okay set up Redux then for
the uiu design it saying responsive
layout okay then you have to do theme
and styling Define a consistent theme
okay now for authentication and user
management you have to do user
registration and login okay for product
management like product listing product
details and product search so we have
seen these functionalities that we have
implemented in our website and also you
can see there's a shopping card and
checkout option you have to add to the
card card management and checkout
process for the order management you can
also track the history and we are not
going to Target these two things okay
these are some of the additional
features but till here we are going to
complete it okay so not to complicate
too much just to give you a brief
outline how you can make a website using
CH GPT and Tailwind CSS and other tools
and
dependencies so like we have got the
brief idea regarding the main features
and functionalities so we have
responsive design user authentication
product catalog shopping cart checkout
process order management admin panel
wish list reviews and rating
notifications and performance
optimization now let us write the the
next part so here I'm going to type my
next prompt that will
be can you help me
explain the folder structure or can you
help me with the folder
structure of this
react e-commerce
app and
also let me
know the
purpose of each
folder so let us Ty this prompt and
uh we are getting some brief idea like
how our uh things would be there so it
says like you can see the folder
structure first we have to create a
folder called e-commerce app okay and
then so guys for this I will have an
assets folder okay then we are going to
create a components folder inside the
components there are going to be various
components okay so let us start with
that and let us first set up our
development
environment so guys I'm using vs code as
our text editor and in that let us see
that you have first all the dependencies
installed like node especially with the
help of node we are going to install the
package for creating the react app so
guys uh you can also type all over here
that uh how to set up my
development
environment and if you type this command
you can see so there are certain
prerequisites it's going to tell like
node and npm code editor visual code so
like you have to create a certain thing
like this npm create V latest my
e-commerce app then template and then
you can go in this app so since I've
already created an e-commerce app so
what I'm going to do uh inside this I'm
going to create this and uh let us copy
this all over here so you can see assets
I have already created and uh let us go
to the terminal click on view and here's
a terminal and here let's type this
click on
yes so all the necessary dependencies is
going to install so you can see all over
here like what I have to choose it says
pre- react lit CES solids or other so
you you can just select all over here
that I want to use a react
version
okay just click on this and let us keep
the JavaScript part all over here and
you you can see this has already been
created now the second would be go to
our e-commerce app so this is your
folder navigate to
this and next type npm
install and finally click on okay it's
installing the node modules we are going
to wait for some
time so guys as I have asked GPT all
over here give me the folder structure
for our components so you can see all
over here it has given card item card
item list card totals checkout forms
complex pagination container and it has
given error element feature products
then for filtering it has given for
filter. J form checkbox form input okay
form range form select header hero
loading nav bar nav links order list
imagination container product container
then product grid is there product list
is there then section title and you can
also learn about the process or what do
you say the purpose for each component
okay all over here now like product grid
what it does so you can ask GPT the same
question with a prompt like what is the
purpose of this uh given component so
you can see it is going to tell you all
over here so guys use it excessively
wherever you filled out and it has also
given the code all over here okay now
before that since I've told you we'll be
using Tailwind CSS so now let us type
the command to set up our Tailwind CSS
so type
uh I want to set
up the Tailwind
CSS in my uh
project uh help
uh uh give me
the again
type okay
so if you type this so you it is going
to see that first you have to install
the Tailwind CSS and its dependencies so
guys for the same purpose uh just copy
this all over here come to your folder
so now click it all over here that npm
install the post CSS Auto prefixer so it
is going to start the downloading part
of it okay
the next process is in the step two you
have to initialize the Tailwind CSS so
copy this and go all over here
and let us initialize our Tailwind CSS
pretty fine what is the next step guys
in the next process we have to configure
our Tailwind
CSS so you can see all over here there
is going to be a file called tailwind
config.js and you can configure
it all over
here so let us go in our file and you
can see Twi config.js would be there so
okay so now we have done this now let us
see what is the third thing in the step
four it is saying add the Tailwind
directive to your CSS file okay so
there's going to be a file okay first
you have to create a CSS file for your
Tailwind Styles okay and in that you
have to add these directives okay so
guys this is our index.css file and we
can also add the directives all the way
here just click on everything and delete
it and just add the required directives
okay so I have added this part now let
us move to the next part so in your app.
CSS you have to import it okay so
whenever you are going to open our
app.js file so here we have app. j6 so
you can see we are importing this okay
all over here and uh in our main. j6
file you can see our index. CSS is
imported so basically this file is
already been imported all over here okay
okay which is basically going to apply
the Tailwind CSS directives that we are
going to use while building our
components now let us build our
components one by one okay so you have
seen all over here that uh our folder
structure was something like this okay
so we have card items card item list
card totals checkout forms complex
pagination container error element
featured products filter form checkbox
and form input form range header so let
me create all these folder for you so
we'll go all over here
now click on the new folder and say
components pretty fine now here we have
to create all the files so guys you can
see all over here I have created all the
components in the meantime so I have
card items card item list card totals
checkout forms complex pagination
container error element featured
products filters form checkbox form
input and many more
so the same thing which chart GPT has
given me I have created all these things
okay these are the basic things and uh
while also creating a website I would
also recommend you to understand like
how these components which are usable
throughout the process have been used
okay now let us ask chat GPD to populate
this okay now this thing has been done
now let us ask for Pages like what pages
I want to make in our website so if I
navigate to our website we can see we
have homepage we have about page we have
a products page we have a card checkout
and orders so let us ask GPD the
same I want to create
Pages for
about
home
card check
out
error okay
okay
orders then we have the home
layout
login
register
single product page
okay so like these things you have to
identify or the best thing you can do it
you can take the screenshot of this okay
so take uh like all everything you can
just take a picture okay snap it up and
send it to chat gbt it is also going to
recognize it and let me show you this
okay so say I'm going to snip it up so
say I want to say I want to create these
pages
[Music]
and you can just take an image and just
paste it up so you can see the image is
going to get pasted and you can type a
prompt something like this that I want
to create Pages like this which includes
home card checkout orders home layout
login register single product page and
you can also ask GP to give a Tailwind
CSS for these things so GPT is going to
answer you for the same but as a
developer you can take this help but
don't rely over it too much you have to
also do little bit of modification by
yourself so this thing I have written
and let us click it so so first it is
telling you to install the react rout to
D okay so now you have to install this
so copy
this okay so you can see in your
package.json file so this will our
package.json
all over here and you can see all over
here that we have dependencies all
installed which is react router
do so you can see all over here its
version is 6.2 4.1 now the most
important part like while using this
project so what dependencies I have used
all over here so I'm going to give a
brief idea regarding this so guys for
building this project you are going to
require these dependencies like you need
to have Redux toolkit you need to have
tank tank you need to have react query
dep tools okay you need to have an xos
you need to have a DJs react react Dom
react icons we'll be using you going to
use react Redux for State Management
react rout to Dom react toasttify then
there are certain de dependencies as you
can see Tailwinds typography we have to
use because what kind of text we are
going to put it up on our web page so
this is going to handle it then we are
going to use types types react Dom then
V plug-in okay this we have it Daisy UI
okay esent then we have esent plug-in
react hooks then we are going to use
post CSS Tailwind CSS and V so what we
can do next you can copy all these
things okay so since I've already copied
now let us go to our GPT and
say uh give me the
command
to
install these
dependencies so you can see all over
here it has given me all these commands
and just going to go our uh text editor
so here's our
terminal and just type
this and you can see all over here it is
going to start the process of installing
all these packages similarly you have to
install all the da
dependencies now the best thing is that
uh what are the dependencies required I
will share you in the given video and
you can in install it and also for the D
dependencies similarly you have to do it
just copy it and go all over here and
paste
it and you can see all the da
dependencies are going to be added in
your package.json file okay since we
have used it
now these were the given components and
these were some of the pages okay now
let us create the pages that we have
discussed before
and also guys uh you can see assets all
over here you have to transfer this all
over here
okay now I'm going to do this but before
that let's create the pages section so
create a new folder called Pages all
over here
and inside the pages you can see all
over here that for Pages we have told
all about here that they're going to be
home layout they are going to be error.
jsx they're going to be a checkout and
about. jsx okay all over here and in
similarly just create this now for each
of the given page you can check all over
here that it is giving an idea about it
that you can have to ensure something
like this and also you can ask GPT to
explain you what we are going to use it
okay so see here all the headers you're
going to add the links like about card
checkout ERS login register so which is
basically there on our navigation panel
and similarly for applying the CSS just
ask GPT to make it something like this
provide a proper space Ing and also you
can take a screenshot of this and send
it to gbt so it is going to analyze it
and give you the required code for this
okay but the most important part is you
need to identify what folder structure
that you have to use it and don't worry
guys I will share the required doc file
in the description where you can check
what are the components that we have
made and similarly you can take the help
of GPT and build this project so guys I
have created all the required pages and
you can see all over here that we have
about card checkout error for handling
the errors okay home layout index. jss
Landing login orders product management
error for handling the errors throughout
like 404 page then we have the landing
page we have the login orders products
register then we have the single
product. jsx so these are the required
pages that we need to build in order to
replicate the
website so if you have any problem like
what this given page does just ask the
GPT and it's going going to give you the
required answer now this was building
our project structure for the second
part now let us move to the third part
now guys the next thing which I want to
do all over here is that I want to
create a utility folder which is kind of
reusable throughout the application and
it has these functionalities a custom
fetch okay which means a pre-configured
axio axio basically which is going to
have an axio instance for making
standardized API calls and also to the
back end server then we have the format
price functionality in which we are
going to use the utility function to
format the numerical prices that we are
using while buying the given product and
also in a USD currency format okay so
it's a basically a dollar format okay
and then generate amount options then
also we are need to create a utility
function to generate the list of
quantity options for a selected drop
down okay so these were all the features
that I've shown you all over here so
when you go from this suppose say on
this given product and if you select
this say add to the back say I want
seven of them and when you go to your
given card so you can see all over here
the format pricing and all the utility
fun repeat and all the utility functions
used all over here are
given so you can see GPT has given so it
has given custom fetch format price
generate amount option. JS you can
create three of them
but I will not complicate this instead
of this since the application is pretty
simple I will put all of these things
under one folder so guys as you can see
all over here I have created a folder
called utils folder and with a name
called index. jsx and inside this I'm
going to add all the three
functionalities which I have told you
now and this was the project structure
that we need to build in order to make
an application like that now what you
can do guys now you can see the
functionality of this all over here okay
now since you'll not get an access to
this website what you can also do you
can create a demo website like this or
you can take a picture of this and send
to GPT it is going to give you the
required idea like how you can proceed
to build the project so it is very very
helpful but at the end of the day you
need to know about react little bit so
that you can modify the application
based on the given instances so guys
inside of my e-commerce app you can see
our project structure is set up so
inside the SRC we have the assets so I
have pasted these images okay so if you
click on this so it is going to show you
these kind of images so I'll share you
the link for the assets you can use this
to create this website for the same you
have components and all the components
like card items card items totals
checkout forms form checkbox hero
loading nav links is all been mentioned
so this is for all the components that
we'll be needing to build this website
for the required Pages we have about
card checkout error home layout Landing
login orders product registers and
single product okay these are the
required pages and one we have the
utility folder all over here that we
have created called index. js6 for
handling these custom
functionalities now this was the basic
idea regarding the project structure now
what you can do guys since you have got
an idea like what components we'll be
using so ask GPT okay now build each of
the components by using this prom uh say
now help me uh I want
to make
the give me the code or you can ask
something like this uh give me
the code for card
component
and with
the required
Tailwind CSS configuration the Tailwind
CSS
Snippets or you can say with a Tailwind
CSS
code now if you type this all over here
so it is going to give you a demo idea
okay suppose you have this cart jsx and
cart item. jsx so you can see all over
here it has started using this CSS which
is basically a Tailwind CSS and I know
it on the first time you're not going to
get exactly the same you wanted so on it
what you can do guys that you can take a
picture like what the output is coming
and send it to GPD and ask it to you
have to ask for each of the components
similarly ask for the pages okay so ask
like something like this so based on
the project structure based on the pages
so guys as you can see all over here so
guys it has started giving the codes for
the respective Pages as you can see all
over here and with the respective
Tailwind CSS you can definitely modify
it based on your choices and also what
you feel like is more responsive and
user friendly for getting an in-depth
idea regarding Tailwind CSS you can
navigate to its official
document and it will be very very
helpful that you can also take a help
and ask GPT the same thing so after you
have populated these pages with the
respective codes and components okay
that we have shared all over here next
thing what you can do all the way here
that just type all the way here that
this command or you can ask GPT how
to run my
application give me the command you can
type this and it is going to give you
the command but I know the command that
is npm run de uh or this is the given
command that is will be very helpful for
running your application so at each
stage suppose you are building one
component so keep running this and keep
seeing like what changes you are
applying on a real time so building an
application using react or any frontend
application is a hit and trial So based
on the modifications that you require so
you have to consistently interact with
GPT and make an application out of it
but this was an overview of our given
thing so just type this all over here so
just type this and your application is
going to start on a given Port so this
is your Port 5174 so if you navigate all
over here so your application will be
open so let me show you like suppose the
port which I'm using all over here so it
is
5173 okay so this will be your
application and in this way you can make
an application with the help of Chad gbt
so I've given you the basic idea and I
will also share the given documents for
the components pages so so that you
could have a brief idea and you can ask
the GPT to give the required tailn CSS
for the same I will also share the
assets you can use it or you can
download the assets from various other
websites where they have like free pick
where you can make the images for the
given products like you can say lamp
coffee table confe wet which are easily
available and you can start designing
all these
things so guys the best thing about GPT
40 that you can also share the image so
with the help of this you can definitely
build an application thank you guys for
watching this video I hope so you would
have got a brief idea like how you can
build an e-commerce application with the
basic functionality using chgb till then
