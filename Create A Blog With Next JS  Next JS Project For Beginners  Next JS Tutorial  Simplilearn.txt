foreign
welcome back to another video by simply
learn this is an Uber and in this video
we are going to create a next year's
blog project using Nexus and Tailwind
CSS but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and
press the Bell icon so you will get all
the updates from Simply learn
so for today's video we are going to
create a blog post with the help of
markdown files or text files these
markdown files will then convert into
static HTML CSS files
and then we are going to use nex.js to
transform this block into statically
generated HTML file and then we are
going to style those pages with Tailwind
CSS
nexjs has changed so many features like
how files are routed and how data is
fetched I have covered all these
features and changes in my next.js
tutorial video you can check that video
out to learn more about next.js I'll put
the link in the description box and by
the end of this video you will have the
blog project using next year's that you
can showcase on your resume
so let's jump into it but before that do
you know according to Glassdoor the
average salary of a full stack developer
in the U.S is 70 000 US dollar per annum
and it can go up to 125 000 per annum in
fact by 2024 there will be 27 percent
increase in jobs for developers
according to the U.S Bureau of Labor and
statistics
now is the best time to start picking up
the knowledge needed to get started in
this career and if you want to become a
software developer consider the course
on full stack developer mean stack by
simplylearn and master those necessary
skills check out the link in the
description box for more details so I
would like to ask you guys one question
who created nex.js
is it react JS or is it versal or is it
front-end technology
pause this video for a moment and
comment the right answer in the comment
section below now let's start
there are so many code editors available
but my personal favorite and
recommendation is Visual Studio code
let's open Visual Studio code now open
your terminal by just pressing Ctrl
press backtech
and the thumbnail will be
open
okay let's create a next JS project now
for that write a command
npx
create
iPhone next
app
at latest
okay now this will create a next JS
project for us
let's write a project name as next
Js in Block
okay we need
ice cream
we don't need a slide
you
and you know okay
let's wait a couple of minutes
so our next year is a successfully
installed okay
let's open this folder now
this is installed in my
Drive users
and yeah
let's open it
and this is how the structure of my
folder looks like okay
let's move ahead
let's open the terminal again
exchange block folder okay make sure
that you are in the same folder okay
okay let's write here a command
npm
run
tests
so let's wait a couple of minutes to
get over server ready
we're getting a locals over here
okay let's wait a couple of minutes
until let's get started let's go to the
link for some time and see
okay it's running fine
so this is how the next pair
okay let's minimize this and
it just our page here
okay so we can get
all the updates
yeah
this is fine
yeah
now
let's move ahead
now let's delete this page here because
we are not going to use this
yes
okay
foreign
okay that module
is deleted now now let's create another
folder not in the public
let's give it a name as tab
and inside this app I'm going to create
another file called page
dot TSX
release
press enter and inside this I'm going to
create another
constant homepage I'm going to create an
adjustable
over around pages so I'm just gonna
write
this just follow along with me
export
now let's save this file and check
whether it is running on the server or
not
so once I have that I should be able to
run this on the
page and let's see the page directory
here
that's right
uh
load page
let's change the name
physically not showing let's see compile
so successfully
yeah
server is compiled
okay let's see
okay let's find out the issue here let's
close this terminal and I'm going to
show you why this is coming let's write
a command in Kingdom there this time it
will not work it will show us an error
see
yeah
the server was ready but the error is
this app directory is experimental okay
to enable add app directory true to your
next config.ds
so let's copy this here
okay
okay just not copy it let's just close
this terminal for now and open next dot
config Dot
here I am going to write
experimental
and say that
I'm going to break up
let's do it in the next Lane
uh yeah indirect
like this
now let's save this file
and now again
let's delete this one and check whether
it is working or not
open the terminal
again we are going to write the command
npm run Dev
and this time it shows us some errors
but I'm sure it will work
fine
okay the best thing about this one let
me just show you
is that your page r dot page.txt that we
just now has created did not have a root
layout so next is I have created the
app.layout.txt and head.txt for you so
this is a very cool feature of nexjs so
let me show you
so next.js has created
this file for US head.txt you can change
it after some time and layout okay
and as you can see
the file that we have created ph.dxt is
working fine on the Local Host
okay
so let's move ahead
okay
till now we have discussed how to May
create a page and Route on the server so
suppose if you want to create another
page for example another route on the
server for that we need to create
another page
for that
we can create another folder in that way
app directory only and another page.txt
DSX and then
we can do the route so let's see how it
is that works okay
let's create another folder and name it
as
block
okay block inside this block I'm going
to create another file
name it as pH dot TSX
okay
right
now let's copy this content from here
and paste it
here and let's name it as
talk
explode
okay and here I'm going to print this
welcome
to my blog
let's save this file and let's see if
it's working or not
okay
okay so compilation works let me close
it then we started
okay let's wait a couple of seconds
it's compiled successfully let's refresh
this page and now let's add
the extension
good thing welcome to my blog
So This Is How We Do the routes
now I don't want this blog folder
because I don't want this page you are
creating a static page so I'm gonna
delete this one
yeah right
so this is how relates come back to the
Google host program this is the layout
for the page
right and the header so let's add few
things in this part will be
create as
the front page
now let's change the name of this
localhost this doesn't look very good
right
okay for that I'm going to go to my
head.txt file and in the title I'm going
to write
simply learns
now let's save it
and see
if it's working fine or not
right
save this also
it's not showing let's see why
we only need to refresh this right
okay let's refresh this
and this is simple lens block right
now let's work on this layout component
and let's write
footer and
the header
let's create
a header
inside this we will write this is the
header
and let's copy this line on copy let's
create another one
put the
USB is a footer
so let's save this one
okay
let's save this one now and as you can
see it is showing this is a footer this
is a this is a header and this is a
photo this is all working with because
of this children component that we have
created and this is fetching the
page.txs so this is how next.js works
because in basically in any web
development if you want to create a page
we just use a
template in that template first comes
the header then the content and then the
footer so next.js helps us make it very
easy
so let's work on this one I'll create
another component for header and footer
yeah and you can still see the content
here
okay so this is wrapped inside the body
now
let's create another component for
everything
perfect
so
after the returns let's create a header
header inside this I'm going to create a
disk and inside that div I'm going to
declare the H1 tag that comes like a
title and then the like one line will
come to Simply learn and all that comes
into that and after I'll create the
footer
so let's write
this is how we have created this header
now let's just copy this one
and paste it
here
inside this put the I don't need this H1
let's change it and give it a specific
but
now let's save this
and as you can see simply learns blog
welcome to Simply log
created by a number
let's just
right
now we'll go back to this page
and delete this hello from Simply and
goes here
I am going to write my blog
so for that I have to create another
folder
to insert my
files for
which is
markdown files okay so for that I am
going to create another
folder called posts
okay
so inside this post
okay it's coming inside the
public folder
inside the publing so let's delete this
one
and created publicly
not inside there
yes didn't want to write both okay
inside this post
I'm gonna add my markdown files
okay so I have created few markdown
files let me show you in one minute
I'll be back with the mountain files
now I have added few of the Articles
here like this
so
this is a few of them you will get this
in the description box I'll add all the
code
so don't ever worry about the code so
let's just cut these codes
okay yeah
now
I want to create a function that
actually reads all these posts okay
these all the Meltdown files I want some
function
so we'll get copied from the directory
so for that I'm going to create one
function
so for that I'm going to create one
function let's
let's name it at this get post metadata
okay
so let's do that
first let's import
let's import FS
which is a small
file
as
I'll tell you what this list is in a
while
in just a second let's create
function now
const
get
post meta
data
so this is the function that I am
creating
to fetch all the files this MD files
from the directory
okay let's save this
so this is
I use this file system and I imported
this also in the
now let's make sure that the files that
we are getting from here are only marked
on files none other than that okay
let's add metadata also
to clean only fetch the MD files so for
that I am going to create one function
foreign
file that ends with
ends with okay
depends with
m dot MD
okay
so
let's close this one
and create this for your
root now we'll create the another
function of slug so slug is basically a
part of the name without dot MD file
okay which is not a markdown file that
is slot okay let's write
constant
slugs
right
Mark downpost Dot
mapping
videos
again file which doesn't have
nothing in this Arrow function says
files dot replace
with
dot MD
comma and
okay
let's save it
now let's add the metadata function and
post function inside this home page
so for that
I'm going
in here which is okay let's write first
launch
ghost
thank you
data
it
post metadata
this will fetch all the files which ends
with
dot MD okay
preview that we want to see on the
screen it is post previews
first but not be updated one sub
function
focused
ready now
dot map
inside this slugs
when you slug
also but we're not returning here
so it's redone
so it can finish easily
so we'll add on Twitter function there
again
and second brackets I'm going to declare
one
in the container
and inside this div container I'm going
to write these
in H2 file what is it slugs
turn the name of the
these files
accordingly bits okay
don't worry about the code I am going to
provide all the code to you guys
so
okay
so let me first check again what is the
okay yeah
so let's just
leave this H2 it runs and give it a tab
container
and inside this the container I'm going
to add this
post metadata
for post
reviews
then save it and as you can see it is
showing Java kotlin versus flutter
mongodb react versus node versus
react.js react.js so we can also change
these files names as
it's not coming very good
so let's change the name as
Java okay
and this name as
versus
okay mongodb is fine node.js
okay
yeah these are good
and
yeah
now everything's looks
right this is just this structure we'll
do the styling in a while but these are
the just the structures and the
functions that I'm telling you guys
right now
right
okay let's move forward
so what I want now is
I want to make these things clickable
so there is one future in next.js that
you don't have to do like uh anchor tag
to leave these as a directing page but
what we can do is we can just link it
so for that I'm going to write one
function here
inside this div which is link
and
inside this I'm going to give it a path
backtech
post
back then delete all the sign
and inside this I'm going to select
so it will now
here thank you
this one
okay
yeah great
so now
we have to cut this and paste it under
the
Edge to done and let's save it
and now it's showing unhandled runtime
error call stack
okay let's just see what's the error
nor used
let me use and then an okay thing let's
see
okay probably let's move this
bye
just adding here
import
link from
next
slash
link
close this
save save this file and you will see all
the links so if I'll open any of the
link this will show me this page can't
cannot be could not be found this is
because let me first see the
okay so the URL is fine
whether it's going inside the ghost and
then it's taking the right URL it can't
fetch the
right Pages m dot MD files so for that
I am going to create another folder here
let's name that folder
relative
posts only
will it say
I have created one folder post here so I
want to create a folder dynamically in
this post okay so for that in next yes
they have introduced one function
where I can just write in the closed
brackets
so I'll write slug
and then I'll close the bracket
and it will be a dynamic folder
so inside this I'll create a file dot
pages
dot TSX
right
so this is how we can fetch the data
dynamically
so inside this post page I am going to
declare a function
let's name it as post
page and let's give it a
better function okay
say this I'm going to return
foreign
this is a
C
P loans
okay
so let's close this one this one export
the file
so it can be
rendered
page and let's save it
and let's refresh the speed first
and then if you'll click any of the link
it will show this is a simply lens post
but earlier it was giving us an error so
let's open any of this
it is again
now here what I'm doing is I'm accessing
the information from slug
so Props
so this is what
we when we actually want to fetch a data
we use this function and we can fetch it
right
so here we are calling the slug function
that we just declared
so now let's check it first let's just
refresh it
let's refresh the file and let's open
kotlin versus flutter
so this is showing simple and block
welcome to Simply learn this is simply
learns post kotlin versus flutter right
isn't it awesome
right okay fine
let's move ahead
now what I want is I want the content of
these oh md5 markdown files as a post
and content
and show it on the screen
so for that I am going to create another
one
let's create another function
constant
and I'm going to create one function as
get post content and I'm going to take a
slug as a parameter okay
so let me write that function
okay let's now import the file FS
to read the content of the file
from
foreign
I'm going to add one
paragraph for the content
here I'm going to declare that
content
and let's just
save it
okay it's fine
it's not showing me the content let me
see what's the issue here okay
we have added the content slug line but
we haven't added the line to fetch the
function of content so I'm gonna write
it now
it's faded here
get post content
and then again inside that inside the
function
I'm going to write slug
now let's save it and see the magic of
next yes
so the pose that we have clicked on was
kotlin versus flutter and this is the
article
which is coming this is not in
structural format guys let me tell you
first that this is not in structural
format so let's open react.js now
so this is the title of this props in
react yes subtitle all you need to know
about react JS and the date it has been
modified and on this is all about
reactive it is not in an
um
organized manner but don't worry about
it we'll do everything here okay
right now
what we can do is so
we can add one in game okay let's just
open the terminal now
let's see this one okay
so for now we this as you know this is
not in a readable manner so for that we
need to convert this markdown file into
jsx file
so for that I'm going to install one
fantastic dependency which is mark down
to
jsx
so let's install this one and let's see
now so it is installed in our system
now we'll import this
on our
post.jsx
okay which is marked down
now
what we can do is okay I got it now what
we can do is
we have to
wrap this content in the markdown so
it can be fetched
now let's save it and see the magic
let's run this again
just two minute
okay
let's just let's compile now let's save
it okay let me just go back a little
okay now we are going to open the Java
so now as you can see it is in a
readable manner right
earlier it was not in a readable manner
but now we can read this is simply lens
blog welcome and this is a simple learn
post Java title of this is this uh
overriding we can see the heading the
example one output of this explanation
and everything is in
is formatted manner okay
let's open this one this is also in a
formatted manner
now let's move ahead
okay
now
as you can see
this is a metadata right this one is a
metadata but we can't see I don't want
to see this as
like this I want to say it here so for
that I have to delete this one and make
it as first but firstly let's make it as
a link so we can go back by just
clicking on this simply unblock
so for that let's click on the
layout.tx DSX file and here
let's add here
and simply learns blog link
Dot
address Dot
slash
and inside this H1
Let It Be singular only
and let's just cut this and paste it
there
okay let's save it
and showing me an error
let me read we have to import import
this also
so not get the better
right
so let's go here
import
link
from
next
slash link
save it
and
this book yeah let's again save it and
we can just click on simply learn blog
and click on any of the link and it
should be open like you can see here
right
now
my main concern is this metadata
now how can we change that
now let's change this one
each problem have a solution so I to
have a solution for you guys for this
I have to install a library
which is an external Library so
I'm going to use the library called gray
matters
and let us pass the front matter string
from the file okay first just install
this
it lets me open my terminal again and
let's write NVM
install
save
Gray
so the command is let me show you guys
here yeah
so press enter and let this Library
fully installed in our system
so now let's import this file
let's open the DSX file and import this
one
and here I'm going to import
matter from Gray matter
so
okay so what we can do is
thank you
you can delete these two lines and add
mark down so we can just read all these
files from that only
so let's add a function
right
so let me just add it here
so
this is a markdown file
okay so what we will do is here is
we are reading the file sync operation
with the file system so it will open the
file and read the file the content of
the file okay and then we'll returning
the title did a subtitle and the slug
and the slug will replace the file name
again and again whenever we click on the
other file it will again go to the
another file and read this same data
again okay
all right
let's move ahead
so this is showing us an error that this
map is not collecting the slug operation
so what we can do is we have created an
object and we will get back from calling
it as a get post metadata so now we'll
actually create and Define this in
interface as well so let's create a
component here
so I'm gonna response that I am
returning to this so that this
array will get
close
so I'm gonna create here a
note here
okay let's create here a component
folder
components folder
and inside this component folder I'm
going to create a file called
first
metadata
dot TS okay
and inside this file I'm going to write
export interface
post
um
instrumental data
not this
meta data
and inside this I am going to write the
operation which I am doing it
here
this one that it is returning this
but I don't want to return it here so I
can just return created a file called
post metadata and inside this I am going
to declare these things okay like the
title of this string
and the date is also
string
subtitle
string
and slug
which we Define is also string right
okay fine
let's move ahead and let's save this
file
now
instead of returning this Anonymous
object as a post metadata we can just
return here
that okay let's close let me close this
one and inside here after this
I'm gonna declare that I am using post
measure data file
you can fetch the data from there only
right
now
I am going to return the post
now this post method metadata is already
imported by vs code
so this is what I like about vs code
let's save it and see it is calling
stack okay runtime and the runtime error
it's fine we can just remove this one
okay so this is giving us showing us an
error because we have changed the data
model
and we haven't updated here in the home
page yet so we can do that
so
it's not returning now slug it's
returning post
so let's change the
file names
post
dot slug right yeah here also we have to
change
post
dot slug yeah now let's save it and see
if it's working fine let's open mongodb
and it's working fine
Logan no
we got this mongodb but we have to still
work on this part
okay it's fine
let's move ahead
now what we can do is we can just
remove this Slug and write here title
let's save it now and see
it got vanished let me check again
let's check here what's happening
slug
now what I did here is I added two links
of the post subtitle and post it by
which we can see the type subtitle that
we have added on this markdown file
subtitle and the date of each and every
article that we have pasted here these
metadata files okay now let's open one
of them like Java but still we are we
can see this metadata file
so what we can do to change this one is
let's open this page.txx which is comes
under slug post slug open this file and
add here
matter that we installed
import
matter
from
Gray
matter okay
let's use it here as
okay
let's create one const
matter
result
okay
matter
and then content
so what we are doing here is we are just
adding the content we are not adding
this part that we have added in the
markdown file I just want to see the
content from the starting overriding
example output an example and all I
don't want to see this part okay so for
that we are adding one function here
so let's return the
meta
enter
result
Dot
content
okay
so let's see if we want to add anything
or remove
okay this looks fine everything's looks
fine
organ
let's just save this file
and see it is removed from every post
like let's open mongodb and here also
you just see this is a simply learns
post mongodb then all about mongodb like
what is a mongodb
okay let's just go to mongodb and I'll
show you how to change these things
so let's make this as a heading so for
that I am going to write here to hash
and let's just save this file
and let's refresh
as you can see it's coming
like this
right isn't it awesome okay let's move
ahead now
let's go back and style the UI of this
page
okay
let's close this one
now as you can see this page is like a
little we have written here this
function get post method so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to go inside this
component folder and I'm going to create
one file let's name it as get
post
metadata
data okay meta dot dot
and I'm gonna go to this file
[Music]
copy this
question
okay and post it inside this
get post metadata okay
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
export
let's write
I'm gonna export this function as a
default function
again post metadata
okay now also I have to
go to this
now I'll go to the page.dxx and I have
to import all the
Imports and copy these
so I can
import it
inside this get post
metadata file
also one more I need here
adjust this one
okay fine now everything looks fine
let's save this
now I don't have to import these file
inside this page so let's
make it little
clean
so we don't need get post metadata here
now
so let's import
get post metadata inside this also
foreign
okay
that I have created in my components
let's sleep save that
and now inside my post log page
I'm gonna use the at here as well
so for that
I'm gonna write here
or will it just let me delete first and
then I'll added here okay after the
props spams
I'm going to write
it was mirrored as content okay
generally
okay let's create a stat Tech One
yeah right
everything looks good
content we don't need content now
so we can just
return
my data here and then
we have to close this one
and then let's create an export for this
return content and export const
ant generate tactic
Rams
30 grams
sync
function
and vertical function
inside this
I'm gonna write const
post
and here I'm gonna write get post
metadata
connection
here
let's close this one too
and here we have generated static path
for the get post metadata right here we
have to change the
markdown as not count let's write here
as post dot count
Young
it's not working it's okay fine let's
not
and here this one
and beside this let's create another one
and write post dot data
dot title so that we can
see the title when we
go
let's save this one
there are errors also but
okay
let's see
not post message it's post dot data
dot title
okay the post is not being fetched here
so let's see and this is not
the content we don't need because we
have
added post here so let's
write post here and now everything is
working
fine
let's refresh this page
and it's working
fine
read now let's move forward
and let's first just return the mapping
here
and here right
return the path here
return
[Music]
posts whenever we return a post it will
show the map and inside that map
will show me
[Music]
post
and arrow function
and here I'm going to write
slug
okay the slug I'm going to show it as
post
dot slug
let's write comma here and
this is fine
let's save it
and see
now
we'll stop the terminal here by just
pressing Ctrl C and yes and here I'm
gonna write NVM
run build
so we can see with function is working
on which is static or on the server
which function is running
so it will show us
it is creating an optimized production
build
so let's wait a couple of minutes to see
foreign
so as you can see it is a static page
earlier it was not static that's why we
added and created this page called get
post metadata so with this automatically
rendered array static HTML uses no
initial props okay
so
this is
a static page now
[Music]
now let's run the dev website again
yeah everything's looks fine now
yes
everything is working fine
okay
now what I want here
is I can think this also
but it's fine but uh okay let's create
one more file
inside this component only for preview
post
preview
Dot
PS
X
I am
I'm going to create a post preview
function and Export it as default so let
me write it
so this is also a default function that
I'm creating
post
review
let's save it
so I'll go here and copy this entire div
from here and post it inside
this
lip
now
I'm gonna return this div here
so this will need some input also
okay
so so
what we can do is
we can just go back
return only
we are going to use get boost metadata
here
so for that I'm going to do is
inside this I'm going to write prompts
okay
post only post
done
data okay
now we have to import this file also
and the top so I'll import this import
metadata from post metadata let's save
it
and it's not working fine
so we need to replace this post
from from
posts from
not props
so I changed all the post from drops now
I'll change missing links so we'll
import this one and it'll be good to go
now
coming back to
this
okay let's just create another
component here
so I'll look more clean so for that I'm
going to create one
here and the link we don't need here
right now but it's fine if we do
okay
now what we'll do here is we are going
to create delete this first we don't
need it
actually so
here right post preview that we just now
created inside this we have written all
these things so we don't need this
where I'm going to write post dot slug
Slug and let's just close this with the
spread of operation
uh sorry spread operator
okay let me show you that
this dot dot dot notation is called the
spread operator
so I'm gonna write post
and let's close this one
right let's save it
and let's just
refresh this one also
let's show you an error okay let's just
see because I guess I refresh this page
earlier
okay let's just close this and again
press this run
so this is working fine now okay so let
me tell you about this dot dot notation
okay so this will take all the
operations and make them the input
parameter for this component okay
so let's
um move forward
now I think our okay let's just remove
this one from our paid let's save it
again
and I think
everything is fine now
let's close the terminal and run it
again
and see everything looks fine or not
it'll work
let's wait a couple of seconds more
it's successfully compiled okay
let's again go back here and refresh
this page
okay let's open this few of them welcome
to assembly learn overriding go back
mongodb what is mongodb and all
going back to Simply unplug
now everything is looking completely
fine now our next step is to create this
blog static blog page into a beautiful
looking web page so I'm gonna use
tailwind.css for creating the styling of
this page so if you don't know what is
Tailwind
so if you don't know that what is
tailwind and all it lets you write CSS
basically as classic
and utility classes
so we can rapidly build modern website
without ever leaving your HTML right
and also you can compose these uh
components or files directly in your jsx
or your TSX files right so this is what
I love about tailwind.jss and
let's see more
and we can just change the looks of the
file
so this is all about Tailwind TSS okay
so
this is a very easy to start
now here I'm gonna write
next JS to install how to install
tailwind and in CSS in your
system so for that it's saying npx
create
a project and all but we have a project
and all but okay
so
so let's
let's right here
Tailwind CSS now I'm gonna stop my com
terminal
let's open end and let's write yeah
here I have written the how to install
Tailwind in your system let's write in
big steel when CSS in it P
foreign
dot config.js so we'll open this file as
tailwinder is installed in our system so
we'll go to this content part
and add
Dot
pages
slash
star star
names okay let me add it
okay
after doing this content Pages now what
we are going to do is we're going to add
this three properties of Tailwind inside
the CSS file okay so let's open
global.tss that must be here only
let's see
inside the styles
I'll find one first one which is
the style
okay
let's copy
and replace everything
okay
now we let's save this file and now we
actually need to import these file into
our
app so let's open this layout.txt and
let's write
and write
import
don't don't
styles
and inside the slides there's a file
name globals
it is globals.css
okay let's close this one and let's save
it let's
and let's see
let's see okay let's just let me just
copy this in a bit from here
and we'll put it inside the
header link here
yeah let's save it and see
as now the Tailwind is successfully
working and as you can see all the links
are disappeared but we can do what is we
are going to go to this page let's
delete these files
as you don't need it right now so let's
open the layout.txt and let's work on
this blog simply learns blog and make
the header mode beautiful and
make it in Center okay
so let's just
make it
so it look more big and
okay let's close this one and right here
here inside the class name as we have
written this lines
let's read it in here as

so what we can do is
let's create another
link here

this one and
okay let's just give it
now let's just create here after the
header
inside this div class name
