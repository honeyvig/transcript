in this video we will get complete
explanation of devops tools like git
Maven Jenkins anible Docker and more but
before we begin consider subscribing to
Simply learn and hit the Bell icon to
never miss any updates from us so the
way in which git is able to accomplish
this is that it is essentially a
distributed Version Control um solution
um and what that means is that when you
have multiple developers yes you do have
a git remote Hub that you connect and uh
are able to upload and download uh
different branches of the code that
you're working on but essentially as a
developer when you um actually have the
code you actually have all of the code
and uh you're able to uh manage it
directly from your local PC or your
local development machine um without
having to uh worry too much about the
the network or the server actually going
down so some of the key things in which
um git is really good at it is you know
a software management tool is designed
from the ground up to manage code
development it does track the changes on
that code easily and effectively makes
it easy for you as a developer to track
your code the ability for multiple
developers to work together is much
easier in comparison to um other
Solutions and and this is really the the
the key success point with Git is is
that it allows for nonlinear code
development so you can actually have
people working on different areas of the
code that may be released at different
times because of what they're working on
so if we actually break down the
architecture of G it really falls into
four key areas of a working directory a
local staging area a local repository
and a remote repository so the process
you would go through is you would add
files to the um staging area from your
working directory and this would be used
like the get add command and then from
your staging area when you're ready to
actually then commit those files to a
local repository you would use the git
commit command and then from there you
would actually then push your local
repository out to the remote repository
uh for a final commit uh to the remote
repository um and this allows then the
rest of the team to pull down your
latest final changes so you can be
working on your code locally and you can
be using your local local staging area
repository and and when you're ready to
commit your um work you can commit it
and then as soon as it's committed the
rest of the team can then pull down the
latest changes that you have worked on
and this allows for a complete and
holistic checkout and checkin process
and then sometimes you want to be able
to go through and then take the checked
out code that you um that you're pulling
out and merge it with your local code
and the merge process always ensures
that you are working on the latest and
best version of the code and everybody
on the team is being consistent with the
uh communication of the actual code
that's being delivered okay so what
we're going to do is we're going to
validate that we have get running on our
computer we're going to then create a
direct directory add a file to that
directory make some changes to that file
and then use the commit commands to be
able to check in the files and validate
changes that have been made so first
thing we do is we're going to see if we
have git installed and to do that you
just use the command version and what
you'll sorry git Das Das version and
they'll actually then give you the
version number and now we're going to
create a new folder so MK D green and
that'll create a new folder and we'll
move our cursor into the green folder by
changing the directory and we can go
back into windows and we can validate
that that directory is actually there so
here we go let's have a look we should
see if there's the green folder and if I
double click into that you'll see
there's nothing in the folder right now
so what we have to do is we actually
have to add the folder as part of a git
project and so we're going to use our G
initiate in it and they'll actually
initialize the folder and make it a git
repository and so let's go ahead and
create a file that'll actually go inside
of um that uh new initialized folder and
you'll see that there's a dogit folder
that's been added so the new text file
we're going to create is going to be
called class and it'll actually be
class. txt the extension is hidden by
default in the uh text file we just
going to type in the text uh welcome to
Simply learn and save that now let's go
ahead and check the status um of that
file in git so let's do git status and
you'll see that it says yes there's a
file there but it hasn't been committed
to the repository that's why it's in Red
so what we have to do now is commit the
file to the repository and it won't be
able to track any changes that we do to
that file so let's go ahead and commit
the file so we do commit add class. txt
and they'll add that to the Repository
and there we are it's added and the
final step is we want to do is commit it
let let's do get so let's do get commit
dasm put in this will be our first
commit and this is the description and
so it actually shows us committing the
file it's the only item in the folder so
now we can go over to the file that we
just created and we can make some
changes to it so let's open up the file
so it says welcome to Simply learn uh
let's put in some text afterwards that
says this this is my demo and we'll save
that close that and now if we go back to
G we can do a compare and contrast
between the original file that we
committed and the new um updates that
we've just done and we can check the
difference by using git diff and what
you'll see is the uh red text was the
original text and the green text is now
the new text that's been added and so
that shows you how you can actually go
and create a um a new git reposit
repository go through adding files
committing the files into the repository
and being able to see the different
version controls let's move on to mavin
so why use mavin so so why use mavin
well just look at some of the things
that you would have done in the past if
you actually building out the tasks so
let's break down what you would have
done before using mavin if you were to
create a game or football using Java
you'd actually have to go out and for
your actual um game you'd have to
collect all all the different components
needed within the Java environment uh to
make sure that everything would work
correctly and if you make the slightest
mistake uh you wouldn't get the right
output that you needed the actual
process of building and deploying a
project really would take quite a lot of
time after mavin mavin allows you to be
able to take templates that are stored
locally and be able to use those to be
able to improve the efficiency of being
able to build out your environment by
removing dependencies within the
application make makes it a lot easier
if you be able to focus on just writing
the code for your game or your solution
rather than having to manage the
environment within which that solution
would be deployed now the focus within
mavin is that it is an automation tool
and it's used for projects that have a
short period of time so as you're
starting on your environment for
building out um Solutions mavin is great
to get started with and then if you need
to have longer term projects then you
can look at other alternative tools on
the market so four key areas that you
want to focus on why mavin can help you
is that it does allow for efficient um
parallel builds to be run concurrently
it's really easy to use you can get up
and started with mad very quickly uh you
do have fast access to new features and
new configurations quickly within your
environment and the build process that
will allow you to be able to visualize
your code happens very quickly the
actual architecture of mavin is that the
execution and commands are managed
through what's known as a pom file the
pom file itself is a project object
model and it's an XML file that actually
has the details for the project and the
configuration for the build environment
pump file itself will then fetch
dependencies from the local repository
and will apply any plugins that you may
have also included within your mavin
environment the goal is that your
software is built much more controlled
manner so what we're going to do now is
we're going to show you how to go
through and run your very first project
using Maven the first steps you going to
have to do is make sure that you have
the latest jdk installed on your
computer so we're going to go ahead and
open up our web browser and get this
installed on your computer so we're
going to type in jdk download into our
Chrome web browser and go to the Oracle
website which allows us to download the
jdk and because we're running this on
Windows we're going to download the
windows
version of the jdk and once you have
that installed so the next step is to
actually then go ahead and download the
maven files so it's going to take us to
the Maven apache.org website where you
can actually go ahead and download the
version of Maven that you need for your
operating system we're going to go ahead
and download the zip file instead of
just an executable file now this will
give you more control over how you
install it onto your Windows PC after
the file has been downloaded we want to
go ahead and extract the entire um file
so you have uh the unzipped folder
running on your
computer so one of the things that we're
going to have to do is go through and
set a number of system variables for the
jdk and for the path to your MAV files
and to do that you want to go into your
control panel and select the system
security and then system settings and
then go into advanced system settings
this will give you access to the uh edit
system variable setting that you're
looking
for so we're going to go down to the
path variable and you'll see already
that we have pasted in the link to the
jdk uh right there underneath the
variable value if you've installed the
jdk it's likely that it's already
installed this path for you
correctly the good news it's actually
fairly easy to um install the path to
mavin and to the jdk cuz all you have to
do is copy the path for where the folder
is located on your system and just paste
it into a variable value under the edit
systems variable fold um file
system and that should now get us all
the files and we can see that we have
our extracted folder already on our
desktop there and the system path is now
um set to where the maven folder is
located so we also have to go into
system protection
and set the system path to your MAV
folder now we have to go ahead and do a
user variable that also part links to
the path of the m
files so what we're doing right now is
we're just validating that all the files
have been extracted correctly they have
which is good we can now go ahead and
link to these M
folder all right so now what we're going
to do is we're going to move over to
command prompt and this is where we're
going to do most of our work from here
on out first command we're going to do
is uh
MV so we're going to go ahead and create
a new user variable and uh we're going
to type in we're going to close one M2
Dash and then we'll put in the path uh
to the Apache M folder you should be
able to use m2- home for your project
but if it's not you can always use the
variable name mavin Dome and that will
do exactly the same as uh M2 we're going
to do both here uh just so we have a
backup
so we're going to open up command prompt
and we're going to see if Maven is
installed we do that by writing mvn D-
version and here we are yes so now we're
going to go ahead and create our first
Maven project and the first part of
creating the maven project is actually
the directory in which we will store the
files that will be used to create for
our
project so we're just going to going go
ahead into the folder and we're going to
create a new directory and we're going
to call this one and we're going to call
it simply
learn and we can just copy the path for
that so I'm going to write this the
correct path for us so we're going to
change directory CD and copy the file
location over all right we are now moved
ourselves over to the simply learn
folder and we'll be able to install the
pomp file which is what all the
instructions from mavin are sored in uh
into this area so to do to do that we're
actually going to use a template that's
already been created by mavin and this
is going to be the mvn archetype
template and so you just to MVM
archetype colon generate and this will
go ahead and create all the files for
us so there's can be quite a few files
and they're all being downloaded from
the mavin website uh so it can take some
time um but as you see we've gone ahead
and all the files have downloaded and we
have everything up and running correctly
inside of our envir on command line and
command prompt so we'll have some values
that we do have to set the first one is
group ID and we're going to call this
one com. MAV and then the next one is
going to be artifact ID and this is
going to be MAV mv- project hit return
and then version is going to be
1.0-snapshot we'll just put in the same
value for this version be 1.0-snapshot
and the package we're going to call this
one com. M.D
demo and then we'll select yes or why to
create the environment and it will build
the environment for
us and what we have now is we have this
screen which shows everything is up and
running for us and we have a successful
build and so let's go into the mov
folder and just see that we have our
simply L folder let's open up and see
what's in there so we double click into
that directory
yep and there we are starting to see
some of our files so it's um the same
project names there as mv- project and
then we have our pom file that's in
there which is fantastic under the
source folder we'll actually see the uh
the demo and we have our app under the
demo
app we have our test file as
well so in the main folder we have a
file that's called the pom file and that
really is the most important file that
you need for your project you'll now go
in you be able to set all your settings
inside of that P file but that's it
that's what we have done here as we've
gone through and we've gone through all
the setup that allows you to uh make
sure you have the right files running on
your computer the right files to
download from the Maven website how to
install all the files the settings you
need to make on your Windows computer
and then all the settings that need to
be done in the command line to be able
to run the application a and then from
here you can actually start running
Maven now let's look at selenium as we
get start looking at testing so before
selenium if you wanted to run testing
and particularly if you want to do
sequential testing it would take up a
lot of time you'd have to run one test
then the second test and then all the
other tests and the actual time elapse
would be quite significant with selenium
you're actually able to do parallel
testing so instead of looking at the
amount of of time it would take to
actually run a test and run the test
sequentially the length of time to
actually run your test is based on the
length of the longest running test of
which in this example uh the longest
running test is 2 minutes now one of the
things that you'll notice with selenium
is that its focus is on web applications
um and it is an open- Source tool and
it's really good at regression and
functional testing of web applications
if you're doing a mobile application or
if you're doing an iot application there
are other uh tools you can use on the
market as well but if you are new to
devops and you're setting up your first
Dev Ops environment selenium is a great
place to start and web applications are
mature and allow you to be able to test
out and validate the concept of
continuous testing in your environment
so four key takeaways uh for selenium U
it really is fast I mean for fast
execution it's highly accurate um so you
can always validate that what you're
doing doing uh will work correctly and
feedback can be sent straight back to
the developer if their uh code doesn't
pass the test um allows you to script in
multiple languages um again this is a
great way for you to test um the focus
is on web applications but you can um
test in multiple um languages used for
web applications and most importantly
allows for parallel test execution which
speeds up the whole test process
significantly you actually to break down
the architecture of selenium and what
you'll find is the actual libraries that
you can use for selenium uh run in C
Java python JavaScript PHP uh these are
the common languages used to build out
web applications the actual web driver
itself is an API driver um which is
fantastic because it makes it easier for
you to integrate selenium with
applications through API and you can run
the solution through different web
browsers the most popular being Firefox
Chrome and Edge so to focus the selenium
web driver codes are being used to build
out the client libraries that make it um
to allow you to be able to build
Solutions across multiple web um
application environments the web driver
application interface is used to
integrate with the application to make
it easy for testing the web driver
service provides an immutable stateless
environment that makes it very easy for
you to be able to use protocols such as
Json to wire up your test environment
the driver manages communication between
the browsers and the wire protocol
that's used for Json within the web
browser itself and then the actual
commands are then run through the web
browser for you to be able to get your
results okay so before we actually get
into the setup of selenium the first
things we want to do is we want to make
sure that we have the right version of
java installed and so I'm just using the
command window here and I'm going to
type in Java and actually what I can see
now is I do have Java installed which is
fantastic otherwise you'd have to go and
down download Java from oracle's website
the next step is to validate that I have
Eclipse installed and I'm just typing
eclipse and there we are I have the
eclipse app installed uh you can
actually download um eclipse from the
eclipse website the third step I want to
check is to validate that I have a
browser driver installed so I'm using uh
Google's Chrome um for my main browser
but you can actually go out and download
the chromium driver um and that's the
actual core engine that powers Chrome uh
interesting enough being used in the new
Microsoft Edge web browser so you can
actually go and download the latest uh
chromium driver and install that and
then the final stage is to go to the
selenium website and download the JV
files themselves so just uh do a Google
search on selenium download and here we
have the selenium h.org website and it
takes straight to the download page and
we want to download the latest version
and we we' gone ahead and done that
already so we have everything running
and now the next step is for us to
install all of this great content okay
so before we actually get into the setup
of selenium the first things we want to
do is we want to make sure that we have
the right version of java installed and
so I'm just using command window here
and I'm going to type in Java and
actually what I can see now is I do have
Java installed which is fantastic
otherwise you'd have to go and download
Java from oracle's website the next step
is to validate that I have it Eclipse
installed and I'm just typing eclipse
and there we are I have the eclipse app
installed uh you can actually download
um Eclipse um from the eclips website
the third step I want to check is to
validate that I have a browser driver
installed so I'm using Google's Chrome
for my main browser but you can actually
go out and download the chromium driver
um and that's the actual core engine
that powers Chrome uh interesting enough
being used in the new Microsoft Edge web
browser so you can actually go and
download the latest chromium driver and
install that and then the final stage is
to go to the selenium website and
download the jar files themselves so
just uh do a Google search on selenium
download and here we have the selenium
hq. org website and it take us straight
to the download page and we want to
download the latest version and we've
gone ahead and done that already so we
have everything running and now the next
step is for us to install all of this
great content so we're just going to go
ahead and open up the eclipse
environment and it always takes a moment
to launch eclips and we're going to go
ahead and create a new project and we're
going to call our project
XYZ I think that should be fine and this
is just a test after all and we're going
to go ahead and create a new class file
by right clicking and select new
class and we're going to go in here and
we going to give the class file a name
of Simply learn and I don't see the
Finish button being selected so maybe we
need to select some other options here
oh you know I think it could be the
package name yeah let me go ahead and
change the package name and I'm going to
change that to qwe qw yep and the Finish
button has now been highlighted I can
select that I can go select that and
select finish and uh we now have a test
page as up and running and but what we
have to do is to validate that selenium
is actually part of the project so to do
that we're going to go to the source to
the actual Source XYZ file and right
click on it and we want to validate that
all the files are there correctly and so
we're going to see that we have the
libraries are there yep there's selenium
if it's not there you can select add
external files and find the selenium jav
file select open and they would load
that in there and then you hit a apply
and close and that would apply it to
your project and now we can actually
start writing the Cod
part so we're going to put this uh code
in the public static void section and
the first uh command is going to be a
system. set property and we want to make
sure that we're configuring the web
driver for chromium correctly so we're
going to do web driver um do Chrome
driver and then the argument is that
going to be the full path full network
path to the chromium driver that you
have on your PC so let's see we have
chroming here we want to copy that path
and so that paste that in and then after
we've pasted in the path we have to make
sure that we also put a link to the
actual file that we want to execute
which is in this case is Chrome driver.
exe and then we want to make sure that
the work driver is pointing to the new
Chrome
driver and you'll notice that there's a
couple of red colors on here which means
that we don't have all of the public
classes imported correctly so you can
right click on that and SE import the
web driver and just select that real
quick and that adds the import correctly
at the top of the page and same for
Chrome
driver and that's just a very quick way
um when you're working in Eclipse to
import additional uh
files so before we actually start our
test we want to make sure that we've
actually cleared out any potential
browser cookies that would be within the
creian driver so for that we're actually
going to go ahead and we're going to
write a script that allows us to remove
the
cookies so we want to do driver do
manage and then delete all
cookies and the next line we're going to
do do is to actually have the web page
that we're going to connect to open up
in full screen mode and for that to
happen we're going to go and actually
use the window property uh which is what
I was writing before by mistake and so
this will allows to go full screen and
now we need to pull in a web page so
we're going to get the get command and
what we're going to do is we actually
just going to pull in a web page from
Amazon uh which I just happened to have
here so I'm just going to go to to
Amazon web page and so I'm just going to
copy the URL and you know just need to
copy htps
www.
amazon.in or.com wherever you're located
and so you can see that I've pulled in
the Amazon web page and then line 18
actually allows me to go and connect so
here we are we have uh the Amazon web
page that I'm pulling in and then what I
also want to do is I want to look for a
specific ID in one of the elements and
so I have the driver which is called f
an element and that allows me to look
for any element that be on the actual
page so here we have the HTML in the
console screen and I can actually then
paste out an ID from the element that I
want to
use so the find element is just the ID
for each element and most of them have
them because they needed for the
JavaScript and
CSS so let's see there's quite a few IDs
so and we can select any of those so
what we have here is we have two tab
search text box and then what that
actually does is that finds the ID for
the text box used for searching and then
we're going to use the send key command
which allows us to actually prefill in
the search box and we're going to use
the test of Puma shoes this is a fixed
string but you could actually put a
variable in here if you want to pull
strings from a database or an XML file
and then the next uh line on line 19
shows how long we're actually going to
run the actual script for the uh search
which is only 10 seconds and then once
the uh 10 seconds has elapsed we'll
actually quit the script which actually
closes the web browser and takes us back
into our screen here and let's test that
make sure it's working and everything's
looking good the browser opens which is
what we expect it goes to Amazon
fantastic um it now actually goes to the
search screen and should fill in the
Puma shoes there we go Puma shoes and
waits 10 seconds and it closes and
that's exactly what we were expecting
now you can actually change the unit of
time that you would have for the actual
test so if you wanted to see what was
happening so longer than 10 seconds you
can actually change the actual time or
the actual metric and so in in this
instance we got it as seconds and unit
of time but you could do minutes or
hours or micros seconds and you can
change the keyword as well so it could
be a jiga or anything you wanted to
check but if you're actually building
your own application you want to be able
to test your own data against your own
application that's where you put in that
specific
data so let's look at the center the
heart of um your Dev Ops environment and
that Center is with Jenkins so before
Jenkins people would uh developers would
work on their code and the code would
then be checked into a source repository
you would then check for any issues and
then you would then send that code over
to the operations team and there would
be a delay for actually delivering
software so the actual um challenges
developers had is that if they wanted to
run any tests they had to wait until
their software was built and there was a
lot of problems in providing feedback
and particular if you had large teams
working on software or who actually had
the error the actual delivery of
software was often uh delayed uh because
of these key problems so after Jenkins
what we actually have is the ability to
be able to streamline this whole process
the build test and deploy happens
continuously and are able to then notify
developers and the natural specific
developer of any errors that are
detected being able to speed up the
delivery process much more efficiently
the focus of Jenkins is that it
automates a continuous development
testing and deployment environment and
it's open source Jenkins is easy to
install and configure it's been around
for many years now and is very mature
there are many plugins that you can use
within Jenkins to be able to have the
Jenkins product work with with your
environment if there isn't a plug-in you
can actually extend by you can actually
write your own plugins if a plug-in
doesn't exist so you can actually
continue and extend and invest in the
Jenkins ecosystem and it can be easily
distributed across multiple machines so
let's break out the architecture of
Jenkins so Jenkins starts as a remote
source code repository and it then pulls
out the code every time there is a
commit from into the server Master the
server master will then have a slave
that will run on either Windows Linux or
Mac OS to be able to distribute this
load across those environments and after
it's actually gone through and run its
test it'll then send out a report the
goal of the report is to communicate
back to the team what has passed and
what has failed the actual check-in
process okay so we're going to go ahead
and show you how to install Jenkins on
your local PC uh so the first thing you
want to do is check that you have Java
installed so we're just going go into
our system and see whether or not we
have the Java jdk installed you can do
that by going into system properties
seting advanc and environment settings
and there we are we have Java jdk
installed and you want to just double
check on the system variables to make
sure you have the Java uncore home
installed correctly as well and we have
that installed and under path also make
sure you have a link to the uh Java jdk
as well so we have everything installed
and what we're going to do is we're
going to open up command window and just
do a double check right there so open up
command window and we're just going to
check that we have Java installed so we
do Java Dash version and we have a
version number that comes back if we
didn't have Java installed we wouldn't
get a Java version number come back we'
actually have an error all right so
everything looks good so the next thing
you want to do is to go to the Jenkins
website and download the files so we're
going to go to
jenkins. and that's the official Jenkins
website and if you want to download you
just go to
jenkins. download or you can just type
into your search bar download Jenkins
and that will give you a link straight
to the download page and one of the
things that you'll see is that there's
lots of different versions uh for
Jenkins because Jenkins runs on pretty
much uh most operating systems including
Windows uh Linux and Mac OS um but we
want to select the windows version so
we've already gone ahead and downloaded
a zip file which contains all of the
files that we need for Jenkins and so
there's the zip file and we've expanded
it and what we want to do now is H
double click the installer file and
we'll go ahead and install that so we've
already installed this so um one of the
things that we'll get is a message
asking if you want to repair you would
actually get a install message because
it' be a fresh install for you and but
once you've done that it has all the
files and all the settings correctly
installed onto your Windows computer and
we do all of our commands for Jenkins
through um a web page that's run locally
on your PC and so you're going to type
in Local Host colon 8080 and when you do
that they'll actually take you to
Jenkins running locally on your PC and
here we have our Jenkins dashboard and
we've already gone in and created some
sample jobs and you can see those listed
on the uh sorry on the right hand side
of the screen so let's go through some
of the things you would want to set up
here so first of all let's go into the
manage Jenkins screen and that will
actually so go to the manage Jenkins tab
on the left hand side uh to do some
standard configuration settings so we'll
go to the configuration systems and if
you want to if you're like remotely
connecting to a remote Jenkins
environment you can actually install a
jdk remotely for on that machine if you
want to and we already have the jdk
environment already set up so yeah
that's good here so we don't need to do
that but you'll also see is you go
through the uh the list of applications
that you have have Gradle an mavin
Docker uh git and other tools that you
would use in a devops environment there
are many other tools you can install
through plugins as well let's have a
look at one more setting here with the
security the default security is Jenkins
own user database uh that probably is
not allowed within your company due to
security um restrictions um so you can
choose Lam which allows you to connect
with your active directory configuration
again because there are so many plug
plugins uh for Jenkins uh there are
plugins for saml authentication as well
as a so let's go ahead and start a new
build new build job and so we select a
new item and we're going to select demo
one from that to create a new item and
we're going to use just a freestyle
project because I just want to demo how
you can actually create a build take
okay description um gosh what can we
write here um we can put in slimy demo
and we're not going to use source code
for this one we're going to do that in
the next demo but what we want to go
down to is the job time and we're going
to so build and we can just do um add
for execute Windows batch command and so
let's just put in a very simple command
and so we're going to type in Echo open
quotes hello world and then we'll put in
the Tim stamp so we'll put in date first
and then time as part of our output
those quotes and we're going to save
that that so set save and that's our
simple project so what we want to do now
is we want to actually go and select the
build Now command to actually run this
project hit build now and it'll take a
couple of minutes for it to run and here
we are this is our project and we can
actually now see the different builds
that have happened and if you look on
the build history you'll see the latest
history shows when the build was
executed and if you click on that uh you
can actually start getting information
such as the console output will actually
provide information that we were asking
for so for instance uh we have first of
all we can see that the build was
successful and we see the output
includes uh the hello all and date and
time so we're going to go ahead and
create one more project where we can
actually connect to a GitHub and use the
git command tool to be able to build a
real project so we're going to go ahead
and create a new item and we're going to
call this one Jenkins it's Frey our
project and our description is demo
using git um so we're actually going to
connect to GitHub and so to do that
we're going to go into source code
management Tab and we're going to select
get and so we select that we can
actually now connect to uh GitHub um so
to do that you go to your GitHub account
and you want to go in and select the
Clone or download and you get the URL
link from there so copy that uh go back
to Jenkins and add that in the
repository URL so you paste that in and
then for credentials we want to add in
our Jenkins credentials and so just make
sure you have those selected correctly
and we've select add and then we just
pull those from the drop down and let's
not change any of the other settings and
then for the build we're actually going
to be building a Java application so
it's a slightly different set of build
commands so we want to type in Java C
for comp file and then space and the
file name is simply. Java then you want
to put Java and space simply on a new
line save that it's again this is a
really simple application but it gives
you the understanding of what you need
to do here and so we saved it and let's
now go ahead and see if everything's
working we'll do the build now and see
what's happen and here is our first
build we select that uh we can go to the
conser output for details and what we
can actually see if we scroll down is
that the finished at the finished output
at the very end says success which means
everything was built correctly and so
that's how you're able to connect
Jenkins with a git repository and the
thing that's great with working with
Jenkins is that it connects to so many
different systems and really does become
the central point of your Dev Ops tool
set so let's start looking at the
operation side of the dev Ops
environment and let's focus in on Docker
so before Docker the problem you had as
a developer if you working on a virtual
machine the actual virtual machine uh
was a your VM uh was a very complex
piece of software so first of all VMS
have not been around for very long and
we're talking about less than 10 years
and the typical way of having a VM is
that it's very heavy of usage on your um
computer you essentially are running
everything of the VM plus the the tools
to run the VM on your computer with
Docker what you're able to control is
the actual development environment
you're working in you don't have to be
encumbered by all of the additional
extraneous processing that a VM
environment has you really stripped down
to just the bare minimum that you need
to have to run the environment using a
containerized solution known as Docker
so Docker is essentially an OS level
virtualization software it is a maturity
of the solutions that were started with
virtual environment and there are other
Solutions out there doc has become the
de facto container solution that you can
use for building out and guaranteeing
that what you the developer is building
is going to be the same as what the
operations team will use so Docker
itself is highly scalable and efficient
uh you can have many Docker environments
running on a single piece of Hardware
the boot up time is incredibly short you
can reuse the data volumes very very
easily it's not complicated ated and the
actual applications are completely
isolated this is like a perfect sandbox
environment so let's dig through the
architecture of Docker so there are
really two parts to Docker there's the
docker engine and there's the docker
client uh the docker engine is comprised
of the docker CLI which connects with
the server demon the docker client will
then issue the commands to the dock
demon and then the dock demon will then
interact with their system to be able to
provide the tasks and tools needed for
you to be able to build out your
solution the actual images that Docker
uses are instructions for creating
docket containers and the actual Docker
container itself is a lightweight
package that contains all the
dependencies needed to run an
application now once you have created a
container that is of value to your team
you want to be able to store that
container so that other team members can
use it and this is where you would use a
Docker registry to be able to host and
distribute multiple Docker images so in
this video we're going to go ahead and
see how we can get Docker installed and
running so we're going to go ahead and
open up our terminal window and we want
to validate whether or not Docker is
installed uh if you have't installed
Docker you can actually go ahead and use
the following command and that is to
enter in pseudo a install Docker and
that will go ahead and run the command
to install Docker um I already have
Docker installed on my system so I'm not
going do that right now so I'm just
going to delete that out but um what I
am going to do is check to see what
Docker images I have installed on my
system and to do that I'm going to type
in pseudo Docker images and when I run
this this will actually show how many
images I have and as right now I don't
have any images at all so why we go
ahead and install an image there are two
ways you can create an image for your
dog environment one is to get one from
dog Hub and the other is to create your
own image and let's go ahead and get one
from Docker Hub and so the command line
that we'd want to write is pseudo darker
pull reddis colon and after the colon
we're going to actually write the name
of the actual file that we're going to
be connecting to from Docker so I'm
going to go ahead and go to Docker Hub
and I've already logged in with my user
ID and account so I'm going to go to
dockerhub and hub. doer. com is the
website address and I'm already logged
in with my simply learn account and what
you can actually see is different
repositories that I have already created
below I'm going to collect the explore
button and I can see the the reddish
image and these are all the different
commands that I can actually use all the
different variations that I can create
so I can I I can do 5.0 I can do a 32bit
version I can do um a 4.0 o version or a
3.8 version or if I select latest that
will allow me to just pull the latest
version even if it's updated so I'm
going to go back to my command line do
latest and what's going to happen now is
that we're actually going to pull the
files live over the internet and create
the docket image so this is going to
take just a few minutes of course if
your internet speed is faster then this
will happen a lot
faster and here we are we have
everything downloaded which is great and
so let's just go and check and see if
the image has been added to Docker so we
do pseudo Docker images and now you can
actually see that we have the lest R
Redd um image and it's given the default
image ID and there's the size of the
docker image and the tag is latest so
it's the latest version of
redis and I'm just checking to see if
there's any other images running and no
there isn't so let's go ahead and now
create a container and so the command
for that is pseudo Docker run- d - P
0.0.0 I think it's 80 colon 80 space
Redd colon latest and let's run that got
an error message okay now you know that
it's a real demo this is really live so
I'm just going to clear the screen and
um let's write that in again and so
pseudo Docker run- d-p and it's
0.0.0.0 colon 8080 rus. col latest and
there we are everything's up and running
awesome so let's just go ahead and check
that we actually have the image running
in Docker so pseudo Docker PS and there
you can see that we actually have the
latest reddest version and it was
created 16 seconds ago we have a new
container ID for it and there's our Port
that we've
created and let's see if we can view all
the running containers and Pudo Docker
ps- a there we are and we created that
container 42 seconds ago one of the
things you'll notice is is um the name
for the docker is created automatically
by Docker and here we have stupified
angle bars is the name let's change that
name to something that's more meaningful
for the work that we're doing so that's
actually fairly easy too and it's going
to be our final task here so we're going
to type pseudo darker and the command is
rename and we want to copy over the old
name and then we put in the old name and
then you do a space and then you put in
what you want the new name to be in
which case we're going to make it simply
learn we run that command that's good
now let's validate that everything has
been changed so we're going to do pseudo
Docker
ps- just PS and there we are everything
has been renamed and that gets you
started working with darker now let's
move on to anable so before anable the
ability to be able to deploy software
across a network was pretty hard and you
know you couldn't guarantee that your
web servers were all consistent and that
the database environments were
consistent this was okay if you had a
small environment but once you actually
started getting into more complex
environments it became very difficult to
manage anable is code that allows you to
be able to consistently and reliably
create and stand up the environments
that you need to be able to store your
code for production so whether or not
you require one server environment or
you need a thousand server environments
using tools like anible will allow you
to be able to consistently deploy out
environments that all look the same so
essentially anable is a configuration
management tool and it allows you to be
able to deploy automatically to a large
variety of environments the actual tool
itself is a push based configuration
Tool uh it is an agentless tool so there
is no communication coming back about
the health of the environment we
actually have tools that we'll cover
later on in the video that cover that
anal does have a consistency of its
product performance so you know that if
you're using anible that it's going to
work it's just a very consistent product
and it uses SSH for very secure
connections so it doesn't matter whether
or not you have one or a thousand pieces
of Hardware you're looking to configure
you can actually be rest assured that
there will be no security infringement
because of the use of SSH and we look
into the architecture of anible it's a
very simple architecture there is the
anible management node that has play
books which contain the instructions
that you would have for your environment
and that Playbook is then pushed out to
all the different nodes that contain the
hardware that you wish to configure the
actual module collection is the
configuration code itself um the
playbooks are the the instructions of
that configuration and then the
inventory is the document of the
different groups and Hardware within
those groups that you would be pushing
out to so we're going to go ahead and
install anible onto system here and
we're actually running our environment
in a Linux environment right now U so we
have a must environment and and a
standard node but we're actually going
to go into our terminal window and we're
going to do everything on the master
node so the first steps we want to do is
actually go ahead and install anible and
we're going to do that by installing
pseudo yam install anable
Dy and this goes ahead and downloads all
the files that we need and starts to run
the
installation and let's go ahead and see
if it's installed correctly so we type
in
vi- ETC SL anible SL hosts and there we
see we actually have a default anible
hosts already up and running which is
fantastic and we want to grab this IP
address which is anable servers and then
the IP address with the password and
root access and the IP will be specific
to your local client so this is my
client system so if I type in my config
I'll actually see that the IP address
matches up and then you want to make
sure that the IP address is correct for
your environment and so this is
essentially a node in the nort
environment and this is the IP address
and the password for that node so we can
access effect um correctly so we're
going to hit colon at the bottom of the
screen and take ourselves actually into
anible and what we're going to do now is
create a Playbook to be able to run a
script so we're going to call it V
sample. yml and here we have a sample
Playbook we have the name we have the
host we have the user and we have the
task and in the task you actually see
that we're looking to create a virtual
web page with the content of welcome so
that we can actually see that the web
page is loading and all of this is
written with a very basic XML format
called yml which stands for yet another
markup language uh but it's very
flexible and it's very easy to learn so
let's see if we can go go ahead and
actually run this Playbook so you can
actually see it in
action and so we're going to type in
ansible-playbook uh sample. yml this
will run the sample yml script D- syntax
D
check and we Ty ansible-playbook
sample. yml so I had some issues there
so I'm going to try that again and let's
uh go in and write the uh command again
so an- Playbook
sample. yl- syntax do- check and then
run the actual Playbook itself and let's
see if it works yes everything's working
and it'll take a moment for everything
to initialize and now what we want to be
able to do is go back to our web browser
and see whether or not we were able to
create that default web page with the
word welcome in it uh cuz that was the
command that we created in our Playbook
and there we are there's the word
welcome exactly as we planned and we can
go back and and we can review The
Playbook that we created just to
validate that so let's go back into
screen here and let's uh go in and look
at the uh yaml page and there we are we
see that the word welcome is there
exactly as we expected now step into our
final area which is network monitoring
using a tool called nagios so before you
had nagios sometimes you didn't know
whether or not your network was working
in fact the worst case scenario was when
your customers called up and said hey
your website's not working you know the
challenges you had is that you didn't
know um how the usage of the server was
being managed you didn't know whether
you were up to 80% usage um utilization
on that server or if you were at 50% it
was difficult to get that information
easily with nagios you're able to set up
email notifications and other
notifications that allow you to stay
ahead of issues that you would have with
in your environment so with this example
if you're looking for memory utilization
you can receive a notification telling
you that your memory is almost full on a
particular server and that you should be
setting up a new server in this instance
use anible to set up another server so
again it's an as with the other tools
that we've been covering nagos is an
open- Source tool and it's specifically
for monitoring systems servers and
networks within your infrastructure very
easy to use it has comprehensive
monitoring tools that you can set and
control it is highly available and it is
designed specifically at problem
remediation you want to set it up so it
is the eyes and ears of your network
without you having to constantly monitor
your network so the way that nus works
is that it's just constantly checking
out your environment so the negative
server is constantly checking the status
of your systems and then is able to
create visualization tools of that data
so you can actually then make quick
responses or you can even send out
alerts such as an email alert or a push
notification Alert in this video we're
going to take you through the steps that
you need to follow if you want to set up
nagios and the dashboard nagios provides
to be help to help monitor your network
so the first thing you want to do is go
to nagios
docomo the application or you can
actually do what we're going to do here
is actually just log into the actual
application running on the nagio website
so for that you want to go to nagos na.
demos nagos
docomo provides and we've gone ahead and
we've actually pre-filled in our ID with
nagos admin and nagos admin for the user
name and password of course you wouldn't
do that in normal real life um so that
brings us into the nagio dashboard and
what you're going to notice is that
there are three distinct areas that you
should want to focus on um you have the
fixed sources which which is all your
actual physical Hardware that you're
monitoring you have alert summary and
abnormal behavior so let's go check out
the fix sources and so we have two
default fix sources here and one in
Chicago one in Tulsa um and you can go
ahead and set up additional sources um
but what you'll see is that this
provides a quick dashboard of the
activity in the last 30 minutes the
amount of usage on the the disc uh you
can go ahead and under the behavior Tab
and you can modify how you monitor
monitoring and updating the actual
Source itself and then the data from
these reports will be from these sources
will actually be then using reports
queries and alerts that you'll use so we
going to go back to the board and here
you are the two um fixed sources so
this's look at alert summary we going
expand that out and the alert summary
provides just a overview of the alerts
that are being managed the alerts that
you see here are the default alerts that
have been created as part of the test
environment um it's very easy to create
alerts and in this instance you can see
that the Chicago source is being used to
manage the alert what you can do is when
you're actually setting up your own
sources you'll see that the alert will
then point specifically to the source
that it's um pulling the data from so in
the PowerPoint in the presentation that
we just went through you actually see
how nagios actually is the center of
collecting all the information but it's
actually pulling information from the
different networks and environments you
have and then it stor that data locally
to be able to create the visualizations
and the alerts and we have here just a
quick overview of an alert here inside
of the summary which actually shows
green which shows that the alert is
actually good now there are three
different types of colors there's green
yellow and red but as you can see we
have no critical alerts right now and
you'll see the same thing happening at
abnormal behavior as well where it
actually goes ahead and shows you the
different colors that are available the
thing that's great is about as soon as a
war status is created then allows you to
trigger an email notification that gets
sent out to you and has information in
the email which you can then action so
the alerts are very important and the
alerts again are pulling the information
from the fixed sources so the abnormal
behavior is just going to zero in and
show any specific abnormal behavior that
would be happening with your fixed
sources and so in this instance it's
around bandwidth and everything is green
so everything's looking good so we're
going to the source Tab and we're going
to look at the bandwidth graph and this
is a more detailed visualization of the
bandwidth that's happening through the
Chicago fixed Source again you can
create your own fixed sources and you'll
be able to see the actual usage um such
as the bandwidth gr for that fixed
Source um on this screen and at the
bottom of the screen we have just kind
of the the most popular information that
um most Network Engineers are looking to
assess on how a network is being used so
we go ahead and we can select reports
and we can actually come in and we can
either create our own custom report or
you can use one of the many saved
reports are already there uh if you're
new to nagios use a save reports because
you'll be able to get in and get the
great visualization tools that negos
provides very quickly and be able to
then action the information visually
from what you're looking at these
reports are absolutely fantastic and
they're also really good to send to
other team members that would um have an
interest in understanding the network
usage um and the different areas that
you're managing uh now if you want to
get really specific on the type of data
that you want in the report you can
actually go in and create a query and
the query um can be customized to really
however you want it to to work the
points of view are very specific
insights into different data points that
interact and they're very easy to create
um a lot of them have been created as
you can see on the screen already um and
as you can see on the left hand side
there's an edit button that allows you
to edit and modify those points of view
very quickly now we're going to go ahead
and create one right now and we're just
going to put one in put the limiter for
an IP address we're going to change the
data lifetime we can either do hours
days a weeks we do 24 hours that's fine
so we'll just go ahead and we'll see
what we have on the screen and is as you
can see there are just a lot already
created select one we'll edit the FTP
and we'll see what the data lay time for
that is and it all looks good so a query
will show all of the safe queries you
created but you can actually go in and
modify query very easy um you can go in
and create a query and really
essentially ask it to pull any kind of
information that you would be looking at
analyzing that has been captured by
nagios and there's a dictionary you can
use that nagos has on their website that
allows you to get better access and
understanding the querying constructs
you can put together the alerts in my
opinion are the most important part
because these are the actual actions
that interact with the data sources and
will trigger alerts that get sent to you
uh so if we go back to the presentation
again you can see that we're analyzing a
lot of data but it's the data that gets
sent to you as an alert that allows you
to immediately understand why you need
to be able to go in and check out your
network and this is why you're really
using NEOS because you need to have
those alerts and so what we're going to
do here is we're going through the steps
you use to create an alert and we're
just going to do an an alert here that
uh is going to be on um analyzing btes
of traffic and the final step is to
actually go ahead and save the alert and
really put in what the alert
notification model um method is going to
be um the default is to use an email
which is great but you can use a nagios
alert or you know s SMP a simple Network
um protocol alert um or just use a an a
command email is definitely the easiest
one to use and so getting started I
would recommend you use email so we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
create one can do one on workflow and
we're going to set up the way which
we're going to manage this so the
threshold is going to be 34 bytes with a
critical threshold of 50 bytes which is
very small I expect an alert to be
triggered because of this and we're just
going to use the default emails to send
out and you'll see by default that um
the new alert is now impending and and
the reason why we have impending is that
it's just there to re be reviewed by the
system to make sure it meets all the
standards I don't think that' be a
problem and I'm just looking at some of
the other different commands we have
here so if we go back and we can get
alerts from other negative networks we
connect to different networks um right
from this configuration screen and same
thing with the S SMP receiver uh we can
use a simple Network management protocol
uh to connect to other receivers and the
command tab allows us to create scripts
that can be triggered from uh alerts
that get created so you may want to have
something that triggers a a rebuild of a
network environment which would allow
you to authenticate through um other
systems now of course there are other
things that you can set up in the nagos
dashboard so you know things like
information on your profile you know
default here such as language and your
username you have the same thing for
system administrator where you can
actually go in and set defaults for the
assist admin there's ldap ad integration
for simple um for S authentication go
back to the main dashboard we scroll
down you'll actually see that we have an
alert has been approved that's the alert
that we created before and it's now
saying critical and because more than 50
bytes of information have been sent over
our test Network in the uh fixed source
of Chicago surprise surprise 50 bytes is
very easy uh to do so it's good to see
that uh the uh system is working
correctly and this is how our nagios
environment works and uh from here the
next step is for you to be able to set
up and configure nagios to run with your
infrastructure thanks Matthew now we
