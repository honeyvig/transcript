without further delay let's get started
with the advanced tips on how to use f
formula in Excel now I have started my
Microsoft Excel and you can see I have a
really small data set so let's get
started by the simple F function as we
know it let's say we want to find out
the result of the following students and
there is a criteria let's say less than
or above some number they pass and less
than or above some number they are fail
right now let's get started with the IF
function equals to if and the
cell if this number is less than 35 then
the result is
fail else result is pass now enter the
answer is passed and now if you drag the
same formula across all the cells you
have the results so this is how we
basically know the function now let's
advance to a higher level where we have
multiple criteria you also want the
result like we got in the first sheet
which is pass or fail and along with the
result we also want the grade in one
single a function let's try to do that
so let's revise the simple if if
function less than
35 then
P else
has now I have a multiple level of f so
if the same cell okay we must equals to
f the max
cell is greater than equal to 80 so here
we have the criteria so if it is greater
than equal to 80 then it should be an a
comma another if it's similar to an
ested if which you use in programming so
another if select the F function by
using Tab Key and then the same cell
which is E8 if it is greater than or
equal
to 65 according to the criteria then you
should be printing
B comma another nested F function if the
same cell E8 is greater than or equal to
55 it should be C Comm if
E8 is greater than or equal to 45 then
you must be printing d
if
E8 is greater than or equal to 35 then
you must be prangle e else it should be
an F now close the bracket just ensure
that you get the black one which means
that all the brackets are in the right
place just press enter and drag the same
formula across all the rules and you
will have the grades and to make life
easier you can also choose if s or if
method so let's also try to explore that
drag the same sross here and add lines
and equals to instead of a simple F you
can go to the last one which says ifs
right now ifs will make things easier
instead of using IF inside un nested if
you can just write your conditions and
your grades so the say same cell which
is E8 should be greater than or equals
to 80 then in such scenario you can just
print a comma the second condition which
is the same E8 should be greater than or
equal to 65 then you can get a B comma
if the same marks is greater than or
equals to 55 then you can print me c
comma if the same
E8 is greater than or equal to 45 then
you can print me
D just make sure that you're placing the
commas in the right
place if the same E8 cell is than or
equals to 35 then you can print me e and
if it is none of those then if it is
none of of those so you're indicating
that with a number one then you can
print me
f
okay Enter there you
go the same formula it RS all the rows
and you have your grades and with that
we have covered two three methods the
simple F multiple nested F and Fs now
let's go to the next sheet where we have
another one so so far we have
concentrated on one particular cell
let's say if E8 is greater than a number
than pass or fail now let's say we have
multiple criterias the marks should be
above certain number and also along with
it we should also have attendance let's
say we have a
rock in the last section and uh we
want if we consider the result only by
number is pass but if we have a
condition
that let's say if you're an engineering
student you already know that you have a
minimum criteria of 60% of attendance
right so let's say we are judging the
result of Rog based on both numbers as
well as attendance then rock is a
failure candidate right so how do you
decide based on two conditions so that's
our condition here that's our criteria
here so let's try to investigate with
the same IF function so equals to if
select the function by using Tab and
before you get ahead with the condition
try to include an and function press T
to select and now select the
cell for Marks which should be greater
than let's say 35 and also comma the
attendance cell which is f8 here to be
greater than percentage so we have the
percentage in the F column so give the
decimal numbers so what's the minimum
number which which we are looking at is
0.6 so
0.6 if both these conditions are
satisfied then print me pass else print
me
fail bracket enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells and here
you have the results so you should be
getting both numbers above 35 and the
attendance should be above 60 now this
was the next type of condition or tip
for using advanced level F conditions
now coming here so we will be using the
next U step for using F conditions so
the only difference is in place of if we
will be using the function choose so
here we have list of professors and days
of a week so let's say we need to find
out which Professor will be scheduled to
your class on a specified date right so
here we have dates and based on this
particular calendar you will be
receiving professors chenny Albert St
Gilbert Swati John and Ken now let's try
to use the choose function so first we
need to extract the week dat so equals
to week dat of the date comma and here
you have numbers so number one Sunday
which means it is considering Sunday as
the first day of a week according to our
calendar we have Monday as the first day
of a week so we need to select the
second one press St to select there you
go if you close the bracket you will be
receiving the number four right so on
1st of February 2024 we have Thursday
right now this is not what we need we
need which Professor is going to come
here so Professor Gilbert is expected to
arrive on 1st of February so we need to
make minor changes to this so you need
we need to be using choose a function
over here press T to select
and
comma if it is first then it should be
Prof
Jenny second one is Prof
Albert so
on there you go now enter so some type
of mistake here we missed double Cod
here and not write enter once again and
there you go now if you drag the same
formula across all the cells you have
your particular professes for the te
then and to make things a little more
easier instead of using choose you can
use index match because we are getting
the address here right a cell address so
you can use index match equals to index
of week day press stop to select of this
particular cell
comma second option choose
that so far we have the match function
and now we need to give the index for
this particular one so the index is from
K7 to k30 so this is our index and the
match we already have now press enter we
drag the same formula across all the
cells you have your results yeah so a
small mistake here just quickly undo it
and if you double click the formula here
you can see we have not fixed the range
so let's fix the range using function
key F4 now enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells now you
should be having no errors there you go
and those were a few Advanced tips on
how to use if formula in Excel and with
that we have session on how to use IF
function in a few Advanced variations
