number one on the list is 11 Labs 11
Labs is an awesome tech company that
specializes in creating advanced voice
generation tools with the help of AI
basically they can take any text and
turn it into Super realistic and natural
sounding
voices this is perfect if you're working
on a video game a podcast or any kind of
online content one of the coolest things
about 11 Labs is that you can customize

they support a wide range of languages
and produce really high quality sound
and the best part it's really easy to
use and works well with other softwares
so you can add lifel like voiceovers to
your projects without any hazle 11 Labs
is really changing the game when it
comes to digital voices making them
sound more real and accessible for
everyone now let's see a sneak peek at
how it works so this is where the
website will take you to press the get
started for free button and you can sign
up with your Google account so first you
just have to enter a few details like
your name how you got to know about them
and everything yeah so you can fill
those details
first so here I'm giving I'm a
Creator
YouTuber you know depends on what your
profession is so as you can see we have
two options here you can convert text to
speech or convert your own voice to AI
speech so let's first check out the text
to speech option so we'll choose text to
speech option and after that uh you know
you have to copy paste your content so
here I already have a Content so I'm
just copy and paste and then you can
select the voice before selecting you
can even play it once like for example
Alice in our politics Washington is as
divided as ever you
can LEL trust if you
you can go through different voices and
you can select which voice suits your
content best so let me check with Emily
never mistake motion for Action okay so
we'll select this and generate Success
is Not final failure is not fatal and
once you have generated you can actually
download it so here you have a download
option so you can download it so now
let's see what are the other settings
yeah as you go to the settings you can
actually see you can you know vary the
stability now at the time you can
actually you know paste up to 5,000
characters in the box so now we'll try
out the speech to speech options so
either you can give a live recording or
also you can upload your own voice like
the recorded file so right now I'll be
uploading a recorded
file let's just hear it first hardships
often prepare Ordinary People for an
extraordinary distin so this this is
what I actually got after I uploaded my
own voice to be honest I'm not much
satisfied with it but let's see the
thing is while recording your audio you
must make sure that there is no other
disturbance now apart from these you can
also generate your own customade voice
so for that you have to click the voice
tab on the left side and hit create so
here you have voices tab you can add
create go to Voice design and you can
actually you know create a custom voice
like for example if you want a male
voice or a female voice so I'm selecting
a female voice you can select gender you
can select age you can select which
accent you want for example age I'm okay
let's just try old age accent let's keep
it British accent an accent strength let
it be almost high now let's see how it
comes
generate first we thought the PC was a
calculator then we found out how to turn
numbers into letters and we thought it
was a
typewriter see how awesome that was we
actually felt that it was an old lady
speaking right now another option an
interesting option is you can actually
create your own sound effects also by
giving a detail description so here is a
sound effect option so you can actually
give a description like you can give a
detailed description here for example
I'm just
giving uh small girl crying a small
girl let's see what what it's what it
generates see it has actually generated
four variations right so we can actually
play and see which is better and choose
from them so let's see how it
is
okay I think this is better than the
first
one quite
bad okay I think the second one
yeah the second one is better so like
they actually give you variations you
can actually select which one is better
for you and again hit the download
button okay now another awesome feature
which I found is the automated dubbing
option where we can actually replace the
original audio of a video with a new
language now that is very interesting
let's try that so go to the dubbing
option yeah so here what you can do is
you can actually uh select a video so I
have actually downloaded a video from
YouTube so it's it's an English
advertisement okay just a
second it's an English advertisement and
now I'm going to convert the audio of
that advertisement into Hindi language
so let's see the source language is
English and the target language that we
want is Hindi right yes now let's
see so this might take a few minutes
because you know they have to convert
the entire language the entire audio so
let's wait now it's the dubbing is
almost over now let's see how it sounds
so you have the view tab you have three
tabs remove download and view so let's
just view and see how it has come
[Music]
out Juice drink sort
[Music]
see now this is converted to Hindi oh
I'm really sorry I haven't shown you the
original video so just a second uh yeah
this was the original
videoed with added sugars and calories
[Music]
and Juice drinks sodas and sports drinks
are loaded with added sugars and
calories and have little or no
nutritional value so now you saw an
advertisement which was completely made
in the English language was converted
into an Hindi advertis ment just in a
few minutes Isn't that cool now let's
check out another cool tool to generate
speech which is called play HD play HD
is an amazing tool for creating
realistic voiceovers with play HD you
can easily turn text into natural
sounding speech using Advanced y
technology it offers a wide range of
voices in different languages so you can
pick the perfect one for your project
plus it's super user friendly you can
type your text choose a voice and hit
play you can even customize a speech by
adjusting the speed pitch and tone to
get it just right so let's see how
that's done so here you can click
generate AI voice for free which will
take you to this page now sign up using
your Gmail account like how you did for
11 Labs now again they will ask you so
many questions about whether you are an
individual or a company and why are you
creating video and everything so yeah
you can answer those questions and give
for videos entertainment videos and yes
you're done so to be honest I have found
played slightly cooler than 11 Labs uh
let's see how so first let's see how to
generate voice from text so again it's
the same process base the content in the
text box and choose the voice from the
drop-down okay so again we are selecting
we have already
selected okay we are selecting the
content pasting it here and after that
again we can select the voice so here
also you can you know listen to the
audios beforehand and then select which
suits you better so let's see do hello
Place support speaking please hold on a
moment let me just um pull up your
details real quick can you tell me your
account email so I'm going to select
thir just a second
confirm generate
speech now let's he Success is Not final
failure is not fatal it is the courage
to continue that counts so here you also
have an option where you can actually
decrease or increase the uh speed of
your audio now here comes a cool feature
of play HD so imagine you are preparing
a script for a drama or play where you
need different characters delivering the
dialogues so in play HD you can generate
multiple voiceovers so let's see how so
for that what you have to do is Click
create a new paragraph so here you have
click create a new paragraph and you can
U add another dialogue like for example
I'm adding this quote and you can
actually change the voice for that
particular person for example let's
let's take s let's try Samuel once upon
a time in a magical forign okay we'll
select Samuel
confirm generate speech now below you
can see that there's a track maintained
for the voices that you generate in
order so in this way you can generate
more character voices as per the
requirement so this will now look like a
conversation so I'll just play and
success is not final failure is not
fatal it is the courage to continue that
counts everyone has their own time to
rise be patient your moment will come
see so this is how you can actually you
know work upon your script like suppose
if you creating a script for drama or
any play or anything this is how you can
use PhD for that now this is a very cool
feature of PhD which was not available
in 11 Labs so now again PhD also allows
you to generate voice in multiple
languages same like 11 Labs so for that
you have to go to create new file you
can go to the fourth option where they
actually provide 900 plus voices for
over more than 100 plus languages now
you can create the audio select the
voice you want so we'll select
Hindi just a
second Hindi and let's try this Cloud
machine
learning take dea's voice confirm now
let's give a Hindi script let's see how
it
does so now you can con go to convert to
speech option
and after that you can download it from
here so now another cool feature is we
can clone our own voice let's see how
click on voice
cloning just a
second yeah click on voice cloning
create a new clone where you can you
know upload up to 30 seconds of audio
needed enter the voice
name it's a female
voice so this is my audio sample clone
voice press use
and we'll again copy paste a script or a
sentence so now this is my voice let's
see how it
comes Success is Not final failure is
not fatal it is the courage to continue
that counts so I think this is pretty
good like pretty good compared to 11
labs this particular feature so both of
these tools also have paid versions so
the free version itself has cool
features many cool features both for 11
labs and PhD but again according to your
uh purpose you can also purchase the
paid versions so these are the details
of the paid versions and also you can
check out the check out the websites
also so that was it there are numerous
audio generators available but we found
these better than the rest try out these
tools and let us know in the comment
