delay let's get started with our
tutorial for today which is about
integrating AI into your day-to-day
operations in Excel now let's quickly
switch to the Excel workbook now here I
have a simple basic Excel workbook and
to demonstrate the uh Power and
potential of integrating EI into your
Excel stret sheet we are performing a
small minor operation over here where we
just have few results right the students
their department and their percentage
now we going to calculate the result of
your pass or fail now you might be
telling me or you you might wonder this
is just a very simple if formula why do
you want to integrate an AI into this
now the speciality is let's say you are
a beginner in business analytics or data
analytics and even though if you're a
you know you might figure out the
formula but let's say you don't have any
idea on generating a new formula alog
together it's like asking a question to
chat jpd so here the AI editor that we
are going to integrate with Excel is
related to chat jpt and it's you know
built on chat GPT so basically it will
give you a query editor where you can
just write your query in very simple
terms like you're just talking to excel
right in the same way like you talk to
chat GP
ask AI Editor to give you a formula to
identify column D numbers and give you a
result in column e so let's get started
on how it can be done so it's really
simple go to the home bar and here you
can see add ends option just click on
that and here we have the AI Ed editor
in case if you don't find it just you
can you can just you know download any
of the gbd for Excel so just uh you know
click on this Parton over here and uh
you will get a search window just type
down AI editor or something so you can
just get one of those just press enter
so I'm using this the first
recommendation AI formula edit up you
can choose any one of these right charge
video over Excel we've got a multiple
ones so I'm using the first ones already
added into my workbook so let's quickly
go to the ai8 formula editor you might
have to um you know create create your
Microsoft account and try to login right
so here I have the AI generator right
now you can just write it down in your
own terms you can use your local
language you can use Excel anything just
write it down the way you want it right
uh you can just type down uh give me an
Excel
formula to
identify if the students pass the exam
and not
result
percentage percentage greater than or
okay percentage greater than or equal to
35% is pass and
percentage less than 35 is fail is your
parameter are your
parameters is submited and it will give
you a query or a formula which you can
just copy and paste into the Excel cell
or workbook here we have one you can
just copy it the way it is just paste it
over here so in place of A1 you're
supposed to use percentage enter now you
have the results pass right so it is we
did not specify the column number here
right in case if we have spef ified the
column number or column header which is
basically e over here sorry D over here
so we named it as percentage so it did
and another thing to recognize we did
not convert this into table so basic few
things but overall you are getting a
readily available formula which is
completely Flawless you can also
experiment this particular feature of AI
AED formula editor with some complexed
Advanced Excel tricks as well should you
