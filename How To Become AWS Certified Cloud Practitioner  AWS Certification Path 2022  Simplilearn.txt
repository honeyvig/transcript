the required knowledge is divided into
four domains for the exam these are
various objectives within each test
domain that broadly reflect the
knowledge and expertise required to pass
the exam
cloud concept
this domain makes up 28 percent of the
exam
security this domain makes up 24 of the
exam
technology makes 36 percent of the exam
and billing and pricing makes up 12
of the exam
the following three goals are included
in cloud concepts
they find the aws cloud and the value
proposition it provides recognize
characteristics of the aws cloud's
economics
and make a list of the various cloud
architecture design principles
you should be able to explain the
advantages of public cloud services and
define the services that are offered on
aws like
iaas eas and saas
you must comprehend the financial
benefits of cloud computing and the
distinction between
c a p e x and o p e x this relates to
item one
you should be familiar with cloud
architectural design principles such as
loose coupling scaling bootstrapping and
automation to mention a few
now comes security
you should be familiar with the aws
shared responsibility model which
specifies who is in charge of which
component of the technology stack from
the data center to servers firewall
rules and data encryption
aws offers tools and services for
deploying security evaluating your
security posture and creating alert and
compliance reports you must be
have a thorough
understanding of these services and
tools in order to describe their use and
benefits now comes technology
you must know what the basic aws
services are and how they are used

redshift elastic load balancing auto
scaling cloudfront root s3 cloudwatch
cloudtrail and sms are all core services
you should be familiar with the aws
cloud's worldwide infrastructure
regions availability zones and edge
locations are all part of this
then comes billing and pricing the
majority of aws services are available
on a pay-per-use basis
however there are also alternatives to
save money by signing one or three year
contract with a variety of payment
options
you must comprehend these models and the
services to which they apply
make sure you know what aws will charge
you and what will be free inbound data
transport for example is free whereas
outbound data transfer is usually
expensive
vpc cloud formation and iam are all free
services but the resources you generate

it will require more or less resources
in the future
thanks to
elasticity infrastructure can scale up
and down on demand thanks to elasticity
question 2

option 4 gain greater control of the
infrastructure layers and option 5
comply with all local security
compliance programs
well the answer is option one and two
you may pay on a variable opex basis for
the resources you use and grow on demand
using public cloud services like aws so
you never have to guess how much
resources you need to deploy
question five
under the aws shared responsibility
model what is the customer responsible
for
choose two
option one physical security of the data
center option two replacement and
disposable of this drivers
option three configuration of security
groups
option four
patch management of infrastructure and
option 5 encryption of customer data
the answer is option 3 and 5
customers are responsible for creating
security groups network acls updating
their operating systems and encrypting
their data
while aws is responsible for the
physical security of the dc the
replacement of obsolete disk drivers and
infrastructure patch management
question six
what are two ways an aws customer can
reduce their monthly spend
choose two
option one
turn off your resources that are not
being used
option two use more power efficient
instance
types

suitable option four be efficient with
the usage of security groups
and option 5 reduce the amount of data
in dress charges
the answer is option 1 and 3
turning of resources that aren't in use
can help you save money reserved
instances can also help you save money

a one or three year contract which is
ideal for predictable workloads
question 7
what are the advantages of availability
zones choose to
option one they allow regional disaster
recovery
option two
they provide fault isolation
option three they enable the caching of
data for faster delivery to end users

network connection
and option 5 they enable you to connect
your on-premises networks to aws to form
a hybrid cloud
the answer is option two
and four
each aws region has numerous
availability zones which are unique
locations each az is designed to be
isolated from other failures a data
center is an az and
in some situations an ez is made up of
numerous data centers
with an area hazard provides low cost
low latency network connectivity to
other zones within that region this
allows you to synchronize
duplicate your data between data centers
allowing the failover to be automated
and visible to your users

now that we have discussed all the
important aspects required for aws cloud
practitioner exam
let me give you some tips
you should remember while taking the
exam
first start by answering questions you
are familiar with to prevent spending
time on tough ones
it will give you confidence as well as
save you from wasting your time on
trying tough questions
second keep track of your time and learn
how to manage it in order to complete
all the questions distribute your time
according to the time available to the
number of questions so that you can work
on each question precisely
third analyze the question first then
respond as there may be traps in the
questions focus on keywords and try to
read them two to three times for better
understanding sometimes it is said that
answer lies in the question itself
fourth because there may be numerous
answers to a question
read and choose your answers carefully
if you feel there is a chance that
multiple answers are correct for one
question
then do go for it and analyze it wisely
before coming to that conclusion
