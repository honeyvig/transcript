the increasing adoption of cloud
computing solutions will offer robust
opportunities for both the market of the
forecast period and allow introduction
of newer technologies
the use of cloud computing solutions is
quickly growing worldwide owing to the
lower cost of cloud-based services and
the lack of the need to set up separate
idea infrastructure
the penetration testing market is
predicted to also grow in the near
future due to the increasing use of
cloud-based solutions and services for
multiple workloads be it email data
backups crm and collaborative services
cloud deployment exposes software to
more vulnerability and makes it more
accessible to unauthorized users
this is where penetration testing for
security testing comes in
with handheld devices seeming to be the
primary device of choice for the future
one such framework that facilitates this
service is the offensive security back
kali net hunter
so let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in today's video on kali net
hunter
we start with a small introduction to
what kali net hunter is followed by
going through the different versions of
parallel net hunter we then learn about
the different components in the kali
network framework and some of the most
helpful attacks or features that are
featured in this distribution
finally we take a look at the pros and
cons of kali net hunter as a whole

so let's get started with what is kali
net hunter
kali net hunter is the very first
android penetration testing framework
for android smartphones
because net hunter is an open source
project developers can freely utilize it
without fearing copyright infringements
or other threats the project grants
access to the kali toolkit to compatible
android devices which allows penetration
testing
furthermore net hunter provides several
unique capabilities and available on
other hardware platforms
a user land refers to space outside of
an operating system kernel meaning
anything that doesn't have root access
we can use an app to system supported on
nexus or oneplus and rooted android
phones
while this is pretty incredible there
are some limitations to this
in general you can communicate with the
instance of whatever linux device you
want by ssh or vnc using kali net hunter
the best device for hackers is an
android phone installed by kali linux
because mobile phones are more
convenient and portable than laptops for
personal purposes
the night hunter interface also allows
users to work easily with complicated
configuration files through a local web
apache interface
aside from this functionality
modified kernels that handwrite 802.11
wireless injections and securely link
pre-configured vpn services comprise a
strong network security breakthrough and
a separate dropbox with kali linux
constantly at your disposal
we now have a basic understanding of
what kali linux net hunter is
however there isn't a single
distribution to learn about here
kali linux net hunter has multiple
different versions depending on the
device at the hands of the users
let's cover them in more detail
so let's cover them in more detail
while kali net hunter functions as a
portable operating system designed for
penetration testing there can be other
tools you want that isn't pre-installed
to solve this problem there is a net
understood at the address
store.nethunter.com
this function is the same as a google
play store on android or app stores on
iphones
except the difference is that the tools
in this repository are more in line with
ethical hacking and
network penetration
the first of the three versions that
netflix provides
is the net hunter rootless
this works on almost all devices without
any issues the number of tools available
in this version is the lowest among the
three
we then have net hunter lite which
requires root privileges to work
properly
it doesn't need any custom kernel
fashion to power up and has
comparatively more tools than net hunter
rootless
finally we have the original net hunter
package with all the tools available at
its disposal
however your device must have good
privileges and the custom net hunter
kernel to install this version
as we can clearly see the more open our
device settings and preferences are the
more tools kali net hunter can work with
root privileges provide administrative
access to many functionalities that net
hunter can leverage and ultimately
perform network penetration with
some rules are exclusive to the original
net hunter core and not under light so
you may have to cross check your
requirements before installing any
version on your device
now that we have covered the different
versions of kali net hunter let us cover
its different components and how they
help in the working of this distribution
we look at the various net hunter
components which are effectively the
building pieces of net hunter's
operation
net hunters roam comprises of various
pieces that communicate and rely on one
another to function properly
below you will look at the three
components that comprise net hunter the
first is a modified android kernel
followed by net hunter android app and
finally but not least the kali linux
chrome itself
let's examine these in depth
the program that provides a ui to
simplify the user's tasks is a graphical
component of net hunter which is its
android
the software provides a straightforward
interface for controlling the kali linux
ch root
the fact that it has a simple ui does
not imply that it is not capable of
performing complex tasks this
application contains all configuration
files necessary by net hunter and is
transferred to the sd card during the
first run
aside from the ui the program also
serves as a boot up service allowing the
server to activate when the device ports
out
the next inline is the custom android
kernel
the kernel is a system component that
allows applications to link to hardware
that meet users needs aside from
facilitating communication the kernel
also maintains system resources
now the default kernels inside android
do not supply at all utilities for
security and exploitation
still with a custom android kernel any
device can empower with unique features
which are not accessible in the stock
ones
now we have the kali ch root
chute is essentially a full color lens
installation that allows android to
share network storage and other
resources
the kali linux siege tube is effectively
the heart of netrunner and the
configuration settings have been updated
so that net hunter functions seamlessly
with the android ecosystem
netnata has a ch2 manager that
simplifies the download and installation
of chu
this component is stored in an internal
app storage region and one must meet the
installation space requirements
now that you have covered the different
components of kali net hunter let us
cover some of the tools the distribution
offers that may be used in penetration
testing
at the top of the chain lies nmap
and map stands for network mapper and is
a free and open source utility for
network discovery and security auditing
many systems and network administrators
who also find it useful for tasks such
as network inventory managing service
upgrade schedules and monitoring host or
service uptime
it is most beneficial in the early stage
of exploitation where a hacker must
figure out the possible entry point to a
system before running the necessary
exploits
it uses raw ip packets in novel ways to
determine what hosts are available on
the network what services are being run
what hosts are offering etc
it was designed to scan large networks
but it also works fine against single
host
moving on we have the mitm framework
mitm or man in the work framework
provides a one-stop shop for man in the
middle and network attacks while
updating and improving existing attacks
and techniques
originally built to address the
significant shortcomings of other tools
it's been almost completely rewritten
from scratch to provide a modular and
easily extendable framework that anyone
can use to implement their own version
of a man-in-the-middle attack
it contains built-in smb http and dns
servers that can be controlled and used
by various plugins
the next tool at hand is the kex manager
it stands for the kali restock
experience
kali net100 desktop experience puts the
kali linux desktop in the palm of your
hand
it provides the graphical user interface
or gui of kali desktop on your android
device making penetration relatively
easier for people not comfortable with
the command line
however
the major tools all include command line
functions so this is more of a
convenience inclusion rather than a
functional one
finally we have metasploit the
metasploit framework is a very powerful
tool that can be used by cyber criminals
as well as ethical hackers to probe
systemic vulnerabilities on networks and
servers
because it's an open source framework it
can be easily customized and used with
most operating systems
with metasploit the ethical hacking team
can use ready-made or custom code and
introduce it into a network to probe for
weaker spots as another paper of threat
hunting once the flaws are identified
and documented the information can be
used to address systemic weaknesses and
prioritize solutions
we now have a very clear understanding
of what kali net hunter is and its
features
let's cover some of the pros and cons of
this particular framework
when it comes to the advantages
net hunter provides features that are
not by default included in the original
kernels of android phones
the new tools can be used to perform
network penetration and system checks
for security vulnerabilities
qualcomm jets and snapdragon have
monitor support enabled monitor mode
helps listen to wireless traffic and
capture data packets which can then be
unencrypted and snooped on
the kernel builder's presence assists
the easy creation of kernels that are
not yet available to the public
similarly the use of gitlab cli or
command line interface speeds up the
release timelines it allows the input of
other developers making the bug's
washing process easier and the
development of the tools more
collaborative
the human interface device hardware is
fully supported by default but it must
be enabled and configured through user
space controls
so when it comes to the disadvantages of
kali net hunter
so not every android phone is supported
as part of the official netcenter
release
therefore be cautious while downloading
and running them since the wrong net
hunter may break the phone in some very
rare circumstances
because some internal wi-fi systems do
not allow monitor mode or data packet
injection an external usb wi-fi adapter
may be required for some devices who
want to pursue wireless network
penetration
