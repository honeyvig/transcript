hello everyone this is dr. Marjorie from
Team MBS conquer I'm going to discuss
about the edema in this video
so this edema means the abnormal and
excessive accumulation of free fluid in
the interstitial tissue even in the
spaces and serous cavities is called as
a edema and in the Greek terminology the
edema means the swelling there are two
things here that is free fluid in the
body cavities and free fluid in the
industrial space okay
free fluid in the body cavities is
commonly called as an effusion
whereas free fluid in the interstitial
space is termed as a edema then coming
to the classification it is of two types
localized Eddy minor and generalized
edema and then generalized edema is also
called as a Ana Sarkoja dropsy and
depending upon the fluid composition the
edema may be of a transudate
and the exudate now we will see the
differences between the transudate and
the exudate and here the translate means
the filtrate of the blood plasma without
any changes in the endothelial
permeability whereas in the x-ray there
is the increased vascular permeability
translate is a non-inflammatory whereas
x-ray it is an inflammatory protein
content is very low this point is very
important protein content is less than
one gram in the trans date whereas high
that is 2.5 to 3.5 gram per decilitre in
xr8 glucose content is same as in class
now whereas accelerated is low that is
less than 60 mg specific gravity is low
your ex rate it is high pH is greater
than 1.3 for trans date less than 7.3
for ex rate le H is low whereas exudate
is in it is high a fusion of ndh or
serum at this ratio is less than 0.6
whereas here in the x-rated is greater
than 0.6 cells will be few cells only
present like mainly mesothelial cells
and cellular debris but as many
inflammatory cells as well as
parenchymal cells can be seen in the
exudate an example in edema
in the consistory cardiac failure is
your translate whereas purulent exudate
such as puss-puss is the example of the
purulent exudate this table is very very
important then the coming to the
pathogenesis of edema this edema may be
because of six reasons that is decreased
the plasma oncotic pressure so that is
decreased in plasma oncotic pressure may
be you can see in the edema in renal
disease or a ascites liver or a edema
due to hyper protein india hypo protein
emia so these are the renal disease
ascites and hypo protein emia on because
of decreased plasma oncotic pressure if
you see the second one that is increased
capillary hydrostatic pressure okay this
capillary hydrostatic pressure is the is
the force that normally tends to drive
the fluid through the capillary wall I
mean this pressure will drive the fluid
through the capillary one okay this
increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
may be seen in edema of cardiac diseases
or in a ascites
pass you congestions and postural edema
all these are the examples of this
increase the capillary hydrostatic
pressure then coming to the lymphatic
obstruction lymphatic obstruction is
mainly because of in the examples
include lymphedema like removal of
axillary lymph nodes or inflammation of
the lymphatics and one important term is
there it is
Milroy disease will mi l ar-15s min rise
disease that is it is called as a
hereditary it is a hereditary lymphedema
then coming to them
tissue factors like sorry this is the
tissue factors like increased oncotic
pressure of interstitial fluid and
decreased tissue tension then increase
the capillary permeability and the
sodium and water retention so these are
the pathogens I mean of edema
then you can see here in the picture is
the norm
fluidics chains whereas here you can see
the decrease the plasma osmotic pressure
here you can see the decreased plasma
osmotic pressure then increase the
capillary pressure also he leads to the
more amount of fluid into this
extracellular space is leadings to the
edema find lymphatic flow obstruction
causes lymphedema and the tissue factors
and the increased capillary permeability
also causes the edema then this is the
pathology Amalek pathogens is showing
the sodium and water retention so this
involves like extra renal that is
hormonal intrinsic renal or a deist
mechanism so if there is a hypovolemia
it causes the renal ischemia this causes
a decrease in the sodium in renal
tubules which causes angiotensin or gen
substrate and this hypovolemia will will
act on the baroreceptors at the
vasomotor center and it activates the
sympathetic outflow and even in if there
is hypovolemia there is increase in the
ABS production in the posterior
pituitary gland so all these things and
in Nanji attention this angiotensin will
convert angiotensin 1 is committed to
angry dancing do finally there is a I
lost it on release so this causes
increase the sodium and water retention
and the sympathetic flow will cause
renal ischemia decreased
drum roll filtrate rate and decrease the
excretion of sodium and finally the
sodium and water retention and also the
finally the production of ADH causes
increased retention of water and finally
the sodium and water retention so this
sodium and water retention increase the
residence in an atomizer so these are
the results of sodium and water
retention and these are the differences
between the nephrotic edema in Ephrata
Kadima and here the nephrotic edema the
important thing to be is proteinuria it
is heavy here it is moderate there is
protein content it is high here where it
is low
mechanism is decreased plasma oncotic
pressure and sodium and water retention
and this is nephrotic this is because of
sodium and water retention degree of
edema will be severe and generalize wear
a smile in the freighting distribution
subcutaneous tissues as well as visceral
organs whereas here the loose tissues
mainly nephrite academy that is face i
isn't anchors genitalia okay so if they
float academy is there you can see the
swelling of this whereas nephrotic edema
you can see the swelling of face
remember this thing okay this is
important then this is speaker this is
the pathogens of cardiac edema that is
in congestive heart failure you will see
the increase the central venous pressure
or a decreased cardiac output or a
chronic hypoxia these three things you
will see so because of the increased
central venous pressure there is a
increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
and because of the back pressure
hypothesis cardiac atomized seen and
because of the decreased cardiac hype
output there is a hypovolemia and
because of this we have seen right
previously that hypovolemia may be extra
renal and because of hollister are
intrinsic is because of GFR and the ADH
production the PT during all these leads
to water retention sodium and water
retention cardiac edema and this chronic
hypoxia will needs to increase the
capillary permeability and because of
the forward pressure hypothesis it
causes the cardiac edema then coming to
this thing you can see the pathogenesis
of the pulmonary edema this is because
of the increased in the hydrostatic
pressure you can see the annular ad my
here I need this thing because of the
increased permeability so increase in
the pulmonary hydrostatic pressure and
increase in the permeability are the two
things which make the pulmonary edema
and in the cerebral edema the mechanism
here it differ differs from the other
because there is no draining the
lymphatics in the brain so the function
of fluid electrolyte exchange is
performed by the blood brain
barrier located in the theatres and so
the function of fluid and electrolyte
exchange is performed by the blood-brain
barrier here remember in the cerebrum
the cerebral edema may be it is of
vasogenic or a cytotoxic and uh
industrial types and if you see the
hepatic edema you there is a hyper
protein Linea portal hypotension failure
on inactivation of aldosterone and the
secondary stimulation of graining and
your tension mechanism so these four
things are there which we can see in the
hepatic edema then in the nutritional
edema mainly the nutritional deficiency
of proteins likewise your a prolonged
starvation and vitamin deficiencies and
chronic alcoholism all these may be -
the edema and finally the mix edema this
is due to the deposition of
glycosaminoglycans on the industries iam
and remember this is important that if
it appears as basophilic
mucopolysaccharides in the when seeing
microscopically so that is regarding the
edema so the important thing to be
remembered in the idem is your
transudate and exudate and also the
difference between the nephrite taken
the nephrotic edema okay well work hard
steepest you and lower learning with MDS
