description box below and the pin
comment so without any further Ado let's
get started so hello guys welcome to
this demo part of this video so here
what I will do I will go to new then
Python 3
file then
here I will give it the name called
exploratory
data analysis basically we will so we
have one data set file of roller coaster
basically so we will be using that and
you can download that file from the
description box below from the below
link dve Ling okay so we will be doing
some small basic function using using
Python and later on we will uh make some
good charts okay we will remove
duplicates and all we will do all
that thing we'll do data preparation
we'll do feature engineering okay and uh
we'll remove the duplicates we'll check
for the duplicates we'll make charts
like histogram KD blogs box blog and
like many more similar to that like heat
map will make scatter L Group by
comparison okay we all do that right so
just stick with me and you can right
side along with me your this good okay
okay so let's start with
importing pandas
first I guess everyone know what is
pandas and
numai
fine as NP then I will import
numpy as NP why this is NP and PD sorry
my bad PD is here because I don't want
to write again and again this pandas
this numai so basically I can write this
is small version okay yeah so if you
guys don't know what is Panda so panda
is very popular library for working with
data okay it's goal is to be the most
powerful and flexible open source 2
okay so it has these that go so data
frames are the center of pandas and what
is data frame a data frame is is
structured like a table or a spreadsheet
okay the rows and the columns okay
whereas nump numai is an open source
python Library again that facilitates uh
you know efficient numerical operation
on large quantities of data okay so
there are many functions in numpy as
well those we can use in the Pand data
frame got it so we'll import one
more do
pyplot do PAB okay as PLT okay there is
one more Library M plot lip for plotting
the graph and and there is one more
import
cbon as SNS so what is cbon cbon is
again the Pyon data visualization
Library based on M BL Li okay it
provides a high level interface for
drawing attractive and informative
statical unog graphs okay then I will
write here PLT do
style do
use we'll write
ggplot got it
ggplot
fine so yeah let me run it so what is
ggplot so ggplot is an again this is an
open source data visualization package
for a statical programming okay so yeah
uh you can say or a general scheme for
data visualization which breaks up graph
into know semantic components such as
scales and layers okay mlo Le
by get
SP B okay yeah so
now we will import our data set DF DF
means data frame you can write any word
of your choice then PD again pandas
doore CSV used for readings CSV file
okay Excel files got it then here I will
write
my this
coaster. CSV okay I'm not writing any
path because my this uh data set is here
itself coaster coaster C Co this is
coaster. CSV okay if you have your data
set in another location as in like in C
drive D drive or whatever okay you can
give that
path okay let me run it yeah so now we
will do some data understanding okay
we'll see data frame shape head and tail
data drives UND describe like small
small function we will use DF do
shape done it so we have 1087 rows and
56 columns in our data
set okay then we will see DF do head
5 so DF do head means it will give me
top five rows of my data set okay you
can see 1 2 3 4 five okay five rows and
56 columns here 56 column but we have
1087 rows okay so we have cost name
length speed location status opening
date type this this this this okay we
will
do uh you know we'll make some graphs
using this these columns okay and there
is one more DF do
tail again last five rows so DF do tail
gives you the last last five rows see
1086 1085 okay and if you want to
see full data it is here okay 0 to one8
fine yeah so we have one more DF do
columns to
check all the
columns see coaster name L speed
location stat as opening date type and
these all are my columns names fine so
we have one more data types actually we
have like many data types but let me
show you some important ones or you can
say some the basics ones okay so DF dot
d types D types means data types Co name
is object type length object and
inversion is float okay we'll check
[Music]
inversion where's the inv verion yeah
Flo type okay
then everything is object and er
introduces in numeric one and let it do
float okay so basically we have three
types float int and
object okay then what do we do let's
just quickly check this
describe okay so what is the count of
this inversion 932
okay it won't include any you know what
is it empty cells okay it won't count
empty cells right mean of this
particular table then standard deviation
then mean minimum value 25% 70% 75% and
Max it will describe you all this okay
and there is one more DF doino to get
the info see coaster name 1087 value non
n object
then length 953 non n okay like
this yeah so now moving forward what we
will do we will do data preparation okay
what comes in data preparation like
dropping irrelevant columns and rows
which we don't want okay then second
thing is identifying duplicates columns
then third is raming
columns then we'll do some feature
Creations
right so if you want to drop a column
okay how you can
drop so you have to write just DF do
drop first I will give here has
data
rep okay yeah so how you can drop a
column okay DF do
drop then here I will
write
opening
date Comm XIs equals to
one
okay opening okay spelling
strong instead of
this maybe what is the opening date okay
o is capital
here instead of this you can use double
to okay AIS is not defined
my bad so what you have to do you have
to give this here and you have to
yeah again ACC is not
defined yeah fine okay so as you can see
here first I will show you this question
name length speed location status and
opening date is here
fine so if you will go here question
name length speed location status
nothing opening date is there right so
this is how you can drop a table fine
for a while I'm making this as a comment
maybe in
future upcoming you know making graph I
need this okay so yeah so I will write
here DF equals
to
DF coaster name
comma
location then
comma
status then here I will write
manufacturer fine then again
comma then I will give
here
ear
introduced
then comma
latitude wait I will tell you why I'm
doing this then
longitude let itude
longitude then I will give
you type
M okay
then
opening
date clean
fine then speed
into R is Right
speed comma what
else
then
height
foot
inversion clean
Comm
gForce clean dot copy
yeah so here I will write
okay type
in okay one more mistake is
here
fine so now what I will
do I will write here open
date clean equals to
pd2 do date
Tye
DF
opening
date clean
fine what happen
so what this does this PD do2 dat time
do okay so it converts argument to data
time date time okay so this function you
know you can see converts a scalar array
like or series or data frame dictionary
like to a panda's datetime object
okay so now let's rename the
columns okay
then to you know for better things
DF equals to DF dot
rename columns equ
to
coaster name
then
poster
name
comma here
introduced
then
here
introduced
okay opening date clean
to
open
date okay then I will write
speed in
R
then caps
speed got it
then height into
foot I will write it
as
C so why I'm writing this because this
is a very good practice as a
professional way know as a data analyst
or as a business analyst whatever you
are working on machine learning projects
or whatever the this is a good
practice okay so
inversions
inions
clean then it should be
like
verions then
gForce clean to
gForce
fine let me done
it okay now let's check the
column yeah so now you can say our
column name is
changed
fine so I will write this
and Dot
sum so what does this is an a do sum do
so is an a function returns a Boolean
value of you know true if the value is n
n and the false otherwise and the sum
function return the sum of the two
values which equals to the number of NN
values in the column so here we have
zero NN here same this stat is
23 here 217
5 height for is 916 okay so now what we
will do we will write here DF dot
location DF dot
duplicate I told you in
starting
will duplicate it
okay question name location status okay
let duplicate it now okay
so now what we will do I will check
duplicates for the cooster name so you
can write DF doco L LC then
DF DF
dot
duplicated and subset equs
to
poster name then dot
head okay head of five now everyone know
right what do
what this head
does okay yeah so here you can see so
these are
duplicate okay of the question name
right why because you can just check the
type
in and all fine so now checking with an
example duplicate let's check DF do
query
Co
name equals
to
Crystal you know now you will get
Beach Cyclone okay I took this Crystal
Beach Cyclone
fine then run it so now you can see 39
and 43 are the
same okay everything is same so this one
is duplicate so now what I will do I
will write here just let me give some
space yeah DF do
columns then I will write here
DF
DF
loation then DF
do
duplicated
subset
question question name
then
location
then
opening
date
okay
dot
deset
index then drop
that okay
so now what we will do we will do some
feature understanding
okay so now we will do some feature
understanding okay so in this we will
plot some feature distribution like
histogram KD box plot okay for that I
will write here
DF ER introduced
okay then I will write
value
counts so now what I will do let's
create bar chart okay axal to
D introduced
dot
value comes
okay then
dot head 10 Max I
need then Dot Plot kind equals to I need
bar then title is
stopped I like what what what what
should we give top
10
years coaster
introduce okay
then I will write here a x do
set X
label then I will write here
here
introduced okay then I will write it ax
do set y Lael
then count okay let me run it okay
unexpected corrector after line
continuation
okay we can remove
this unexpected
intended now let me run it yeah so this
is our bar blot okay so this is how you
can create bar bar plot using your data
okay
so a barplot is you know one of the most
common types of Graphics in this data
visualization or Ed it shows the
relationship between a numerical and the
categorical variable okay so each entity
of this category variable is represented
as a
bar got it so now let's do some more so
what uh
let's make a class okay
histogram so for that I
write ax =
DF
speed R then
plot kind equals
to
St then comma I'll write B pin here okay
pins equals to
20
then
title
coaster
speed okay me R then
ax dot
set X
lbel
spe okay forward to give
this okay yeah so histogram displays
numerical data by grouping data into bin
of equal width so here each bin is
plotted as a bar whose height correspond
to how many data points are in that bin
so bins you can say are also sometimes
called the intervals or classes or
buckets
basically it's the
same so here for this this much is the
bin for this this much is the bin this
is like that
okay so now let's create KD plot so for
that it's very simple axal
DF then I can write as speed in R then
plot
kindal to KD
comma title
I can write anything
coaster
speed then ax.
set X
level
speed
okay yeah so KD what does KD means a
kernel density estimate this plot is a
method of you know visualizing the
distribution of observation in a data
set analoges to a histogram so KD
represent the data using a continuous
probability density curve in one or more
Dimension okay in one or more Dimension
that curve fine so now let's do some
feature relationship so in this we will
make scatter plot heat map correlation
and pair plot okay or we can also do
some group by comparison fine so now
let's first make
scatter plot okay so DF do
plot kind equals
to
scatter
comma X =
to
speed m
r comma y =
to height
inut
fine then comma let's get the title
equals to coaster
speed
versus
height fine then PLT do
show okay some error is there speed me R
okay okay s should be capital and it
should be
Capital
yeah so this is scatter plot speed
versus height this is a speed versus
height okay if the I can see here height
is directly proportional to speed
somewhat because if you can see the 350
is speed is than 120 km per hour no it's
not like that okay
fine so scatter plot identifies the
possible relationship between change
observed in two different sets of
variable here the variables are height
and the speed okay it provides a visual
and the statical you know means to test
the strength of relationship between two
varable fine now
let's okay now let's make one more to
give you better idea okay with
Legend now I will show you wait SNS do
scatter plot then xals
to speed
R comma y =
to height into
fo feet whatever you can say then H will
be there then
here
introduced okay then data equals to DF
then axal to set
title set title then
coaster speed
versus
height then PLT do
show yeah so now you can
see so this color you know the light
color I will let me Zoom it okay okay so
this color we have some here which are
introduced in '90s okay and this color
which are introduced in 1925 and these
colors which are introduced in 2000 okay
so you can see like this as
well so now let's make pair blot okay
it's look
amazing so let me write SNS
dot dot pair PL do then DF
comma variable equals to I need ER
introduce then
speed meter
R comma that should be Capital height
for just remember the spelling okay case
sensitive in
inversion inversions
comma inversions comma
gForce okay comma here I will put what
what what what okay I put
type
mean find that
PL okay let run it okay some is
there here
introduced
byab and save here so that's why I'm
saying just remember the proper spelling
again
some sorry my bad
inversions is
[Music]
inversions now let me run
it okay again some
okay
versions okay let me check here while
renaming inversions
only okay
fine in
versions let me paste nothing changes
let me check
again okay some error is there
wait so yeah you can see it's running
fine so after this what I will
do so what is the pair plot so pair plot
function allows the user to create you
know then an AIS grid why which each
numerical variable is stored in the data
is shared across the X and the Y okay in
the structured
column so this is how see you know type
in v other and steel this red one is
wood other are the blue one and the
purple are the steel one okay the
different different format okay now
let's create the last graph which is
heat map okay so let me write
DF for relation to
DF
here introduced
comma
speed
R
comma
height into
foot again
it
comma comma
gForce then
drop P then
coration okay
dfed I
cap cap
yeah so this is correlation values of
all the things right so now let's write
SNS
do heat
map heat map then TF let
go comma and not will be
true
okay now let me run yeah so to create
heat map in Python so you can use this
okay see Bor library for this heat map
so this function takes a data frame you
know as an input and generates a heat
map type of things as the output okay so
this is how you can perform Eda using
any data set or you can show your data
or Insight with a beautiful
representation using graphs and all like
this fine so with this we have come to
