hey everyone welcome to simply runs
youtube channel and today we will learn
how to add rows in excel but before we
begin let me tell you guys that we have
daily updates on multiple technologies
so if you're a tech geek in a continuous
hunt for latest technological friends
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add rows in excel
for that let's get back to the practical
mode now we are on the excel spreadsheet
now here we have some sales data based
on a store now what we are going to do
is we are going to add some multiple
rows or a single row in this particular
data so here you can see the region wise
category wise statewide subcategory wise
and there are sales and quantities right
now let us imagine that you must start
to add a sale data here right so let us
imagine that on the row seventh you are
supposed to add some detail for example
some technology related sale happened on
that day and you missed out to add it
right so how do you create a new row now
so for example if multiple sales
happened on the same day like three to
four and you missed out them so how do i
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row
and right click and press on the option
insert now this will insert one single
row if you wanted to add one single
uh row or a tuple and if you wanted to
add multiple rows for example you wanted
to add three rows altogether then it's
also simple
all you have to do is select three rows
and
right click and press on insert and then
you have three rows so there you go so
that's how you add multiple rows in a
excel spreadsheet or that's how you add
one single row in an excel spreadsheet
so with that we have come to an end of

excel if you have any queries regarding
