in front of you
okay to discuss a very important topic
called as hypodermicia
okay so most of us are familiar and
by seeing the clinical cases or the
clinical findings
in front of you you can see there are
some missing teeth over
in this particular area okay so this
missing teeth
okay you can conclude these cases of
this condition as
a hypotension okay
as a high potential so first of all what
are the other terms that you can give
for hypodermicia is
true partial anodizia and one is
oligodensity okay i hope you you you
know the
differences of each and everything okay
the next
most commonly asked question is the most
common missing teeth
most common missing teeth is your third
molars
and if you go into your chakras and just
read a line
okay the line clearly says that the
studies on
the frequency of missing teeth were done
and it was showing that
third molars are most commonly missing
teeth in many of the cases
and there are few other studies telling
that the other missing teeth can be your
maxillary laterals
mandibler premolars and the maxillary
premolars
okay so now the question raises if they
ask a question
basing upon the sequence what is the
sequence of
missing t the sequence of missing teeth
is as following
third molars okay followed by third
molars the next teeth
that misses most commonly is the
mandibular
premolar followed by mandibular premolar
then is the maxillary lateral incisor
followed by the maxillary premolar i
hope you are very clear with this
sequence this sequence is most commonly
asked
okay third molar followed by mandibular
premolar followed by maxillary lateral
followed by the
maxillary premolar this is the order of
sequence that you have to make a note
okay until now we are discussing
primarily about the permanent date
now the question is on the decision that
is the primary tip
the most commonly missing primary teeth
the answer is
maxillary lateral okay so don't get
confused see in the question
and they're asking missing teeth see
whether they're asking a permanent
missing teeth or a primary missing tip
if
they are not specifying whether it's a
primary or a permanent then it is they
are asking the permanent missing tip
okay so this is a very very important
that you have to
make a note okay
and the next important thing in front of
you is
name the syndromes or the disorders or
the conditions
in which you can find high potential
means less number
less than the normal teeth less than the
normal number of teeth
okay please do drop this in your comment
box okay
please do drop this in your comment box
i'll be posting the answer in your
comment box okay the question is
name the syndromes or the disorders or
the conditions
with less than the normal number of
teeth
you call me a saint bird you know i'm a
stranger
