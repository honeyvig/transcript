ethical hacking has become a lucrative
industry for cyber security
professionals and enthusiasts
with the major tasks of an ethical
hacker running on command line tools
learning a scripting language like
python is highly essential
python has grown in popularity thanks to
various applications in multiple sectors
while being a relatively easy to learn
language
discovering the benefits of pythons and
ethical hacking helps beginners write
their own customized scripts at the time
of penetration testing
hey everyone welcome to this video on
ethical hacking using python
let's take a look at the topics we are
covering today
we start by learning about ethical
hacking and how useful they are for
organizations looking to secure the
systems against malicious hackers
we cover the basics of the python
programming language as well
next we take a look at the distinct
advantages of python over other
programming languages when it comes to
user friendliness
finally we write two programs from
scratch which help ethical hackers in
cracking passwords
let's start by learning about ethical
hacking in general
when we talk about penetration testing
or ethical hacking we mean hacking that
is based on ethical or moral principles
and has no harmful intent ethical
hacking is defined as any type of
hacking that has been allowed by the
owner of the target system
it might also refer to the practice of
putting in place active security
measures to safeguard system from
malicious hackers
it is the process of subverting or
cracking a system security in order to
find vulnerabilities data breaches and
potential threats
it is only regarded as ethical if
regional or organizational cyber laws
are followed
this is known as penetration testing in
the technical world
the strategy as the name indicates
comprises seeking to enter the system
and documenting the purposes necessary
the purpose of ethical hacking is to
improve the security of the network or
systems by fixing the vulnerabilities
found during testing
ethical hackers may use the same methods
and tools used by the malicious hackers
but with the permission of the
authorized person for the purpose of
improving the security and defending the
systems from attacks by malicious users
ethical hackers are expected to report
all the vulnerabilities and weaknesses
found during the process to the
management
ethical hacking has proven itself to be
quite a productive career option for
many ambitious individuals the demand
for its courses today is at an all-time
high and rightfully so
it provides you with an engaging job
that never gets tedious
some certifications like the comptia
plus ceh and cisco ccna are highly
acclaimed and will teach a learner all
there is to know before dipping their
toes in the industry
to summarize an ethical hacker acquires
access to a target system before any
criminal hacker
this allows the organization security
personnel to deliver a security patch to
the system thereby closing a gap for an
attacker to enter the system or perform
a hack
now that we understand the basis of
ethical hackers let's go over how python
came into existence and its features
python is a computer programming
language often used to build websites
and software
it can also be used to automate tasks
and conduct data analysis
python is a general purpose language
meaning it can be used to create a
variety of different programs and isn't
specialized for any specific problem
this versatility along with its beginner
friendliness has made it one of the most
used programming languages today
a survey conducted by industry analyst
firm brad monk found that it was the
most popular programming languages among
developers in 2020.
python is commonly used for developing
websites and software task automation
data analysis and data visualization
since it's relatively easy to learn
python has been adopted by many
non-programmers such as accountants and
scientists for a variety of everyday
tasks like organizing finances
it has become a staple in data science
allowing data analysts and other
professionals to use the language to
conduct complex statistical calculations
creating data visualizations build
machine learning algorithms manipulate
and analyze data and complete other data
related tasks
python however is mostly used to create
scripts rather than full scale programs
a python script the file containing the
commands is structured to be executed
like a program
these files are designed to contain
various functions and import various
modules
python interactive shell or the
respective command line is used to
execute the script to perform a specific
task a script is structured by defining
the set of function definitions and then
stating the main program used to call
the functions
a program consists of numerous tasks
these tasks can be executed with the
help of scripts
unlike libraries scripts can be used
without importing and are less code
intensive
python variable assignment is different
from some of the popular languages there
is no declaration of a variable just an
assignment statement when we declare a
variable in c or c plus plus or any
other alike languages this sets aside an
area of memory for holding values
allotted by the data type of the
variable the memory allocated will be
interpreted as the data type suggests
at compile time initial value will be
checked so we cannot mix the data types
in between but python is a dynamically
typed language it doesn't know about the
type of the variable until the code is
run so the declaration is of no use what
it does is it stores that value at some
memory location and then binds the
variable name to that memory container
this makes the contents of the container
accessible through that variable name so
the data type does not matter
it will get to know the type of the
value during runtime
python also offers multiple options for
developing gui or graphical user
interface out of all the gui methods
tkinter is the most commonly used method
it is a standard python interface to the
tkg ui toolkit shipped with python
python with deckinter is the fastest and
easiest way to create gui applications
python programming languages is widely
used by companies around the world to
build web apps analyze data automate
operations via devops and create
reliable scalable enterprise
applications
many companies do not even realize they
are using python across the
organizations for example if a company
is a java only company but they use ibm
fsphere as a web application server then
they have to use python to script the
server's configuration
python has a habit of getting in
everywhere regardless of whether the
usage is intentional
big names like microsoft netflix google
uber and dropbox regularly use python in
the software framework development
now that we understand python's basic
functionality let's cover some of its
advantages when compared to industry
counterparts
when it comes to third party modules the
python package index also known as pypi
contains several third-party modules
that allow python to communicate with
the majority of other languages and
system
it has functions that are separate to
the python code base and has many extra
capabilities that can be activated later
on
python also contains a vast standard
library that covers topics such as
string operations internet protocols web
services tools and osi interfaces
many join programming tasks have already
been coded into the standard library
considerably reducing the amount of code
that a new developer must write
python is open source due to a lack of
official technical support which has
driven the establishment of communities
that increase the resource bank for the
language's continuing growth and
acceptance its source code development
is partnered with multiple coders and
receives community feedback well
features are often shared with the
community to garner feedback before
pushing them onto the main branch
python includes built-in data structures
such as lists and dictionaries that may
be used to create quick runtime data
structures
furthermore python has added benefit of
dynamic high level data typing
decreasing the support code length
required
data structures are the set of data
elements that produced a well organized
way of storing and organizing the data
in the computer so that it can be useful
for example the data structures like
stack queue link list etc are mostly
used in the field of computer science
artificial intelligence and graphics etc
we have now covered all the features
python offers and the basic
functionalities
let's write some real-time python code
that can crack passwords using python's
libraries
in this demo we will write two blocks of
code both of which offer a unique way to
break passwords the first one is a brute
force attack the other is a dictionary
attack
the difference with brute force attack
is that in brute force a large number of
possible key permutations are checked
whereas in the dictionary attack only
the words with the most possibilities of
success are checked and are less time
consuming than brute force
so let's jump into the code editor now
the code editor we are using today is
pycharm
pycharm serves as an ide for running
python program specifically and can be
downloaded for free as a community
edition
now the first thing we're going to start
is by importing some libraries
the first one would be
the
random library
this one would be necessary to generate
the random choices from which the
password will be guessed
next we're going to import another
library
known as p y
auto gui
this is necessary to generate a
graphical user interface but the user
will be asked to enter the password to
be cracked
next we're going to create a variable
called as
cash
this will hold the number of characters
it will store all the characters which
can be used in our password
so we're going to start with
all the alphabets
and just to be safe we're going to add
all the digits as well from 0 to 9. now
this can be expanded further to include
special characters but we're going to
skip that for this
example next we're going to turn this
variable into a list this is necessary
so that we can traverse the list
accordingly
so we're going to create a new variable
all care
and
convert this into
a list
and there we go
regarding the user they are asked to
enter a password that needs to be
cracked
the password will be entered into a
graphical user interface and can be
stored in a variable
let's take it as pwd
we're going to use the py auto gui
function to generate the gui
the type of input will be a password
input so that the values entered are not
visible
we're going to write a message such as
enter a password
and that's it
let's keep the semicolon over here
the user will see this message on the
graphical user interface and can then
enter a password
now the passwords that are being guest
need to be stored somewhere so we're
going to create a sample
pwd password
and just enter
a null value to go with
now we're going to start generating
random values that need to be checked
for that we're going to use a while loop
and the condition that we're going to
run is
sample password which will be our guest
password
should not be equal to pwd which is the
original password now this loop will run
as long as the values are not same the
moment the sample password which is the
password guest and generated randomly
becomes equal to the original password
this loop will be closed and the program
will be over
so we're going to start generating by
assigning the value sample pwd is equal
to going to use the random dot choices
function
and the arguments we're going to pass as
all cap which is the list of all the
values that need to be checked or more
like all the characters that can be used
to generate random choices
and for the length we're going to assign
a value of k
which will be the length
of
the original password
the original password which is entered
we're going to check the length using
the len function and make sure that the
random choices function generates
passwords of that lens specifically
now we can skip this so that it checks
for all the possible variations and all
the different lengths but that will take
time so we're going to stick with
something small for this
example next we're going to print out a
message where we can see the number of
values that are being checked
we can put up a simple message
such as this
we're going to check the string value
of
sample pwd
and we're going to close the message
that's it
now this is the one that generates the
random choices we also have to check the
choices with the original password
so we're going to set up an if condition
over here
and we're going to write if sample pwd
is the same
as pwd or we have to use the list
version
of pwd since sample pwd in itself will
be a list
if it is true
we're going to print
the password
is
going to put up a space
and we're going to join
the new one
this will display the guest password
we can break over here so that we run
out of the if condition and the loop
now
let's run this code once
to run main
okay as you can see we have missed a
colon sign over here in the
while function
so we're going to run it now
as you can see we have the gui that is
asking the password for us
now we can give a small password so that
we can see if it's working or not
we're going to write
pc2 and since we have given the data
being input as dot password it's not
going to show what is being entered over
here
i have entered the password of a b c one
so press ok and you can see it's going
to check the combinations of four digit
passwords now this doesn't follow a
specific order
so this works on generating random
choices we can create programs that goes
a specific order as a single permutation
like we're going to start from zero zero
zero and move on to zero zero zero one
that's typically how normally brute
force password crackers work but this is
easier to examine and we can see how the
program is being worked on using this
now if we going to stop it for now
and give it another try
going to run main
i'm going to try something else
and you can see it keeps running up the
same program and this time i end
entered the password of abc2 and you can
see in one of those random choices it
did find out my password like i said we
can do this using a systematic method
where it goes from the first option to
the very last one but this is more
easier to explain and more easier to
visualize as a first program
now regarding our next program which is
going to be a dictionary attack a
dictionary attack uses
a word list a wordless will consider
will have a list of passwords that can
be used or a list of possible outcomes
we're going to start
by importing some libraries on its own
here we need to use only import hashlimp
because
the password that we are going to enter
will be a hashed version we are not
going to give the plain text password in
an input like we did in the previous
program so to work on those hash and the
functions that are necessary to work on
those hashes we are going to use this
library
we also want to set up a counter
of pass found
this is necessary to know if the
password has been found or not when we
do find the right password we can change
the value of this counter and the
program and the interpreter will know
that our program has been completed
the password that the user will enter
needs to be in a hash format so we're
going to keep it in a variable known as
let's say i hash
we're going to ask the user for the
input
enter the
hashed password
and there we go
next
we're going to use the word list over
here to use the word list we need to
open it how can we do that let's take up
a variable known as
p doc
we're going to ask the user for an input
going to move on to the next line using
the backslash n command
and write
enter
password
file name
including path
so what we are asking over here is we
are going to ask the user for a
particular path in this local system
where the file has been opened up
once the user gives the file name path
we can open it and store it in a file
let's say p file
and we're going to use the file option
functionalities
of python okay
functionalities of python
we're going to use the path stored in
pdoc
and open in read mode only
next we're going to set up our loop
which is going to check every single
password with the hashed password we're
going to use a for loop
we're going to carry out every word
in
the open file over here
next as we know we have received a
hashed value of the password we need to
convert it into standard terms before we
can start comparing
first what we have to do is we have to
encode the hashed password
into a common
variable known as the utf-8 standard now
there's a good chance that it is by
default in utf-8 encoding but
running this line helps us in being sure
that the next few lines work correctly
we're going to store another variable
known as hash
word
this is after the encoding
where we're going to use another hash
lib function which is the
md5 so that we can convert the value
found in enc word
and keep it in a hashed format now that
we have made it clear that we now the
hash can be read and run by the computer
we're going to get the final hash digest
of it now to strip the hash digest we're
going to store it in a value let's say
of name digest we use the value
generated above in hash word
and
write
hex digest
this will generate the hash digest of
the password and crea store it in this
digest variable
now
we have the digest so we can start
comparing it to the password file that
we have found we're going to write a
loop such as if digest is equal to
the input hash which is the hashed
password that the user input
then
we can just print
password
found
which we can then
show
using whatever value has been extracted
right now from the password file or the
word list
we're also going to change the variable
of the pass found counter
to 1
and we're going to break
now
let's say that we did not find a
password
we have to
inform the user that the password is not
found in the particular word list so
we're going to write another loop let's
say
if not
pass found
now think of it from a
systematic way the default value of pass
found is zero
let's say we do find a password in the
word list the value is getting changed
to one so at this point of time the
value of password should be one if the
password has been found
if not 1 which basically implies if 0
since 1 is considered as true and 0 is
considered as false
if it is 1 this part of the if condition
will not be executed this part will only
be executed if no password is found and
by default the value of pass found is 0
so if not 0 will turn into f1 which is
supposed to be true and the following
lens will be executed
so the next few lines we're going to
print that the password was not found
and we can start running the program
now to generate a hashed password we're
going to use an online tool known as the
md5hashgenerator.com
now let's say our user password is the
same as the one we used in the last
program which is abc2
we're going to generate the hash
we're going to copy the md5 ash over
here we press on copy
and we're going to paste control v and
press enter now this password file name
is asking for the location of the word
list
now i have stored the word list in my d
drive with the name of p1.txt
this file has a list of passwords which
also include the word abc2 in there
so we're going to press enter
as you can see it has found the password
abc2 after doing the hash
functionalities over here
now if we were to remove it
let's say we're going to use a wrong
password for example
we're going to create a new value such
as of abc 5
and take this new hash value
we're going to rerun this program
and we're going to use a new hash value
which is not present in the current word
list
as you can see we are now getting the
expected password not functionality
so this way the password has been
cracked open with two different types of
attacks using a brute force and a
dictionary attack since this type of
methodology works on a word list this is
known as a dictionary attack as it has a
source of passwords where it can check
the possible outcomes from
