ethereum is that part of the blockchain
network that can do any task you can ask
for like it can perform transactions it
can act as a platform to develop and
deploy adapt
smart contracts can be created on it and
many more
every action of the ethereum network has
its own way and method of functioning
that is one of them
which catches people's eyes every time
for one or the other reason
so in today's video we will focus on and
explore about the fairing dab
hey everyone i'm shanley and i welcome
you all to this new video simply learn
on ethereum dapps in this video we will
explore ethereum dac and we'll go
through some of the fascinating concepts
and components revolving around it
first we will understand what adapts for
decentralized application
then we will explore what are smart
contracts
then we will look into the features of
that
then we will figure out why use ethereum
network for building the app
then we will explore the difference
between web applications and
decentralized applications
after which we will understand the
benefits of dapp development
then we will have a look at the dab tool
then we will explore limitations of that
development
and at last we will explore top 5
ethereum dap projects
so without any further delay let's get
started with the video
so what are dacs or decentralized
applications
decentralized applications are
application built on open source
peer-to-peer network of ethereum
blockchain technology which uses smart
contracts and front-end users interface
to create platforms that are launched
and streamlined without intermediaries
and centralized authorities
in terms of user experience it appears
to be similar to other available web
applications but they have a lot of
differences
what are smart contracts
a smart contract is a form of code that
lives on the italian blockchain that
runs and functions exactly as programmed
quite similar to normal contracts
once these contracts are deployed on the
network you can't alter them which means
you can't change or modify them
that's a decentralized because they are
controlled only by the logic written in
the into the contract
and by not any individual or company
which also means you need to design your
contracts very sensibly and carefully
let's discuss some features of that
which makes them unique and popular
first is decentralized
this means dapps are independent and
cannot be controlled by any centralized
authority
second is turing complete
dapps can perform any task or action
provided by required resources
third is deterministic
irrespective of the environment that
performs the same function everywhere
and the last one is isolated
which means they're executed in the
ethereum virtual machine a virtual
environment so that if there's any kind
of bug in the smart contract it won't
hamper the normal functioning of the
ethereum network
that makes me wonder why ethereum above
all blockchain network is majorly used
for creating data
there are several reasons why ethereum
is dominating the majority of dab
development
first the ethereum is capable of
implementing a development interface
that can reduce programming time as well
as help in quickly launching the
projects
second the ethereum network consists of
a remarkably grown developer's community
since the platform's launch
third ethereum greetings tremendous
network effects from its global
coalition of technologies
which continue to pursue the network and
actively develop user resources to
encourage adoption
and at last but not the least the
ability to monetize dapp projects
adequately stipulates the participation
of others in the ethereum network
but what makes dapps different from
other web applications
let's have a look at the difference
between web apps and that
in web application architecture there is
a front-end client and a back-end server
the front-end is majorly written using
html css and javascript and the back end
is written in django node or rails
for that the architecture is the same
the front-end is written in same
language as of web applications but for
backend blockchain technology like
ethereum is used
in web apps and apps they both interact
with each other with json messages
similar
to other applications
web app store user information at the
company headquarters on a separate
server usually however that's consists
of a data created by the users therefore
the nodes are used to verify the
exchange when a user makes a transaction
on the tab
let's have a look at the benefits of
that
first is privacy
that maintains the privacy or anonymity
of the user which means you don't need
to provide your any kind of personal
information to deploy or interact with
the data
second is complete data integrity
data stored on the ethereum blockchain
is immutable due to cryptographic
primitives
no one can forge or manipulate
transactions or other data stored in the
blockchain network
third is verifiable behavior smart
contracts can be analyzed and are bound
to execute in the directed ways
without the need to trust any central
authority
fourth is zero downtime once the app is
deployed on the blockchain the network
as a whole will always be able to serve
its clients looking to interact with the
contract of the dap
let's dive down and have a look at the
dart tools
rumble ui it's an adaptable component
and design standards for decentralized
application
one click dab
it is a false tool for generating dark
content from an abi
and e to flow it is also a first tool
for ethereum developers to test their
node and compose and debug rtc calls
from the browser
so what now when we know everything
about that
let's understand the limitations of that
development
maintaining dabs can be a tough job
because code and data published on
blockchain network is very hard to
modify
to achieve the high levels of security
integrity transparency and reliability
that ethereum aspires to every node of
its network needs to run and store every
transaction which leads to huge
performance overhead
the entire ethereum network gets backed
up if a single dap is using too many
computational resources
sometimes it may be harder to engineer
and configure
user-friendly experiences
sometimes the average user might find it
too difficult to set up a tool stack
necessary to interact with the
blockchain in a truly secure manner
now let me take you through the five
best ethereum dapps projects
make a dao
an ethereum based protocol that creates
the die stable coin and allows for
collateral backed loans to be made
without the use of a middleman
uni swap a decentralized cryptocurrency
exchange protocol
chain link a blockchain oracle network
that is completely decentralized
axi infinity a blockchain based trading
and battling game that lets its players
gather brief raise battle and trade
token-based entities called axes
and thus avei an ethereum-based
decentralized money market that allows
users to lend and borrow a variety of
crypto assets this is all about ethereum
dac we have almost reached the end of
