's YouTube channel in this session we
will be learning how to add date and
Excel spreadsheet but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple Technologies so if
you're a tech geek in a continuous hunt
for latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never press an update
from Simply learn now without further
Ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add date in Excel
spreadsheet now there are multiple ways
to add date to Excel spreadsheet for
example equals to today this is a
shortcut method and you can enter
done you will have to list it but again
there is some problem with this kind of
approach so today's state is 4th of
September 2022. now if we open the same
spreadsheet after today that is tomorrow
or day after tomorrow then you will have
a concurrent date that is 5th of
September or 6th of September right the
date will always vary or get updated
according to time now you don't want to
change that or you don't want that to be
happening with employee state of joining
right it should be stagnant it should
not vary right so there is another
shortcut way apart from using the
daytime functions there is a keyboard
shortcut where you can add date to excel
that is control semicolon so this is the
shortcut way to add date to your Excel
spreadsheet and this particular date
will not change this will remain the
same constant date throughout the time
now there is a chance where you might
also have to add time to your
spreadsheet that is date of joining and
time of joining right so there is
another simple shortcut where you can
add time by just pressing three keys
that is holding Ctrl holding shift and
pressing semicolon then you'll have the
time
so this is how you can add date to your
Excel spreadsheet and add time to your
Excel spreadsheet and this date and time
will remain constant it will not vary
like the 3D function that we have used
here with this we have come to an end of
