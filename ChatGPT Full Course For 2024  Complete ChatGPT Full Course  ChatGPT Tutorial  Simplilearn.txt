pin comment meet John a talented
programmer who is looking to start a
company that used his personally
developed mobile application to connect
restaurants and customers for booking
and
reservations even though the app was
ready JN had difficulty getting together
a team for his startup needing separate
people for sales marketing programming
content creation and customer support
hiring reliable Manpower while being
strict with his budget was getting
difficult he reached out to his friend
Ryan who said Jon could start his
company without hiring any new people
thanks to just a single AI based tool JN
couldn't believe it which led Ryan to
introduce chat GPT the Revolutionary AI
chatbot being developed by open AI it is
a state-of-the-art natural language
processing or NLP model that uses a
neural network architecture to provide
responses this means that the chat GPT
bot can answer questions without being
explicitly told what the answer is using
its own intellect unlike previous AI
chat bots so how does chat GPT help JN
in filling out his team
regarding sales chat GPT can provide
full-fledged sales pitches based on the
correct prompts it can provide tips on
how to pitch your product businesses
removing the need for sales training
completely customized to your
requirements and your prompts if you
don't like some things about the
response you can ask for certain changes
and the chatbot will make sure they are
done when it comes to marketing chat GPT
can provide efficient marketing
strategies which can help new
entrepreneurs learn how to Market their
product to prospective clients it can
provide trending keywords that marketers
can use for SEO purposes while providing
ad copies for your website and block
speaking of websites since JN can do a
lot of the heavy lifting and programming
chat GPT can help proofread the code and
help out when looking for bugs to fix
apart from basic bug fixing he can also
provide sample code structures for
different programming languages allowing
JN to focus more on improving core
functionality and workflow rather than
fixing basic code
errors websites and blogs content is
very helpful in gathering potential
customer
leads the Revolutionary bot can provide
fulllength blog posts with near perfect
fast accuracy in seconds allowing
further customization like choosing the
length of the subject matter to the
complexity of language for John's
customer support the bot can draft
complete customer service emails based
on the situation saving time and
resources
the tone of the message can be changed
to reflect the nature of the message
creating an efficient alternative for
call center professionals Jean was left
speechless seeing this level of
Versatility from chat GPT and wanted to
implement it right away however Ryan
made sure John knew about some drawbacks
of the chatbot before getting started
since the bot is trained mostly on data
up to 2021 many of the newer events May
still need to be discovered by chat GPT
even basic stuff like asking about the
current date and time is beyond its
scope much like the limited
understanding of context despite
providing near lifelike solutions to
certain problems even the accuracy of
many responses can be questioned since
the AI model is still learning and being
developed there is a section of the
public that believes the Revolutionary
tool can one day replace Google search
but that day seems far-fetched so far
because of the variety of issues people
keep running into in using chat
GPT however chat GPT poses a lot of
promises for the future of AI from full-
skilled automated divisions and
organizations to serving as the perfect
digital assistant open AI is creating a
bot for the future aimed at solving the
problems of today with the tools of
Tomorrow the ability to carry out a
myriad of tasks with minimum Manpower
will boost productivity at organizations
in every sector thanks to the
Revolutionary chat
GPT so how do you think chat GPT will
benefit your daily life are you looking
forward to using the spot regularly for
work or personal life let us know your
thoughts in the comments below meet John
a software developer Jon develops a
program and now he realizes the program
is surrounded by a lot of
bugs Jon starts exploring a solution he
surfs through the internet checks
programmer communities doubting every
step of the way JN feels his problem is
not
solved desperate to find the solution
John meets his friend Adam Adam comes up
with an idea of an artificially
intelligent and practical solution
called the chat
GPT Adam says chat GPT has the caliber
to systematically resolve all the bugs
with an elaborate explanation for every
step it makes chat GPT is an AI trained
model that works in a conversational way
developed by open
AI fascinated by hearing this John asks
Adam to explain him in detail after Adam
explains that
GPT AKA generative pre-training
Transformer has come a long way before
the introduction of GPT natural language
processing used to deal with a specific
task with large amounts of data GPT was
first released in 2018 which contained
117 million parameters GPT gpt2 and
gpt3 each one is stronger than the one
before the main reason why GPT received
little attention was that it was more of
an idea or test than a finished product
but after the introduction of gpt2 it
gained a lot of attention as it could
accurately predict the word that would
begin a text then they introduced
gpt3 which is a strong language model
achieving translation question answering
and Performing three-digit
arithmetic but chat GPT Stands Tall
compared to all other achievements of
open AI so how does it work work chat
GPT uses deep learning techniques to
generate humanik text it is based on the
machine learning model derived from the
class called the large language model
chat GPT is a byproduct of instruct GPT
instruct GPT introduced a strategy for
integrating human feedback into the
training process to match model outputs
this Innovative technology made chat GPT
exceptional it is trained on the massive
data sets of text from the internet and
learns from the patterns and
relationships between words and phrases
it responds to a prompt by determining
the next word based on the context then
repeats the process until a stop
condition is met as a result chat GPT
can produce various logical responses to
various queries and prompts the most
important components of chat GPT are the
Transformer model and language model
coming to the Transformer model it is a
neural network architecture designed to
process sequential data it consists of
multiple layers of self attention and a
feed forward Network after the
Transformer model has processed the
input a decoder generates the output the
decoder uses the context provided by the
encoder to generate the response the
model is trained using unsupervised
learning and fine-tuned on specific
tasks using supervised learning for
successful completion of tasks it needs
pre-trained data the model first encodes
the input text then converts it to a
numerical representation which can be
processed by the model's neural network
this encoding is done using the embedded
layer that Maps the word then comes the
language model chat GPT is trained as a
language model trained to predict the
next word in a sequence given the
previous words the language model
intends to produce rational consistent
and meaningful output the pre-trained
chat GPT can be tuned for a specific
task
so chat GPT passes a fine-tuning test by
answering questions generating text
summaries or generating text in response
to a query overall chat GPT is a
powerful language model with a
combination of techniques like deep
learning machine learning neural
networks and natural language
processing can chat GPT change a wide
variety of business tasks John asked
chat GPT possesses the ability to
automate content creation on social
media create chatbot and e-commerce
sites provide medical assistance by
acting as a symptom checker write code
and assist to developer thus chat GPT
can change the working of every industry
now John can resolve any coding issue
without looking into any other resources
but like any other technology chat GPT
comes with a few limitations that can be
its A's heel chat GPT is capable of
developing content up to 2021 if finds
difficulty in providing logical
reasoning in certain situations and also
chat GPT lags in Translation
summarization and sometimes question
answering but above all chat GPT has
shown remarkable ability by providing
accurate answers flawlessly in a
creative way in very short periods of
time today we are diving into an

right so with this we have come to end
of this video if you have any question
or any doubt please ask in the comment
section below our team of experts will
help you as soon as possible today we
will dive into the latest AI
advancements comparing CH gp4 and the
newly launched Chad GPT 40 CH jpt 40
offers a 30% Improvement in factual
accuracy and Excel and creative task
we'll reveal the top upgrades and how
they can transform your AI experience
get ready for an in-depth look at these
powerful tools and find out which one is
the game changer you have been waiting
for so let's explore the future of AI
together so first we'll start with the
official documentation and those who
want to jump straight to the comparison
of chj 40 and 4 can directly jump to it
with the time stamp mentioned in the
description box so let's start with
documentation so guys here we have
search about the chat GPT photo
documentation and this is the official
page of open
Ai and here you can find out that they
have put on advancements and the model
capabilities that CH gp4 processes you
could see here they have posted the
videos that two gbd foros are
interacting and singing you can play and
watch these videos so how they have
advanced this J gbt 40 compared to chat
j4 and you could see the vision
capabilities of chat
j4 as they are asking for the interview
preparation with their Vision
capabilities so similarly you can check
out all the other videos that they have
posted and moving downwards we can see
that they have posted explorations of
capabilities you could select the sample
that could be visual narratives or
poster creation for the movie or corre
design so you could check out how CH G4
and 40 are
different and as we move down here they
have mentioned the model evaluations
between chat gb4 and CH gb4 turbo here
we have the text evaluation audio ASR
Performance Audio translation
performance and they have posted the bar
graphs and the charts with all the other
a tools compared and then we have the
language tokenization and what
improvements they have made in that that
they have used Gujarati language telu
Tamil marati Hindi and they have
achieved the fewer tokens in these
models Now we move downwards we can see
that the model safety and limitations
they have added some more safety
features and the model availability that
is chity 40 is available for both the
free version and the paid version so
this was all about the official
mentation of chat jpt 40 so let's get
started with the compassion analysis of
chat jpt 40 and 4 so guys I have opened
chat GPT 4 here and in the other window
we'll open chat GPT 4 and we'll provide
the same proms to both CH gp4 and 40 and
we'll see what responses they provide to
us and in what time frame we'll compare
the time frame also and how they
conceptualize or provide the fractional
prompts to
responses so starting with number one so
the number one category we will be
choosing is factual inquiries so we will
ask both of them and we'll ask
them that tell me something interesting
about
maryury and provide to chat4 also
so let's press enter and see which one
of those will provide
us a good
response uh so you could see that chat
GT4 has provided us the response in a
paragraph and if we read this so the
tone
is okay like it is telling to a third
person and if we move to CH 4 you could
see here that it has categorized the
points here that these are the main
points that you could use as an
interesting points about
merury so I would say ch40 has an edge
here and I won't think like there was a
time difference and I can say that we
can't have any difference in the time
taken by both the models so now we'll
move to next category that is complex
scientific and Technical problems so
here will ask both the models about how
how quantum computers work and compare
their advantages to classical
computers so let's ask
them that
explain how quantum
computers and compare their
advantages to classical computers
we'll copy the same prompt and paste it
to chat GT4 also so let's press enter
and till then I will tell you guys that
from here you can use the different
model also that you have used GPD 40
here it's showing you after generating
the response I will show you guys how
you can switch to the models
also here you can copy it and here you
can read it loud and and in the settings
also you can check out what voices you
need as an assistant here so moving back
we can see that CH gbt 4 is still
responding and generating the response
while CHT 4 has already done it we can
surely say that that CHT 40 has an edge
with the time frame thing as it
generated the response much faster than
CH
GT4 and if we compare what the responses
they have provided and and chat jpd for
has mentioned how quantum computers work
advantages of quantum computers
comparison with classical computers and
after that challenges that quantum
computers are facing and if we see what
chat GT4 has provided you could see that
how quantum computers work and after
that the advantages of quantum computers
and the comparison with classical
computers so you could see that with the
less time frame sh GT 4 has provided
more subtopics and and the more points
that he has covered whereas chat GT4 has
provided the least information but he
has provided the okay information that
we are sufficiently acquired with the
prompt but definitely I will give an H
to CH4
here so here I was telling you about the
change model thing so you can click here
and check out chbt 4 and CH4 if you
click here CH gbt 4 it will generate the
response again with jpt 4 model as we
have select the J GPT 4 model here but
neglecting that he will generate with
the chat gbt 4
model so here after generating the
response if you click
on 1/2 so these arrows you can find out
this response has been generated by GPT
4 model and this response has been
generated by GPT 4 model and you can
have this comparison in the same window
also but I'm using different windows so
we'll compare it in one another
only so now moving to the next section
that is creative writing so now we'll
ask both these models to write a short
poem about a moonlit night in a forest
so let's ask them that write a short
poem about a Moon
lit night and a
forest so let's copy the same prompt and
paste it in
gbd4 and let's wait for the response as
you guys can see that GPT 4 has already
generated the response and here gp4 has
also
generated and before comparing both
these responses I want you guys to
notice something that this new version
of open AI that is GPT they have moved
the profile section from bottom left to
top right and there are many more
advancements if you see here this is the
history section and the memory
feature and you could find many other
features that could be manage memory in
the profile sections
only so if you go into personalize
category here we have the memory
section so moving back to the prompt
response
so here we have the gp4
model and if we read this poem in the
forest de where Shadows play the moon
cast light in a silver aray Whispers of
leaves in a gentle breeze dance with the
night in serin silent E and if we
compare this so gp4 has provided a
really a short poem whereas GPD 4 has
provided us the four Paras and if if I
tell you about the tone so GPT 40 has an
edge here as it has provided a really
crafted good poem then
gp4 so now we'll compare these models on
the basis of text analysis skills or
before that we will compare them on
complex mathematical and logical queries
so we'll ask them to solve a quadratic
equation and we'll provide them the
equation solve the equation
that would
be
3x² -
12x + 9 =
0 and explain each
step so let's see which model does IT
job better
so you could see the writing speed also
like how this cursor is moving I would
definitely say that CH GPT 40 has a good
speed
here and it has generated the response
and gp4 has also generated the
response so I would say that GPT 4 has
taken six steps to solve this and
provided a detailed information how you
can solve the quad equation and whereas
GPD 4 has shown us the three steps and
he has integrated other steps in step
one only that is factorize the quadratic
equation so if you are a beginner you
could definitely switch to J gbt 40 to
understand these quadratic equations or
mathematical
equations so giving another point to
chity for here now we'll move to another
category that is data analysis questions
so now we'll provide a data set to both
of
them uh so this will be the data samples
sales
data so here we will ask both the models
to
create a bar
chart between sales and region
you would see that both the models are
analyzing and here we are CH4 has
provided us the response and the main
thing that I want to showcase here is
that j40 has now interactive images or
bar graphs or the visual representations
here if you click to static chart they
have an option here so now this bar
chart is not
static and you could just have the plain
2D design and if we click on this again
you could see that you could find the
actual figure what has been showcased in
the bar graph and similarly here you
could change the data set color that is
you can change the color of the bar
graphs or the bars in the
graph and moreover you have the download
section here also and the expand section
if you expand it you could see that here
you can generate the response and chat
with gp4 model and have the output
here so we
will get back to the window and here you
can see that CH gb4 has provided us the
basic response as it was doing
previously also so here's the bar chart
and no interactive design and no
download
option moreover no other expanding
options
also so let's move to the next category
and that would be our last
category so now we'll ask both the
models about solving philosophical and
ethical problems so now we'll ask them
do animals have moral rights so justify
your
answer we'll copy paste the same prompt
to gp4
model and ask both of them to generate
the
response so you could see that both has
generated the responses and if we
compare them so chat GPT 4 has provided
the number one point that is argument
for moral rights of animals and then the
second point that is argument against
moral rights of animals and if we move
to GPT 40 section he has also provided
the main topics but he has provided the
subtopics and highlighted what are the
main key points for both that is moral
rights and against moral rights so I
would definitely say that j4 has
improved factual accuracy and response
discipline like he has a framework to
provide the response whereas char4 just
provide the response in a basic
Manner and one more category we'll see
here that is we will ask him to create
an
image
of two
robots
fighting or facing each
other or in a face
off so let's copy the same PR to gbt for
model
also so here's the response you can see
that CH jpd 4 has
generated an image with two robots in a
dramatic face off in a futuristic Arena
and whereas that gp4 has also generated
two futuristic robots in a dramatic
phase off and I would definitely say
that g pt4 has done a good job
here his image is much better than jpt
40 so if I tell you about the conclusion
so choosing between chat gbt 4 and chat
gbt 4 depends largely on your specific
needs if your work requires detailed
analysis and you often engage in complex
discussions then Chad gy Forum might be
the better choice with its deep
understanding and retention capabilities
however if you need quick turnaround
times and are managing multiple task or
collaboration
speed and efficiency will likely serve
you better so both tools have their
merits and can significantly enhance
your content creation process and other
data analysis processes so as these
Technologies evolve staying informed
about updates will help you continue
making the best use of jna in your work
so we'll start with the first tip that
is change your dashboard appearance so
for that we'll move to CH jbd and you
could change the desktop appearance or
Dash Cod appearence of chat jity you can
customize your dashboard by going to
settings and choosing a new theme or
layout so for settings you will go here
and in general you can just select the
theme that is light you can change it to
dark system theme or light theme so
these are the options you can use to
change your dashboard appearance so this
can help you create a more comfortable
and personalized working environment for
example you can change the color scheme
and you can also change the font size
also and you can generally change the
font size by just zooming in the window
and the second tip we have is switch on
beta features so we move back to chat
jpt and here you can see the beta
features so for that we'll go in
settings and beta that is custom
instructions try a new feature that lets
you share anything you would like
charity to consider across it respons
Serv so we have we have sech St these
beta features the plugins try a version
of chat jpd that knows when and how to
use third party plugins that you enable
the code interpretor that is a version
of chity that knows how to write and
execute python code and can work with
file uploads try asking for help with
data analysis image conversions on
editing a code file and these files not
persist Beyond a single session so these
are the plugins or the beta features
that we have turned on and we are using
them and in chat gb4 gb4 you could see
that is code interpreter beta and the
plugins beta they both are available for
us so this was the second tip that is
switch on the beta features and you can
use them that is you can toggle on beta
features to try out new and experimental
features if you like trying out new
features you can switch on beta features
there are experimental features that are
still being tested keep in mind that
they might not always work perfectly and
the next is change the tone of your
writing that is you can ask J JP can you
rewrite any sentence in a more formal
way so now we will ask a prompt to chat
jpt that is can you rewrite this in a
more formal tone and what we can ask is
that could be hey how are you okay so
we'll ask this so you could see that the
chity has changed the tone of the
sentence over for the imperative you
were asking that is hey how are you now
greetings how do you find yourself today
so this is a more formal tone and you
can ask CH je for more such responses
that is give me more such
responses so you can change the tone of
the sentence that is you could give any
sentence or any imperative or any
language to chat jpt and you can ask for
any tone that could be emotional that
could be funny tone or that could be
sarcastic tone so Chad jpd would reply
with the particular tone so this was our
third tip and now moving on we'll see
the fourth tip that is use chat jbt for
quick learning so you can ask can you
explain the basics of anything that
could be the simple biologic Concepts
the solar system and you can use chat
jpt for quick learning that is for
instance you could ask any prompt that
is here we will ask CH jpd
that teach me how to write hello world
in
Python so you can see that judge
responded that is showed writing a hello
world program in Python is quite
straightforward due to python Simplicity
and here's how you can do it that is
print hello world and in this code it
has given you some some sentences so you
can just read them and understand how
the code works that is print is a
built-in python function that outputs
specified information to the screen then
the text that is hello world that is an
inverted commas is a string which is a
type of data representing text then the
parenthesis that are used to enclose the
arguments of the function so when you
run this program it will give the output
of the text that is hello world to the
console so this was our fourth tip and
moving on now we have our fifth tip that
is view the plugin store so now chat jpd
has many plugins that is we will create
a new chat and in gb4 you could just
click on plugins So currently no plugins
are enabled and this is the plugin store
so the developers are developing plugins
so you could use them and be more
productive and add more features to the
chat GPD so you could see that is AI PDF
that is super fast interactive chats
with PDFs of any site complete with page
references for fact checking ask your
PDF chat with PDF xedia notable link
reader so these are the plugins that you
could use and this comes with the GPT 4
version that is the paid version so you
could enable any plug-in and you can
write any prompt and the chat jpt will
respond to it now moving on to the next
Next Step that is tip six use the web
browsing feature so with gp4 and with
the beta versions you get a feature to
search with Bing or to browse with Bing
that is not available for my account or
for my area so this is the new tip you
can use it if you have the paid version
and if you are accessible for the beta
version of browsing with Bing so this
was our next step and moving on you'll
see our seventh tip that is template
useful prompts so you can ask can you
create a 10 minute full body workout
using some kind of dumbbells or a barble
road and save this prompt for future use
you can also templae useful prompts for
instance you can also ask can you create
a menu or to-do list and save this
prompt for future use so we'll see a
quick example that would be create
a 10 minute full body workout and that
would be using so you could see that the
chat J has given us a templatized
routine so there's a quick high
intensity bubble workout that you can
complete in about 10 minutes that is
bubble deadlifts then bubble squats
bubble overhead press bubble Rose bubble
bench press so for that you also need to
have bench press also and the not is
remember the key to this workout is
intensity and form not necessarily the
bit used okay so this is how you can
templae useful
prompts and moving on the next step we
have is summarize text that is you can
paste a long article and ask chat JP to
convert it or summarize in few sentences
for example you can paste a long AR
article so I'll show you
how we can do that we will just search
for simply learn
articles so we'll use any article we'll
just copy it and give this to chat J
that is you paste
it and ask it can you
summarize this
article five
sentences so you know that this prompt
will just summarize the whole article
into five sentences and this is the
feature of chat jpt to summarize
anything and in a very concise manner
and this was our t e and moving on the
next step we have is analyze your
writing pattern that is can you you can
ask chity can you analyze my writing
style and generate a paragraph mimic
cing it that is you can give it any text
or chat that you have done you can just
copy that chat and give that as a prompt
to chat GPD and you can then write a
prompt that can you analyze my writing
style and generate a paragraph mimicing
It On Any topic so the chat will analyze
your writing pattern and will mimic your
style and you can also ask it to act as
a famous person like you can ask chity
to act like alen musk and give your
thoughts on
AI so here we will ask chj that is act
as Alan musk and give your thoughts on
AI so you could see that it has stated
that artificial intelligence holds
immense potential for human advancement
it's essentially digital super
intelligent and can go beyond a human
intelligence
but it is not saying that it can
perfectly act as alen musk or it can
directly speak to alen musk but can
provide a perspective based on his
public statements on the topic of
artificial intelligence so the CH JT has
analyzed all its statements that are
present that is gp4 has some browsing
features so it has analyzed all the
statements and on behalf of that it has
given us the result and now moving on to
the next step that is act as an examiner
so you can ask can you check this essay
for grammatical errors you can ask it to
check your project or even grade your
homework so as we have copy pasted the
article you can copy paste your if you
want to check your code or debug your
code you can just give it to chat jpt
and it will give you the suggestions or
it will point out some matters and can
give you a perfect code or you can just
ask him to get get some grammatical
errors in your article or essay so this
was the 10th tip that is act as an
examin and now the next is format your
outputs so you can give any data to chat
jpt and ask him to format this into
tables and you can ask him to add some
columns to the tables that would be
Monday Tuesday Wednesday and you can ask
him to prepare a to-do list or something
like that so you can format your outputs
J J will respond to that so for that
we'll just give it a prompt to chat jpt
that is format the days of week in a
table and days put days in column so
let's see uh so you could see that it
has given us and it has given all the
days in one column so you have to
correct your prompts and rewrite your
prompts and see what chat JP is
responding with those promts so you have
to be concise and be conscious and just
regenerative PRS so now moving on to our
next tip that is tip number 12 that is
generate too list you can say I need to
do grocery shopping finish a report and
call my friend today and can you create
a to-do list for me so chat jpd can
create Todo list just tell it what task
you need to complete and it will create
a to-do list for you you can just you
just have to give it a prompt and the
next tip we have is explain it to a
child so this is you can ask can you
explain how a rocket Works to a
5-year-old you can ask jity to explain
complex Concepts in simple terms just
say explain it to a child followed by
the concept so for example you can also
ask
that can you explain quantum physics to
a child so we will just try this prompt
that is explain quantum
physics to a child so this will give
you so you could see that the chat jpd
has given the answer that is absolutely
there's a very simple way to explain
quantum physics to a child and it has
given a Lego books example you can build
a castle a spaceship or whole city so
this is how you can use this
prompt that was the tip number 13 that
is explain it to a child then the next
step we have is share your chat thread
links so after having a productive
conversation with chat JT you can share
this conversation by clicking on the
share button and sending the generated
link to your colleagues this is a great
way to collaborate with others for
instance if you're working on a project
with a team you can share the link to a
chat thread so everyone can see the
conversation and contribute so I will
show you how you can do it that is this
is the share button share a chat and you
can just copy the link and send it to
anyone and you can collaborate with them
and now moving on to our next tip that
is tip number 15 that is export data to
mail if you want to export a chat you
can click on the export button and enter
your email address you will receive a
copy of the chat in your inbox this
useful feature is used if you want to
save a record of your conversation or if
you need to share the information with
someone who doesn't have access to chat
jity so I'll show you how you can do it
so simply you have to go here click on
settings and go to data controls and
here is your option that is export data
so just click on export confirm export
and the successfully exported data you
should receive an email shortly with
your data and now moving on we will see
another another tip that is organize
your chat history so you can organize
your chat history that is you can edit
it and you can name anything that is
tips for chat jpd so this is how you can
organize your chat history and now
moving on now we'll see the next tip
that is go
minimalist so what do you understand why
minimalist is you can just close this
side bar so this is the minimalist
options here you can just use the chat
GPT here so in settings you can choose a
minimalist theme which will remove any
unnecessary elements from your dashboard
leaving only with the essentials and if
you prefer cleaner Loop you can go
minimalist and this removes any
unnecessary elements and you can delete
all your history that is in settings you
can find the delete all history button
clicking this will erase all your
previous charts and for privacy reasons
you might want to delete your chat
history you can do this by going to your
settings and selecting delete all
history so this was our tip number 18
that is delete all your history so we'll
just go to settings data controls and
here we have chat history and training
that is turned on if you will turn off
it will just turn off and it will also
act as an incognito mode and here you
can clear all the chats this will delete
all the history
and the next tip we have is describe
images and the next is summarize YouTube
videos so this is available with beta
features of Bing that is you can just
write describe image and paste any image
link here so the chat jpt will describe
the image for you and if you want to
like know about any YouTube video so you
can just write describe you YouTube
video and then paste the link and it
will describe the YouTube video for you
and that is available with the beta
feature of browsing with Bing and if
that is available with you and currently
that is not available with me you can
like if you if the feature is available
with you that is the beta feature you
would able to see here that was the beta
feature and you can also go into
settings and beta and check check out if
the feature is available for you or not
Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on
creating a fully functional e-commerce
application using react Tailwind CSS and
Redux with the help of Chad GV in this
tutorial we are going to leverage the
powerful capabilities of Chad GPD to
assist us in building modern responsive
and fature e-commerce application you
will learn how to set up your
development environment we will start by
setting up the essential tools and
libraries required for our project
including react Tailwind CSS Redux and
react router we are also going to design
the application layout using Tailwind
CSS we will create a visually appealing
userfriendly layout that includes the
header navigation bar product listings
shopping cart and checkout Pages we are
also going to implement the State
Management with Redux we will use Redux
for managing Global State ensuring our
application is scalable and maintainable
you will learn how to set up slices for
handling user authentication product
data and the shopping card we will also
create reusable components and
throughout this tutorial we will build a
variety of reusable components such as
product cards form inputs buttons and
models to enhance the modularity and
reusability of our code for fetching and
managing data we are going to use react
query so that we are going to fetch data
from a backend API and manage the server
state efficiently we will also learn to
handle loading States caching and
synchronization with react query with
that said guys watch this video till the
end if you want to learn how to make an
e-commerce application using chat GPD so
guys this is a website which we are
going to create with the help of chat
GPD so you can see all over here we have
the navigation bar which includes home
about products card okay so suppose I
want to add this product okay this is a
lamp and say I want to add in this
quantity say three and if I click it up
you can see there's a notification which
is coming up and it's saying item has
been added to the card now we can also
go and check the card but before uh
proceeding for check out you need to
also login so suppose I have not created
any account so let us create an account
so say this is a mail ID and say let us
take some demo mail ID and here is some
password
and you can say email is already taken
so let us give some random mail
suppose name at theate 1 2 3 and say the
password is 1 2 3
4 okay now let's log in so it's saying
email must be a valid so I have also put
like we can say checkpoints where if the
proper validation of the input field is
also given so name add theate name 1 2 3
add theate
gmail.com now I hope so it is going to
work so email or username has already
being taken so let us change our
username so username name 1 2 3 and let
us try to
register so you can see all the input
validation has been done so let us give
some big
okay now you can see it has completely
logged in okay so you can save the
password
now let us go to
our repeat
so you can see I'm trying to log in all
over here and it's been logged in
okay so now you can see if you click on
our products you are going to see the
products part like there's a chair
there's a glass table king bed size and
all these are the cards of the product
so basically this images have been taken
from a link okay I will mention you the
link and you can do it and inside this
you can also search the given product
suppose say I want I want to grade lamp
or say chick chair
okay if I type this and uh if I try to
search it you can see this is coming up
you can also select the company suppose
if I just see all over here so the
company name is luxora okay so you can
type all over there in the check box
okay so where the search button is
coming up and you can say all these
companies are there and with the help of
that you can search it you can also do
the Sorting from A to Z Z to a high to
low okay so this is all we are going to
build using reactjs dwin CSS Redux and
also use some State Management and with
the help of Tailwind CSS we are going to
create a fully responsive website now
let's get started so guys let us open
our chat GPT and write a prompt so guys
the first PR that I want to create is
that
say I am
creating a
tutorial or you can say I'm creating a
website
using
reactjs and it's
an
e-commerce
website so we'll with the help
of or by us using V okay Tailwind
CSS and
Redux
now the next thing what I have to tell
the GPT that can you help me outline the
agenda of this project like including
the main features and functionality okay
so this is the first thing and you can
see all over here so it says like
install and configure whe integrate
tailin CSS okay set up Redux then for
the uiu design it's saying responsive
layout okay then you have to do theme
and styling Define a consistent theme
okay now for authentication and user
management you have to do user
registration and login okay for product
management like product listing product
details and product search so we have
seen these functionalities that we have
implemented in our website and also you
can see is the shopping cart and
checkout option you have to add to the
card card management and checkout
process for the order management you can
also track the history and we are not
going to Target these two things okay
these are some of the additional
features but till here we are going to
complete it okay so not to complicate
too much just to give you a brief
outline how you can make a website using
CH GPT and Tailwind CSS and other tools
and
dependencies so like we have got the
brief idea regarding the main features
and functionalities so we have
responsive design user authentication
product catalog shopping cart checkout
process order management admin panel
wish list reviews and rating
notification and performance
optimization now let us write the next
part so here I'm going to type my next
prompt that will
be can you help me
explain the folder structure or can you
help me with the folder
structure of this
react e-commerce
app and
also let me
know the
purpose of each folder
so let us type this prompt and
uh we are getting some brief idea like
how our uh things would be there so it
says like you can see the folder
structure first we have to create a
folder called e-commerce app okay and
then so guys for this I will have an
assets folder okay then we are going to
create a components folder inside the
components there are going to be various
components okay so let us start with
that and let us first set up our
development
environment so guys I'm using vs code as
our text editor and in that let us see
that you have first all the dependencies
installed like node especially with the
help of node we are going to install the
package for creating the react app so
guys uh you can also type all over here
that uh how to set up my development
environment and if you type this command
you can see so there are certain
prerequisites it's going to tell like
node and npm code editor visual code so
like you have to create a certain thing
like this npm create V latest my
e-commerce app then template and then
you can go in this app so since I've
already created an e-commerce app so
what I'm going to do uh inside this I'm
going to create this and uh let us copy
this all over here so you can see assets
I have already created and uh let us go
to the terminal click on view and here's
a terminal and here let's type this
click on
yes so all the necessary dependencies is
going to install so you can see all over
here like what I have to choose it says
pre- react lit CES solids or other so
you you can just select all over here
that I want to use a react
version
okay just click on this and let us keep
the JavaScript part all over here and
you can see this has already been
created now the second would be go to
our e-commerce app so this is your
folder navigate to
this and next type npm install
and finally click on okay it's
installing the node modules we are going
to wait for some
time so guys as I have asked GPT all
over here give me the folder structure
for our components so you can see all
over here it has given card item card
item list card totals checkout forms
complex pagination container and it has
given error element feature products
then for filtering it has given for
filter. JX form check box form input
okay form range form select header hero
loading nav bar nav links order list
imagination container product container
then product grid is there product list
is there then section title and you can
also learn about the process or what do
you say the purpose for each component
okay all over here now like product grid
what it does so you can ask GPT the same
question with a prompt like what is the
purpose of this
uh given component so you can see it is
going to tell you all over here so guys
use it excessively wherever you fed out
and it has also given the code all over
here okay now before that since I've
told you we'll be using Tailwind CSS so
now let us type the command to set up
our Tailwind CSS so type
uh I want to set
up the Tailwind
CSS in
my uh
project uh help
uh uh give me
the again
type okay so if you type this so you it
is going to see that first you have to
install the Tailwind CSS and its
dependencies so guys for the same
purpose uh just copy this all over here
come to your folder so now click it all
over here that npm installed the post
CSS Auto prefixer so it is going to
start the downloading part of it okay
the next process is in the step two you
have to initialize the Tailwind CSS so
copy this and go all over here
and let us initialize our Tailwind CSS
pretty fine what is the next step guys
in the next process we have to configure
our Tailwind
CSS so you can see all over here there
is going to be a file called tailwind
config.js and you can configure
it all over
here so let us go in our file and you
can see Twi config.js would be there
so okay so now we have done this now let
us see what is the third thing in the
step four it is saying add the tailin
directive to your CSS file okay so
there's going to be a file okay first
first you have to create a CSS file for
your Tailwind Styles okay and in that
you have to add these directives okay so
guys this is our index. CSS file and we
can also add the directives all over way
here just click on everything and delete
it and just add the required directives
okay so I have added this part now let
us move to the next part so in your
app.css you have to import it okay so
whenever you are going to open our
app.js file so here we have app. j6 so
you can see we are importing this okay
all over here and in our main. j6 file
you can see our index. CSS is imported
so basically this file is already been
imported all over here okay which is
basically going to apply the Tailwind
CSS directives that we are going to use
while building our components now let us
build our components one by one okay so
you have seen all over here that uh our
folder structure was something like this
okay so we have card items card item
list card totals checkout forms complex
pagination container error element
featured products filter form checkbox
and form input form range header so let
me create all these folder for you so
we'll go all over
here now click on the new folder and say
components pretty fine now here we have
to create all the files so guys you can
see all over here I have created all the
components in the meantime so I have
card items card item list card totals
checkout forms complex pagination
container error element featured
products filters form checkbox form
input and many more so the same thing
which chart GPT has given me I have
created all these things okay these are
the basic things and uh while also
creating a website I would also
recommend you to understand like how
these components which are usable
throughout the proc process have been
used okay now let us ask chat GPD to
populate this okay now this thing has
been done now let us ask for Pages like
what pages I want to make in our website
so if I navigate to our website we can
see we have a homepage we have about
page we have a products page we have a
card checkout and orders so let us ask
GPD the
same I want to create
Pages for about
home
card check
out
error
okay
orders then we have the home
layout
login register
single product page
okay so like these things you have to
identify or the best thing you can do it
you can take the screenshot of this okay
so take uh like all everything you can
just take a picture okay snap it up and
send it to chat gbt it is also going to
recognize it and let me show you this
okay so say I'm going to snip it up so
say I want to say I want to create these
pages
[Music]
and you can just take an image and just
paste it up so you can see the image is
going to get pasted and you can type a
prompt something like this that I want
to create Pages like this which includes
home card checkout orders home layout
login register single product page and
you can also ask GPT to give a Tailwind
CSS for these things so GPT is going to
answer you for the same but as a
developer you can take this help but
don't rely over it too much you have to
also do little bit of modification by
yourself so this thing I have written
and let us click it so so first it is
telling you to install the react router
Dom okay so now you have to install this
so copy
this okay so you can see in your
package.json file so this will
package.json
all over here and you can see all over
here that we have dependencies all
installed which is react rout to
do so you can see all over here its
version is 6.
24.1 now the most important part like
while using this project so what
dependencies I have used all over here
so I'm going to give a brief idea
regarding this so guys for building this
project you are going to require these
dependencies like you need to have Redux
toolkit you need to have tank stank you
need to have react query depth tools
okay you need to have an xos you need to
have a DJs react react Dom react icons
we'll be using we going to use react
Redux for State Management react rout to
Dom react toasttify then there are
certain Dee dependencies as you can see
Tailwinds typography we have to use
because what kind of text we are going
to put it up on our web page so this is
going to handle it then we are going to
use types types reactdom then V plug-in
okay this we have it DZ UI okay es lent
then we have es lent plug-in react hooks
then we are going to use post CSS
Tailwind CSS and V so what you can do
next you can copy all these things okay
so since I've already copied now let us
go to our GPT and
say uh give me the
command to
install these
dependencies so you can see all over
here it has given me all these commands
and just going to go our uh text editor
so here's our
terminal and just type
this and you can see all over here it is
going to start the process of inst
installing all these packages similarly
you have to install all the da
dependencies now the best thing is that
uh what are the dependencies required I
will share you in the given video and
you can install it and also for the da
dependencies similarly you have to do it
just copy it and go all over here and
paste
it and you can see all the da
dependencies are going to be added in
your back is. Json file okay since we
have used it
now these were the given components and
these were some of the pages okay now
let us create the pages that we have
discussed before
and also guys uh you can see assets all
over here you have to transfer this all
over here okay now I'm going to do this
but before that let's create the pages
section so create a new folder called
Pages all over here
and inside the pages you can see all
over here that for pages we have told
all about here that they're going to be
home layout they are going to be error.
jsx they're going to be a checkout and
about. jsx okay all over here and in
similarly just create this now for each
of the given page you can check all over
here that it is giving an idea about it
that you can have to ensure something
like this and also you can ask GPT to
explain you what we are going to use it
okay so see here all the headers you're
going to add the links like about card
checkout or login register so which is
basically there on our navigation panel
and similarly for applying the CSS just
ask GPT to make it something like this
provide a proper spacing and also you
can take a screenshot of this and send
it to gbt so it is going to analyze it
and give you the required code for this
okay but the most important part is you
need to identify what folder structure
that you have to use it and don't worry
guys
I will share the required doc file in
the description where you can check what
are the components that we have made and
similarly you can take the help of GPT
and build this project so guys I have
created all the required pages and you
can see all over here that we have about
card checkout error for handling the
errors okay home layout index. jss
Landing login orders product management
error for handling the errors throughout
like 404 page then we have the landing
page we have the login orders products
register then we have the single
product. jsx so these are the required
pages that we need to build in order to
replicate the
website so if you have any problem like
what this given page does just ask the
GPT and it's going to give you the
required answer now this was building
our project structure for the second
part now let us move to the third part
now guys the next thing which I want to
do all over here is that I want to
create a utility folder which is kind of
reusable throughout the application and
it has these functionalities a custom
fetch okay which means a preconfigured
axio axio basically which is going to
have an axio instance for making
standardized API calls and also to the
backend server then we have the format
price functionality in which we are
going to use the utility function to
format the numerical prices that we are
using while buying the given product and
also in a USD currency format okay so
it's basically a dollar format
okay and then generate amount options
then also we are need to create a
utility function to generate the list of
quantity options for a selected drop
down okay so these were all the features
that I've shown you all over here so
when you go from this suppose say on
this given product and if you select
this say add to the back say I want
seven of them and when you go to your
given card so you can see all over here
the format pricing and all the utility
fun repeat repat and all the utility
functions used all over here are
given so you can see gbt has given so it
has given custom fetch format price
generate amount option. JS you can
create three of them but I will not
complicate this instead of this since
the application is pretty simple I will
put all of these things under one folder
so guys as you can see all over here I
have created a folder called utils
folder and with a name called index. jsx
and inside this I'm going to add all the
three functionalities which I have told
you now and this was the project
structure that we need to build in order
to make an application like that now
what you can do guys now you can see the
functionality of this all over here okay
now since you'll not get an access to
this website what you can also do you
can create a demo website like this or
you can take a picture of this and send
to GPT it is going to give you the
required idea like how you can proceed
to build the project so it is very very
helpful but at the end of the day you
need to know about react little bit so
that you can modify the application
based on the given instances so guys
inside our my e-commerce app you can see
our project structure is set up so
inside the SRC we have the assets so I
have pasted these images okay so if you
click on this so it is going to show you
these kind of images so I'll share you
the link for the assets you can use this
to create this website for the same you
have components and all the components
like card items card items totals
checkout forms form checkbox hero
loading navel Lings is all been
mentioned so this is for all the
components that we'll be needing to
build this website for the required
Pages we have about card checkout error
home layout Landing login orders product
registers and single product okay these
are the required pages and one we have
the utility folder all over here that we
have created called index .j6 for
handling these custom
functionalities now this was the basic
idea regarding the project structure now
what you can do guys since you have got
an idea like what components we'll be
using so ask GPT okay now build each of
the components by using this promp uh
say now help me uh I want
to make
the give me the code or you can ask
something like this uh give me the code
for card
component
and with
the
required Tailwind CSS configuration the
Tailwind CSS
Snippets or you can say with the
Tailwind CSS
code now if you type this all over here
so it is going to give you a demo idea
okay suppose you have this cart jsx and
cart item. jsx so you can see all over
here it has started using this CSS which
is basically a Tailwind CSS and I know
it on the first time you're not going to
get exactly the same you wanted so on it
what you can do guys that you can take a
picture like what the output is coming
and send it to GPD and ask it to you
have to ask for each of the components
similarly ask for the pages okay so ask
like something like this so based on
the project structure based on the
pages so guys as you can see all over
here so guys it has started giving the
codes for the respective Pages as you
can see all over here and with the
respective Tailwind CSS you can
definitely modify it based on your
choices and also what you feel like is
more responsive and user friendly for
getting an in-depth idea regarding
Tailwind CSS you can navigate to its
official
document and it will be very very
helpful that you can also take a help
and ask GPT the same thing so after you
have populated these pages with the
respective codes and components okay
that we have shared all over here next
thing what you can do all over here that
just type all the way here that this
command or you can ask GPT
how
to
run my
application give me the command you can
type this and it is going to give you
the command but I know the command that
is npm runev or this is the given
command that is will be very helpful for
running your application so at each
stage suppose you are building one
component so keep running this and keep
seeing like what changes you are
applying on a real time so building an
application using react or any front end
application is a hit and trial So based
on the modifications that you require so
you have to consistently interact with
GPT and make an application out of it
but this was an overview of our given
thing so just type this all over here so
just type this and your application is
going to start on a given Port so this
is your Port 5174 so if you navigate all
over here so your application will be
open so let me show you like suppose the
port which I'm using all over here so it
is 51 73 okay so this will be your
application and in this way you can make
an application with the help of Chad gbt
so I've given you the basic idea and I
will also share the given documents for
the components pages so that you could
have a brief idea and you can ask the
GPT to give the required tent CSS for
the same I will also share the assets
you can use it or you can download the
assets from various other websites where
they have like free pick where you can
the images for the given products like
you can say lamp coffee table confe wed
which are easily available and you can
start designing all these
things so guys the best thing about GPT
40 that you can also share the image so
with the help of this you can definitely
build an application imagine you are
juggling multiple task at work meeting
deadlines keeping track of Team
responsibilities and remembering client
preferences now picture having a virtual
assistant that not only remembers
important dates but also nudges you
about them right when you need it this
is the magic of Chad gpd's memory
feature for example you are leading a
marketing campaign due on June 30th by
simply telling J gbt remember my
marketing campaign deadline is on June
38 it's go to your back now chj can
remind you about this deadline in future
chats help you plan steps to meet this
deadline or update it if things change
Chad gbt acts almost like a coworker
who's on top of the detail
allowing you to focus on the bigger
picture this feature transforms how you
manage task making sure you are always a
step ahead and before we commends guys
just a quick info for you if you're one
of the aspiring AI ml Enthusiast looking
for online training and graduating from
the best universities or a professional
who elicits to switch career in Ai and
ml by learning from the experts then try
giving a short to Simply learns
postgraduate program in a ml in
collaboration with per University and
IBM you can enroll in this course with
the link in the description box below
and pin comment so let's get started so
guys let's see so membran chat gity
allows the AI to keep track of
information shared in past conversations
and this capability enhances the way
chat GB interacts with users by using
previously mentioned details to provide
more tailored and relevant responses
think of it as a having a digital
assistant that remembers your
preferences and past discussions to make
each conversation smoother and more
personalized I will show you guys from
where you can turn this memory feature
on you just have to go to your username
click on that then go to settings and
then click on personalization here's the
memory feature you just have to turn it
on and you can go to manage to check it
has stored any memory regarding you or
not and you can clear the chat jip's
memory also so it's up to you whether
you want to keep the memory or you want
to delete it or what memory you want him
to keep or what memory you want it to
delete so this feature is handled by you
only and you could see that this memory
feature is accessible for the chat gyy 4
plus users and the Enterprise users and
they have a description here that chat
Gip will become more helpful as you chat
picking up on details and preferences is
tailor it responses to you and you can
click here learn more and get a hands on
where it will show as this is the
official website for open a and they
have memory and new controls for chat GB
and here you could see that this is the
manage memory section that I show show
you this is the manage memory section as
currently I don't have any memory store
in the chat GPT they have some memory
store that is has a 2-year-old daughter
named Lena daughter Lena loves jellyfish
so these are the kinds of memories that
has been stored and you could see they
have mention how memory works so as you
with chat gbt you can ask it to remember
something specific or let it pick up and
these details can be used in the further
chats I will provide you some examples
and I will show you some prompts that
how could you use this memory feature
and how this will help you in
prioritizing your task or if you are
dedicated to your fitness journey or you
are like working on any project so how
could this feature help you so let's
move and see you are in control so what
they're doing here is I think they will
be showing how you can use the memory
and delete the memory accordingly and
viewing and managing memory that's in
the manage section you can view and
there's a temporary chat section that if
you want to conversate without storing
the memory so I will show you guys where
this option is so when you click on chat
GT4 there's a temporary chat section if
you just turn it on like you could see
here that it won't store any history no
model training and the memory is off
here if you click on continue so you
would start conversation in the chat jpt
with the temporary chat section and he
won't store any memory regarding this
conversation so we will close this
template chat as we will be using using
the memory section here and you could
use the custom instructions also that
chat GPT and that would be more helpful
so the custom instructions they are here
you could just use customized CH jity
and you could provide some custom
instructions but they are generic so
what we want is we want the memory to be
stored and the chat G should use the
memory for further chats so you could
see that so they have also mentioned
evolving our privacy and safety
standards here and then they have shown
that team and and Enterprise customers
can work more efficiently as they have
got this feature so for Enterprise and
team users memory can be useful when
using chat G for work and chat JT can
remember your tone voice and format
preferences like how you want so you
could use chat J to remember your tone
voice and format preferences and he can
write in your own tone like how you
write how you use some keywords how you
English is like how fluent and what's
your tone Chad jyy can deduce it from
its memory and use that and provide the
same output as you want so this is about
the jjy memory thing so gpds will also
have memory they have mentioned it so I
will show you guys what are gpts so
here's the explore gbt section and there
are many that are provided by openi only
like these are featured ones these are
trending ones that is image generator
logo generator and you can create your
own GPT also that's here here's the
create section and these are by chat GPD
by openi team only data analyst D or
modes creative writing so they will also
have the feature of storing memory so
let's see an example like they have
provided it like the books GPD helps you
find your next read with memory enabled
it remembers your preferences such as
favorite Jes or top books and tailor
recommendations accordingly without
needing repeated inputs so it will make
your task easier as you don't have to
input all the prompts they will have
their memory they will just refind it
retune it get the memory get your joners
your preferences and they will suggest
so now moving on we will have some or we
will discuss some applications where you
could use it so let's start with the
applications so if you are managing some
project
or a project manager you could use the
chat JT memory feature like you can keep
track of ongoing projects deadlines and
responsibilities or if you are a student
and you are learning something so the
chat GPT can remember the users learning
goals that I want to learn some language
and dedicated to these weeks so provide
me a road map and the daily when you
will be learning with chat jpd he will
remind you that today is this day and
you should accomplish all these codes or
the task that are provided to learn that
language so similarly if you have
personalized recommendations for that
application also that could be recall
preferences in books movies or
restaurants to offer customized
recommendations and in your health and
fitness journey also you could ask him
to track fitness goals dietary
restrictions and exercise preferences to
provide tailored advice so let's see an
example promt for memory storage so
let's see the example for project
management let's start it so we will ask
him to
remember that my project
deadline for
the marketing campaign
and we can name it like any marketing
campaign rise
up marketing campaign named rise
up okay
uh is June
30th okay so you could see here that
he's updating the memory memory updated
so project tit and for the market
campaign named rise up is June 30th you
can go to settings personalization and
the manage memory you could see here
that it has stored this memory that
project deadline for the marketing
campaign named rise up is June 30th so
similarly he remembers the things and
will help you that this deadline is on
June 30th and how you would be
proceeding with your chats he will help
you to like me need the deadline so you
won't miss the deadline and he will
guide you with all the
outputs and if we see another prompt
that could be if you are interested in
learning something so you can ask him
that keep that in mind and if we discuss
something provide those output also that
you could ask him that I am interested
in learning about renewable energy that
I
am interested in learning
about renewable
energy so keep that in
mind for our
discussions you could see that he's
updating the memory when you will see or
write these prompts now that keep that
in mind or remember so he will store
that in your in the memory and he will
guide you accordingly so you have
written there that keep that in mind
like this a spell mistake but he has
updated the memory so these kind of
prompts allow chity to store relevant
details which it can recall in future
conversations make the interaction more
personalized and context aware so let's
focus on the application of project
management using chat jip's memory
feature so we'll write some of the
prompts and we'll see how he will guide
us for the project management so we'll
start here and ask him that
remember that
the next review
meeting for the rise up
project is
scheduled for May
20th at 300
p.m. so so we have provided this
information to him and he will store
this into the memory as you could see
that he's updating the memory memory
updated you could go back click on
settings personalization and check
whether it has done that or not and if
you want to clear that you could do that
and if you want a specific memory to be
cleared you could delete from here or
you could just ask him by writing the
prom that I mentioned you to keep the
track of review meeting for the rise up
project you can delete that memory I
that meeting is rescheduled or that
meeting is cancelled so he will delete
that memory so you could use that
feature also and and similarly you could
see that it has provided us the output
that CED your next review meeting for
the rise of project is scheduled for May
20th at 3 p.m. if there's anything you
would like to prepare a discussion
before then let's just let me know so
you could start the conversation here or
we will ask him some other prompts that
keep in mind that Sara is the lead
designer on the on this project and make
sure to include ude her in relevant
updates so we will provide this prompt
also to CH to store in memory that keep
in mind so these kind of prompts that
keep in mind this will allow chg to
store that into the memory that Sara is
the
lead designer uh on this project that is
we will mention the project only on the
rise up
project and make sure
to include
of in
relevant
updates okay and after this you could
ask him that you need some reports so
can you draft me reports you could just
provide him the xlsx file or Excel file
or word prompt you can write here is I
need to submit the budget report for the
sustainability initiative by the end of
next month for this project so keep that
in mind and the deadline for this budget
report will be like it's May 20th you
could prepare it before May 19th so he
will help you with that
so I will write the prom so you guys can
understand how it
will that I need to submit the budget
report for the
sustainability initiation ative and for
this project
only for this project and that
two at the deadline was May 20th so and
that to at May 15th so that's up to you
like what you want to tell him to
remember so ask him that we
should
discuss this in the upcoming
chats and you can also ask him that I
will provide you the Excel file and
after that we can start preparing the
report or just let me remember these
things so you could see that it has
provided that understood you need to
submit the budget report for the
sustainability Initiative for the rise
up project by May 15th so we can discuss
this in our upcoming chats to make sure
you are fully prepared if there's any
specifics you want to start with let me
know okay so so here we will start with
the budget report only so let's start
with budget
report and have a road map to complete
it till the
deadline so let's see what it will
respond so you could see that it has
started generating the response that you
have the deadline on May 15th so so
first is gather the data then structure
the report draft the content review and
revise finalize the report submission
preparation and submit the report so the
number one is gather data we have the
xlx file so you could provide it here
and as this is the hypothetical example
so really I don't have the file what I
telling you is if you have the file just
provide to him and he will start
structuring the report and what you want
to show in the report like if you want
to create the dashboard or you want to
create the graphs or you want to analyze
the data he will do that for you just
ask him that these are the functions and
these are the dashboards or these are
the graphs I need so he will start
drafting that so this is how the memory
is used and how you can store it and how
you can use it for any purpose so
similarly we can use another example
that could be we'll create a new chart
for that that I want some recipes or
healthy
recipes uh
as I have started working
out and
remember I
am
allergic to
peanuts okay so this is the point that
what recipes he will provide he should
keep in mind that I'm allergic to
peanuts so he won't include peanuts in
that so you could see that it has sped
the response and it has updated the
memory here so that's great to hear that
you're focusing on Fitness on hand and
the first recipe is Kona and black bean
salad and then we have chicken and
avocado wraps vegges Ste fry with tofu
so similarly you could keep your journey
accordingly that now he knows that you
are allergic to peanuts if you want any
recipe without being the specific to
healthy thing so he will keep that in
mind and won't include peanuts in your
recipes so this is how you could use the
memory feature and the team and
Enterprise customers can work more
efficiently with this chat JT feature
and you can learn your style and
preferences and build upon past
interactions chat JT will help you
provide all the outcomes and you also
knew that it has memory section for the
GPS also so I think we have covered all
the things for this new feature that is
chipy memory and if you want you could
go to settings
personalization if you want you can turn
off the memory if you don't want chj to
store the memory just click turn off
click on the section turn off and if you
want anything to delete it you can
delete it from here or you could just
type The Prompt that what I have told
you about the allergy to penuts just
delete that prompt or delete that memory
as now I am fit for the peanuts so
getting back and the thing that we have
the temporary chat section also that
won't store any memory so this is the
section that is temporary chat if you
have conversation here it won't be
storing any memory for you and you could
just go on and write all the prompts
here we'll start with a chat jbt to
automate our Excel and we have some
Excel files I will upload them in the
link with the GitHub so you can freely
download them and you can also try this
project with those files
and here we are with the chat jpt so now
we are on the chat JP website and here
you can see that there's a try chat jpt
option and when we click it we will be
redirecting to the chat jpt the chat box
and before that I will show you the
homepage it's showing us the samples
what we can do with the chat
GPT the
methods and there's the collect
demonstration data and train a
supervised policy like how it's trained
how open a has trained the chat jpt and
its
limitations they have mentioned all the
things here itative
deployment and moving on now we will log
in to our chat
jpd I will log in with my Google account
tell us about you and this is my name
and he's
asking my phone
number so I will get this blurred so you
guys won't be seeing my phone number
okay
is asking for the code I'm waiting for
the code after entering the OTP you
would be directed to this page that is
chat GPT and this is the feed box where
you can write any query in the simple
natural language that would be English
and the chat jbt would answer your
questions and if we talk about chat jity
uh little bit information about chity
that it's an AI powered chatboard that
has been developed by open Ai and the
chatboard understands natural language
and responds in a humanlike manner it is
based on GPT 3.5 which is a language
model and the chatboard was unveiled as
a prototype on November 30 2022 while
announcing the chatboard open AI wrote
on its announcement page that we have
trained a model called chat jpt which
interacts in a conversational way the
dialogue format makes it possible for
chat GPD to answer followup questions
admit its mistake challenge incorrect
premises and reject inappropriate
requests so now we will talk about the
chat J so Chad jity is an AI powered
chatboard that has been developed by the
artificial intelligence and it's been
researched by the company open Ai and
the chatboard understands natural
language and responds in a humanlike
manner it is based on GPT 3.5
which is a language model the chatboard
was unveiled as a prototype on November
30 2022 while announcing the chatboard
openi wrote on its announcement page
that we have trained a model called Chad
jpd which interacts in a conversational
way the dialogue format makes it
possible for chat gbt to answer followup
questions admit its mistake challenge
incorrect premises and reject
inappropriate
requests so this is
jity and it's been boing all the
developers around the globe so now we'll
start with automating Excel with the
help of chat jpt and with the help of
Python
language so
first we will create a folder and see
the Excel files with which we will use
Python and with the help of chat
jpt we will automate them
so first we'll create a folder for our
project and we'll create in Python
projects and name it
as automate Excel using chat
jpt and inside this we will open the
command
prompt and now we'll open any ID link so
that we'll write a request to chat GPD
and he'll answer us with the suitable
code and that code will copy paste into
our idle and run it if it gives any
error we will copy paste the error same
to the chat jpt and as I know he answers
them so here we will open our ideally
and for that we are writing a command
that is code space period and that will
open our ideally that is Visual Studio
world now we have open our ideally and
first we'll create a file
here or first we'll see our Excel files
on which we will do the
Automation and for that we'll get get
back to our
folder and here we have the number
folder in which we have two files that
is CSV files phone number and phone
number
two and other we have the sales folder
and in that we have the datea of the
sales of the Year
2022 so we will use these
files sales and the number so we'll cut
them
and get to a
folder and inside the number file no uh
we'll start with
sales first we'll do the automation with
the sales
files so we'll open the sales folder and
inside that we'll create a file that
would be the py
file and the first automation we would
be doing is concatenating all all the
files in a single Excel file we have the
files from January to December that is
the sales files so we will concatenate
them and ask the chat jpt to write the
code to con sorry to concatenate all
these so for
that we name the file as concate
only
netore data
py so now we'll give the command to the
chat
jpd so here is a chat jpd and here we
will write a command for it that would
be I have 12 Excel
files and I want to concatenate
them and we'll also mention the name
named
January spelling of January is this only
but we'll check with the file
January and then we have
February and moving
on so on we have till
December so we have all these 12 files
and now we'll command him to use
Python to concatenate the data inside
the 12 XEL files into one
file so this is our Command and it's in
the simp simp natural language that is
the English language so we'll just press
enter okay it shows us that an error
occur if
the so for this thing we'll just copy
the open a link and paste it here and
open it as the chat jpd is seeing a huge
traffic sometimes it
shows these
errors so he's us whether we are a robot
or
not so we will agree with the
chat and answer it questions
here asking again okay now we are clear
with the chity and we'll paste our
Command here and press enter
and here you can see that it has started
answering our question that you can use
the pandas library in Python to read in
the data from each of the Excel files
and use the concat function to combine
the data from all the Val into one data
frame is an example of how you
okay is going in a very right
Manner and he has imported pandas and
then create a data and using the for
Loop is going through all all the months
reading the Excel file and appending
okay
done and result he has concatenated but
he has not created the Excel file where
we can see all the data and he has also
not printed it so what we want so first
we'll
see what does this code do as I have
seen so it will concatenate but it has
not created the Excel file in which we
can see all the data so we have copied
the code we will paste it
here save it and run
it and most important thing you have to
import the pandas library and if you
have not installed it please install it
in the command prompt with the command
pip install pandas or you can use it in
the
terminal okay
it has not found the january.
XLS okay J and u a are
by sping we'll
see what error it
expects we'll save this and run one once
again so we'll just copy the error and
write it back to chat jpt and
see how does it
respond okay it's seeing is indicating
that the PBR is unable to find the Excel
file you are trying to read in based on
the error message look like the files
are not located in the same directory as
the python
script okay we'll see that but we have
the python script and the
library in the
same
folder
yeah concatenate
to and we'll check once again here let's
go data py
they are in the same folder and why we
have this
error okay
so so there it is we have open our
IDE
in automated Excel using chat jpd folder
and currently we are in sales
folder so it is not recognizing
the
directory so what we'll
do we'll copy all these
files copy the sales
files and paste it
here
now now we will run the port that chat
CH provided us
okay uh yeah it has R
successfully exed successfully okay
we'll try once again we kill the
terminal save it and run it
again now we'll see yeah it has executed
successfully uh but the thing is it has
not converted it
into a single Excel file for that we
will write
you forgot
to
create the
concatenated file as we also haven't
mentioned in our
Command
specifically so we have to be specific
with our commands
Also let's see
yeah after conting the data frame to
export to a Excel file we can just write
this
command and index equal to false here
okay and he is giving all the
explanations so you can just read them
correct I apologize for the site to
create a new Excel file that contains
account cre data you can use the 2core
XEL method of the data frame here is an
example of how you could do this okay
get a new Excel file named concore data.
xlsx in the same directory as your
python script and it will contain the
concatenated data form from all of the
original Excel file you could also use
the 2core CSV method to save the data
frame in CSV format yeah we can do that
also okay
we make the xlsx
file and just p
it
yeah C part
two
okay uh we don't need any part we'll
just do it here
only here result. 2XL
data do
slss so we'll save this and run
it it is sh that it has executed
successfully and yeah outside the sales
folder we'll close it you can see that
it has created the concatenated data
xlsx
so for that we move here yeah it has
created it
here we'll open
it and first I will show you what these
files
contain so every file have the entry of
around th000 every file has
th000
entries so the CATE file should have
around
12,000 so this is the concore data and
if we go
beneath yeah we can
see
2000 and it's yeah it say it has con
canulated all the data
so yeah chat GPT responded and we have
to precise with the commands what we are
writing in English as it has not
mentioned to convert it into Excel file
now when we have return it again it has
done that now moving on we will do the
second
Automation and for that we'll move back
to our ideally and the next automation
we would be doing would be that we will
be using the sum and the average
function to all the files that is from
January to December files and
we'll use sum and average function I
will show you where we will
use so it's
data so we'll open the August
file and here you can see the quantity
in the edge column
so we'll average down the quantity so
what is the average per
customer
and in the J column we have the total
cost so we'll add all the cost in all
the files this is the August file from
January to December we will do in column
match the average for the quantities and
column J we'll do the sum of the two
total amount per customer and we'll get
it printed at the last column that would
be we have the th000
entries it's going
till H 1 1 so we would get it printed on
h12 and the sum we would get it printed
on
j102 okay so moving on we'll close these
files
we will get back to a chat jpd and give
him a command that I have 12 Excel
files and we'll tell him that we have
named
them
January then we
have
February
then we have till December
and
now we want you to use
Python
to
apply the sum
formula the sum formula and the average
formula so the sum formula would be
applied from J2 to
j101 let see okay we have Clos file yeah
but I remember some formula
from J to 2 J 1 0 1 okay and the average
function and now we want him to use the
average
formula from H2 to h11
okay and that would be in all the Excel
files and we want him to write the
results in the cells and that would be
J12
and
h12
respectively so we have to be precise
with the commands and we have an error
here uh that is done and yeah it's all
done I'll just give this command to chat
jpt and see how it answers use the pen
as library in Python to re okay and
perform the sum and average calculations
good and then write the results back to
the same file here is an example of how
you could do this yeah we're writing in
the same file
okay we are importing friend PD and
running a loop for all the months we
have read all the Excel files one by one
and we are taking the
cell one and I location and doing the
sum and doing the mean of the Hedge
colum yeah it's
good
Excel yeah I think it would do our
job so we'll copy this and create a new
file and name it
as sum.
py and inside this we will paste the
code that our GPT has provided
us and we'll run this and it has
executed successfully okay no uh we got
an error
that
is okay it has made the
mistake yeah
it okay we'll just see what
query we WR I have 12 X Files named
gener every to the and use Python to
apply the Su formula from J2 to
j11 and the average formula from H2 to
h11 in all the files and write the
results
okay
done uh we will be a little
specific in the cell
j102 and
okay okay okay okay yeah we once again
submit it if we didn't
get okay yeah now he has used the
open yxl Library that's good yeah that
would be working for
us let's see
what he will provide to
us
here
she
and
okay
okay yeah
think uh it can serve the purpose but
first we'll run it so he is
giving us the explanation for what he
has written this code that is this code
will apply the sum formula to the range
j22 j11 and the average formula to the
range H2 to h101 in all the Excel files
the results will be written in
j102 and h102 respectively it is
important to note that this code will
overwrite the original file so that it's
recommended to make a backup okay we
don't need that and we have backup in
the sales folder also so you can also
the read theore XEL and 2core XEL
function from
P
okay so we'll try this
code uh is not return to import OS and
guys uh you have to install all these
libraries open pyxl I have already
installed them you can search on the
browser that open pyxl installation
python
and it would be directed to pypi tocom
that's the official website for the
particular libraries and there you can
see the command that would be the PIP
install and the particular command for
the module
name uh it is showing that it has run
successfully so we'll just see if it has
done its job or
not and in the AIL file we have in the
HED column that is the average of the
HED column that for the items and in the
J column we have the total sum of the
amount of the customers yeah the query
has run successfully J jpt has provided
us with the perfect code heads off to
the J jpt and moving on now we'll do
some other
automations and now
what we can
do uh we have other files that is phone
number and phone number
two and what it
contains it contains the phone
numbers so what we could do is we could
add the plus 91 extension that is the
country code for India we will ask chat
JP to add the country code plus 91 to
both the
files so I'll close these
files and
first we'll copy them and paste in
our root directory so we don't get any
error and
we'll change the
slide
name inste of
hyon we will add the underscore
okay now we'll move back to chat jpd and
write a
command and these files are CSV files
not xlsx
file yeah these are CSV files both the
files are CSU files other files are xlsx
files Okay so for that we'll write the
command to CH JT
that I have two
files uh with to CSV
extension and they are
named phone
underscore number and the second was
named phone underscore number uncore
two okay so we have told the J jpt that
we have two files and now we will tell
him to use
Python to add the con
code add
the
country code plus
91 as string
prefix and that would be adding as a
string prefix else it would only show 91
it won't show Plus so we'll see if Chad
jpd understand that or not as string
prefix in both the CSV files
with column name that was
phone okay now we'll just press
enter and wait for a chat jity to answer
this
quy and we'll see how it
responds you can use the Pand library to
well okay and theix to the phone numbers
and modify data
okay do this
[Music]
okay okay
the now we are
reading and
phone it's adding S Type string okay it
has understood that and to
CSV and this code will in both of f yeah
I think this will
work we have copied the code this code
will read in both CS files and the plus
time string to the phone numbers and
write the modifi data back to the S
files it's important to know that this
will override the original file so it's
recomended to make a backup of the
original
okay uh you would also use the apply
function to add the prefix to the phone
number in the column
okay okay yeah uh we can do this also
with the Lambda
function and that's this will also do a
job first we'll see
this and we will create a
file for this Automation and name it as
country code do py okay and we'll paste
the code
here and run it for you guys it's
showing that it has executed
successfully uh yeah it has executed
successfully so we'll
just go back to our
files and
see whether they go plus 91 as in prefix
or not here the
numbers okay the files code only 91 as
the column it's still in the number
format it
hasn't converted into string format uh
we'll see the second code
also
like yeah it has converted X into string
okay Lambda X we'll
see whe it's working or
not like it has worked uh and the issue
is we
have change the files permission red
okay we have opened a file we'll close
it on
save save this and run it
again now it shows it has executed
successfully we'll open the
files and now if we see
it is showing yeah uh now it has added 2
91s uh so no isues uh the thing is first
we have to transform it into the string
format and then we can add plus 91 as a
string to that
string so chat JP misses with the
slightest
implementation the
code now moving on uh we'll see this
command later if you want to see how we
can add plus 91 I will tell you how to
write that code okay so now moving on we
will do another Automation and you would
be glad to know that chat jpt improves
the existing code like uh in the first
automation it has con at but it hasn't
converted the concatenated file like it
hasn't created that file it had created
the file when we have returned to it
that you forgot to create that file so
chat jpd it modulates the existing code
also and moving
on
now uh in
any okay we open the concatenated _ data
XLS
and inside this okay we have the product
line so what we will do is we will
change
the name of the electronic assess to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to
Lifestyle now we'll automate this
process and we can do this automation
all the files also so from January to
December so we'll do that only
okay now
here we will command
is Okay now we'll command the chat jpt
that using
python I
trate
through all the Excel
files in
the directory so we are asking him to
iterate through all the Excel files in
the directory and we will ask him to
replace what was Electronics
electronic
accessories see the spelling
oric accessories
okay yeah electronic accesses with
electronic equipments
and we also ask
him
equipments okay we'll do equipment only
and home and lifestyle we choos
yeah
and home and
lifestyle
and change it with
only
lifestyle okay so using python we are
iterating through all the Excel files
and changing
these uh that would be in each Excel
file so we have to be specific with a
written language and now we'll save the
modified workbook
in we'll create another folder and in
that
we will save the
files
okay save
the
modified
file in
the
out put
folder and if the folder is not created
we'll ask him to create it
okay then create
one add it
in okay I don't know why I'm saving this
so I have written the command I will
press enter so that J jbd can process it
and give us the code for
that so it's showing us sorry that was
showing us uh you can use the OS Library
toate through all the Excel files and
directory the Pand library to read in
the files and make the changes and to
save the modified files okay here's an
example of how you could do
this now here we inverted OS Pand as PD
and it has return the code we'll copy
that this code will iterate through all
the Excel files in the current directory
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle in the data
frame and then save the modified files
in the output folder if the sorry if the
output folder doesn't exist the script
will create
it you would also use replace function
to replace values in the colum okay
they will add it through all the cells
in each of the Excel sheet and replace
electronic accessories with electronic
equipment and home and lifestyle with
lifestyle if the cell value is equal to
the respective string okay we have coped
a code and now we will create a
file
and name it as it trade. py
we paste the code here and run it for
you
guys the code has been executed
successfully now we'll
see open all the files not all but yeah
will open
some that was the previous electronic
access okay so it hasn't changed in this
okay we will open another
file and see if we code the changes in
that or
not that also States the electronic
accessories so it
hasn't done its
job so move back to
GPD and use this code if it functions l
we'll write back to the chat
jpd
okay just a second the we using the
replace
and okay so for here we have to import
the
OS
done load underscore
book and for
that about
this
it close this files
okay now we'll
see if we quote our solution or
not no it's showing electronic
accessories and and home and lifestyle
so Chad jpd
doesn't go the code to change
them so we'll ask him another time and
with a different language this
time Al I don't think it has created the
output
folder it has oh sorry
I'm really sorry what I have done is my
mistake those were the original
files and we have the product line here
and we have electronic accessories
here and that should be equipments
okay uh we have electronic accessories
and
lifestyle let me see my
command okay I have asked him to change
electronices with electronic equipment
and home lifestyle with lifestyle so it
has changed only
lifestyle let see
okay
okay uh the E here is small we'll update
that in the
code you can write this back to chat jpt
also
but yeah first do
this what are i
showing has executed successfully
okay in the output folder we have the
this
number
accessories that's is the capital okay
okay okay okay so this code is giving us
error we we will see the last code we'll
copy
that
and try to use this
close the terminal and run it
again it has executed successfully now
we'll see the
file whether it has changes or not it
has not now we'll ask the chat
jpd what have you done brother
using python iate through all the Excel
files in the Dory and replace electronic
accessories with electronic equipment
and home and lifestyle with lifestyle
okay in each Excel file save the
modified modif
[Music]
file okay then we ask the same thing
once again to
him and with this electronic accessory
pleas
sorry and save the modified
file output folder and get the folder it
doesn't exist okay
okay the same the movement
let see once
again turn CL these
files has executed successfully now
we'll open it
and now we can see that it has changed
to electronic
equipment electronic
equipment yeah now it has executed
successfully maybe there would be an
error with us while copying it as we
have also created the output folder but
we forgot to see in that folder maybe
that could be the error from our
side now we are done with the
changing of the column names uh the cell
names that was electronic accessories to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to Lifestyle now we'll do the
next
automation for that first we'll open any
Excel
file uh this was in the output
folder we get back to our main directory
and open the file July
and
here here we will filter the Excel file
for gender that is we'll select gender
as female and with the unique values in
column
City and we'll extract the data from
column A to q that would be the whole
data and for each Unique city value
we'll create a new Excel file for each
City
and that will contain data only for that
City and for females only and after that
we'll save this file in a folder named
City so we'll give this command to chat
jpd and here you can also specify the
module you want chat JP to use for the
particular command here we will be
commanding the chat jpt to use the
pendas module and for that we'll write
the command
note command in the natural language
we'll give this command to the chat
jbd and for that we'll write using
Python and
pandas filter
the okay we will just pick a single
Excel file or we can pick the
concatenated file that is concatenated _
data
filter
the
concatenated underscore
data dot Excel
SX Excel
file and that would be for gender
female and by
the unique values in column
City okay first we'll give the
command by the unique
values in the
column
City and after that we want to extract
the data from column A to q that is the
whole
sheet extract the
data from the column A2 q and for each
Unique city
value for each unique
City
value now we will extract the data and
now we'll create a new Excel file so for
that also we'll give the command to J
jpd and we'll write create a new Excel
file and that would be for each
City
okay so we'll write create a
new Excel file
for each
City
containing
data only
for
that
City and for
females
okay and save this file in the
City
folder and if it's not being there chat
jpt can create the folder for that
also okay City folder
and naming the each file with the city
name
Okay naming each
file uh after
the
corresonding
city
okay now if
the city folder that is we have written
the small City
okay if the city folder doesn't exist
then create
it before saving the
files
okay now we have given this command to
the chat jpt and it has responded us
with you can use the pandas labrary as
we have already mentioned to use that to
read in the conate undor data xlsx file
and filter the data for gender female
group the data by the unique values in
the city column and extract the data
from the specified columns for each
group and here is an
example so we have put the
code we wait till chat JP continues
and we can see that the chat GPD has
completed
and we will copy this
code open don't just see
female City make the Dory for City and
for City Group in female data Ro Group
by okay
City and you could also use the Asen
method to filter the data frame for
female gender okay first we'll see
this and
for that we will create filter. py
and run the
code it has been executed successfully
so now you'll see that the city folder
has been created or
not I'm not able to see the city
folder okay it's been
created so we'll see okay it's been
created
man it's still
empty so we'll give
time okay V quote an
error okay okay we'll pass this eror to
J J first and after that we'll see
what's wrong with this
on you so the error message you're
saying is ining that the column name
specified in the list are not present in
the data frame it's likely that the
actual column names in the data frame
are different than the ones you
specified in the
list okay just see the
list that is concatenated data
go
back and see that is
A2 okay it's still
R okay made a little mistake
here so we'll
just change change our
Command yeah this is it and instead of Q
now we'll write R and save and submit
now we'll see what it
would what it would generate for
us we close this
okay this will in Exel files filter the
data for females group the data by the
unique values in City column great and
extract the data from the column A to R
for each Unique city name and then
create a new Excel file for each City
containing data only for that City and
for females files will be sa in the city
folder naming each file after the
corresponding setting
okay it's done now we'll copy this
code and paste it here and
see whether this code works for us or
not
so it's been executed successfully now
we have moved to the okay it's executing
so we'll give time to the
code let it do it so yeah it's been
executed
successfully okay so there were three
cities that was manday Nao and
Yangon and if I show you the data
you could
see there see three cities and it has
created the Excel files with the name of
the Cities only the unique cities and it
has extracted the data for the gender
female now we'll see those
files close
this and
back in the city
folder could see the manday city and the
data is just for the
females so this automation works well
with J
jbt now moving on we will do one more
Automation and that would be to use
Python to identify what is the count of
each payment mode
so for
that I will just get you aware of the
payment modes in our sheet and will'll
do this automation on the concatenated
data sheet
only so this is the payment column and
you can see the mode of payments that is
ewallet cash credit card and these are
repeating so we will use Python to
identify what is the count of each
payment mode from column M column n
sorry
and that is from this sheet only and
then we'll create a new sheet and name
it as count. xlsx and write the count
against each payment method so we'll
give this command to our chat
gbt and ask him to write the code for
our
automation so we writing use Python to
identify
use Python to
identify what is the count
of
each payment
method
[Music]
from column and the column was n from
column n and that was in concatenated
con
cated
uncore data do xlsx
sheet
and create a new
sheet
named count do
xlsx
and write the
count against
each payment
method
okay now we have given this command to a
chat jpd and we'll see what it offers to
us you can use the Pand to okay that's
the same value counts function to get
the count of each method okay and you
can use the 2XL method to the data frame
to write the count to a new sheet okay
that's good and he has imported the
Panda's Library and create the DF
variable in which he has read the
concatenated file and used counts
function with the payment
method and colal to pay okay the column
name is
payment note payment method I think it
would
generate an error for
us so
spyon of each one method from column
n and we will
specify column M and that is
named payment as it has used payment
method here you can
see that it has used a column name as
payment method so we'll specify
this we have to be very specific with
our Command
for these automations for simple task
you can use Simple language like no
complex sentences or you have to mention
every detail but for these automations
you have to use
them now our chat GPD is working with
this and mostly he will deliver us with
the perfect code I hope so
okay
uh it has red and the value count and it
has
exported
reset thep by function top the data
method and use the
size meod
okay okay we'll see
this uh
and
here we will create a file as count.
py and in this file we'll paste the code
delivered us by the chat
JP we have executed it it's being
executed we'll wait for that
it's being executed
successfully so we have mve back to our
folder and we have to look
for file count file now yeah count
file is this the no it's the okay yeah
it's showing us the mode of payments
that is ewallet cash credit card and the
number of
usage yeah 4
483 12 yeah it's 12,000 that was the
whole entry of the
concore data. xlsx so we have done with
this Automation and now we'll do one
last
Automation and first we'll close all
these files
okay and moving back to our jat GPT and
now we will do we will rename all the 12
Xcel files that was January February to
December and we'll add the
word uh Car Sales just before the month
name that would we will just add the
prefix before for the month name and for
that we'll give the command to the chat
jpd in the natural language and here
only we will change it in the main
directory only as we have the copy of
all these files so for this we'll write
the Quant use
Python
rename all the 12 Excel files
named
January
February
until
December
okay and that is present in my
directory and what we have to do is we
have to
add uh the V will add Car Sales
okay car cells
in front
of
each in front
of each file
name
okay so what it will do is car sales and
underscore January Car Sales _ February
and so on so we'll wait for the chat jpd
you can use the w library to iterate
through all the Exel files in then use
the W to rename function okay to rename
the files here is an example of how you
could do this go to S and we have the
months okay
this code will iterate through all the
Excel files in the cont directory and
add carels in front of each file
name and those files would be those only
the months and good it's using the glow
module and you could also use the glow
module okay that's the second
code it's the easy one
okay but we'll go with OS
first and get back to our ideally and
name the file as rename
dopy and here we we will paste the
code and run
it it's been executed we'll move back
yeah you could see that car sales have
been added to all the
files and with that we have done with
our
automations and if you want you can also
submit your code to chat GPT and ask it
to add commands to your code so that it
could explain you what that line does or
what that function does it would explain
very tediously and if you want you can
also try chat gbd to automate many
office
tasks you can automate PowerPoint for
that and do many more tasks with jity
did you know that 93% of online
experiences begin with a search engine
that's a massive audience you are
missing out on if your website isn't
ranking high on search result pages that
is

after that we will understand plagarism
check met title and descriptions and in
the end chat GPT for summary all right
so now before using the chat gpt's
abilities to enhance suo in your system
we need to install an extension that
extension is known as
aipm so the aipm extension is a powerful

aipm
extension click on enter so this is the
first link basically we'll click on
it and this this is aipm for chat gbt
don't get confused with any other
extension this is this looks like this
and now we'll click on add to
Chrome and then add
extension and that's
it now let's just click on
allow and it is integrated I
believe
yes so as you can see it is also showing
a quick start tutorial select a prom
template enter the WordPress or more
send
message so you click on get if you want
to view tutorials you can click on this
otherwise you can get started with aibm
so as you can see the whole layout the
whole interface is changed there are lot
of things over here let me explain to
you guys what all these things are all
right so there are various Options under
public and on from which you can filter
prompts by uh topic as you can see or
activity and then uh prompts can be
sorted by top videos trending as you can
see and uh there are actually 4892
prompts available and uh you can see the
first 12 on this page as you can
see and some examples of prompts here is
like you can say us SE optimized content
writer human written % unique SE
optimized article so these are the
examples of prompt now first of all
we'll ask Chad gbt to write a blog post
for us on let's say Fitness all right so
we'll ask J
gbt Fitness in
everyday
lifestyle all right uh let's click on
this
so we haven't used any prompt till yet
so let's just first put this input and
let's see what CH gbt gives
us all
right so as you can see this is the
topic name importance of everyday
Fitness simple strategies to incorporate
Fitness then we can see subtopics are
also
there all
right and here's the conclusion all
right so this is basically are blog post
so now let's say we want to optimize
this blog post and we want to do SEO on
this one so let's first just copy this
we'll copy this and paste in
our
document all right so this is our
document and we have pasted this all
right now let's go back over here and
let's say we want to write it in a more
familiar or or you can say friendly tone
and in a more explanatory tone you can
also use so let's just write
this don't worry about the spelling guys
uh Chad take care of this all right so
let's see what are the changes in both
of these block
post let's just wait to finish
it and here's the conclusion so this is
the second block post so let's
understand the difference uh in between
these two first we'll first check out
for this one start small begin with
manageable changes all
right as you can see here it is begin
with manageable changes take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destinations or stand and stretch
during work breaks these small efforts
can add up over time all right let's
just see what is written over here in
the second block Post in the second blog
post it is written begin with manageable
changes that fit seamlessly into your
daily routine for example or for
instance choose to take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destination instead of driving or
stand and stretch during work breaks
these small efforts can accumulate over
time and contribute to your overall
Fitness so if you want to take the
second one which is a few changes it is
more bit
explanatory uh compared to the first one
we can just copy paste this this one as
well so you can uh write a second prompt
as well in which if you want to write in
a friendly tone or in a formal tone you
can write like that all you have to do
is to just write the prompt in chat gbd
let's just copy paste it and replace it
with the First with the second one
all right so now we are back in chat gbt
so now basically we have the blog post
content basically we have the content of
it now we want to polish it we want to
select the best title out of it and many
more things so for that let's just make
use of prompts instead of writing all
these prompts by yourself you can make
use of the prompts that is that comes
with aipm chgb prompts all right so
let's just say we want to write about
the title we want to select a perfect
title for this blog post so what we can
do is we'll go over here and first of
all we'll select in topics we'll go and
we'll select copyrighting because we
want to write about the S optimize title
we want the best title we'll select
copywriting
confirm all right now after this you can
just go
for prompts what whichever you like
I'm going to go for this one blog post
title generator as you can see also if
you didn't get what you wanted then you
can go for the search engine over here
you can just type let just say if you
want to uh want to if you're writing a
script basically and you want a perfect
title for it then you can write a script
generator or something like that over
here automatically whichever prompt that
are relevant to it will come all right
so we have selected this one blog post
title generator because we have to
create a title for our blog post we'll
click on this and now all we have to do
is to write the name of our blog post
the name of our blog post is we'll
select everyday Lifestyle Fitness in
everyday lifestyle let's just select
this
one all right now as you can see you can
select the titles to write it is five
let's just select 10 all right now the
language you can select
English and many more languages are
there we'll keep it in English itself
tone emotional or default let's just be
default itself poetic default default
itself we'll keep it like this all right
now click on this let's just
see so according to chat gpta and prompt
these are the 10 best title that we can
Implement in our blog post now what we
want to do is Select one best title out
of it all right so these are 10 we have
to select one out of it so for that
we'll go to Google Keyword
Planner so this is Google Keyword
Planner we'll click on this find your
campaign and keywords we'll click on
this visit Keyword Planner now you guys
might be thinking what is Google Keyword
Planner so let me explain to you
guys so this Google G planner is a free
tool that helps you find keywords for
your online content it shows you how
often people search for certain words
and phrases and how much competition
there is to rank for those keywords this
way you can choose the best keywords to
Target in your ads or blog post or
website to attract more visitors and
potential customers so it'll give you
the numbers basically which are mostly
ranking and having the competition all
right so we'll click on discover new
keywords
and let's select where it is we'll
select the first
10 go to Google Keyword Planner and now
here we will paste
it so all 10 of them are pasted now what
we'll do is we'll click on get results
so after clicking on get results as you
can
see so this is average monthly searches
this is competition the we want the
maximum monthly searches Fitness healthy
lifestyle and low in competition so
according to your preference you can
select from here and whichsoever this is
100k to 1 million and many more more
topics you can select from here which
has low competition so as you can see
this treadmill has more uh average view
100K to 1 million but the competition is
also high so we should keep the
competition low as well so we should
keep in mind so we can select our best
title from it so whichever
suits all right after selecting the best
title we can go
to our what we call this blog post to
change the title so this is the new
title let's keep it like
this all right so now our title is done
now let's go back to chat
GPT and here is a chat
gbt and now let's go to
the its layout now here we want to write
the content regarding that regarding
that title so what we'll do is basically
we'll go over here and we'll select
SEO and once we have selected it we'll
go we'll select this prompt human
written 100% used SE optimized article
now based on that title that we have
generated we'll write a complete content
on it we'll use the help of this prompt
so as you can see G gbt 3.5 turbo gbt 4
gbt 40 we'll select
this and paste our title this is our
title transform your life how everyday
Fitness can boost your health so now
this promp will generate the content
based on this title all right now let's
see as you can see transform your life
how every day fitness can boost your
health this is the content out
line the article outline you can
say so this is the introduction what is
everyday Fitness then physical fitness
benefits and it keeps on
writing I believe it will it will be a
long article or blog
so you don't have to write too many
prompts for this you can just do this
and the whole thing will take care of it
all as you can see fqs are also being
generated by this prompt otherwise we
would have wrote another prompt for the
FAQ and many things are there that
should be in there in the article or
block so yeah now we can select our
article or blog we can
say so we have the title we don't want
the outline let's
say we'll take it from here from the
introduction it's a long article I
believe as you can see this last
question is not completed but you can
click on continue generating and it will
complete that we don't want the last
question I think three questions or four
questions are sufficient for us so now
as we have copied it first of all we
need to make sure that our content is
unique it is not plagarized because we
can't publish or use the plagarized
content so we have to be sure that we
are using the unique content for that
we'll have to go to this site known
as duply
Checker we'll click on this first link
and now as you can see here we can copy
and paste it paste we can just exclude
this last question as I told
you all right now our content our
article is pasted now we will check the
plagarism
all right first of all we'll have to
tell them that we are not a robot and
then we have to click on check PLM
all right so it is showing maximum
thousand words allowed per search all
right so let's just do one
thing we'll do it because if you want to
do thousand words you'll have to go for
their pro version or the premium version
so we now have
to use some part of it not the complete
part it's actually a long
article so from the rule we'll take
as you can see number of words is 5
not5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
12% uni all right so plagarism is uh 3%
I think that can be that can we can
neglect it and now let's check
for the rest of this
one all
right all right here we'll copy and
paste
it check lism
as you can see number of words 671 0%
plagarism 12% unique so I don't think it
will be a problem so it is good to go I
believe and now we just copy and paste
it so
let's take it from
here till here
all right so this is our content now so
our content was not plagarized but let's
just say if it is plagarized and is not
unique so what should we do then we can
simply put a prompt in chat gbt that
make it non- plagerized or make it
unique or rephrase it but let's say uh
that plagerized Checker the duply
Checker mentions the particular lines of
where there is plagarism so you can
select that line put into chat gbt and
ask them to rephrase or make it
plagarism free by doing this you can
make the complete content plagarism free
it is very easy or else you can use a
prompt from aipm as I told you all you
have to do is to just
type plagarism free content writer and a
particular prompt will come you can just
put your content in that prompt and the
rest Chad JD will take care of all right
now to boost your SE strategy you must
focus on eat that is expertise authora
liveness and trustworthiness and keep
that human element strong use chat gbt
to improve your content with interesting
verified facts and relevant examples
create a FAQ section to answer common
questions and look for any missing
information to fill in these steps will
help you make high quality content that
connects with your audience and ranks
better in search engines so for that
we'll write a prompt to chat gbt to
include the what we call FAQs and the uh
statistics we want to uh make use of
statistics and fq and include it in our
content so how should we do that let's
just understand it let's come to our
chat GPT again now here what we'll do is
we'll write a simple prompt
saying no no no first we go to the new
topic now here because otherwise it will
keep on writing in that prompt itself
all right we'll write
please add to what we call stats
or you can write
statistics and one
analogy and uh fa
AQ
section with
answers to
this
content draft to
increase engagement
all right now you want to uh if you want
to paste a particular section of your
content you can also do that or else you
can paste the entire content it's as per
your choice so let me just paste a
particular
section let's just paste this one
and all right let's see
all right so as you can see statistics
studies show that engaging in just 30
minutes of moderate physical activity
each day can reduce the risk of chronic
disease like heart disease so these are
the statistics and these are the
analogies and this is the FAQ section
that you can include in your content or
a particular section of the content
usually these statistics are included in
the introduction part to make it more
interesting in so you can make use of it
and do that all right moving forward
let's understand the chat GPT prompts
for meta titles and descriptions so
crafting meta titles and descriptions is
essential for drawing reader attention
so it is necessary that we should use
that all right so uh now we'll be
writing a particular prompt for it for
that for the content part I'll be
leaving the space
content here
and
create a meta
description and title for this content
here this mean this one all
right
including the keyword now here will
mention the
keyword all right so whatever is the
focus keyword or the primary keyword you
want to include it in all right and
make it
easy to read and add
a
CTA so uh let's
just paste our content over here where
is our content this is our content
and let's just use this one again you
can you have to use the entire content
but I'm just showing showing you so you
can use this one itself it'll be more
than enough don't have to worry about
it and the focus keyword is
ly
lifestyle all right so this is it now
all we have to do is
to wait we done something
wrong here we'll paste the healthy
lifestyle and as we can see title
transform your Healthy transform your
health with everyday Fitness this is
meta description discover how
incorporating everyday Fitness into your
routine can transform your health this
is meta description this is CTA ready to
transform your life start incorporating
everyday Fitness into your routine today
so you can make use of it using this
prompt and
yes now let's understand the chat gbt
prompt for writing summaries so now like
writing blog summaries and posting them
on LinkedIn and Twitter helps you reach
a wider audience by sharing engaging
Snippets you can attract more visitors
to your blog increasing traffic to your
website this practice also establishes
you as an expert in your field building
your brand and reputation so social
media platforms facilitate interaction
through likes shares and comments
boosting engagement with your content so
posting a Blog summary in your social
media like Twitter LinkedIn Etc will be
helpful for you so now let's just write
a particular prompt in chat gbt for uh
creating that blog summary for us all
right so let's make use of it we'll
write
please
create a
100w summary of this
of
[Music]
this
post
optimized
for
Twitter so as Chad already have your
content so you don't have to worry about
rep repasting it so let's just see
all right as we can see looking to
improve your health without spending
hours at gym everyday Fitness is the key
incorporate physical activity into your
daily routine for profound effects on
your physical and mental well-being just
30 minutes of daily activity can reduce
chronic disease risk by 30% and boost
mental health so yeah it has included
all the things that we wanted from our
content or blog to this and it also has
mentioned the hashtags # lify # everyday
Fitness # Wellness you can easily post
this on Twitter and drive traffic from
there and you can also post this on
other social media handles as well okay
guys let's start with creating the
Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation
with the help of chat gity and we'll do
this in two ways starting one with the
VBA code so here we'll ask the chat LGBT
to write a VBA code for the PowerPoint
presentation and for that we'll write a
prompt that is uh write a VBA code for
PowerPoint presentation and you would
just write the topic that is on how to
become a generative a expert and you
could mention some of the details like
you want a road map in the PowerPoint
presentation or just the steps to become
a generative AI expert so let's see an
example so ask the chity that write
a VBA
code
for PowerPoint
presentation and we'll write the
topic on how to become a generative
AI or a master in generative
Ai and here you could mention the
details also or you could ask the chat
GPT that you can act as an exp exp ERT
in computer science or as an expert in
artificial intelligence and you could
create a PowerPoint presentation and
give us a VBA code on how to become a
master in
generative and you could ask him that I
want the slides in a manner or you could
just list the slides that on slide one I
want the problem faced by gener experts
then in the next slide I want what
skills and on the next slide that is
slide two I want to to know what skills
that generative AI expert should possess
and in slide three I want the road map
and in the upcoming slides I want all
the road map skills or the roles to be
explained in a good manner that I can
understand or I can use this PP for like
for students to get them
understand so you could like modify your
prompt
accordingly so let's see uh
how the chat jpt respond to this and
what VBA code it will provide to
us so you could see that CH has started
jointing the response and you could see
here that to use this VBA code you'll
need to access the vbi dator in
PowerPoint and for that you just need to
press alt plus f11 and then insert a new
module I'll show you how you could
insert the VBA code in
PowerPoint uh till then he in
like generating the response we'll come
back here so this is the developer
option that we need to
unlock so just click on the blank
presentation and coming on the blank
presentation just right click here and
you could see the option customize the
ribbon so this is the ribbon the whole
thing this whole thing this is the
ribbon and you could
see the options
here and this is the developer option
which I have already tick marked that is
it is accessible in my ribbon Hub so we
make it accessible and here in the
developer option you have to click on
Visual Basic and then insert user form
then we have module here click on the
module and here we have to paste the VBA
code that will be provided by the chat
gbt as you could see that it has
provided the code and there's another
method that is you just press all plus
f11 and then you will come on the
particular slide here then you have to
go here and use the module and paste it
here so we will copy the VBA
code get back here paste the code and
this is the button you have to click
that is run sub or user form just click
on it and you could see that it has
provided the PowerPoint presentation so
it is the basic presentation as I have
not like commanded the chat jpt or I
have not modified my prompt accordingly
I've just used the basic prompt that
just generate a basic presentation on
how to become an expert in generative VI
so you could modify a prompt accordingly
on how you want your presentation and
put the design thing you could use any
template or
layout so we have the design here so you
could use any
design what you
prefer so you would see that it has
applied the design to all the
presentations you could ask the chat
GPT if you want to like have more text
heavy and if you want to generate images
also you could do that with the help of
Del so now moving to the next method on
how we can create ppts or the PowerPoint
using chat GPT this is the one method
that is using the VBA code now moving
back to chat
gbt now here we will ask
him
that generate a PowerPoint pitch deck
for a
topic and that could be any topic you
want so here we will modify a prompt and
ask him that act as
a as an expert in
CS that would be computer
science and I want him to
generate PowerPoint
presentation that would be pitch
Tech and that would be for
topic let's move to the topic for the
cloud computing
topic on
mastering cloud
computing okay and we will instruct him
that structure the
presentation in the following manner
in the following sections and now we can
provide him the section that
is
problems faced by Cloud
expert then it could be
skills and then the road
map
roles
salary I think that's it and you can
modify accordingly what you want in your
presentation let's see what it will
provide to
us so you would see that it has started
generating it
so what we'll do here is we'll open the
word
here
and we'll paste all the content that has
been provided by the chat jpt and using
the word
only what we'll use here we'll
paste
and we'll use the paste formatting here
that is the merge formatting so first
delete all these
okay now we have the content
here and we don't want this also now mve
to the view
outline and here what we'll
do we will make these
like the
titles just get back and use contr Ed
we'll find all the slide
titles and replace them with a
space okay and there
are colons also so we have made The
Replacements here now for the content
part also we have to make that replace
so we'll use the control h only and what
we have here is
content and we'll replace
it with like nothing that would be empty
only and
subtitle so yeah our Word document is
here now moving to the view outline and
here what we'll do we'll make all this
that is the heading of the
slides we'll select all of
them and make them as level
one and all
the other
things as level two if you see the
content it has not Ed us the good
content that it has just provided what
things we can include in the PowerPoint
not like the chat J has not given us
the all the content that should be
included in the parment like you could
see here that is in the first slide it
has stated that mastering cloud
computing a comprehensive guide and
unlocking the future of technology only
it has not provided us the content and
in this word is cloud computing it has
said that Define cloud computing and its
importance in the mod digital landscape
it has not defined for us it has just
provided the definitions so you have to
modify prompt that I want the whole PP
presentation with all the information or
all
the understandings of the
concepts so you could do
that and
now in the view section
only with this we'll save
this and we'll save this on the desktop
only and name it as
PPM okay now move to the
PowerPoint and here we'll move to file
blank
presentation and in the new slide we
will click on the option slides from
outline move to the dektop here we have
the ppf file we will insert
itose is used by another user okay so
we'll close
this and click on
okay we'll do the process again that
insert it and wait for some time till
then it proceeds with that and create
the presentation so you could see here
that it has created the presentation
here that is mastering cloud computing a
comprehensive guide and looking the
future of technology so you could see
that jjt has not provided us all the
information it has just drafted how you
could insert information in the slides
so what you can do is you could just go
to chat jbt and ask him that provide all
the informations for the slide one and
then paste it in your word document
accordingly you could do for all the
slides and then save the word document
after doing the level one and level two
headings for the content and after that
you could just come here and in the new
slide section just click on slides from
outline and insert the document that's
it and if you want to design it you
could use any layout or template so with
this guys today we have learned two
methods to create PowerPoint
presentation using chat JB today in an
era of mobile devices robots and social
media content creation is the most
effective inbound marketing
strategy nearly 40% of marketers say say
content marketing is essential to their
marketing strategy and 81% say their
company views content as a business
strategy original and high quality
content can help your company stand out
and attract new customers and help your
business grow on that note welcome to
Simply learns YouTube channel today we
are here with a fantastic video on chat
GPD for Content creation which will help
you create some compelling content on
your desired topics so let us understand
what is Chad GPT here now content
creation can be of any type such as
blogs podcast videos graphics and so on
but how do you create high quality
content with a few minutes it not be
worried when we have chat GPT now even
though there are numerous AI writing
tools for Content creation chat GPD
stands out from the crowd due to its
faster response rate ease of use
increased productivity support for
multiple languages and other benefits
now let's try to understand what exactly
Char is and how to create content from
it
now generally chat GPT is an open AI
trained and developed model that works
conversationally chat GPT is capable of
systematically resolving all bugs while
providing detailed explanation for each
step it takes so in simple words chat
GPT is a tool that creates content for
any query chat GPT stands out among all
the other achievements of open AI so let
us now move ahead and understand how
does chat GPT work now chat GPT uses
deep learning techniques to generate
humanik text which is based on a machine
learning model derived from the large
language model class now it is trained
on a massive Text data sets from the
internet and learns patterns and
relationship between words and phrases
it responds to a question by selecting
the next word based on the context and
then repeats the process until a stop
condition is fulfilled so as a result
chat GPD can logically respond to your
queries and commands so let's see how to
create content in chat GPT now as we
already discussed content creation can
be of any type so for instance let's
take blog a Blog is an online general or
a website where a writer or a group of
writers share their views on an
individual subject now there are variety
of categories for writing a Blog so
let's pick one for chat GPD here so as
you can see we have navigated into chat
GPD and let us now ask a simple question
about food blogging now lately food
blogs are the most popular blogs that
everyone wants to write about so let's
find out what chat GPT has to say about
it now you can give any question to chat
GPT and it will answer so I'm just uh
writing a question here saying how to
start a foot blogging
carrier so as you can see it is
generating the answer for us uh wait for
it to
end well as you can see it is saying
that starting a foot block can be a fun
and rewarding way to share your love of
food with others so it is showing us
some steps to get started in food
blogging career it is saying choose a
nishe choose a name and domain choose a
blogging platform create your blog
create high quality content and so on so
in this way chat GPT will automatically
generate the response for you based on
the questions that you are giving input
to it next we will see another question
on lifestyle blogs now with the world on
social media everyone wants to read more
about lifestyle espe especially of a
famous or a popular uh entity what
habits they adapt and what to let go of
Etc so let's explore this segment in
chat GPT as well and see what it will
show the answer so let's uh give the
question as how to
start
lifestyle blogging in
India so it is giving the answer for us
guys so it is saying that start a
lifestyle blog in India can be a great
way to share your experiences and
knowledge with others who share similar
interest so here are some steps to help
you get started again it is giving some
uh important points for us in order to
start your lifestyle blogging career
like choose your nishe choose a name and
domain choosing a blogging platform
create your blog create high quality
content and so on Chad GP is truly a
fascinating technology changing how we
interact with language it's the result
of years of research and development by
open AI who have trained the model on a
massive amount of Text data to create a
machine that can easily understand and
generate humanik text imagine you are a
digital marketer looking to make a big
impact on your next campaign J GP can
help you do that Chad GPT uses natural
language processing or NLP which can
assist you in creating compelling
humanlike copy for your website social
media and email marketing it can even
generate product descriptions and add
copy that is engaging and optimized for
search engines using chat GPT will save
time and increase your productivity

aspects of your campaign and with its
ability to generate multiple text
variations you can test and Define your
messaging to find the perfect tone and
language that resonates with your target
audience get ready to revolutionize your
digital marketing game with the help of
this video you will gain a deeper
understanding of how chat GPT can
supercharge your efforts as a content
creator or digital marketer say goodbye
to mundane tasks and hello to a 10-fold
boost in productivity let's dive in ever
since open a launched CH GP it has been
making waves in every field be academic
marketing engineering or content writing
so here's a little trivia for you who
are the investors in opena the company
behind the development of J jpd and your
options are option option A Ellen musk
and Sam Altman option b Jeff Bezos and
SAA option C Mark Zuckerberg and L page
option D zma and masayoshi Sun Drop your
answer in the comment section Below on
that note we present you postgraduate
program in Ai and machine learning
elevate your professional journey by
enrolling in this Ai and ml course
presented through a partnership between
per University and IBM hurry up and
enroll Now find the complete course
details from the link mentioned in the
descript box below okay then let's get
started there are many uses of chat jpt
in digital marketing its main USB is
smart human sounding content writing we
can command it to write content related
to marketing first on our agenda is an
ad copy there are various ways to go
about it but we must understand that no
matter how much content sounds like
humans it is still a piece of content
written by an AI so you have to give
detailed and precise queries to get the
best results let's start by giving it a
basic command like write an ad
[Music]
copy as you can see it gave us random ad
content let's give this query more
content like write an ad copy for simply
learn digital marketing Master's course
now as you can see it gave us a more
precise ad copy we can also ask to make
it longer or shorter let's give it a
next query can you make it
[Music]
longer and VOA it gave us a long version
of that same content now let's try to
convert it into email newsletters we
digital marketers often send emails to
promote our products and services so
let's give it a query as can you convert
it to email
newsletters as you can see it has ated
an email with a subject line and body
that is enticing and engaging to read we
can also utilize chat GPT to correct
grammar or change the tone of the
content for example let's enter a new
query what is
[Music]
Facebook it has given us a Jour overview
of Facebook now let's ask it to rephrase
it more engagingly and in a digital
marketing context we can give queries
like can you make it more engaging and
relatable with digital
[Music]
marketing as you can see it has
completely rephrased it and it is more
interesting to read it as well J GPT can
also help with keyword research so let's
try it we will give a query as suggest
more Search keywords for a digital
marketing core
[Music]
side and voila it has completed a work
we used to spend 10 to 15 minutes in a
few seconds you can request to write
blogs as well let's give it a query to
search for some keywords for the blog
suggest keywords to write a blog on
digital marketing
it gave us some keywords you can ask it
to reduce these topics based on search
volume to get maximum results let's ask
it to narrow it down to five topics
based on keywords
volume here we have some suggestions
let's pick a topic content writing and
ask it to write an article on content
writing
[Music]
here we have our article for the blog
let's use chat GPT to se optimize it
let's first request it to give us meta
title and meta
[Music]
description here we have meta title and
meta description for this article we can
even request it to give us an SEO
optimized URL link
we can also request it to write the SE
optimized version of this article just
give it a command as also can you as you
optimize this article to improve Google
search results
[Music]
here we have fully SE optimized article
with meta title and meta description
with a su optimized URL chat GPD can
also be used to train your customer
service chat boards but we can discuss
the process in some other video chat gbt
is well worth with its content writing
capabilities it can even help you write
product marketing campaigns let's try it
with this query the query is write a
product marketing campaign for simply
learn digital marketing courses
well J jpt has done it again this
campaign looks interesting and it will
be able to generate more leads for
simply lar courses Chad JP can also be
used to write scripts for YouTube videos
let's give it a query as write a script
for 5 minute YouTube video promoting
simply learn and its digital marketing
courses
[Music]
[Music]
as you can see it gave us full script
along with few suggestions for video
editor on where to put logos and clips
to make the video more engaging if
you're a content creator and you don't
know how to approach other content
creators for a collaborative video then
chat GP can help you with that it can
help you writing collaboration emails as
well my next query will be to write a
collaborative email for a YouTube video
on digital
[Music]
marketing since my last query was
related to Simply learn J GP assured
that I work for simply and I wrote a
customer collaboration email that looks
professional plus easy to read and
understand as technology advances in all
aspects of Our Lives programming has
become increasingly important it is used
in many fields and industries including
software development gaming and
entertainment education scientific
research web development and many more
so needless to see the demand for
programming and coding in the IT
industry will probably keep increasing
for the foreseeable future
but where does CHP open AI popular
language model fall in this chain that's
exactly what we are focusing on in this
today's video as I said earlier
programming is utilized in many domains
like web development robotics mobile
development machine learning and so on
so how can a program achieve maximum
code efficiency nowadays we have eii
based tools like charab to make our
programming experience more efficient
although there are several coding
resources platforms such as stack
overflow and GitHub where programmers
can find solutions to their technical
programming questions charity stands out
from the competition because of its
quick response time usability and
support for numerous languages among
many other benefits now let's first
discuss how Char Works Char generates
responses to the text input using a
method called Transformer architecture a
large volume of text is fed into the
chat GPT from various sources including
books websites and other social media
platforms the model then uses this
information to focus has the following
word in a phrase based on the words that
came before it the charity systems
allows users to enter text or queries
and then the system uses its training
data and algorithms to produce the right
answer the answer is created after the
input text has been examined and the
pattern most likely to match the input
have been identified using the training
data in short charity is designed to
respond to queries logically and command
more quickly and accurately but why do
programmers use CHD on a regular basis
chib assists programmers by offering
programming related answers and
solutions and helping them improve their
skills beside that charity is utilized
for code generation code completion code
review and a natural language interface
let us understand each in detail chity
is trained to generate the code or even
the entire program described in the
natural language specified by what they
want a program to do and then Char could
generate the relevant code look at the
example of how Char generates the code
so now open the chat GPT and you can
type any program that you want chat GPT
to generate so I will give write a pal
program in Java so here you can type
write
a
palum program in
Java so using Java programming language
it should generate the whole
program so as you can see it has
generated the program so it has used a
class name called pandrum Checker and it
has used e pandrum as a method name and
also it will give the explanation on the
program so you can see here why it is
explaining why e pandrum is used as a
method and U it also explains the for
Loop if a condition and so on next we
have code completion Chi is trained to
generate Snippets of code or even fully
fledged programs it can generate a list
of possible code completion depending on
the context of the users incomplete
piece of Code by automatically producing
the entire code it can help the
developer save time and minimize errors
next let's see the example of code
completion using chity so even if the
program is explained in natural language
CH GPT will generate the proper code and
give the complete code so let's type
here using a
function write a program
to
convert the
string in
uppercase so using which language let's
keep using C
programming and enter it once
again so as you can see we have just
said that using a function write a
program to convert the string in
uppercase so using C programming
language and using C programming
language it has used function and you
know this is the function convert to
uppercase and has given the complete
code for string or to convert a string
in uppercase and also it gave the
explanation here the convert to
uppercase function takes a pointer to a
string as its argument and then iterates
over each character in the string using
a for Loop so it explained why for Loop
is used why two upper is used and why
the method convert to uppercase is used
everything so let's say uh we'll give
one piece of code like
void to
Upper car s
Str so as you can see we just gave the
method to Upper and and it's generating
the complete code so this is how charity
works for code completion next code
review charp can analyze code identify
the bugs or errors in the program and
further help resolve them it allows
developers to fix errors more quickly so
now let's have a look at the example of
code review so in this example Char will
review the code so even if the code has
some mistake it will give the proper
output let's say we have given the
example here so we gave the function or
a method called
upper and here we are giving the keyword
called upper so it should check whether
this piece of code is proper or is there
any mistake in
this so as I said uh it's saying that
the given code appears to have logical
error as the function upper is being
called recursively on itself inside the
loop so instead of giving two upper we
just give upper here right so using the
keyword to Upper only then the string
can be converted to uppercase so here we
gave just upper so it says that it is
having this piece of code is having a
logical error and it gives a proper code
for
us so I hope it's clear and then we have
natural language interface with the use
of chpt a software application can be
given a natural language user interface
that enables users to communicate with
it through natural language instructions
rather than through conventional user
interfaces next let's see how TD helps
the programmers for natural language
interface so let's save we'll give
your
create a software
application
where the
user asked to
enter
credential for the too app
enter so as you can see the Char will
give the steps so it can provide you
with an outlet for creating a software
applications that requires the user to
enter credential for a Todo app so here
it is few steps that we need to follow
to do a to-do app
so it's giving the explanation step by
step so it says that determine the
programming language and framework then
set up the database to store the US user
information and then create the
registration page and then finally
create the login page as well and once
the user is successfully logged in um
you know it will have the options like
add edit and delete task as well and
then finally implement the security
measures to you know protect your
passwords and then test the application
to ensure that it works as intendent and
the user data is being stored and
retrieved correctly so it gives the
steps of how it has to be developed I'm
sure you all are aware of chat at this
point the Revolutionary new AI based
chatbot developed by open AI has taken
the World by storm thanks to its near
lifelike responses and a very intricate
pattern of answers we have never seen
this level of expertise from a chatbot
before which really made us think to
what extent can we push it there are
many questions on lead code that even
the most experienced programmers have
difficulty answering so we wanted to see
how far chat GPD can take us have we
finally reached the stage where AI is
going to replace us let's find out so
basically here we will be listing 10
really difficult questions that we found
on lead code popularly asked while
hiring and other Superior examinations
and see if chat GPD can actually answer
or solve those difficult questions or
not but before you like to watch more
such interesting videos then do
subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn so let's let's get
started so here is the lead code let's
see uh in our list which is the first
question that we are going to implement
in our chart gbd and see if it's able to
solve it or not mainly we'll focus on
hard category questions only
so according to my research there's a
question of
median of two sorted arrays
so as you can see the success rate is
35.7% so let's see if the chart GPD is
able to do this question so first let us
go through the
question
okay press enter let's see what it first
returns
uh on a one approach to solving this
problem is to use a modified binary
search algorithm to find the median of
the two sorted areas so right now it's
particularly giving the logic which we
can actually imply to solve this
question and uh this is a good about the
chart GPD is that before uh giving the
code it's actually explaining how they
are putting the logic in together in the
code so probably you can use this logic
to create your own program but let's see
how sensible this code
is white a LLY
program in Python so if uh you are
looking for your Solutions on chat GPD
you can always opt out or you know
mention the specific program you want
the code in so okay
it also gives that okay that the time
complexity will be o log Min m or n so
let's see if
it the case or
not so we have copied it and we'll
quickly paste it over
here as you can
see uh as we know that python is uh very
sensitive towards its uh syntax and you
can see the indentation over here is
perfect but here it's not so I feel that
something like this is something with
lead code so let me just quickly Rectify
this you can see I have cleared out the
indentation issue and let's just quickly
run this program so that we can get an
idea if this is the correct program
uh now you can see here we have an error
let's see copy this and see what chart
GPD has to say for this
so if you remember when we actually saw
this question there were three arguments
passed through this function which was
self nums one and nums 2 ask GPT if it
can write the code with self argument
and see if it's correct
wait that if it can pass a self argument
through that function and see if it can
generate a new
code okay now it has cleared that yes it
takes three
arguments let's Cy this code
it over here again I think we will have
to go through the indentation
process oh no this time it's fine okay
so now quickly run this program let's
see if this time it passes all the test
cases or
not
okay I think it doesn't need because the
class is already mentioned over
here uh
yeah okay the runtime is 35 Ms and as we
can see case one and case 2 is
definitely passed
so let us see
if this code can pass all the Death
cases internally mentioned in this
question now you can see the first three
cases are actually accepted but the
other three are not there's a runtime
error
so the first question in our list Jad
GPT was unable to solve let's move on to
our next question
that is zigzag
conversion now let me quickly search for
it this is a question here also you can
see the success rate is definitely below
50 and uh the difficulty level is medium
so the hard one charity was not able to
solve let's see if this can be
done so it will give a string that will
be written in a zigzag pattern on a
given number of rows and uh then you
have to read the line in a certain as
you can see over
here we have to write the code that will
take a string and make this conversion
given in a number of rows
has also me a certain amount of certific
uh repeat do also given a certain
specifications that we exactly want so
this time we'll make sure that we are
mentioning
everything so let's quickly copy
this yeah
okay now that we have mentioned all the
specifications uh let me
quickly Fe
and pasted now let's see what code it
has to
generate it's implementing the code in
C++ so meanwhile it's generating the
code let's
quickly the code oh it's already C++
okay
okay it's also suggesting that we can
definitely use Python and
Java and it's generating an alternative
code as well for
us that's
sharp just quickly copy this code
a one I think it's a okay so it's
generating in uh
Java it's generating we'll definitely
have a look at its alternative codes as
well let's quickly have a look at what
it has to C++ 1 the first code generated
by it uh is correct or
not okay copy the code
pasted over
here dation
error okay
okay 28
okay so
let's this
error the one thing definitely this time
we have mentioned all the constraints
criteria specifications that we wanted
in our code but again
charging questions we have implemented
till now
let's see if it has any success rate in
further okay it seems
okay okay now it is okay so this time it
is uh generating the
solution considering the error in Java
let uh see what it has to say in Java
and we'll make it specific that the
error was in C++ program so generates
the correct
code Plus+ program
what it has to say
see so this error is something related
to the compiler and now it is giving the
updated code in
C++ is the correct one or
not apologizing for making errors in
their
Solutions
fascinating uh
yeah paste the code over here I don't
see there's a lot of difference or
changes over here let's see if it runs
or
not let me see if all the braces are
covered over here or not
I think it's missing a brace
okay so there was a syntax error one
brace was missing uh um I
don't B
that definitely something with the code
but okay we can give that to chgb it was
partially lead codes issue because we
were copying still it was not getting
the error that there is a bra
missing has passed the first three cases
mentioned over here and the run time is
3 Ms now just let us submit this code
and see if it passes all the rest of the
cases or not minded this time we have
actually mentioned all the constraints
so let's see if this has to
into okay so this time it has passed all
the test cases but still my conclusion
with this question is uh it was still
not able to generate the solution in one
go uh but still I can give that to char
GPT because the first that we faced was
more of a lead courses issue because it
was something with
compile and Char GPT was able to give a
proper U now let's go back to our
problems
list so right now the score is one in
one it wasn't able to solve one question
and one not so let's have a look at the
third question and see if that brings
any difference to the Chart
gpt's scoreboard right now or
not third question that we are going to
deal with is
substring
with concatenation of all words this is
in the category again and the success
success rate is
31.1% which is is even lesser than the
first question that we faced which was
median of the two sorted
Aras weying here we are actually trying
to cover all the Spectra the huge
Spectra of different types of questions
and you know categories available in
coding and uh to give you an idea of
how beneficial charity can be for you to
solve difficult questions
which can be helpful for your interview
base
in companies or you you can say well
established companies or mang companies
so here this video is specifically for
you to give an idea that whether you can
use it for your benefit and you know to
get an idea or you can actually uh
compare it with
yours uh and you can get a you know
wider range of different types of
approaches to a certain
question so let's start with the third
question is that you're given a string
and an array of strings probably words
and all the strings of words are of the
same length now a concatenated substring
in s is a substring that contains all
the strings of any permutation of words
concatenated here you can see it's given
an example that if words has AB B CD EF
then AB CD EF basically it uh has done
all the permutation and combinations
that can be done using that specific
array
uh and that ACD BF is not a concatenated
substring because it is not the
concatenation of any permutation of
words so we have to basically return the
starting indices of all the concatenated
substring in the S
string also you can choose any order for
it here it has also given uh to be
examples for you
to understand the question in a better
perspective
now uh copy this question and see
if what programming language AG chooses
to answer this
time start with new chart
again copy these constraints
okay it's just a
question okay this is the solution that
we're getting right now you requested a
model that is not compa able with this
engine please contact us through our
help center at
help. open.com for further questions let
me just quickly refresh it if it has
something to do with the you know demand
also sometimes it happens that the
console is very busy and you're unable
to
implement uh your task in it so again
let's
quickly paste it over here
we want a code write a
code to return
now this
enter I'm definitely it's not giving the
same error like let's see it this time
it charger P has anything to give as a
solution okay so it's generating the
code in
Python more thing every time charge
doesn't follows a similar pattern as you
can see in the first question it
explained the logic first and uh then
implemented the code second time it just
gave you the approach not the logic and
then implemented the code in multiple
languages uh first choosing for
C++ and this time it straightaway went
for the code so definitely we can say
that it has some different styles of
generating their code and explaining the
code I think it depends on the
understanding how they want the code to
be presented in front of the user and to
give the perspective that if the code is
understandable or not and if the code
has multiple approaches I think Char is
capable to capable enough to give
that that the code is generated let's
quickly copy
it
and paste it over
here I feel the indentation issue is
going to be there
it was not
there
okay F probably I think if we back
isue let me quickly Rectify this and
I'll do you once the indentations
are
e
e
e
e e
the indentation is corrected now let's
have a look at the code if it's correct
or not let's quickly run
it definitely it has given our first
syntax error again I can see that even
specific video question it definitely
goes to at least one error which is
mainly the syntax
one sure if that is something with the
lead code or you know with
the chart GPD code
generation
okay now that we have given the error
okay it seems that the error is caused
by the use of type hints the function
type hints were introduced the version
we using is lower than that okay so
basically it's generating now in the
python version uh probably this code
is well suited for different version of
python let's change it then and see if
that helps
it is actually generating the
code okay again given the other I think
it's again something with the
self
uhon one the new code generated is
here we definitely come back to that
error and have a look at the Python 3
code
also uh first let's copy this code and
in giving the same
[Music]
error and see what it has to say
uh you know every time the Char
generates the python code we
cannot ever takes self as an argument
but
le as you can see when we start the code
it's already mentioned what arguments we
need to pass from that particular
function so I think that is something
with the lead code
so that what all arguments it's passing
even so we have mentioned everything
this time we have mentioned all the
constraints we have mentioned all the uh
necessary specifications that we want in
the code even then the code is not
correct in the one go so probably I'll
get this point to GPT it's something
with the lead code because it's passing
that parameter and every time we have to
mention that parameter pretty much when
we do the charab is able to solve the
question so let's see what let let me U
actually mention
that it pass uh self parameter self
argument from that parameters one of
make it a one of the parameters
processing that
yes self can be passed as the first
argument to the given function now let's
see if that it's able to give the
correct solution or not again we can see
it's uh generating the code in you
know Python
3 but we can give that to char GPD that
either it uses python or Python 3 the
error is with the cell
argument so once we mention that error
and when we mention that specification
that if Char can pass self argument
through that particular function in that
code the solution is pretty
much right so here it's also
implementing and giving the
answer okay it also has mentioned that
uh it's important to mention import
imported list and counter so
okay just copy this because again there
will be a lot of uh ination
issues okay now that we have
it copy the code
already mentioned so yeah we'll
just copy it from the
[Music]
function paste it
run this code and see if it has the
solution in it or
not yeah there's an indentation
issue let me
again as you can see it is able to pass
all the test cases here and the run time
is 208
Ms now let us submit this question and
see if it is able to pass other test
cases or
not it so it is able to pass all the
test cases and uh I think this is
something with lead code again uh
whenever we are generating the python
code we are actually passing self
argument uh in lead code but chart GPD
is not assuming it so this solution is
definitely correct uh even though we are
specifying everything we will have to be
more specific that we have to run one
more argument uh from the function so
that it you know generates the solution
in one go so let us uh try that in our
next
question we can definitely see chart gbd
was able to solve this so now the
scoreboard is
211 uh among the three questions it is
definitely able to solve two questions
even the first question it was able to
generate a correct solution but it was
not that accurate to pass all the test
cases
to our question
list the next we are going to cover is
in
Queens atory but still the success rate
is 63% over here again a new genre or
question we are covering over here let
us see
if solve it or not definitely the
success rate shows that many people were
able to do it definitely more than half
of people who have attempted it so it's
see if the question can this AI can beat
that or
not so uh I have copied this question
this question mentions that the end
Queen
puzzle is the problem of placing n
Queens on an n in to n chest board such
that no two queens attack each other
given an integer n return all distinct
solutions to the n Queen puzzle so
basically n is any given number and you
have to create a puzzle of n n and you
have to arrange all the Queens in such
uh you know way also the number of
Queens in the board will be equal to the
number
in and in such a way that it is not able
to attack each other in any
case po it this part of the
question and the constraint is just one
let
me that it will be easier to keep a
track of uh what all questions Char gbt
is able to solve
so these questions are very popular uh
in
interviews uh whenever you actually go
to technical rounds and uh for
prestigious companies these questions
are very popular uh they are considered
as very uh suitable questions to check
uh to check your you know IQ and to
check your potential that how well aware
you are towards your coding
potential that we have pressed enter it
is giving the logic it is going to
implement in its code one approach to
solve the end Queen's puzzle is to use
backtracking idea is to start by placing
a queen in the First Column of the first
row so let's see if the code is again
capable to you know solve it or not
again it's giving the python
code generating the code let us quickly
see whether it's python or Python
3 Pyon Python
3
okay once the code is generated I'll
also write that you need to pass one
more argument from the main
function uh that is self and uh let let
it generate the code again and see that
code can run in one go or not
what I want and let us see sure here's
an example of how you can pass an
additional parameter self let's see if
it
suits the code or not
the solve end Queen function is a method
of the end Queen's class and it takes
self as its first parameter followed by
the integer n so yes this solution does
take self as a parameter so let's see if
this can run in one go or not because
this time we already covered the most uh
frequently generated error which is
syntax error of not mentioning parameter
self let me see the indentation if it's
correct or not
this time uh let us quickly Run
This
plus okay there you go now you can see
that it has actually run the code in one
go and all the test cases are passed in
one go even the run time is 39 Ms so
definitely chat gbt is able to provide
the solutions the Logics in a proper
manner it's just that we have to be more
specific with what we want exactly uh
from chg right now we can see that it
has been able to successfully
generate of five uh questions that we
have actually implemented till now out
of which four are from hard category
let us submit this code and see if it
also covers all the test cases inter
internally fed in for this question just
a second I think I will have to submit
it
again there you go it has accepted all
the test cases and this question is done
by Char GP it has actually implemented
next question that we are going to cover
till now I can say Char GB has taken the
lead it is pretty much able to implement
all the questions uh I think there are
still some range of questions that it is
not able to implement as we saw the
first one was not a huge
success but uh I can still give that to
char as it is in a and still in a you
know developing mode but still if it can
give you 90% of the output correct it is
a pretty decent and you know amazing
thing to
do question is shortest subar with some
at least K now let me search for it
again this question is from heart
category and its success rate is even
low which is 26.1 let's see this
question can be solved by Char
gpt's have a look at the question given
an integer AR nums and an integer K
return the length of the shortest
nonempty sub array of nums with a sum of
at least K so if there is no such
subarray return minus
one
so bar is a contagious part of an array
it is also given a description of what
an array is or what sub array is so now
that we
have a new
chat and let's
[Music]
me
CH so here is one way to solve the
problem initialize two pointers uh left
and right both pointing to the first
element of the array initialize a
variable so now this time this it is
giving pointers to solve the this
question uh you know a perfect approach
in a sequential manner so that you can
also use these pointers and the Logics
it's giving to actually Implement your
own code apart from you know asking it
to generate a code I can see that it has
given the pointers but not the code
specific
so yes uh it's giving an implementation
of the algorithm in
Python uh again we can see it's not the
Python 3 it's python uh little low
version of python
um switch
to python
then we have to pass self
so it has generated a code and explained
what all variables and what all
statements have the individual fun
functionality as so we have also asked
it to pass self parameter through its
function and then write the code so
let's see if it ads to it and generates
a new code with self
parameter okay so
here is the new code with self pass to
the main
function now I do have confidence on
chat GPT till that it was able to
generate logical and you know pretty
decent solutions for every
question this pass to the class as an
argument when an object is created and
is stored as an instance variable the
short is
subar takes K as an argument which is
the target sum so basically it's trying
to explain the code that what exactly
it's doing and what individual
statements have as an influence on the
code and whatever parameters they are
passing what influence or what position
they hold in the
code uh definitely charge is not just
generating the code uh you know it's
also explaining the logic and approaches
towards it and when it's generating the
code as you can see here they have legit
explain the whole code how it's actually
functioning that's a good way to you
know
put emphasis on you know put a
confidence on the solution
and remove
this
yeah H eror okay let me
okay so it's apologizing it made a
mistake in its previous response the
init method should take two arguments
one for the nums array and one for key
so now it's again generating a new code
ading to the syntax error or type error
generated
like right or not
mentioned that here the elect meod takes
two arguments one for the nums aray and
one for the K which was the error
exactly and it's again explaining the
whole code so that one person who
watches code or you know the logic could
understand the functionality of it
let's see if this code can
run W checking for indentation removing
class and run
is one more type
error let's copy it
and we mention that we want self
argument to be
passed it is still not able to generate
you know the correct solution twice so
let's see if this time it can work out
issue though with the
code apologize for the confusion it
seems that I misunderstood
the that you are trying to call the
function directly without creating an
instance of the class in that Cas
function outside of class and simply
Call It by passing the parameters like
this okay the code is definitely
generated by itself so definitely I am
not calling any function uh the code I
copied was actually generated by chart
GPD itself so it's it contradicting its
own pointers
maybe we have copied the question uh
sorry the code let's paste
it again look for indentation
and run this
code okay once again it is not able to
you know
pass I am eror is that and now again we
have to copy this error and paste
it again according to chat GP it was
confused with the context of the
question uh like I said the code was
anywhere generated by chart GPT so yeah
this time I think chart GPT is trying to
contradict its own
Logics let's see if the current code can
do the miracle of solving this question
[Music]
last and
run okay so after four attempts of
running the codes generated by chart GPD
on lead code but this particular
question finally now it's able to pass
all the test cases so I can I have a
very contradicting point right now uh
not exactly contradicting more of a
skeptism that okay chat G does generates
uh proper code or logic but it doesn't
considers all
the criterias or it also has a tendency
of taking the question in a wrong
context so I feel that when we as a
human try to solve these questions we
definitely try to implement all the
Logics and if we get it we can actually
get the code in one
go or you know demand of the question
and being AI being the superior
version or you know trying to be the
superior version of human brain and
going to the extents of a human
brain still faces those issues can be a
you know drawback for chat GPT because
you can see for this specific question
we have faced multiple types of error
and we have seen chity contradicting its
own prior code
so definitely this is something to
consider or or you know something to
think
about submit this
code and like I said after giving four
attempts it is still not able to pass
all the test cases it is only able to
pass 61 out of 907 test
cases which is almost 70% of the test
cases 30% of the test cases are still
not passed even though we mentioned all
the constraints we have mentioned the
commment we have mentioned all the
errors that but this particular code can
go through still it was not able to
generate the proper code that could go
through all the test cases so this was a
fail for charity uh it at least till now
we have made out this point that Char
GPT is definitely not able to solve
every
question
question L array with same
average all right
AR
with this is from the category of hard
questions and the success rate is only
25% uh Let me refresh it and remove this
code now let's have a look at the code
what it demands so you are given an
integer array nums now you should move
each element of nums into one of the two
arrays A and
B and B are non empty and the average of
array a is equal to average of array B
now return true if it is possible to
achieve
that condition is not
justified so given a note that for an
array uh average array is the sum of all
the elements of array over the length of
array okay so it it is giving the log
how to actually you know find out the
average of what average is exactly and
also it has given a few examples to give
you how the code needs to be projected
or
implemented pleas copy the code and
paste it
okay it is possible to achieve this by
checking all the possible subsets of the
nums array and comparing the averages of
the subsets so definitely it has given
you the approach uh the way you can
actually think of solving this question
uh however this approach would have a
Time complexity so it's also giving that
this approach can have a Time complexity
of O the power n so again it's
suggesting a different approach a more
efficient approach that will be using
dynamic programming now that can be used
to find the subsets with a specific
average and create a 2d array with the
length of I and J will that will be the
length of the two we have actually given
as input and represents whether or not
it is possible to get the sum of J using
the first elements of the nums aray
[Music]
so so the time complexity of this
approach would be o NS so definitely is
not given a code let me ask for it
that not for every question chat GP is
generating a code it is also mentioning
just and the approaches that we can
actually use uh definitely again we will
have to mention that what we want from
them as you can see I've mentioned this
time to write a code for it and now it's
generating a new code for
it is also mentioning comments that what
every snippet of the code is actually
for and what it will do like here you
can see it will fill the 2D RP uh DP
stands for dynamic programming this here
it has mentioned initialize the First
Column as true so it is also mentioning
the comments for better idea of you know
understanding the code in a better way
also giving the note that this
implementation assumes that the nums AR
is non empty and that the elements of
the nums AR are non- negative
integers okay also the above
implementation will return the possible
subset that can be formed by the array
to fulfill the given condition and not
pull in true and false but that's what
we want exactly right uh still okay let
us this approach is in Python so let's
copy this and see this code can run or
not I can clearly see that again it
needs to pass self uh
parameter indentation
give it a heads up
or I have mentioned what I want
specifically uh sure here is an example
of how you can pass the self parameter
so now the current solution will pass
self
okay generate there wasn't it okay
in and it has generated a new code uh
considering the criteria I just
mentioned that I need self parameter to
be passed through the function can
parip so I have copied it and let's
quickly paste it over
here uh you know pass all the cases and
not wait uh we need to remove
this okay it's done now quickly just run
this
program okay so here is
uh error attribute error solution object
has no attribute okay so let me copy it
and paste it over here and see what chat
GB has to say about this error
okay the error message solution object
has no
attribute uh split array same average
suggest that there is no method named
with this in the solution class so it is
likely that the test case is trying to
call this method but it does not exist
in your implementation anyway that I
have not mentioned this method this was
given by chart gity itself so again we
can see the condition that it is
contradicting its own so again it has
generated new response and if says that
it should resolve the issue and the test
case should be able to call this
particular method
correctly so that is something for us to
decide now let us copy this code and see
that now is it able to run or not and
pass all the test cases or
not and click on right
okay now the new generated response does
works for this particular question and
the runtime is 12 Ms and it does passes
the first two cases mentioned so let us
quickly submit this code and see if the
code is perfectly you know fine to deal
with all the test cases actually fed by
lead code
okay now again we can see one more
situation that this code is not able to
pass all the test cases even though we
mentioned all the specifications
constraints and we were pretty precise
about the questions and parameters that
we want our code to be done in certain
form but still it is just able to pass
68 test cases out of 111 which is almost
50 to 60 % of uh total amount of test
cases so let's move on to the next
question that is find substring with
given hash value so let me quickly
search for this
question find
substring with
hash value again it's it's a question
from hard category and the success rate
is
22.2% so let's have a look at the
question what it demands so here the
hash of a zero indexed string of length
K given integers P and M is computed
using the following functions now hash
with parameters
SPM uh this is the logic given how we
want our output to be demonstrated in
certain value or how the hash can be
generated the particular formula uh how
you can get the hash value of your you
know uh
string so the question is you are given
a string and the
integers uh and you have to return the
first substring of that string of length
uh given to you here it's K the test
cases will be generated such that an
answer always exists we are going to
copy the scores and mention all the
specifications mentioned here in their
chart GPD console so that it gets all
the
specifications copy the code and
so I have copied the code and paste it
over here now let's check for
indentation it's fine let's remove class
my
class and
again it faces a type error so let's
move on to the next question again we
saw that CH was not able to solve this
particular question coming back to our
list the next question in the list that
we are going to cover is partition array
into two Aries to minimize some
difference let's quickly search for that
question
aray
to two
arrays again this question is from heart
category and the success rate is even
more low so let's have a look at the
question first it's partition array into
two arrays to minimize some difference
that is generated as the
output or we can see that there are
three constraints so now quickly copy
this question and see if it is able to
solve this question or not first we have
to create a new
chat
copy all the constraint
means let's see what chity has to say
for this particular
question let's ask it to generate a code
this time it has only generated a logic
not exactly Logic the approach they they
are going to follow or anyone can follow
to solve this question
me ask if it can generate a
code it's definitely taking longer time
to generate this code okay here is the
code which is possible python
implementation and
uh okay the code is generated and and uh
it's mentioning that the codee takes in
an input an array of integer called nums
so basically uh it's explaining that
what it actually it's doing which is
pretty much explained in the question
itself that what exactly it needs to
function like and what will be the
variables and what will be the inputs
and how it needs to be segregated to uh
obtain our Optimum
result
so let's copy this
and paste it over here again like I said
we can see that it's generating you know
uh again we could see
that pass self
parameter
okay and the
attribute error let's quickly copy
it paste it over
here see what CH GPD has to say about it
okay that you have seen that after
placing the error it's giving that error
message you're seeing suggest that
there's a problem with the function name
in your code so the error message is
indicating that there is no function
called minimum difference within the
solution uh also I have seen that apart
from the function name it doesn't have a
self parameter so let me just write it
down
self
argument
in apps wa let me copy that will be
better and write
a new code with
it let me see if it can generate a new
code this time
so yeah it has a GRE sure there is an
example and here's the
code I have copied
this
and pasted
over see any such huge difference in the
syntax or the logic of the code but yeah
we can definitely think of running now
let's run this code
me copy it and paste it over here again
an error has prompted out I don't know
how uh
valid code we'll get after projecting
this error over here in Char
GPD so yeah definitely considering the
error message you are seeing is
indicated that the function is returning
INF which is not a valid value for the
expected return type
integer so in the base case where I and
J are both zero the value of is set to
float which is positively Infinity
however the expected output is an
integer so this valid this value is not
valid so again considering this change
the CH GB is giving a new code so let us
see how valid this new code
is okay I can see that it has changed
logic over here instead of float INF it
has changed it has uh written a new
syntax a new logic over there now and
also charity gu guarantees that this may
solve the issue of returning INF as the
value let's see how accurate Char GPT
here
is
now we have pasted the
logic uh yeah
as oh sorry I need to remove these two
lines okay now let's quickly run this
program okay so now as you can see it
could only pass one test case but not
the first two so there's no point of
submitting this code as we can see that
the logic for this code or this code as
a whole is
not well moving on next in the list we
have
is longest common subpath now let's see
longest
common
subpath so this question also comes from
category of hard questions and the
success rate is 27% now let's see what
this question demands actually now let's
quickly copy this question with all the
constraints and whatever apart from
example is left on the screen we need to
copy it as you can see over here you
cannot just miss out on any
specifications talking about the
constraints
copy and paste now enter
giving the approach to solve this
question which is dynamic programming
approach okay we didn't got any code
over here so let's
try that if it can present a
code I have asked to write a code for
this and yes CH GP has definitely agree
to provide me a code for it uh Char is
done with its explanations I'll type it
out and wait for the new code which will
contain self as a parameter that it's
this code is pretty similar to the
previous one it's just that it's using
the self argument the function as it was
mentioned by me so let's quickly copy
this code
paste it over here check for the
indentation run this
code I should be any okay I spoke too
fast here we have another error let's
see what charp has to say about this
the list index out of range error is
likely occurring on line 10 because the
indices I and J are being properly
bounced checked before being used to
access elements in the path and dprs
okay so we have found a new code let's
quickly copy this code and see if this
code is capable of you
know eliminating the errors we probably
found
C copy and
paste let me check for the
ination done and
run then we got a error over here even
though after providing so many
specifications and criterias and errors
and condition s yet chat gbd is not able
to provide a perfect solution for the
code uh moving on to the last question
of our list that is going to be uh sum
of total strength of wizards hopefully
this question does some magic for CH GPT
and prove itself lucky for CH GPT graph
for this video because for now we can
see it's a 50/50 scene uh half of the
question chat G was able to provide
Solutions with and half of the questions
chat GP couldn't actually figure out
what uh needs to be done even the logic
and approach was correct still the
implementation of the code was not
correct so let me search for
this question sum of
total strength of wizards again a hard
category question so let let's have a
look at the question
first let's quickly copy this
question uh create a new
Chat Place it over
here and uh look for constraints now
that we have copied it paste it and
enter the giving an approach how you can
actually uh think of a solution for this
particular question charge has not
generated any code uh let me ask for
it
okay so here's an example again they
have implemented the code in Python now
it is also giving a note that the
approach is valid only if you're allowed
to modify the original array
and also we are not working on down
over menion and then write this code so
let's see if it can do it with self
argument okay so yeah there's an example
it's generating the code okay so let's
see what's the update with the
code okay
this
are let's
add
solution and run the code
so there's a runtime error let me see
why this
error and paste it over
here what charity have to say the error
message solution object has no attribute
mod so justest that there is a class
name solution and the code is trying to
access an attribute named mod on an
instance of that class but the attribute
doesn't exist we probably uh need to
make more specifications and if it still
doesn't works then it clearly classifies
that charity doesn't takes every point
or classification uh you know in
consideration uh which
ultimately uh you know reflects on the
solution
new code is here let me quickly paste
it
okay let's try running this code let's
see if this
works try running it
again again it has a runtime error I was
unable to solve one more question now
that we have tried and tested a huge
spectrum of questions from De code on
chat GPT we can conclude that though
chat gbd is an amazing tool with the
bright future it still has its own
limitations and maybe it is not ready to
replace humans or compete with human
brains these questions were picked from
a list of frequently asked questions for
interviews and examinations chat GPT
does have a potential to generate Logics
and approaches for the code in an
effective manner but still its ability
to analyze the question is weak as
compared to humans as we know these
questions are there the success rate
that shows that a proper solution to
exist for these questions but still even
after multiple attempts Chad GPD was not
able to find the correct answer but we
can also give chat GP the benefit of
doubt that it's still it's in in its
initial phase and still there are a lot
of aspects that need to be worked on so
probably in future CH GP can take an
upper hand over this but for now CH GPD
needs to do a lot of work for these
situations let's start with our
project and for that first we'll create
a folder
in Python
projects and name it
as
telegram Port using chat
jbd okay and inside this we'll open the
Comm prompt and open our ID that is I
would be using the VIS Studio code and
you can use any ID that you have hands
on and
now we will go back to our chat jpd and
we'll start here but before that uh
let's talk about telegram board so a
telegram Bo is a program that interacts
with users VI the telegram messaging app
uh the prerequisite is you should have a
telegram account and Boards can be used
for a wide range of purposes such as
customer support news delivery and even
games and chj so chj is a large language
model trained by openi that is based on
gbt 3.5 architecture and J gbt is
capable of generating humanik response
to text based inputs making it a great
tool for building chat
boards and now if we talk about
prerequisites you should have a telegram
account python install on your system
and we need a python telegram board
Library
that I will show you what to install and
that chat J will tell us like what to
install so we'll just ask chat
jpt to
create telegram
boort
using
python okay so it says error we'll just
refresh the
page and ask again create Telegram
[Music]
board using python okay we see
what he States so create a telegram
board you need a
telegram what talking to the board
father yeah we have to go to the board
father I will show you guys how to do
that install the required libraries next
you need to install
okay and write this
code
okay so in this
script they have started with the start
function
so it will just says
hello when it would be
started
okay so we'll add some more
functionalities
and we will ask uh where to find the
your API token here so I know like we
have to go to the board father but we
will ask chity
also where can we
find
the
toen so it states that to get to
telegram about AP token you need to
create a new Bo by talking to the board
father on telegram open telegram and
search for board father okay and send
the board father message that is/ newb
and the board father will ask you for
the name of the board and it will ask
you about the user name and the fifth is
the boat father will then generate a
token for your boat this token is a
string of characters that uniquely
identifies your boat on telegram so keep
this token secure and I will also blur
it so you guys won't be able to to see
it
okay so moving to our
telegram we'll just search board father
here and you can see this is the board
father and we'll just click on
start and they asked the J asked us to
right SL new board we'll just click on
this and we'll
get so write a new board how are going
to call it please choose a name for the
board so
right simply
learncore
new B
okay good let's choose an
username so
[Music]
simply learn
1
onecore
Port and it states that that your
username should end in boat so we have
to end it with boat and you could see
the token here and here you can just
access your
board
so we'll get back to our ID and create a
new file and I will name it as new. py
only or you can name it as board. P or
anything you want we'll get back to
our uh jity but before that first we
need to install the library for that you
can go to the command prompt or you
could use the terminal of your
ID that
is uh in Visual Studio code you you
could use the terminal to install the
libraries you could see that the
requirement is already satisfied as this
library is already installed on the
system so moving back library is
installed and now we'll copy this
code and paste it
here and we will just change the
token we'll go back to board
further we'll copy this to
token come
back and paste it
here
okay now we will run this and see
whether our board is working or
not so it has successfully executed
we'll get back to our board father and
just click on simply learn one one board
so we click on
start and see it says hello I'm your
board so it's working fine so if we
write
hello it won't respond as there are no
functionalities so we will ask jity to
add
functionalities please add some
more
functionalities and
respon to the
port let's
see so sure here's an example of how you
can add some more
functionality so there what updat
dispatcher okay
Define the help command
Handler
Okay so
chat JP has defined three functions that
is Eco and what does eco do it will just
give you the same thing what you give to
the board or what you write to the board
caps that he has also declared a help
function and in which you can see like
what functionalities does the board have
and the Caps will do it will convert the
message to all caps Eco uh EO the
message back to you it will give you the
same message SL start it will start the
board and/ help to get
help and
now unknown uh if there's something you
ask out of these things it will just say
sorry okay I will let you guys
understand this code also but first
we'll see whether it's working or
not so with that we have pasted it here
we'll paste our API token
again so I pasted it here now uh first
we will close this terminal and get a
new terminal and then run the
program we'll get back to the board F
and this is our board so we'll just
write
slash
start and it says hello I have your
board
now we'll
say hi to the B
so okay it's not
responding okay we just close the
terminal and we have pasted
the keys also
okay run it
again now we'll see whether it's working
or
not
start I
so the code is not
working just see the code
again okay uh here we don't have any
response to I or lello so what we'll do
we'll use the help and to call the help
what we have slel so these are the
commands for what it will
respond so we'll use slash
help okay now you can see that SL start
to start the board that we have done
help and
E EO the message back to you so we'll
write I don't write back so we'll write
slash equo
High then he has given us the output
that is high so we can write slash
EO how are
you so it has given you back and same we
have slash caps so we'll write slash
caps and we'll write something in small
caps that would
be greatly built
okay now you can see it has returned in
caps so you can add some more
functionality to it and before that I
will get you guys understood the
code so now we'll see what does this
code do so so first we have imported the
necessary modules that is the classes
from the python telegram board library
that we need to create our vard so
telegram contains the main board class
while updator command Handler message
Handler and filters are classes that we
use to handle incoming updates and
messages from
telegram okay now these are like uh we
have created an instance of the board
class that is using our telegram board
API token as well as an updator instance
that will continuously fetch new updates
from Telegram and pass them to the
appropriate handlers and we have use
context equal to true that tells the
updator to use the new context based API
introduced in version 12 of the Python
telegram board library and we also used
a dispatcher object that will handle
incoming
updates after that we have created a
start function and passed update and
context so so we have Define a function
that will handle the start
command and the update parameter
contains information about the incoming
update from telegram while the context
parameter contains some useful methods
and objects that we can use to interact
with the telegram API in this case we
have used uh context. port. send do
sendor message to send a message to the
chat with the ID specified by update.
effective chat. ID
and after that we have created a help
function so we use a multi-line string
to define the help message which
contains a list of available commands
and then we have used the context.
board. sendor message to send the help
message to the
chat and after that we have the Eco
function so we use context. arguments to
get the message sent by the user
after the/ EO command so to use this we
have to use the SL EO and after that we
have to write the message and then use
join to join the message back together
to a single string we then uh we have
used the context. board do sendor
message to send the message back to the
chat then we have caps so this function
defines that will handle the Caps
command and we have again used the
context to arguments to get the message
sent by the user after the slash gaps
command and then the we have used the
upper function to convert the message to
all caps and then we have used the
context dobard do sendor message to send
the message back to the chat then we
have unknown
function that is this function defines
that will handle any command that the
board doesn't recognize so we have used
context to Port do send so it will just
say
sorry okay so these are the start
Handler help Handler Eco Handler and GS
Handler so these are the
commands and we have the we have added
the ADD handl and to start the bo we
have used update do startor
ping so this is how we have created the
port with the help of python and
chity
so we are done with the project you can
add more more functionalities also to
the board you can just ask J JB to get
more functionalities to play music in
the telegram board or you could just ask
him how to send messages to a particular
user by the board only and you could
also send media files ask the media
files from the board and you can train a
fully board by the help of J jpd and
this is called Chad JP scripting so with
the help of chat JP you can just ask him
and he will guide you with all the code
and processes you just have to like make
them in a sequence and use them to full
of your
use so for that first we'll open the
command
prompt and run the file main for that we
write the command go run main. go so so
this is the file that is written in the
go language and we going to run with the
command go run main. go for that you
need to have colang installed on your
system so I will guide you with all the
process but currently we seeing the demo
so here this command will generate a QR
code that will scan with the device
which we want to integrate the chat GPD
on so we'll wait for the file to get
executed and after this
we will execute the server.py file and
that will open the chat JP on the
Firefox browser you can also use other
browsers that is chromium and other if
you want but we'll use Firefox to skip
the onstep verification that chat J ask
us whether if we are a b or a human so
we will run the file again as there was
some
error so this time yeah it run perfectly
now we'll take the device and open
WhatsApp on it in which we want to
integrate the chat jpd so I'm using one
device to just capture this QR
code so this is the device and you can
see that my device has captured this QR
code and you can see here that WhatsApp
me
me it has been activated
so now we'll run another file that is
server.py file and that is the python
file for that we'll open the command
prompt again and that would be another
command prompt and to run that file
we'll write the command Python server.py
and you can
see in the Firefox browser chat jpt has
opened and I have logged in already so
it didn't it didn't ask me to log in
again now we'll take another device and
will message on the mobile device which
has been integrated with the CH
jity so from this device I will write
hi and you can see on the screen that
chat JY replies hello how can I assist
you today and the same you could see on
the WhatsApp chat so today we will ask
CH JP what is the capital
of India so you can see that the chat J
is typing the capital of India is New
Delhi and it has been responded to our
mobile device so this is
how we can integrate chat JP on a
WhatsApp and this would be the simple
tutorial in this you don't need to code
any
uh this there would be another tutorial
if you know what's behind the code or
what behinds the integration part so you
could watch that video and know how we
have integrated but in this tutorial I
will guide you with how to download the
files and how to run the files and how
you can integrate chity on your device
to start integrating CH jpd on our
device so for that first you have to
download this Repository
and it contains some files and I will
upload some more files here you just
have to download it download the zip
file and after downloading
it you just need to extract it in a
folder
so we'll extract in C drive in Python
projects mainly we create the folder
here only so here we'll create a
folder okay integrate CH WhatsApp mean
or yeah right
integrate chat GPD that's it so inside
this folder we'll extract the files and
and I think it's been done so we'll just
visit C drive uh python projects and
inside it we have integrate chity and we
have these two files so to run these two
files what you need is you need python
install leer system and goang install
leer system so I hope you guys know how
to install Python and goink if you don't
I will just give you a quick tutorial
so to download the python you just need
to visit the python.org website and move
to the download section and you will see
the download the latest version for
Windows you just need to click that and
the download will start for you the
package has been downloaded so I will
provide you the link on how to download
the python in the description box and
also the link for the GitHub repository
so you don't have to search it anywhere
also you can search it on the browser
just write integrate CH in WhatsApp and
abisara you will get the GitHub link and
just write GitHub also in the search bar
you will just redirect it to this and
now you have downloaded the python so
just open the exe
file and start with the installation so
you can choose at python EXA to path you
can choose
that
and customize
installation and just click on the
python test suit and the next you can
add the python to environment variables
so you have to take both these options
and then you will click on the install
as I have already installed it so I
won't need to install it again you just
need to click on the install button and
here you will get the python installed
okay and the other thing you need is
goang go language so to download it you
have to go sorry you have to go to its
official website and go to the download
section and here you will see the
Microsoft Windows as I'm working on the
Windows operating system so I will
download for the windows I've already
downloaded and installed it so you guys
can download it and I will show you like
this is simp simple how to install
goling you don't need to add anything so
it's been
downloaded where to guide to the
installation okay so we are just waiting
for the setup to be initialized so that
we can install
it now you can see the next button is
available just click on that and a
previous version of go programming is
currently installed yes you can see that
it's already installed so you don't need
to do anything in installing the go
language just click on install and it
would be installed for you so I won't be
installing it again as I already
installed on my device so moving on now
what we'll do first we'll run the
server. py file so for that we will go
to the folder where we have extracted
our files
and here we will open the command prompt
and run the file server.py so to run a
python file we have to write the command
Python and then the name of the file
that is server and its extension that is
py so we have initiated
that okay uh Firefox is already running
as we have
not closed what we have opened for the
demo
I think
uh this an error I
will
again run the command prompt I will just
close the previous command
prompts yeah I have close them now I
will open the new one and you should
open the command prompt the new command
prompt after installing the Python and
the code language I will also assist you
in installing the GCC compiler because
you would be needing that for go
language so first
will run the server
file so you could see that by running
the python server.py file you could see
that the chat jpd has opened up in the
Firefox browser so I will show you the
code what we need for that you need to
to install the flask system OS modules
playright
module and here in the 16th line you
could see that we have used Firefox you
could use chromium for Chrome but the
cas is you need to do the one step
verification that is the capture thing
for like initializing the CH jpd but we
don't need that so we are using the
Firefox so you should have Firefox on
your system now what I want you to do is
just install these modules as if you if
these modules would not be installed on
your system it would show an error it
would give you an error in the command
prompt only as I've already installed
them so it's not giving me any
error so I will tell you the commands to
install
them so to install flask you can just
write
pypi space flask in any browser and it
will direct to the
website so you could open the first link
that would be pypi dog and this is the
command pip install flask so you can
just copy that and open your command
prom first we'll create it contrl
C
and now you could see that we are in the
folder integrate CH JD and here you
could paste this command and press
enter it's states that that the
requirement is already satisfied as I
have already installed these modules and
the other module you need is play right
so just copy the command go to your
command prompt and paste this
command and press enter it will be
installed for you and another module you
need is virtual environment so just copy
this and paste in your command prompt
and another module you need
is the OS module
OS sys system uh and we'll open the
pypi that is the official website the
PIP command website and you just copy
the command go to your command prompt
paste the command and press enter and
this module would also been installed
for you guys and now you have installed
the go language the Python language and
the modules you need to run the
server.py file now what you need to do
is run the go file but before running
the goang file what you need is GCC
compiler so to download it I will
provide you the link for the GCC or you
could just see here I'll provide you the
link in the description box below you
could just click on that you would be
DED to this page just click on this
release that was 24th May and what you
need to download is this 64 plus
32bit just download it and as it gets
downloaded just open
it and click on the create
button and after that the second option
then next and the directory you want to
install in as I already installed
this I will choose
the C directory
only in
C I
would install in Python projects
okay okay didn't took the
folder in
see sorry canel
it in Python projects and in the same
folder that was integrate CH
jbd okay so I'll click on
next no time want to install it yes I
want to install here and when you click
on install it would get installed for
you guys I've already installed
it and the process started so it will
get installed again so now what you have
to do is you have got the all the
requirements to integrate the chat JD on
WhatsApp that is all the modules for the
server.py file and the main.go file for
that you have installed the go language
and the GCC compiler so you could run
both the files and for
that we will close the command prompts
and open the new command
prompts and this this is
a folder so we will open one command
prom here
sorry and we have to open different
command prompts for both the files for
the uh goang file and the python file
okay so we will open the command prompt
here
and now to run the goink file we need to
write the command go space run space the
name of the file and extension that is
main. go and we have executed the file
and this file will provide us with a QR
code and we'll scan this QR code from
our first device in which we want to
integrate the chat jpd and before that
we will run our another file that is
server. pyi and for that we'll open
another command
prompt and and to run this
command to run this file we'll write the
command python space the name of the
file that is server and the extension
py so we'll see whether a QR code is
generated or
not and I can
see that it's been linked
to the previous device as we have done
in the demo so we haven't logged it out
so I will check with the device
yeah it's been active so I will just log
out from that
device and run it
again or I will open another command
prompt to run the goang file
again so to run
it we'll open the command prompt and
write the command CMD for that and here
we'll write the command to run the go
file and we have done
that and if we see the server. py
file yeah it has been perfectly executed
but we not able
to yeah our chity is running fine now
what we have to do
is use our first device to scan this QR
code so that CH JT gets linked to our
first device and then we'll use another
device to chat with the chat
jbd so now we have opened our first
device and open the WhatsApp and click
on the link
devices and
here we will scan this QR
code and you can see that it's logging
in now it's logged
in and now from the another
device will'll ask a query to chge aity
and then we will ask Chad jity to write
a code to add two
integers and that to
python so we just misspelled python but
we hope that our J jity understood that
so here we can see that the J J Code the
command and it
has ROM good example show here's an
example code to add two integers in
Python so you can see that CH jity has
been integrated and we'll
see its response yeah we got the
response and now we'll ask another
question and that would
be what is the currency of United States
let's see what it responds the gr of
United States is the United States
dollar it is the most commonly used
currency in international transaction
and is the World primary Reserve
currency so we can see that tet writes
all the lines what L say it's been
executed on the browser and after it
completes or it stops generating the
answer it sends it to the WhatsApp
chat so here we are done with a
project now you guys have understood how
to integrate chat jpd with WhatsApp and
what you have done is we have downloaded
the repository and we have to extract
all the files that are present in the
repository I will update all the files
you just have to extract them into a
folder and then run the main go file and
the server.py file and before executing
these files you need to have goang and
python installed on your system and for
the python you need some modules that we
have seen that is the playright module
the flask module the OS system module
and the virtual environment module so we
have seen how to install them and when
you will just execute the file on the
command prompt you would get errors if
these files or modules are not installed
on your system and for goang we have
installed the GCC compile and after
installing all these requirements then
you have to just run both the files and
when you run the goang file you will get
the QR code just scan it with your
device on which you want to integrate
that jpd and after that from any device
you can just message on that number on
which you have integrated the chat jpt
and the J jpt would answer all your
queries we are going to automate
WhatsApp using python by pyot kit
library and and with the help of Chad JD
and before starting I have a quiz
question for you
guys and your question is how much did
meta that is formerly Facebook spend to
acquire WhatsApp in 2014 and your
options are your first option is do $10
million second option is $19 million
third option is $20 billion and the
fourth option is $21 billion please
answer in the comment section below and
we'll update the correct answer in the
pin comment you can pause the video give
it a thought and answer in the comment
section so moving
on now we'll move to create a
project so first we will create a folder
for a
project and for that we will create a
folder in Python projects
and we name it as automate
WhatsApp using chat
jbd okay and inside this we'll open the
command prompt
and open our
ID that is we want to automate the
WhatsApp using Python and with the help
of chity we won't write the code on our
own we will ask chat jbd to automate
it we will create the file and name it
as
main.py and now we'll move to chat
jpd and ask chat jity to write a code to
send message messages through WhatsApp
using Python and the pivot kit
Library so we will give a command send
message through WhatsApp
using Python
and pivot
kit let's see what chat JP responds to
us and we have also created the automate
WhatsApp using python video I will just
link it in the I button you can check
that out and we'll see what chat jpd
tells us
okay country code
message minutes yeah it could
work and first you need to install the
pivot kit Library
by Running P inst private kit in
terminal or command prompt okay replace
Target phone number with the Target
phone number you want to send the
message to country code with the country
code of the Target phone number message
with the message you want to send r with
the r in 24hour format and you want to
send message and minute with the minute
you want to send the message okay for
example yeah
okay go it so we'll copy this
code
and paste
in our ID but before that first you need
to install the pivot kit library and for
that you can go to the command prompt
and write the
command
pip space install
space pivote kit and press
enter it states that the requirement is
already satisfied as I already installed
this module and you can install it by
writing the simple command and you'll
get it installed and if you face any
error installing it just comment down
and we would be very happy to resolve
your
queries okay
so as Jad jbd States we'll just ENT
enter
the things it want from us so it's
asking the Target phone number and the
country code without plus
sign
okay so here we'll
just WR all the things but uh as you can
see it has also given us an example
to
see and work on the code so
here we'll just clear
it I will write the phone number to whom
I want to send the
message so it would
be and I would just blur this number so
you guys won't be able to see okay and
here will'll just add the country
code and that is without plus
sign
okay so my country code
is you can search it that is I live in
India and the message I want to send to
him
is hello
how are
you and
now we'll set
the hour and minute so the current time
is
1514 so we'll
set 16
okay we'll save this
and run
it so it says that the country code
is
missing so we'll
just copy the error and give it to chat
jbd as we are taking the help of chat
jbd in this video
so he has given us the code so we'll
just provide the error to him let's see
what it states if it's not able to
resolve this then we will resolve
it country code the phone number you're
trying to send
okay yes and the country code is 912
send the message correctly you need to
make
sure
okay 1 2 three 4 5 6 7
8 yeah
mention in the person the provided phone
number is this and the country code is
91
okay you need to make sure that country
code is prefixed to the phone number
like
this 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 okay
uh okay we don't have to make it a Str
yeah
now we'll run it
again okay it's a string only
so I will write the phone number
again
this
3 okay now we'll see
and what I will
do I will write the country code here
we'll save this and the time is 1517 now
so we'll just turn it to
158 save this and run
it so our code has been executed
successfully that is 20 second WhatsApp
will open and after 15 seconds message
will be delivered so we just have to see
that we have enter the time as 1518 is
the seconds available
for the code to get executed yeah it has
open the
WhatsApp it will take time as my
WhatsApp has loads of chats and
contacts yeah I have to scan it
don't
think it would be able as we have
reached the
1518 yeah have scanned
it let's see if it will deliver the
message or not else we have to change
the time
so we just have to wait for 15
seconds let's see
okay just stop the
terminal and run it
again
4521 so we will save this and run it
again so it states that in 85 seconds
Whata will open and after 15 seconds
message will be
delivered so we'll get fast forwarded
here so we are still
waiting let's see when it will open the
WhatsApp
okay it states that the phone number
shared by URL is
invalid okay I'll just check the phone
number again
[Music]
okay I entered the wrong phone
number sorry
guys so I will just update the time
again and it would be
15:22 we'll make it fast we'll run this
okay it say that the call time must be
greater than so we WR 1523 save
it we will make the time is
15:27 save it and run
it okay it stes that in 40 seconds
WhatsApp will open and after 15 seconds

what that product is so you can use the
ebook in many ways so in this video
Let's understand how to create ebook for
that let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
at gbt so now here we will be writing a
prompt to write the content of ebook now
it's up to you on which content you want
to write it it can be in your domain
also and it can be something in which
you have the interest you have the
passion and you're good at it for
example let's say somebody's good at the
knowledge regarding cars or regarding
bikes or regarding anything he must he
or she must have the value to provide to
the audiences that content he should
write the ebook on for example so let's
take an example like I'm writing an
ebook on how to make money online right
so what should I'll write so I'll start
with writing the prompt just a second
there we
go write
an ebook
for
titled how to make money online
featuring the AI
generated
images for each
chapter this
ebook will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
that
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there titled how to
make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed chity to create eight
pages divided into six chapters each
chapter will be explained in humanlike
Manner and long paragraphs it should be
long paragraphs also use AI generated
images in between the chapter for the
better explanation so let's see what the
result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely
blogging and content creation online
service and market research selling
products online affiliate marketing
online tutoring and courses so six
chapters are there all right so Chad GPT
has given us all the chapters that we
have asked chat GPT for now we wanted
the images also like AI generated images
also so let's write a prompt for it as
we are not able to see the
images so I'm writing where are the a
generated images that I asked
for I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us chapter
wise images all right so it is giving us
chapter wise images here is the air
generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters so all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
are a generated images that we asked for
and now we can use each of these images
in between the ebooks selling products
online affiliate products and online
tutoring and courses the images what I
think the images is pretty well that I
expected now you rebook how to make
online includes a images for each
chapter all right so what we asked for
chat gbt it gave us sometimes it happens
that what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now now the
thing is we want all these images to be
inside this one in this doc not this doc
but this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include it in between can you include
these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to me
let's see if it can do that otherwise we
can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use this also this only
will
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write
compile the
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document file
all
right I think chat gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another promt let's just stop
it and just copy paste this one and
we'll be adding another prompt so that
we can tell chat gbt that use this
format instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into into a specified format like
we can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see chgb has
given the answer I have compiled the
document with converted JP Fage properly
integrated you can download the ebook
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that Chad
GPD has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own Chad gyt helped us in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is is how to
make money online so now we can also
make the changes in between the profit
of writing the document in Word is that
only we can always convert this document
into PDF by going to various sites but
let's just create first in the document
file so that you can also do editing and
changes and if you want to add something
then also you can easily do that so
that's why we have created into the
document format so as we can see
freelancing then there is the image as
we can see we can also resign it all
right as you can see we have resized it
so this way you can also edit it and
whatever you like I mean it's up to you
it's it's very subjective to people what
they want to do for their ebook so it's
up to them if they want to add something
in more detail or they can also Showcase
with the help of an example then they
can definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well and another thing is let's say uh I
want to change it a bit like let's say
online service and market research is
there then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what will I do is
we'll simply copy paste it or you can
use from chat GPT also we have copied it
and now we'll go to chat GPT all right
now I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand
it now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want CH to more explain explain
it in an elaborated way so here it is
blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that CH gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simply copy it let's say I've copied it
now I'll go back to the dock this is the
dock and I'm just showing the example
right I'll just paste it now let's see
all right online
service and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added and
basically we got the format basically
all these things are done so we don't
need to worry about that even we want to
make any changes it is very easy to do
that as we have just saw now the next
thing that we want to focus on is the
mockup or the cover photo or the mockup
photos for that basically we want to
Market this digital product this ebook
we want to Market it so what we'll do is
we'll have to create a cover or mockup
so there are many ways to do that and as
we told you that we will be creating
this free of cost how to do all these
thing in free so we'll go to canva all
right now we'll write a prompt uh what
prompt should we write which write
create a AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster
image for ebook that I can use as a
cover for it
all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give
me the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over
here create few
more only create image and not the
background is creating some more images
let's wait for those
give me the inside
image for the
last
photo so basically you have to
manipulate chat to give you the exact
thing that you are asking for so for
that you have to write multiple times
The Prompt sometime it happens so it's
pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert
this by mistake I wrote something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the
image sorry this is the
image and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or something
let's see if something is there code
interpreter session expired I believe
we'll have to create another one
so let's say we want to download this
we'll have to make sure it is in the JP
format so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one and let's see save mockup
so this is how you can create a mockup
for your digital product your digital
ebook and then you can easily download
it so once you have downloaded it you
can put it into use now the next thing
is how you can Market it that is the
next challenge for that you have to go
to the free websites that can that lets
you to upload all the your ebooks and
sell it there are many websites some are
paid and some are free also but before
moving there let me tell you guys the
version of chat gbt that I'm using is
chat gbd4 you can also do the same thing
with chat gbt 3.5 also but it doesn't
give you the feature of downloading all
these images or whatsoever you want so
for that you don't have to worry all you
have to go is to go on
canva and you click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you'll do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatsoever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as chat
gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy all these the
all the content that we uh previously
done and just paste it over here and you
can also add page or something like that
so it is very easy you can you know edit
this so it'll be easy for you and then
you can download it so you don't have to
worry if you don't have the paid version
of chat gbt you can easily do that in
with the help of canva so you don't have
to worry about that now coming to the
part where we were explaining how to
Market it how to sell it and where to
sell it basically so for that we'll go
to a site instam Mojo So it allows you
to you know create your own digital
product and sell it free of cost so for
that we'll log in it's pretty simple and
so once we have logged in so we have to
fill up the details so basic detailed it
is very easy you can easily fill up the
details as it is showing payment
collection is not enabled on your
account so I'm showing you the demo of
it so that's why I've not done that but
it is very easy and it's free of C so it
is very easy for you guys as well so
once you have done the sign up and all
as you can see shortcuts add a product
digital file even ticket manage store
categories there are many things not
only ebooks you can Market over here
there are many things you can do right
so so for that what we'll do is we'll go
to add a product digital file so our
digital product is our ebook for that we
have created a mockup that we have
downloaded it from canva this one so now
we have the this option of adding a
product so you can see I'm a coffee like
this you can do you can set the price
and you can put in the account details
so people who are interested in can
easily buy the product from you so it is
very easy and and it is also showing
physical product digital file even
tickets others so as we know in digital
file it is showing ebooks digital art
software or any file that can be
downloadable we'll click on this and
then you can easily upload the file so
once we have uploaded then we can here
add the image product image that is the
our mockup that we have
curated all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
so product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional and limit the number of
downloads per buyer so you can easily do
all these things it is very easy you
don't have to worry about that and all
these features are there then in the end
you can just Market it so using chat gbt
you can easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of chat gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
gbt also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can't download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
download it from there and I have also
shown you how to create mockups and all
so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
and do what you want to do so guys here
we are in the GPT that is Chad GPT 4
version I I have the premium version
that is I have GPT 40 gp4 GPT 3.5 I have
the gp4 version and if I show you my
plan I have the plus
plan so here I will show you guys where
we can explore the gpds so this is the
section where we are having export gbts
we click on that here is the whole
overview here are the top piics that are
featured then if you click on writing so
these are the custom gpts so now I will
tell you what is a GPT and how do they
work so a GPT is a type of artificial
intelligence model that is designed to
generate humanlike text based on the
input ites so it uses a machine learning
technique called Transformers which
allows it to consider the context of all
words in a sentence rather than one at a
time so this makes gpds exceptionally
good at understanding and Genera coent
and contextually appropriate responses
so these are the gpts and what are
custom gpts if I tell you so these are
all the custom gpts what I told you was
GPT that is the whole GPT 4 version so
they are based on Transformers now if I
tell you about custom gpts they are
generative pre-train Transformers and
are tailored versions of the original
GPT models developed by open and these
custom models are modified to serve
specific task or Industries more
effectively such as legal assistance
medical inquiries or customer support So
by training on Specialized data sets
they can offer more precise and relevant
responses in their respective Fields so
I will show you guys how you can create
a custom GPD also so I created on the
create section I'll show you guys once
again so this is a section you just need
to click on create I will show you guys
the whole process at the last of the
video after exploring the top 10 amazing
gpds okay here you can create it and you
can here have the preview of the custom
GPT if you want to create
it okay so now if I tell you the
benefits of these gpts so they offer
several benefits one is efficiency that
is it automates repetitive task and
handle multiple queries simultaneously
so if you click on chat
GPT and if you want to have some data
analysis you have to type the prompts
again and again for that we have a
particular custom
GPT that is
data
analyst think research analysis we will
move here okay this is for research or I
will tell you guys that's consensus so
this is the custom GPT that have all the
research papers all the studies provided
in it if I tell you guys in the create
section
you could attach more and more files if
you attach files here data and other
related information it will help you
create the perfect custom GPT so you
don't have to write the prompts again
and again or automate you can automate
the repetitive task here number two
benefit what I can tell about is
scalability this assistant scaling
services without the need for
proportional increase in Human Resources
then comes the customization you can
take responses based on the specific
needs of a business or context then we
have the accessibility it improves
access to information and services by
providing another layer of interaction
so these benefits of gpts are the ones
that help you guys now we start with the
top 10 gpts that are prevailing now so
starting with number one that is cod
GPD so here is the Cod GPT you could see
here other gpts that are used for coding
purposes you could use any GPT so let's
start this or you could have another GPT
I will show you guys that is for
programming you just click on
programming and these are the top gpts
that are prevailing in the programming
world so if I click on Code Pilot so
this has been rated 4.2 2 million plus
conversations and rank number one in
programming so we click on start chat
now we are here with the custom
GPT and you don't need to download any
GPT or you don't need to install any GPT
you just have to click on the export GPT
section and you would be accessible to
all the
gpts so here we have this Code Pilot so
what does this do is this GPT assist
users in writing and debugging code and
it provides programming guidance suggest
Corrections and can help with code
optimization for a variety of
programming languages and this gbd is
useful for both noce programmers needing
help with Basics intax and for
experienced developers looking for
advanced optimization suggestions you
could see that he is suggesting some of
the prompts that he can reply to and we
will write some prompt and ask this Code
Pilot what he can
do so I will ask
him can
you write a
function in Python language and what it
should do is that should sort a list of
numbers so you could ask this GPD or you
could provide your code and if you want
to debug your code you can just provide
the code to him and he will debug for
you so you could see that it has
provided the code for sorting the
numbers so this was one of the GPD now
moving to another we'll move to explore
gbt sections one again and
we have one most popular that is canva
so canva GPD assist users in designing
and editing visual content by providing
suggestions automations and creative
ideas tailor to the users design needs
uh I don't know why it's not
showing yeah this is the one canma you
could see that it has been rated three
star 2 million plus conversations now
click on start and you could have a
generic view also
like what this GPT do uh wait a
second I'll show you guys one again so
if you click on that you could read the
description here also that is
effortlessly design anything that would
be presentations logos social media post
these are the conversation starters here
and here are the capabilities that
retries or takes actions outside of
GPT the ratings given by the
users now we'll start the chat and here
we will we could just ask him what they
are suggesting also I need a poster for
are online stores seasonal sale but they
have not specified what their store is
about or we can ask him that create a
series of Instagram post promoting an
upcoming music festival and including
vibrant colors and modern Design
Elements so we will go with their
suggestion only let's see what
day so let's create an i
catching start creative Journey with can
but we will Design together today
okay so create a
poster for medical
online store you could specify like uh I
won't be talking about the prompts here
more how you can generate the good
prompts so for generating the good
prompts you can watch our another video
that is is prompt engineering and for
that you guys have to do is you have to
write the full prompt that what you need
to be and what you need CH to do you
need to be more specific as you can see
that it has created the online poster
but it's not goodl looking or engaging
which can attract customers but it's
okay like with this prompt you can get
this you have to be prompt
specific so this was our second GPD now
moving to third coin back to explore jpd
section and we will search for Del now
so Del is very popular
nowadays think okay D was there only
it's the top most only so it's an AI
program that is capable of generating
unique images from textual descriptions
and it Blends Concepts and styles to
create high quality images based on user
inputs so we can ask him to generate an
image of a futuristic cityscape at
Sunset blending elements of cyberpunk
and Art Deco Styles you could add
anything in the prompt but you need to
create so I will ask him that generate
an image of a
futuristic city space at
Sunset you could add more things to
it be more specific and the custom gpts
will create the thing for you
so you could see that our D custom gbt
has provided the response to us so these
are the futuristic city at the sunset
you can download these images and use
them and you can give the credits to GPD
also so this was all about our third gbt
now moving to the next one and we will
see now web pilot this is also one of
the top most search and the recently
used like this browsing history that was
the recent ly
used so it has been rated 4.2 by the
users 800,000 plus conversations and
hash 4 in productivity
Global so we'll start the chat with it
and so what does this GPD do this gbt
helps users by summarizing long web
pages into concise versions highlighting
the main points and crucial information
for example we
will have some simply Lear articles
we'll provide the link
here we'll provide the link to web pilot
GPT and then we'll ask him to summarize
this article in around 100 or 200 words
okay so we have paste the link here
we'll ask him summarize the
article in
around 150 words okay so let's see you
could see here that it has started
taking the
action okay uh we made a mistake here
the link is about some story blogs it
didn't copy the article
link will copy it again and paste it
here yeah now you can see that it
has go
link now we'll ask him
again as it has summarized a story
video what I have copied earlier I
think so you could see that it has
generated the response that the article
from Simply learn outlines the role of a
risk manager and it has summarized the
article into 150 wordss so this is the
magic of web pilot GPD now coming to
number five so now moving to the fifth
GPD and we will explore it from the
writing section this is the right for
me so this is the fifth GPT on our list
so what you can do with this is you can
have a right for me a tailored engaging
content with a focus on quality
relevance and precise word count so you
could ask him we will go for
the like what they have suggested the
prompts we have going with that only so
you could see that how they're
writing and what English word words
they're using how their vocabulary so
these kind of gpts are collaborat made
to get all the content delivered with a
great understanding of vocabulary and
the content creation so with that we'll
move to our next GPT that is 6
gbt and that will be diagrams so this is
one of my favorites so this tool creates
flowcharts mind maps uml chart FL uml
workflow sequence ER database and
architecture visualization for code so
what does this do is it creates diagrams
and charts instantly from descriptions
aing in visual data presentation and
Analysis so if I ask him
that generate a flowchart
illustrating the software development
life
cycle with
stages and Key activities in each stage
so you could see that it has started
generating the response it will create
the diagram first it had all the stages
listed here and now he is telling about
the diagram syntax so it seems that
flowchart is not a supported diagram
type for rendering so is fetching syntax
that is so you guys so here is a diagram
what diagrams GPD has
created and you could view in the full
screen here
download the PNG file if you want to use
this diagram and if you want to see the
code you could see here or what theory
part they have done behind this diagram
or what they have done for creating this
diagram that is they have used the graph
here and you can edit the code also here
so this is the code written to create
this
diagram so this was all about our six
GPT now moving to the next GPT and and
that would be around the data analysis
part uh not research and Analysis but it
would be around data
analysis I would search for you guys
that would be data analyst and I've used
this GPT many times and it's one of my
favorites so what does data analyst do
is so this jpd helps analyze large sets
of data providing insights performing
statistical analysis and making
predictions based on the data provided
I'll will show you guys what it can
do so I think yeah this is the one I use
it's not showing any ratings or
something but yeah this one is good so
what we'll do is we will upload a file
so I must be having some Excel
files okay Excel data let's see what
this data
contains okay we'll open it
only can you analyze
the Excel
file and tell
me what it is
about you could draw graphs bar charts
or analyze data and got some pivot
tables with this GPT model you could see
that it has started
analyzing and I've used it many times
for generating my report
so you could see that what it has provid
is this Excel file contains two sheets
with the following content so sheet that
is data 2 it has it includes columns
such as order date customer name so
these are the things that are provided
in the sheet if you need to get the code
you could have the code here and use
this in your ID and it will
provide all the things what here GPD is
doing you can do in your ID
so if I show you guys what this file
contains as okay so this is the data so
we have two spreadsheets here one is
data one is data 2 and it has provided
columns and you can do the analysis
further so this was all about data
analyst GPD now moving to the next that
is e GPD that is consensus so this we
will use we move to education section
and here we should find that or else
we'll search it so this is one of the
most used GPD here so this is the one
that is you can ask the research chat
directly with the world's scientific
literature so it aids in academic
research by locating relevant scholarly
articles papers and studies quickly and
summarizing their
findings so what we can ask him is we
can ask him find the recent studies
on the impact
of virtual
reality and on learning
outcomes in higher
education so it is asking for the
permission so we will grant the
permission to him that is always
allow and it has all the research papers
that are available on the net and you
could see that it has started providing
the response and these are the evidence
for this and he has mentioned the
research papers or the
articles that are that have the studies
so this is about the consensus GPT now
moving to the number nine and on number
nine we have teex support advisor that
is Tex troubleshooting
we'll move to explore GPD
section and search
for tech support
advisor so this GPT provides solutions
to Common technical issues offering
stepbystep troubleshooting guidance so
we will ask him that my laptop is
running slow
uh despite no visible running
application so what steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the
issues uh
despite no running
application so what
steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the issue
so you could see that it has started
providing the response like check the
task manager check for malware free up
dis space and update your system check
starter programs so this is the perfect
Support Tech advisor as a GPD that can
help you diagnose any Tech related
problem in your laptop in your desktop
or in any device so this is the great
GPD that we have here so now number 10
on the list is legal
adviser So This legal adviser helps
draft review and interpret legal
documents offering guidance on legal
terminology and
compliance so you could update any legal
document here and ask him what this is
about and what should I do this if you
go to any court hearing or something I
hope you note but if you have any
document you can update it here or
upload it here and ask this GPD what
this is about and what I can do to
counter it so I will ask him something
so I need a or I need to draft
a lease
agreement for a residential
property okay so I will also ask him
that what closes should I
include to protect both the landlord and
the
Tenant so you would see that it has
started generating the response that
creating a comprehensive residential
lease acement is crucial and these are
the closes that you should include
number one is part is clear clearly
State the full names and contact
information property description lease
term rent security deposit utilities and
maintenance use of property occupancy
limits pets access and entry so this was
about our legal advisor GPT that was
number 10 and guys we have a loot of
gpts in the explore GPT section and you
can create your own also uh I told you
about how you can create that just go on
the export GPT section and then click on
Create and here on the left side you
have a create tab where you can use
plain language to customize your own GPT
through prompting you just have to write
the prompt here and it will do the task
for you and you also have a
configuration tab where you can provide
more information about the custom GPD
that is such as the name and description
what this GPD is about and what exactly
the GPD does and what it should not do
and when you make changes in the create
and configure tab you will see these
live updates in the preview window on
the right hand that is this and message
your GPT to accesses abilities you can
start messaging also and you can also
choose the capabilities that is web
browsing D image generation and you can
also upload the files that you want to
store data for a particular GPD you can
upload the files here
also so this is how you can create a new
GPD hello everyone welcome to this
amazing amazing video on the open AI
latest model GPT 40 whether you are
curious about its underlying technology
real world applications or future
prospects this video covers everything
you need to know about GPT 40 so let's
quickly understand what is GPT 40 GPT 40
is a big upgrade in open AI smart Tech
it's better at understanding and talking
like human than previous version it's
super good at task like answering
questions or writing stories just have a
look hey how's it going hey there it's
going great how about you I see you're
rocking an open AI hoodie nice choice
what's up with that ceiling though are
you in a cool industri style office or
something well can you take a guess at
what I might be doing based on what I'm
showing you
here from what I can see it looks like
you're in some kind of recording or
production setup with those lights
tripods and possibly mic it seems like
you might be gearing up to shoot a video
or maybe even a live stream yeah now it
can even understand pictures this makes
it even more useful hey
chbt hello there how's it going it's
going really well today I'd really like
your help solving a math problem I'm all
ears what math problem can I help you
tackle today so I'm going to write down
a linear equation on a sheet of paper
and I'll show you and then I love your
help working me through it but
importantly don't tell me the solution
just help give me hints along the
way got
it okay I see it h no I didn't show you
yet just give me help along the way one
second whoops I got too excited I'm
ready when you
are so chat PT what equation did I write
down there ah I see it now you wrote
down 3x + 1 equals 4 whether you are
using it for fun or work it's way better
now it shows that open AI is really good
at making smart stuff if we talk about
model evaluation as measured on
traditional benchmarks GPT 40 achieves
gp4 turbo level performance on the text
reasoning and coding intelligence while
setting new H marks on multilingual
audio and vision capabilities so now
let's move forward to the demo part and
now let's explore the features of chat
gbt 4 so as you can see my phone screen
is there so this is the UI of chat gp4
here you can see the model name
gp40 and gp4 GPT 3.5 so gp4 is for
premium version so as you can see here
is camera button you can upload the
files you can upload the picture you can
give the audio text give you can
chitchat with chat GPD okay so these are
some okay default prompts are there so
let's start with the this audio version
this new version okay so you have to
just click here so it will connect with
the open a server so Hi chity how are
you hi there I'm doing well thanks for
asking how about you I'm also
good that's great to hear is there
something specific you'd like to chat
about today yeah please tell me
something about
gbd4 gp4 is a language model developed
by open AI it's designed to understand
and generate humanlike text based on the
input it receives gp4 is an improvement
over previous versions with better
accuracy understanding and generation
capabilities it can be used for a wide
range of application
so chpt can you please tell me how to
become machine learning
engineer sure becoming a machine
learning engineer involves several steps
one education start with a strong
foundation in mathematics especially in
areas like statistics linear algebra and
calculus a degree in computer science
data
science so this is how you can ask jgpt
anything right so let's ask something
related to IQ let's check the
[Music]
IQ so can you please tell me which is
the most spoken language in the
world the most spoken language in the
world by number of native speakers is
Mandarin Chinese it has over a billion
native speakers however when considering
the total number of speakers including
those who speak it as a second language
English often ranks at the
top okay so CH can you please tell me
like I want to create YouTube video on
what is machine learning so can you
please help me with the content
plan sure here's a simple content plan
for your YouTube video on what is
machine learning one introduction one to
two minutes
greet your audience briefly introduce
yourself and your channel State the
topic of the video what is machine
learning two what is machine learning
two three minutes Define machine
learning in simple terms okay see this
is how you can ask rgbt anything and the
all the file all the data will come here
okay see I asked this okay SOB can you
please tell me this then the answer is
there so now let's check the another
feature which is image recognition Okay
so first what you can do you can click
the pictures right away or you can
upload your screenshot so I have I will
go to the gallery and I will upload this
one code is there at please
explain this code you can write this
okay just send this so here you can see
the code in the image is a simple Java
program I will show you the image the
prints hello world to the console here
is breakdown of each part okay so it
explained beautifully okay so let me
show you the picture so this is a simple
hello world program so you can ask chat
GPT by uploading a screenshot your
screenshot okay you can ask any doubt of
yours so now let's again upload one
image then I will upload my image and
add
describe this picture or you can make
even stories okay describe this picture
and make short story in 100 words there
is the current photo as you can see in a
modern studio John prepared to shoot his
latest YouTube tutorial on machine
learning wow with a green screen behind
him professional lightning Illuminating
the room he sat at his desk left on open
and notes ready okay and if you will see
the picture right so you can ask
anything to chat GPT by uploading your
screenshot on a particular image what if
I want to click one present picture okay
so what I can do I can open this camera
part and I can do this
okay so
next describe
this
upload this image shows the screen of a
d laptop displaying an award from the
worst number one online boot cam simply
learn
see so this is how you can upload your
picture or even you can talk to chat GP
on video call like you do with your
friends or your family okay so this is
not published as this version but it
will come soon okay and even the time is
displayed wow okay so what if I want
like you can
write Google
logo image okay now it will create an
image see doing research with Bing
searching Google logo image will search
and it will create one image I guess it
should it's charity it can do
anything
okay okay I want
image I want
image I want logo
image or I can write create image for me
okay give something something okay let
me write create Google
logo
image now I think it will make okay see
as you can see on the screen creating
image right so it will I hope it will
create not sure okay done show me the
image see Google image not exact but
somewhat right okay so this is one and
what you can do you can there is one
more feature multilingual so again we
should connect
connect so how can I say how are you in
Spanish in Spanish you can say how are
you as if you're addressing someone
informally for a more formal
context okay how can tell my name in
French to someone
to tell someone your name in French you
can say Jamel your name for example if
your name is John you would say jel
John wow amazing right so this is how
you can learn any language you want to
okay so these are some basic features of
chb foro maybe in future it will launch
more and more new features right you can
upload your document you can upload any
sort of a screenshot you can ask for the
code you can do anything right you can
upload your image any sort of image and
you can ask chgb to describe it or to
make one story so now let's move forward
and see some safety and limitation of
chgb 4 so now let's talk about safety
and limitation of GPT 4 GPT 40
prioritize safety by Design across
different sites of data and by refining
Its Behavior after training they have
also developed new safety measures to
control Voice output
they also had outside experts review gb4
to identify and address risk especially
in new areas like audio they will keep
improving safety as we learn more while
text and image inputs and outputs are
available now they are still working on
making other features like audio safety
and user friendly today we have an
exciting and insightful comparison lined
up for you as we dive into the world of
AI language models so in this video we
will be exploring two of the most
advanced and and talked about AI models
CLA 3 and gp4 as artificial intelligence
continues to evolve these models have
become piral in various application from
content creation and customer service to
complex problem solving and Beyond so
CLA 3 known for its innovative approach
and unique feature Cloud 3 opers is the
latest saturation in the cloud series
while CH gp4 developed by open has been
making waves with its powerful
capabilities and impressive performance
so we will be examining their natural
language understanding generation
quality and how they handle their
different task so additionally we will
discuss their strength and weakness
giving you a clear picture of what each
model excels at end where they might
fall short so whether you are an AI
Enthusiast a developer looking to
integrate AI into your projects or
simply curious about the latest
advancement in technology so this video
is for you so by end of this comparison
you will be having comprehensive
understanding of how CLA and gp4 differ
and which one might be the best fit for
you and for your specific needs so sit
back relax and join us as we explore the
fascinating world of AI language models
craving a career upgrade subscribe like
and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your back
so before we jump into the demo here is
a quick info for you if you want to
learn AI ml then try simply L
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning from P University in
collaboration with IBM this code teaches
in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP compter
Vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat Duty and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box and
pin command so without any further Ado
let's get started so this is open AI
platform so here you can read about chat
GPT apis about the chat GPT apis okay so
this is the original documentation of
the chat gbt 4 and here you can see the
anthropic so Claud is developed by
anthropic company so CLA is a family so
here you can see so this CLA family have
two three version CLA 3.5 Opus CL 3.5
Sonet and 3.5 hi okay and this is coming
soon as you can
see okay so here you
can learn about all the families of
cloud 3 like we in chat gbt we have chat
gbt 3.5 CH gbt 4 CH gbt 4 okay and chat
GB 4 is a premium version so here also
opas and hiu is a premium version
okay so these you can learn about the
apis of these three I repeat so here you
can learn about the apis of the
particular Opus family okay so now let's
jump into this so here what we are doing
we are just comparing CLA 3.5 son to CH
gb4 okay so here you can see CH gbt 40
gbt 4 and gbt 3.5 okay so what here I
will do I will give some prompts to chat
gity 4 and the same promt to Cloud 3.5
okay so now so after that we will check
which model is giving the information
fast or you can say who is break
breaking down the information in a good
proper manner okay so there are four to
five category I selected okay in this
first category is factual inquiries then
complex scientific and Technical prompts
and creative writing then we'll ask some
mathema iCal and complex logical queries
or we can ask some data analysis
question and some generating Imaging
questions like this okay so after that
we will give some prompt and check which
model is giving the Fast and the
accurate answer okay so here the first
category is the factual inquiries so
here I will write share some interesting
facts
about the
Great Wall of
China
okay okay so here as you can see here
are some interesting facts about the
Great of China like this this this this
okay so and the last it is saying would
you like me to elaborate on any these
points or share more effects okay so you
can ask the particular point to be more
elaborate so same we will copy here copy
this and paste it
here okay then
enter
okay so here you can
see Chad GPD is giving long
answer as compared to the cloud 3 okay
just see
first what CH GPT does CH GPT explains
what is g
all I repeat what is Great Wall of China
okay so Great Wall of China is the most
iconic landmarks in the world rich and
historical significance and this this
this and after that it wrote here are
some interesting facts about the monom
structure so in this CLA you can check
it is
directly giving some interesting facts
okay so here I can see okay I can vote
for the charge basically okay now let's
move to our second category which is
complex scientific and the technical
problems okay so here first I will write
here
describe the
process of
nuclear
fusion and
it's po
potential benefit
over nuclear
fusion okay as
Center
okay so even I don't know the process of
nuclear fusion okay just I write because
I want to make the prompt more complex
so that that's why I write the nuclear
fusion and all okay so same we will copy
here okay so now if we will see okay
first is it telling the process then
benefits of nuclear
Vision okay it's writing
more okay the pro maybe the process is
like long I don't know and here it is
giving some
drawbacks okay first benefits then
drawbacks okay now that after that the
summary P okay so here as you can see
okay what CLA 3 gave is like I believe
there may be small error in your
question you asked about the benefits of
nuclear fusion over nuclear
fusion okay which is the same process I
think you meant to ask about the
benefits of nuclear fusion over nuclear
fusion so I will explain nuclear fusion
and compare it to nuclear fusion oh
nice here what CH GPT does it
automatically took that process okay it
is also tell the same thing nice then
nuclear fusion the process then
benefit
okay so CLA 3 gave only the benefit and
but the chat GP gave the uh drawbacks as
well which is a good
thing okay and in ch GB that process is
not properly displayed but in CLA 3 the
properly is is displayed by the step by
step okay which is again a good thing so
now let's jump into our next prompt or
category you can see which is a creative
writing so here I will write compose a
short
story
about a
time
time
traveler traveler
visiting
ancient
Egypt okay I will copy this for the CH
as
well okay
Egypt okay the same I will paste it
here so claw 3 is giving here is a short
story about the time traveler visiting
in so the timee keepers Gambit okay Dr
Amelia Frost resisted
her chromometer as a swolling Vortex
sped around her
means uh CLA 3 is using you can say you
know uh heavy
English and okay it's a good story I get
the sand of time first of all CH gave
the title as at the sand of time so in
the year
22492 time travel had just breeed the
pounds of the theoretical science and
moved the Practical okay
nice still writing okay and it's a small
story just in the simple line and ropes
okay I think here also I like the you
know story of Chad gp4 as compared to
Claud because it's hard to you know read
and understand you can say see some the
word gesticulating and this okay and
here Char is using easy
words okay so now let's move to the our
next category which is complex
mathematical and logical queries so here
I will write
prove
the
Pythagorean theorem
and
explain each step
okay okay so let me copy this and paste
it here as
well okay so first JP will tell what is
Pythagoras Theorem okay the fundamental
relation in equili Geometry among the
three sides of right triangle it is
state that this this this then the proof
rearrangement method okay first it will
construct the right triangle then four
copies of the triangle angle arrange
into a square then this then this then
this
okay so here what it does certainly I
will prove the Pythagorean theorem and
explain each step the pyan theorem okay
it also good
abc okay h a square + b square = to
c² okay so here CLA 3 is giving more
perfect answer as compared to CH GP
because I can't understand why is
arranging into a square and internal
square formation so here see simple
simply explain that a side label
opposite triangle a b c okay simple and
making I think chgb is making it more
complex okay rather than Cloud 3 so here
I can give V to clot 3 okay so now we
will do some category data analysis so
first I will upload some
data okay then here I will write
determine the
most
profitable
quarter for ABC
company
and
forecast
potential sales for
the next
year
based on
historical
historical data okay from this data okay
first I will copy
this see to determine the pro okay first
I will do it here
also upload from from
computer okay so first we will check to
find the most profit I will calculate
the average sales for each quarter
across all the years okay if you guys
want to
see the data let me open for you okay so
this is the
data okay this is the ABC company sales
data okay so this data also I have
generated from the same
right okay so
forecast
okay so now it's calculating so we will
see whether our answers are same or
not okay so here you can see the most
profitable quarter for ABC company is Q4
as for the cloud 3 okay we will check
the most prob cter for the ABC sarter 4
okay for the same with an average of
figures of
$194,000 here it is showing
$192,000 in sale okay we'll check later
so looking forward the full company next
year assuming the continuation of cont
Trend approximately 3 lakh
63655
th000 okay here we will check it is
giving us okay based on hisory we can
forecast potential shes for 2024 okay
it's giving the different facts so even
I don't know which is the right facts or
not okay but as you can see the most
profitable quarter for the ABC company
based on the average sales data is Q4
okay the figures are different maybe but
the profitable quarter for the ABC
company is the same Q4 so now moving
forward let's do uh next category like
solving philosophical and ethical
problems okay so I will add is it
ever ethical to
lie
discuss with
examples okay here I will write the
same
okay so it is saying the question
whether is AAL to is a complex one that
has been Deed by philosopher eist and
culture theorist what is centuries okay
so
it's it's giving you some few examples
to consider
okay but about CLA 3 CLA the ethics of
flying is a complex and noan topic that
philosopher has deated for a century so
means they are giving me the same
answers but in a different format okay
they're taking different different
examples okay first CLA the is
explaining first and then ex taking
example but here as you can see in chat
gp4 it
taking the particular situation and
giving it the example protecting someone
from harm privacy concern example third
example is preventing unnecessary St
fourth example is this fifth example is
negotiation and strategy after that
discussion this this a conclusion so I
can see Char is giving me more you know
structured way I can see so I can give
vote to chity 4 here okay so now let's
generate some
images so I will write here create so
this is our next category generating
images create a
visual
representation of a futuristic
City
with sustainable or with flying
cars flying cards okay so first I'll
will copy it and I will paste it
here okay gp4 is generating
image okay so here you can see I
apologize but I'm not able to create
generate addit manipulate of product
images I can okay
okay so here you can see maybe CLA 3.5
Sonet won't generate image maybe you
have to subscribe okay so here as you
can see you can create a visual
representation of a futuristic city with
flying cars so here as you can see again
CLA 3 have a draw bag it can't generate
the images but CH gb4 can generate
images okay
and even you can download this
image yeah so now last
category
whether can give me
explain the code from the example from
the photo sorry
photo
here
explain the code
from the
picture
okay so here you can see the code of the
image simple Java program designed to
REM of a number entered by the user is
even or OD right exactly you can see the
picture even or OD program okay so here
you can see it is explaining line by
line here
gbd4 and uh okay okay the answer is
right but
explaining method is wrong not exactly
wrong but it's difficult to understand I
guess the program enter number okay okay
blah blah blah blah blah this but chity
is giving a proper line by line
explanation okay I can say in my
perception the chat gbt 4 is far better
than chat gbt 3.5 Sonet but in future we
will compare pro version with pro
version means Claude Haiku versus chgb
40 or maybe 5 in are coming
years so with this we have come to end
