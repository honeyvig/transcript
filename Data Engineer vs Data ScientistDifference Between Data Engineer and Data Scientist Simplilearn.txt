data engineer or data scientist which
career should you choose so these are
the topics that we will be covering now
before moving forward let me ask you a
quick question
so what is the process of transforming
raw data into a structured format for
analysis and modeling in data science
option A is data visualization option b
is data pre-processing option C is data
modeling and option D is data mining now
you can pause this video and answer in
the comment section below so let's start
with the first topic which is who is a
data engineer so a data engineer is a
person who works with data and build
systems to handle and organize it
effectively they're like architects who
design and construct the infrastructure
needed to store process and analyze
large amounts of data imagine you have a
lot of puzzle pieces and you want to put
them together to create a complete
picture a data engineer would be
responsible for creating a table or a
structure to arrange and store all those
puzzle pieces they would also ensure
that the table is big enough to hold all
the pieces and that is organized in a
way that makes it easy to find and
analyze specific pieces when needed
data Engineers work with different tools
and Technologies to build these Data
Systems
they may design databases set up data
pipelines to transfer and transform data
between different systems or get data
warehouses for storing large amounts of
information now let's understand roles
and responsibilities of a data engineer
so the roles and responsibilities of a
data engineer can vary depending on
organization and specific job
requirements however here are some
common tasks and responsibilities
associated with roles of a data engineer
number one is data storage and
organization
a data engineer is responsible for
Designing and creating databases and
data storage systems they ensure that
data is stored efficiently securely and
in a way that make it easy to access and
retrieve when needed
second is data integration and pipeline
development
data engineers build pipelines or
workflows to extract data from various
sources transform it into a usable
format and load it into the appropriate
storage systems they ensure smooth data
flow and efficient data processing
across different systems third is data
cleaning and quality assurance data
ingenious cleans and validate the data
to remove errors inconsistencies and
duplicacies
they also established data quality
standards and Implement processes to
ensure data integrity and accuracy
fourth is data modeling and architecture
data ingenious design and develop models
and Architects that supports
organizations data needs they create
structures that enable efficient data
retrieval and Analysis and they optimize
performance for large-scale data
processing fifth is performance
monitoring and optimization
data Engineers monitor the performance
of a data system identify bottlenecks
and optimize the infrastructure for
better efficiency and scalability
they ensure that data processes run
smoothly and handle increasing data
volumes without issues sixth is
collaboration with data scientists and
analysts
data Engineers work closely with data
scientists and analysts to understand
the data requirements and provide them
with the necessary infrastructure and
tools to access and analyze data
effectively seventh is data security and
privacy
data Engineers Implement security
measures to protect sensitive data from
unauthorized access they ensure
compliance with data privacy regulations
and establish protocols for data
encryptions access control and data

now now let's understand who is a data
scientist
a data scientist is a person who uses
data to find patterns gain insights and
solve problems they are like detectives
who analyze data to uncover valuable
information and make informed decisions
data scientists work with large sets of
data often collected from various
sources such as databases sensors or the
internet they use their expertise in
statistics mathematics and programming
to extract meaningful insights from this
data
for example let's say a company wants to
understand why some customers are
leaving and other searching
a data scientist would gather and
analyze customer data looking for
patterns and trends that could explain
these behaviors they might examine
factors like demographics purchase
history or customer interactions to
identify common characteristics among
customers who leave or stay with the
company
based on their analysis they can then
provide recommendations to the company
on how to improve customer retention so
this was about the data scientist now
let's understand roles and
responsibilities of a data scientist
first is data analysis data scientists
analyze large amounts of data to
discover patterns Trends and insights
they use statistical techniques data
visualization tools to export the data
and understand its underlying patterns
and relationships
second is predictive modeling data
scientists build predictive models to
forecast future outcomes or behaviors
based on historical data for example
they might develop a model to predict
the customers leaves sale forecast or
product demand these models help
organizations make informed decisions
and plan for the future third is machine
learning data scientists utilize machine
learning algorithms to develop models
that can learn from data make accurate
predictions or classifications
they train these models using label data
and deploy them for real-time
applications like fraud detections
recommendation systems or image
recognition
fourth is data cleaning and
pre-processing data scientists spend a
significant amount of time cleaning and
pre-processing data to ensure its
quality and reliability
this involves removing duplicate or
irrelevant data handling missing values
and transforming data into suitable
format for analysis fifth is
experimentation and evaluation
data scientists design and conduct
experiments to test hypothesis and
validate the effectiveness of models or
algorithms
they evaluate the performance of their
models using appropriate metrics and
fine-tune them to achieve better results
so this was all about rules and
responsibilities of a data scientist so

Additionally the demand for data
engineers and data scientists continues
to grow
which may lead to further increases in
salary ranges in the future
now coming to the next topic which is
difference between data engineer and
data scientist
so a data engineer focuses on the
development and maintenance of data
infrastructure whereas a data scientist
focuses on extracting insights from data
using statistical analysis and other
analytical techniques
a data engineer has strong programming
skills like python SQL Etc whereas a
data scientist has strong analytical and
statistical skills a data engineer
Proficiency in working with databases
and Big Data Technologies like Hadoop
spark Etc whereas a data scientist
proficiency is in programming languages

computing systems whereas a data
scientist has the ability to interpret
and communicate findings effectively a
data engineer ensures data quality data
governance and data security whereas a
data scientist develops and applies
models algorithms and statistical
analysis to derive insights from data so
these were some differences between data
engineer and data scientist now let's
have a look at data engineer or data
scientist which career should you choose
so in 2023 both careers of a data
engineer and a data scientist continue
