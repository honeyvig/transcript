hey everyone i am peppa khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns gtape
channel today we will talk about
conditional statements in c sharp
but before we begin let me tell you guys
we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for our latest
technological advancements then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon to never miss an update from simply
learn
now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with the
discussion on what are conditional
statements
then we will discuss the types of
conditional statement
then we will dive deeper into the types
to discuss conditional branching with
examples
finally we will wind up this session
with the discussion on conditional
looping
let's get started with what are
conditional statements
conditional statements in c sharp are
used when we wish to perform certain
actions based on a given condition
decision making statements necessitate
a few conditions that the program may
assess and a set of statement that can
be performed
if the condition evaluates as true
or another statement that can be run if
the statement evaluates as false
conditional refers to a program capacity
to infer and do various actions based on
the conditions of the codes written in
that program
next up let's discuss the types of
conditional statement
conditional statements are categorized
into two types
conditional branching and conditional
looping
let's have a in-depth discussion on
conditional branching
there are two ways to accommodate
conditional branching
if-else statement and switch case
statements
let's discuss if-else statements first
the if statement is made up of a boolean
expression followed by a statement
the statement inside the if condition is
executed only if the boolean expression
returns true
if it returns false then the program
will simply execute the else statement
if it is available
as you can see in this flowchart
let's try a code to demonstrate if else
statement
let's start
with degree layering
and x comma y
then
console
dot write line
in this we will print
enter
to
number
now
let's get a user input
so x
is equal to end
dot
parse
and we will have console
dot redline
this will request the x
input
let's copy paste
repeat
let's copy paste the same
function
but this time for y
now let's write an fl statement so if
x
is greater than y
then in that case
we will print
console
dot write line
that x
is
greater
than
y
let's go for another condition else
then if
we have x
is less than y
now in this case
we will be printing
that y
is
greater than
x
now let's say
they are equal
since we have already covered
the greater than part and the less than
part so only condition left is equals so
we don't have to mention another if
statement for x equals to y so we will
just write else
and print
console
dot
write line
both
are equal
let's save it
and execute
let's enter value
7
and
5
here it is printing x is greater than y
let's try equal
function as well
let's give it value as 3
and 3
and it is printing both are equal
let's get back to our slides
next let's discuss switch case statement
in this scenario we have been given
number of cases and a default case
in each case
is numbered starting from 1 to the n
except for the default case in the
beginning we are prompted to choose a
number
whatever number we pick then program
will execute the same numbered case
in case if there is no case with the
chosen number it will execute the
default case
let's try this statement in a code
editor
let's start with defining integer x
then we will define a function
that is public
world
get data
here
we will
write a console.write writeline
and we will choose
as
choose
the
following
color
then we will have x
is equals to
end
dot parse
console
dot
red
line
now let's have a switch
statement
so we have switch
with argument
as x
we will have first case
console
dot write line
and we will print
you
choose
red
break
then we can have another case
two
and we will have
same kind of statements
so console
dot write line
you choose
blue
then a break statement
these break statements basically
will loop you out of this switch case
so
let's say case three
and we have another console case
right line
and this time
you choose
yellow
and
break statement
to get them out of here
now there can be a case where
we have to define a default case
when we choose a number other than one
two three
so
the default
will have
console
dot
right line
and it will by default choose
fight
and then
we will also use break for this one as
well
now let's write the function for the
main block
here
we will define an object
for the switch
case
so
for program
obj
is equals to
new
program
then
we can have obj
dot
get data
and
we can have
last line as console
dot
redline
let's save it
and execute it
as you can see it's asking us to enter a
number
let's enter one
and it's printing you choose red
let's enter
let's execute again
this time let's answer
a number which is not in the our cases
let's say use 5
and it will automatically choose us
white
let's get back to our slips

now we have successfully defined the
conditional branching statements
now let's discuss conditional looping
there are four methods to accommodate
conditional looping
first up
for loop while loop
do while loop
and four each loop
let's discuss them in detail
first up for loop
the condition of the for loop includes
the
set up and change inside the syntax as
well
we will first check the condition like
if we are at the last item
if it is deemed false then we will keep
this loop going otherwise we will end
the loop
let's try a code
let's start
with an console right line
here we will print
a statement as square
of
1
to
10.
let's write a for loop to do that
we can have end
i is equals to 1
then i less than equals to
10
then i
plus plus
then we will have console
dot right line
and then we will have i star i
as its argument
let's try
as you can see it is printing
the squares from 1
to
100
let's get back to our slides
next we have is a while loop
in this scenario the while loop will
validate a condition
then it will execute the code block as
long as that while condition is true
and the loop will keep executing unless
the condition becomes false
let's try a code
to understand this thoroughly
let's start
we'll first have
an integer x
then
we will
write function
which is public
void
while
demo
then we will have
a while loop inside
with an argument condition as x less
than equals to
50.
let's decrease that to 10
then console
dot
write line
and this will print x
it will keep on printing x
until
x becomes
greater than 10
to do that the x plus plus will
increment its value after each loop
then let's go to our main block
here
we will call while
loop
then object
equals to
while
nope
new keyword
now let's use this newly created object
to call
while demo
let's save it
and execute it
and here you can see it is printing its
value from 0 to all the way up to 10
then the while loop
was dismissed because it existed the
while condition
let's get back to our slides
next we have do while loop
in this scenario it will first run the
do code block
then the while loop will validate a
condition
and then if that condition is true it
will execute the do block as long as the
while condition remains true
this loop will keep executing unless the
while condition becomes false
let's go to a correlator and try a code
let's start with an end
x
then we will have
a function
that is public
world
too while
demo
here
we will write
a do command
and the trend
console
dot write line
x
and x
plus plus
then we have a while condition
within condition as
x
should be less than equals to
10.
let's say in a case the x was 11
then also the do function will first
execute it
basically in this do while loop
if
our x was already greater than 10 since
our condition that x should be remain
less than 10.
this do block will still run
for the first time
because it did not encounter this while
condition yet
so after running it once it will print
11
then it will encounter this while
condition
and since the while condition will come
out to be false this dual loop will be
terminated
let's write the main block
do i look
obj
is equal to
new
do i loop
then we will use obj
got
dual demo
call it
let's save this and run it
as you can see it is again printing from
0
to 10.
let's get back to our slides
finally we have 4 each loop
when a program
wants to iterate through a contents of a
list
it uses a for each loop
it can be applied to a collection such
as array list or arrays
let's write a code to understand it
better
let's start with the main block
and write
string
break it
close
which is equals to
let's have arguments
as die
comma
we can have shirt
we can have code
we can have
bands we can have
shorts
now let's write a four each loop
so
for each loop
we will have
string
i
in
cloth
then we will have a console
dot right line
and it will print i
let's save it
so according to the foreign loop it will
run this eye in this cloth
which is a string so basically it will
print these all elements
one by one through this loop
and here as you can see it is printing
ties shirt coat pants and shorts
one by one
