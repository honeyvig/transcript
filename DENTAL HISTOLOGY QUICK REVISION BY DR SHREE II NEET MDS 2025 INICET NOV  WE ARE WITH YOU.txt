okay so CH let's start so first of
all considering this as
a revision session the first thing I
just want to add a note is the mandatory
checklist for your dental histology is
definitely I recommend
yes I recommend Dental
pulse
synopsis or even your power play
books synopsis is very nice okay so I
want you to keep that as a primary
checklist so whatever you learn from
this quick revision or whatever the
smart videos that are available you can
consider them as an add-ons wherever you
feel like the concepts are missing you
can add on directly into the dental pul
synopsis
and the previous Pro live class already
available I told you to finish it off
finish it off and try to do as many mcqs
as possible but once you come to the
last reading means maybe like for
example uh people planning to prepare
okay so in the last 10 days few of them
they plan 10 days revision means 10 days
before exam they try to revise all the
subjects few of them they plan 2 weeks
revision either it is 10 days or 14 days
basing upon your convenience okay
because you should not compromise in the
revision in the last so in this 10 days
or 14 days whatever you're going to plan
in the last 10 days or last 14 days
basing upon the convenience okay your
dental
hystology and dental Anatomy both Dental
histology as well as Dental Anatomy the
revision should not be more than 3 to 4
hours each okay means your stuff should
be organized properly okay that is your
dental P synopsis or PP book synopsis
plus add-ons is the only thing that you
are going to revise right clear right so
I have given a plan like how to revise
Dental Anatomy Dental histology in the
last 10 days plan or in the last 14 days
plan you should allocate 3 to 4 hours
only totally it should be 8 hours you
should finish both of these revisions in
8 hours in one day okay means for
example you're reading 12 hours so 8
hours you need to finish these two
subjects and you need to start a next
subject then only you can have a proper
beautiful preparation in the last 10 to
14 days clear guys clear about this
revision Plan before you go to
exam okay so cello uh without wasting
any time uh it is
probably uh a
oneway a oneway class quick revision W
and here and there I'll be asking
questions integratedly and I want you to
answer quickly on the chat box shall we
start without wasting any
time so first and foremost thing is
formation of dental lay so
normally okay your oral cavity and your
for gut will be like this and this oral
cavity for gut will be separated by a
meman called as Buck of arel membran at
27th week at 27th day at 27th day what
is going to happen this Buck of arel
membran is going to rupture so there
there is a communication that is formed
between the forut and your oral cavity
so forut and oral cavity are
communicated by the breakdown of buck
ofel membran at 27th day so this is very
very
important 27th day then the next
important
thing okay the proliferation of your
oral Ecto due to the neural crust cells
is going to occur at sixth week sixth
week is again a very very frequently
Asked question so this resulting in
formation of a band called as primary
epithelial band which is going to split
it into two parts one is Dental Lam
where most of your dental structures are
going to form and second one is
vestibular Lam so vestibular Lam is
going to give rise to oral vegetable
whereas your dental Lam is going to give
rise to all your teeth okay both primary
as well as the permanent teeth Sometimes
some areas of your dental Lam will get
degenerated so those are called as
remnants of your dental Lam degenerated
they are called as cell rests of Reeses
which in future can give rise to
formation of f cysts that we'll be
discussing in oral path and oral
medicine clear right so most important
points are 27 the rupture of buak of
arel membran occurs at 27th day a very
frequently Asked question then the
proliferation of your oral ectom due to
the neural crust cells occurs at sixth
week okay so Dental lamula gives rise to
dental structures and vestibular gives
rise to oral
veget and one important aspect about the
tooth development is okay so which
structure in teeth is formed from Ecto
only Ecto what is ectom which is found
from ectom
only yes it is anamel they can ask you
anamil is formed from Ecto okay
or mol blast
which is the one mol blast is going to
form from ectom mol blastoma is going to
form from ectom so all of these are
formed basically from ectom so these are
generated only once in once in the
entire life okay so once in entire life
they cannot be regenerated again and
again so for example if they're asking a
question tooth is formed from anamal is
formed from
Ecto tooth is formed from so what is
your answer tooth is formed from tooth
is formed from
Ecto tooth is found from Ecto anamel is
found from Ecto okay then comes the
stages so most of you are familiar
regarding the stages okay what are the
stages sequence of stages they can ask
you bud stas cap St Bell Stace which is
divided into early Bell and advanced Bel
St so they next question frequently
Asked is layers in each Stace okay
particularly for example like cap St
layers the cap St has three layers layer
one is outer anamal epithelium Layer Two
is St reticulum Layer Three is inner
anamel
epithelium next one early BST early BST
is going to have four layers outer
anamal epithelium stellate
reticulum stratum intermedium and inner
anamal epithelium Advanced Bel St is
going to have five layers outer anamal
epithelium stellate reticulum formation
of future Ding and Statum intermedium
and inner Anum okay so they can ask you
the layers arrange the layers in the
sequence or they going to ask you
arrange the stages in the sequence
coming to butd St butd St still and
their shape they going to ask you so for
example butd St the peripheral cells are
low cumar cells whereas the central part
okay the central part is going to have
the polygonal cells coming to Outer Anam
epithelium is basically low cubal cells
whereas still reticulum they are star-
shaped cells stellate reticulum is going
to have star shaped cells so normally
during the initial phase s reticulum is
going to have polygonal cells okay due
to osmotic difference okay because of
the movement of the fluid this polygonal
cells in future they modify into
star-shaped cells because of star shaped
they are called as state reticulum okay
what type of cells are seen in the case
of stellate reticulum star- shaped cells
or they can ask you question during the
initial formation what type of cells
there are seen in the case of St
reticulum polygonal cells polygonal
cells will be differentiated due to
osmotic pressure variation into star
shaped cells okay again low cual cells
in the outer Anam epithelium okay star
shaped cells in the case of Statum
reticulum and squamous shape of cells in
the case of intermediate same as right
clear I hope you are clear till this
point so regularly asked which enzyme
which enzyme is increasing in Statum
reticulum and Statum intermedium anyone
which enzymes which enzyme is increasing
Statum reticulum Statum
intermedium yes right yes right you guys
alkaline phosph okay very frequently
Asked question Statum reticulum Statum
medium they are what enzyme is increased
alkaline phosphates alkaline phosphates
is basically associated with formation
okay many formation cells like
osteoblasts condr blasts Osteo sites and
all the these are formation cells where
your alkaline phosphates will be
increased okay resorption cells which
enzyme will be
increased in resorption cells which M
will be increased so in resorption forms
yes right perfectly right in resorption
forms like clasts osto class VTO class
acidic phosphor will be increase means
they are active at acidic pH they are
active at acidic pH can anyone tell me
what is the pH at most of your uh Osteo
class will get activated pH at most of
your OST definitely it is an AIC pH okay
preferably a pH of less than any value
less than four okay so in in textbook it
was given as 2.5 to3 around 2.5 to3 most
of your okay Osteo class are going to
get activated okay next uh I want to
focus on the next important areas so the
events which takes place in each type of
stage they can very frequently ask one
important thing is dental papill dental
papill formation can occur okay can you
tell me what is Dental pap gives rise to
structures Dental papill is
DP Dental papill gives rise to D for
Dentin very good P for pulp so Dental
papill gives rise to Dentin and Pulp
okay next one is Dental follicle Dental
follicle Dental follicle means for
example you consider this as a teeth
follicle is something which is
surrounding the teeth okay so Dental
follicle it gives rise to all the
structur surrounding the teeth what are
the structures surrounding the teeth yes
right very good cementum PDL albone so
Dental follicle gives rise to structure
surrounding the teeth that is your
cementum pedal and alular Bone and
dental papilla gives raise to DP that is
Dental pulp so Dentin and Pulp okay next
one I hope you are familiar with these
terms that is enamel uh anamel KN anamel
cord anamel SEPTA anamel navel and all
these things so these structures are
formed in which stage
these structures are formed in which
stas okay all are related to anamel
right means you can consider them as
anamel complex easy to remember no need
to confess anamel complex what is this
anamel complex all structures of anamel
together form a complex okay right what
are this not Cod SEPTA navel all are
together form complex so which stays
complex C for c cap St anamel complex
all these structures are formed
complex C for c cap St now early Bel St
what happens in early Bel St I want to
add one important Point here already
discussed which enzyme is more in the
case of your Statum intermedium already
discussed that is your alkaline phosph
is repeated so many times
similarly okay so your Statum
intermedium which is very rich in glyos
okay that is very helpful in the
formation of anamel okay very very
important please do make a note of this
okay which layer
which layer in La Bell St is very very
rich in glyos that helps in anamal
formation what is a
layer yes that is your
Statum Statum intermedium very good okay
next what happens your Cate reticulum
okay reduces the distance means Cate
reticulum which is present okay so what
is going to happen the stellate
reticulum is going to collapse and it is
going to reduce the distance between the
inner anamal epithelium and to the
capillaries of outer anamal epithelium
okay so inner anamal epithelium is there
so St reticulum damages and it decreases
the distance between the outer anamal
epithelium and inner anamal epithelium
outer anamal epithelium is lay down into
folds in between of which of the mean of
your dental
Sac condenses to form papill which is
rich in capillaries and which is the
main suppl of your nutrients blood
supply is required blood supply is going
to form nutrients okay now the next
question is okay H RS what is h RS yes
HCS is basically going to contain outer
anamal epithelium it's going to contain
two layers outer anamal epithelium inner
Anam where is this HS formed which
location it is formed okay the HS is
basically formed at cervical portion so
clearly given right here the HS is
formed at cervical portion okay they
consider it as cvic IAL Loop HS is at
cervical Loop what are the two layers in
HS what are the two layers in HS the two
layers in the HS are outer anamal
epithelium okay and the second one is
inner anamal epithelium HS is going to
have two layers one is outer anamel
epithelium and second one is inner
anamel epithelium okay clear
guys just a second please don't write on
my screen because this is a recorded
version and it looks very very odd and
irritating for others okay
please please don't touch my screen
please please kind request
please okay CH so I'm jumping what is
the use of
HS what is the use of this HS HS will
determine you the position of root
number of roots and everything it is
basically inclined to Roots okay so
Dental Pap gives R to structure
DP Dental Pap gives rise to Dentin and
Pulp Dental follicle gives rise to
surrounding all surrounding PDL alular
bone okay cementum are surrounding so
Dental follicle gives rise
to that okay
right okay right so the next important
area is uh the next important area is
okay the composition okay the
composition of Anam and Dentin basing
upon
the so check out whether they're asking
by weight or whether they're asking by
volume okay so by weight or by volume so
what is going to happen okay right so
this is very very important so normally
it is 96 or 97 by weight for example if
they're asking by volume the percentage
of inorganic content is 92 percentage so
highest inorganic content is present in
the enamel okay and uh question which is
previously repeated in the examination
is percentage of water in Dentin by
weight percentage of water in Dentin by
weight is 10 percentage and percentage
of water by volume in dtin is 22% so I
want you to remember water
percentage okay what is this anamel and
Dentin the answer is 16 1022 right so it
is by weight Water by volume water in
the an by weight water in the dented by
by volume water in the anal clear right
guys clear okay so can anyone tell me
integrated question how much amount of
loss of water will be there in Dentin
after root canal therapy how much amount
of water is lost in the Dentin after
root canal
therapy loss of
water in
Dentin
after rctd
how
much yes very good answer is 9% is
previously repeated in the examinations
okay right so so according to this which
is having more water Dentin or
enamel yes right so Dentin is having
more water so that is the reason why
bonding to Dentin is difficult okay so
what came into existence for a good
bonding of
Dentin so we regularly using d bonding
agents so what are the bonds which are
present in the Dentin bonding
agents so Dentin bonding agents
are having two bonds
right one
is hydrophilic bonding and second side
they are hydrophobic bonding right
Hydro philic bonding and
hydrophobic Hydro phobic Bond bonds to
which
structure Dentin is having water so one
side is going to bond to the Dentin so
hydrophilic is going to bond to the
Dentin hydrophobic is going to bond to
the resin or composite your Dent DM
concept
clear okay chello I'm moving to the next
one right so one very important aspect
that I want to stress about your anamel
is anamel is the only structure in the
human body which is already calcified
before the process of calcification
start okay so they can ask you how much
amount of anamel is calcified initially
without maturation okay without
maturation how much amount of anamel is
calcified 30% is okay 29 to 30% is
basing upon the references sometimes it
may be 29 29 to 30% is is the amount of
calcification that is seen in the
initial calcification of the anamal okay
right so after maturation okay
completely calcified whereas in the
Dentin it is uncalcified Matrix will be
there cementum will be uncalcified
Matrix will be there okay the next one
is uh you know anamel anamel is going to
have hydro accepted crystals so the
crystals which are present in the anamel
are 50 to 500 times it varies reference
right it may be orbons it is number may
be different but basically the main
important thing I want you to make a
notice it is larger in size when
compared to the crystals which are
present in the Dentin so when compared
the crystals of the Dentin anamel
crystals are larger in size and very
very unique point about the bone hydroxy
crystals are lengthwise lengthwise bone
hydroxy crystals are lengthwise they are
more okay whenever your anamel is
treated with fluoride okay water going
to form flate and floh hydroxate will be
formed this floh hydroxate are larger
crystals when compared to normal
hydroxate so what hydroxy is present in
the enamel whenever you treat with
fluoride they form florah hydroxyde
these Crystal size are larger in size
okay we have discussed this concept in
operative Dentistry okay when I'm
talking about the mechanism of
mineralization or mechanism of
maturation okay it is almost same in all
heart structures of teeth that is enamel
Dentin it same and it is almost same
in the case of your ab that is Al bone
also clear right okay the most important
thing we have already discussed is
anamel is ectoderm anamel has hydroxy
crystals they are hexagonal in shape
they are long they are irregular
hexagonal okay the only one structure in
the teeth which does not have Collin
what is the structure in the teeth which
does not have collagin is anamel anamel
does not have collagin anamel does not
have nerves anamel does not have blood
vessels so blood vessels are absent
Colin is absent and nerves are absent so
all
these all these
are absent in an
so all the structures are absent in the
enamel right clear guys clear till this
point okay CH so most of you are
familiar regarding this okay so the
modulus of velocity modulus of elocity
is highper anamel or
Dentin modulus of elocity is hper anamel
or
Dentin DM question so modulus of
velocity is hyper enaml and am on the
enamel which layer is having the highest
modulus of velocity yes these are the
lines the surface at the surface the
modulus of velocity is higher at the
surface the modulus of elocity is higher
okay so can you tell me what is the
specific gravity value of enamel so what
is the specific gravity value of the
enamel the specific gravity value of the
enamel is
2.8 Denon anyone Denon what is the
specific gravity value
yes perfectly right Denon has specific
gravity value 2.2 saliva anyone can tell
me the specific gravity value of
saliva very good
1.8 nitrous
oxide specific gravity of nitrous
oxide yes perfect 1.53 now I'll be
asking one questions specific gravity of
gold
anyone anyone can tell specific gravity
of gold
no one specific gravity of gold is 19
Mercury Mercury
anyone yes it is clearly given maurity
is 14 times denser than water okay it's
around like 13 to 14 okay right DM part
okay right so the next important aspect
I want to stress on is the value okay
that is temporary temp resistance value
of your anamel that is 5 to 13 hexs and
electrical resistance value is 10^ of 5
to 10^ 15 ohms clear
guys and Anam is semi-
permeable okay Anam is semi-
perable partially or completely
permitting two important substances that
is 14 carbon labeled UA and iodin 14
carbon
labeled 14 carbon labeled Uria and iodin
and
peroxides okay very frequently Asked
question anamel is permeable to
peroxides Anam is per to peroxides can
you tell me one more layer that we have
discussed in the histology that is your
pero part which is semi perable one more
layer in pero which is semi perable what
is that
layer one more layer yes same easy to
remember right semi
perable circular epithelium right
circular epithelium
circular epithelium is semi permeable
right clear done I'm moving to the next
part yes guys you are familiar coming to
the composition we have already
discussed inorganic content is largest
by weight that is around 96 to 97
percentage and the rest of the
substances are organic substances and
water which occupies 4
percentage coming to your organic
content organic content has some unique
unique
proteins okay some unique proteins what
are those proteins called as amelogenins
and non-
amelogenins amelogenins are low
molecular weight proteins which occupy
90% of anamal proteins they are
basically
hydrophobic okay they are basically
hydrophobic and they are rich in okay
they're rich in hpgl Ammon acids they're
rich in hpgl Ammon acids recently only
we have done biochemistry right we have
done what is what are essential Ammon
acids what are non-essential Ammon acids
what are semiessential am same Ammon
acids hpgl is related to amelogenins
which are hydrophobic and they occupies
90 percentage okay the next goes swu
please don't do anything on my screen
please okay next one non
amelogenins non amelogenins which are
going to occupy 10 percentage okay so
what are the proteins that are present
in non am
they are
ETA they are
ETA okay so when coming to the ammonia
acids what are the Ammon acids which are
rich here
G so tell me what is the code for
ammonia acids which are rich in
amelogenins what is the code for
amelogenins amelogenins is
hpg and remember it's HP gas Limited
both are gas amalog is name hpg HP gas
hpgl gas limited okay within the two
hours of duration okay right okay then
comes okay amelogenin hydrophobic 90% is
low molecular weight hpgl nenin High
molecular weight okay occupies 10 perent
is and the code is G okay and you know
this hydroxy Ed formula very frequently
Asked C10 P4 to^ of 6 and o4 to^ of 2
and it is regularly irregular hexagonal
in shape okay right
clear okay the next comes okay uh
underline points are very very important
during the formation magnesium is going
to replace the calcium and carbonate is
going to replace this hydroxy ions
because of this replacement
okay there will be
destabilization the poor fit of these
ions so what happens finally does the
core of the crystals okay the core okay
you know hexagonal right does the core
of the crystals means the center part of
the crystals is rich in magnesium and
carbonate okay the central part is rich
in magnesium and carbonate okay and that
is the reason why there is a greater
solubility of acids in the center part
than the per periphery okay so central
part is rich in magnesium and carbonate
so that is the reason why it is more
dissolved when compared to the periphery
part of your hexagonal crystalline
structure okay then the dry weight the
dry weight the most predominant uh uh
the most predominant molecule that is
present is carbon dioxide that is 34.4%
is you'll be having carbon dioxide and
you'll be having 36.6% is of calcium and
17.7% is of phosphorus which MO is more
okay molecule which is more is
oxygen next comes to the formation okay
during the formation basically it is
acidic okay and then it moves to neutral
and then it moves to basic so it is
acidic neutral and finally it is the
basic the basic Are alkaline this is how
the pH is that is going to change during
the anamel formation and we know that
the pH is going to be controlled by a
agent called as buffering capacity so
the buffering capacity during the pH
regulation is maintained by Carbonic and
hydras and which types of Carbonic and
hydr very important that is ca2 and ca6
Carbonic and hydr 2 and Carbonic and
hydras six are main Regulators of pH
during the formation of an anal
okay okay clear clear
guys so most of the things you are
familiar
enamel rods are anamel prisms they are
lowest that is 5 million in the case of
your lower lateral and they are highest
in the case of your upper first molar
okay so pulple pulp pulple volume or
pulpal size is highest for which teeth
the volume of Pulp normally the total
volume of Pulp is 0.38 CC pulpal volume
is highest for which
teeth someone is telling canine canine
no not canine it is maxillary F same is
having the highest pulple
space root surface
area root surface area also called as
peral area antisa fpd selection of
abutment is highest for which teeth root
surface area also called as Perler yes
right the question is again the same for
all these like highest number of enamel
rods highest number of Pulp pulple space
root surface area or peral area is
maximum for for all these questions the
answer is upper first molar okay so
which teeth is very close to maxillary
sinus which teeth is very close to
maxillary
sinus which teeth is very close to
maxillary sinus yes the answer is
same maxillary first molar okay one more
twist in the question during development
which teeth is very close to maxillary
sinus during development which teeth is
very close yes during development if
they're asking your answer should be mag
maxillary Canon will be close to
maxillary sinus but in a normal
individual which teeth will be close to
maxillary sinus is maxillary first M can
you tell me maxillary antrum dip is
present between which teeth maxillary
antrum
dip maxillary Anum dip is present
between which
teeth maxillary Anum
dip yes very good kti very good it is
between the second premolar and first m
very good right very good CH I'm moving
ahead and you guys know that these
anamel rats are oblic in Direction they
have a wavy course okay and that is the
reason why they are greater than the
thickness of the anamel anamel thickness
is highest at anamal thickness is
highest
at yes anamal thickness is highest at
cusps okay so what is the shape of your
dentinal tubu these are obl dentinal
tubules yes dentinal tubules are s
shaped dentinal tubules are s shaped
very good okay then coming to the
structure the diameter of the rod is
four micrometers it is hexagonal
irregular fish shaped fish shaped is
recent I question the same diagram was
given you can you can see fish scales
okay they are appearing like a fish
scales uh the diameter of the rods
increases from dentino anamel Junction
towards the enamel that will be the
ratio of 1 is to two
and sub microscopic structures Keyhole
or paddle shaped prisms okay so we have
already discussed the diameter is the
breadth is five length is 9 okay so it's
very simple like 9 is equal to 5 +
4 okay 9 is equal to 5 so we also made
it as diameter is four breadth is five
length is 9 easy right 5 + 4 9 so 5 4 9
are the values that you have to make out
regarding this enamel
rods direction of enamel rods is
important very frequently Asked question
the direction of enamel rods in decious
teeth okay in almost all the areas they
are same but in the case of cervical 1/3
they are different in the case of
permanent teeth they are epically
directed in the case of cervical teeth
they are occlusally
directed striations anamel rods built up
segments separated by a dark lines that
gives tried appearance the uniform
length of four microns is see Grand anel
you familiar right they can ask you
diagram based question also grand
anamals are most commonly seen over the
cusps of the teeth okay at which the
anamel rods appears to be twisted around
each other okay this makes enamel very
strong at those areas and that is that
is the one which is going to give
resistance to the facture of the anamel
okay so anamel is going to
have do we consider anamel as Britt
is anel brittle or
not whatever yes Anam is brittle along
with anamel okay anamel is
brittle okay right very important there
is a small correction regarding this in
your PP book synopsis D for D okay dark
Jones diones okay okay light Jones or
paron easy to remember dark part what is
the angle between these
two what is the angle between these two
the angle between the diones and parazon
what is the angle yes the angle between
these two is
40°
so okay chill I'm moving I'm moving
ahead incremental lines of radies okay
so they are going to be brownish
bands and successive opposition of the
layers of the anamel that is found from
the DJ to the surface deviating towards
theal surface whereas in the case of
transfer session you are going to see it
as a concentric
circles so what is Neal lines where do
you see Neal lines Neal lines are
regularly seen in the case of residuous
teeth and the first permanent Ms so
neonatal lines are basically like they
are going to give an information about
the metabolic
supply for us during inside the mother
and outside the mother outside the
mother environment will be different so
those lines will be different inside the
mother en ironment will be different
okay those lines will be different so
neetal line is the one which is
demarketing showing the differences
between the enironment inside enironment
outside which is normally the patterning
of these rods clear
okay the next comes is structureless
enamel or prismless enamel the thickness
is about 70 muum thickness it is most
commonly seen in the case of 70
percentage of permanent teeth and all
decious it's most commonly seen in the
cervical area Okay so this is called as
a prismic enamel anything about a
prismic anamel any clinical
consideration about a prismic enamel
that we have discussed during
pedo or that we have discussed during
operative part
so according to the new Concepts the
itching time yes p is right so itching
time is basically nowadays according to
the recent modifications the itching
time of primary teeth is equal to that
of the permanent teeth but in World
Concepts you have few questions like
itching time of primary teeth is more
than old concept what is that old
concept primary teeth itching time is
more than the permanent teeth why what
is the
reason the primary teaching time is more
than the permanent reason is presence of
a prismic enamel which is more in the
primary when compared to that of the
permanent but now the latest concept so
what is the latest concept of itching
time the latest concept of itching time
is clearly telling that the itching time
of the primary teeth is equal to eaching
time of the permanent
teeth clear clear
guys okay very good
so perima are wavy like
GRS okay believe to be the external
manifestations of
Rees so very frequently so many times
repeated in the exam external
manifestations of stations of reti rges
is called as perim so at CG it is 30 per
millim at incisal or occlusal area it
decreases okay decreases it is 10 per
mm okay then comes the
cuticle okay so anamel cuticle is called
as primary anamel cuticle or NEX Smith
membrane okay very so many times given
in the exam it has a vavy course it is
secreted from the Amo blast when the
anamel formation is completed means
ameloblast are going to form the anamel
in the last minute they secrete a layer
that layer is called as primary anamel
cuticle why they secrete this they want
to protect the
ANL so M blast is going to secrete an
AML and finally they form a layer that
is called as primary anamel cuticle
which is going to protect the entire
anamel that is the last job done by
amast okay so ameloblast is origined
from
which which germ layer yes
Ecto so
pelic so we have a similar pellicle
right in operative Dentistry also pelic
material Alba and followed by plaque
plaque get calcified to form calus okay
so in an erupted teeth okay so picle
will be there which is basically the
precipitation of salivary protein
salivary proteins they form a protective
layer called as pelic on a recently
erupted anamel okay Anam Lam so what are
this Anam Lam Anam Lam are thin Leaf
like L for
l l for L Leaf like what are ribbon
shaped
structures what are ribbon shaped
structures in an
AML ribbon like structures if they ask
what is your answer ribbon like
structures are
tfts Leaf like
structures Leaf like structures Leaf
like structures are lless okay so what
is this Leaf like structures that extend
from anamel surface and they move this
is anamel surface and they are moving
towards dentino anamel Junction they're
moving down so these are called as thin
Leaf like structures that are extending
from enamel surface and moving towards
the Dentin anamel Junction so these are
called as enam l so they bear basically
a b and c which are most
common God is so great H which are most
common yes most common are c c c for
common which are most common the most
common are C they are basically filled
with Organic material from the saliva
and they are most commonly seen in the
case of erupted teeth you can remember
it as completely eruption c c for
complete C for common completely erupted
organic material from saliva completely
erupted and reach into the Dentin means
complete right completely they reach the
Dentin okay so these are these are the
most commonly asked questions area the
next one is B for degenerated cells
degenerated cells are seen in the
unerupted teeth okay the also reach into
the Dentin but they are less common next
one a a is poor poorly calcified anomal
rods uned teeth but these are restricted
to the enam only less common okay which
is most common
type which is most common type yes most
common type are C type which is which is
the only type which is seen in the case
of erupted teeth completely
erupted most commonly seen in the
completely yes right which is formed
from the organic matter from the saliva
or organic matter from the
saliva yes perfectly right that is C
type degenerated cells are seen in
degenerated cells are seen in B
type which is the only one that is
restricted to
enamel only one that is restricted to
anamel and poor calcified is a type
which structures are Leaf like Leaf like
structur
sir Leaf like structur sir L for l like
Lam okay then our ribbon like fer came
who is the
ribbon ribbon ribbon is tree you can
remember it as tree
Tufts so anamel Tufts okay diagram based
question was previously given now this
fellow comes from opposite direction
Aras from dentino anamel Junction and is
trying to reach the anamel previously it
is Aras from anamel and trying to reach
the dentino Animal Junction this fellow
Aris from D Animal Junction and trying
to reach the outer surface okay right so
these are narrow ribbon like narrow
ribbon like structures and these are
hypocalcified enamel rods okay they
contains hypocalcified enamel rods and
they contain inter prismic
substances they contain inter prismic
substances if you want you can make a
note of this value that is straight away
from the textbook okay right the next
one is odonto blast processes and anamel
spindles so entol blastic processes
passes through passes across the DHA and
they enter into anamel they appear dark
in the transmitted light and they are
most commonly seen in the case of your
cpel
tips next The Junction okay you can see
the junction The Junction is scalloped
okay so it is scalloped and the
convexities of these scallops are
directed towards the Dentin D for D
directed towards the Dentin Dentin
anamel Junction concave convexities are
directing towards the den very simple
okay right
okay then comes the epithelial Anam
organ the epithelial Anam organ is
originated from the stratified
epithelium of the Primitive oral cavity
and it is going to contain outer anamal
epithelium State reticulum stellate
intermedium and inner Anum the inner
Anum is called as am blastic layer this
we have already discussed during our
stages okay now we have already done
okay so outter Anum is what shape
previously done out is cual shaped can
you tell me during the initial phases
your still reticulum is what shaped dur
during your initial phases your state
reticulum is what shaped yes during your
initial phases our state reticulum is
polygonal shape but after osmotic
difference it become star shape normally
if they're asking Sate reticulum shape
star shape okay Statum intermedium also
we have discussed Statum intermedium is
basically flat to cuel shape inner Anam
epithelium is cinar shape outer Anam
epithelium very frequently Asked
question outer Anam epithelium cells are
cuboidal in shape whereas inner anamel
epithelium cells are cinar in
shaped okay they differentiate into Amo
blast and they form enamel okay and they
plays a very very important role in
anamel
production these acts as a buffer
against the physical forces okay
stellate reticulum okay like a cushion
which is going to act as a buffer
against the physical PES and the outer
Anum is going to supply food for this am
blast guys clear very important points
these
are diagram based I hope you can answer
this okay so cap stays butt stays Bell
STS and all these are diagram based very
very important they can Mark you and ask
you to identify which layer it is Dental
L lay outer epithelium inner one is
inner anamal epithelium the the
projecting one is called as Dental Pap
which is going to give rise to your
Dentin and Pulp okay and the surrounding
one is Dental follicle which is going to
surround the teeth that is your pedal
cementum and alular Bone and cervical
Loop is the position at which you're
going to have your h e r s okay which is
going to contain only two layers that is
outer anamal epithelium inner anamal
epithelium whereas your reticulums both
are reticulum Statum and intermedium are
absent in the case of your cervical Loop
which gives R to formation of H RS that
is your root and number of root shape
size and number of roots guys
clear am I going a bit fast shall I
reduce the speed or should I go with can
I go with the same speed
yeah okay very good the next comes is
the life cycle okay life cycle
development of anamel how it's going to
occur we know that the formation of
anamel Matrix during the anamel Matrix
itself anamel is having 30 per of
minerals in it then after what is going
to happen mineralization and maturation
will occur the 30 percentage will be con
to 100 percentage of minerals this is
going to be that and you have how many
stages of life cycle of an AM BL you are
going to have six stages they are
morphogenic organogenic for ative State
maturate
maturation uh protective and desmo litic
the most important questions are they
can ask you two important questions
which are very frequently repeated one
is can you tell me which is formed first
anamal is formed first or Dentin is
formed
first yes right Dentin is formed first
and followed by Dentin you are going to
have an am okay now the question is in
which stas when which stas Dentin is
formed
Dentin Dentin is formed Dentin is
organized okay Dentin is organized on
organized Dentin anamel will start okay
so Dentin formation occur in organizing
State okay now organized Dentin has
formed so we have a layer of Dentin on
which we can load anamel okay anamel is
formed in which
stas formed anal formation okay so
Dentin is formed organized Dentin is
formed in organizing State on organized
Dentin anamel is formed in formative
State very important questions Dentin is
formed in organizing stat anamal is
formed in formative States clear guys
clear very frequent this is a very very
commonly asked question okay so so
during the initial phase of anamel
Matrix formation how much amount of
calcification is seen how much amount of
calcification is
seen yes 30% is which later conver to
100% is very good very
good okay
now so morphogenic what happens in
morphogenic the shape of DJ and Crown
will be decided most of the cells are
short colar with a wal
nucleus organizing we already told like
organizing Dentin formation begins in
organizing
phase so there will be reversal of
functional perality of the cells will
take takes place migration of centrioles
GG operators to the distal and takes
place where the Dentin formation
organized Dentin formation will start in
organizing State formative formative
stage is formation of enamel Matrix
anamel for Matrix formation will takes
place maturation maturation the word it
tells right there the formation of
anamel takes place okay during anamel
maturation that Amo blast are slightly
reduced in the number okay so the
maturation is going to start protective
phas the Amo blast layer transforms into
reduced anamel epithelium reduced anamel
epithelium we told right this reduced
anamel epithelium is going to protect
the mured anamel so protective means
protecting the anamel which is formed
means am blast transforms into a reduced
anamel epithelium which is protecting
the formed
anamel desmo litic the epithelial cells
they release enzymes that are able to
destroy the connective tissue fibers by
a process called as desmo Isis premature
degeneration of reduced anamal
epithelium May prevent the eruption of
the teeth okay so desmo litic enzymes
are going to release to break those
connective tissue fibers that is called
as diotic stage so the most important
stages are formation of anamel occurs at
formation of anamel occurs at which
stas formation of anamel occurs at which
stas formate right very good okay
formation of Dentin occurs at which stas
formation of Dentin occurs at which St
organizing okay ameloblastic layer
converted to reduced anamal epithelium
which stays reduced anamal epithelium
what is the purpose of reduced anamal
epithelium the purpose of reduced anamal
epithelium is for protection okay is for
protection protecting protective stage
okay so formation of enamel Matrix okay
so that is basically due to secretion
the secretory activity starts when a
smaller amount of Dentin is laid
organizing State the Amero blast lose
their projections okay and separate from
the predentin and islands of dentinal
matri are deposited and this process
continues throughout the Dentin on which
anamel will be
formed so next one is Toms process TOS
process Pig fence appearance very
frequently Asked question so each ml
blast each Rod is formed by how many ml
blast each Rod is formed by how many ml
blast yes
each Rod is formed by four molas one is
going to contribute to the head and
three are going to contribute to the
tail so next one is so once the anamel
Matrix is formed later half it is going
to get mineralized and maturation is
going to start so anamel rods matures
from the depth of the surface and from
the maturation of rods will takes place
from the cusp or incisal Edge es and it
goes towards the cervical area important
question maturation starts from the
cuspal tips and inis lges and it moves
towards the cervical
part A changes you are very very
familiar anamal is formed only once so
as a increases there will be loss of
vertical Dimension that is because of
your at regions and everything so
generalized loss of anamel occurs over a
period of time and this lead to localy
increasing in the nitrogen which ions
are increased nitrogen and fluoride can
you tell me which hard structure is
going to have more fluoride in
it which hard structure is going to have
more fluoride in
it yes
cementum and among the different layers
of enamel which layer of anamel is going
to have more fluoride it is outer layer
or inner
layer which layer is going to have more
enam structure cementum cementum is
going to have more fluoride because it
absorbs more CS outer layer of enamel is
going to have more fluoride than inner
layer
so there will be increasing in the
nitrogen and fluoride and anamel becomes
darker and their resistance to Decay
will increase reducing in the
permeability permeability also reduction
in the permeability takes place okay
right clear a changes are simple okay
clear guys only one question I'll ask
you okay shall I
ask so what is the code for
amelogenins Ammon acids code for
amelogenin hpgl non
amelogenins
G formation of Anam occurs in which
stas yes formative stas Dentin formation
occurs in which
stas organizing
States specific gravity of
anamel very good 2.8
Dentin
2.2 what is the type of collagin present
in
anamel what is the type of Collin
present in anamel no collagin no
collagin no collagin nerves no nerves no
nerves no nerves blood no blood no blood
no blood now tell me what is the type of
collagin present in Dentin predominant
collagin in Dentin is
yes recent recent neat question right
predominant Collin and Dentin is type
one any blood supply to Denton have you
seen bleeding when you cut the
Denton no blood supply no
blood n supp is
there yes deer layers are no no it's not
basically n deaper layers are going to
have some nerve endings nerve Supply
neural means you can you can tell s
neural is s no blood supply okay neural
Supply is there okay and type of Collin
predominant Collis is type one okay
shall we shall I go to next
part so yeah
dentinogenesis okay dentinogenesis is
basically Dentin formation occurs from
wood cells and
Amo
blasts ectodermin origin
Dentin dtin is odto
blasts ento blasts are origined
from best
term
is yes best term is neural crust
cells neural crust
cells and Dentin is originated from
which structure already discussed DP D
for Dentin P for
pulp okay done okay I'm moving to the
next
one okay hardness value of anamel very
frequently Asked question we regularly
have very fantasy number okay 143 143 is
related
to which
structure yeah very good Monica 143 is
Tong
fangel Arches from which tongue is
formed 143 D anamel you can remember 343
343 is the hardness value
of an AML Denton hardness value will be
less when compared to the enamel that is
80 okay
CH radio graph you WR it is less radi
than enamel more radi opic than pulp and
cementum very simple these are other
important numbers related to the Dentin
okay proportional limit is 148
megapascals compressive strength is 305
megapascals 10 cell strength is 51.5
megapascals and modulus of velocity
value if you want you can make a note of
it number based questions are slightly
less compared to last five years back
number based questions will be more now
the number based questions are I'm not
telling that number Bas questions are
not there in the exam they are there but
number based stuff was slightly reduced
compared to five or 8 years
back so histology we have already
discussed like you have hydroxy uped
Crystal similarly like that of the
anamel but here you have collagin the
predominant is type one but collagin is
basically absent in the case of your
enamel okay so it is hydro accepted
crystals in combination with
cassin okay so so you have this vento
blast okay okay so ento blasts are
basically originated from the pulp and
these odent blast they form the
Dentin okay now types of Dentin most of
you are familiar okay the first one is
called as predentin and Dentin which is
very close to the pulp which is not
mineralized and the width is 2 to six
micrometers important question is
internal
resorption internal resorption is also
called as
internal resorption also called as yes
very good internal resorption is called
as pink
tooth so now the question in Endo is
which of the following type of Dentin
resorption occurs in the case of
internal resorption which of the
following Dentin resorption will occur
so Dentin which is present close to the
pul because internal
resorption is basically odonto class are
going to get activated and they get
blood supply from the pulp so
which which structure is near to the
pulp that is first eat away which
structure is near to the pulp okay so in
internal resorption case which Dentin is
first affected answer is predentin
Dentin which is very close to the pul
okay right okay next one is int tubular
Dentin that forms the main body so main
body of the teeth is formed
by main body of the teeth is formed by
which
structure entire teeth main body of the
teeth is formed by yes very good Dentin
Dentin is going to form the main body of
the teeth and Main body of the Dentin is
formed by the main body of the Dentin is
formed by intertubular Dentin
intertubular Dentin is going to form the
main body of the den okay very good next
there is something called as per tubular
Dentin or per luminar Dentin or
intratubular Dentin okay Dentin
immediately surrounding the dentinal
tubules is called as peritubular Dentin
surrounding the dentinal tubules and it
is highly nalized then inter Tu Dentin
how much it is 9 percentage we learned
one more value related to the Dentin 9
percentage what is that
value Dentin one more Dentin value 9% is
Dentin
value what is the value yes moist lost
amount of moist lost in the Dentin after
RC 9% is very
good yes very frequently Asked question
okay what is the very important thing
that is causing dis Comfort to the
patient is the dentinal tubu fluid okay
it is also called as dentinal lymph any
lymph in
anamel anamel any
lymph no no lymph no lymph in anamel no
lymph in basically lymph concept is
not also there in Dentin but dentinal
fluid they call it as lymph lymph will
is lymph present in the
pulp is Pulp having
lymph dentinal fluid is called as d Al
lymph is Pulp having lymph yes pulp is
having lymph pulp will have lymph
lymphatic Supply lymph vessels and
everything are there in very frequently
Asked question about your dentinal fluid
or dentinal lymph
is high K low
n so dentinal fluid is very very
important right very rich okay so
dentinal fluid is going to have more
King King is Rich okay denal fluid is
going to have less normal persons okay
na is less k+ is more k+ is more
dentinal fluid k+ is more na+ is less
clear
done inside the cell Which ion is more
inside the N Which ion is more inside
which is who is
topper yes very good inside inside the
kingdom who is the topper king is the
top okay inside the kingdom who is the
topper king is the top okay very good
okay so interlobular Dentin is an
abnormal Den okay interlobular Dentin is
an abnormal Dentin okay that is most
commonly seen in the case of vitamin D
deficiency now a little bit I'll be
talking about vitamins related to the
teeth questions are coming okay now you
have
vitamin A vitamin d and vitamin C okay
tell me which are the vitamins which are
useful for tooth development vitamins
which are useful for tooth development
a b c ADC
okay so a is more inclined with
structure of tooth
development a is inclined to more with
which structure of tooth development a
is inclined to
sorry a is inclined to anamel it it
damages the Dentin also but it's more
inclin to anamel d d is more inclined to
Dentin D is more inclined to Dentin but
it damages the Anam also C is more
inclined to C is more inclined to
Ginga
bone then anamel and
den then anamel and D okay now one more
question right Ginga
which
vitamins Ginga Ginga yes vitamin C among
A and D what you want to add among A and
D both A and D are there which which is
the second one you yes a why a a is
useful for epithelization we remember
right wound healing a is required what
is the purpose of a in wound healing is
yes right epithelization ging also
requires epithelization okay then the
next one is B complex are useful some
vitamins of B are useful for ging growth
okay ging maintenance ging healing
during your perodontal surgeries the
least is vitamin
D least is vitamin D for gingera Clear
guys all these are questions okay all
these are questions you have clear okay
Chell so I told you right interlobular
Dentin is more inclined to vitamin D
deficiency rickets yes vitamin D
deficiency so exposure to high levels of
fluoride during the Dentin formation can
also lead to the formation of
interlobular Dentin exposure of high
level of Dentin sorry exposure of high
level of fluide will cause more damage
to Anam or more more damage to
Dentin Anam or Dentin yes yes it is
causing more damage to anamel because
fluoride is going to love Amo blast okay
so floride Amo blast is very very
sensitive to fluoride okay an AM blast
is very very sensitive to fluoride and
anamel is going to get damaged okay so
when floride is useful for anamel during
development or after
development when fluoride is going to be
very useful for anamel during
development or after
development okay fluide is very very
useful to enamel after development
before development during development it
is going to cause damage to Amo blast
okay it is going to cause fluorosis so
during development okay fluoride with
anamel will cause fluorosis after
development fluoride with enamel leads
to formation of fuoh hydroxyde crystals
which prevents the carries which
prevents the acid dissolution guys is is
is the concepts
clear these are just simple Logics first
thing you should be logical to answer
these questions second thing if you are
not logical now after learning the
Concepts you have to be logical right
okay during formation okay it is very
sensitive that leads to fluorosis you
know fluorosis right fluorosis occurs
very rapidly particularly Andra the
Jones of kamam uh gur and all these the
belt is more fluide Naga kamam and your
gur and all these you have more fluoride
cases right that is during the
development after the development you
apply fluoride that is your tropical
fluoride application your APF gels your
NF gels SNF twos okay all these are
applied because they form floh hydrotite
which is more resistance to tental Caris
so apart from this high fluoride content
hypo
parathyroidism and hypothyroidism okay
are the conditions which can lead to
formation of interlobular Dentin
clear okay Chell I'm going
ahead so this is how the interlobular
irregular Den interlobular Dentin will
look like in the histological photograph
okay types of dentins primary Dentin
secondary Dentin teritary Dentin primary
Dentin is going to have two types mantle
Dentin and circum Dentin mantle Dentin
normally Dentin is going to have type
one coll mantle Dentin which type of
cisin need 2022 question mantle Dentin
is going to have type three Collin what
are those fibers called as those fibers
are called as W of fibers and won of
fibers
they love Which
ion they love Which
ion Wonka fibers they love not k+ okay
they love silver
ions they love silver ions okay and
slightly less mineralized than the
circum pulple denal that is your mandle
Den next comes is circum pulple Dentin
which is more mineralized when compared
to that of the mantle Dentin so these
comes under your primary Dentin next
comes is a secondary Dentin they contain
few number of tubules than the primary
Dentin that is the secondary den and
there will be demarketing line between
the primary Dentin and secondary Dentin
where you can differentiate
it next one the important fellow
clinically more useful fellow is your
teriary
Dentin other names are different names
okay so it is called as reactive Dentin
reparative
Dentin irritation Dentin
replacement Dentin or defense Dentin or
advantes Dentin these are the other
names that they regularly use the most
important thing is I want you to know
about the difference between the
reactionary Dentin and reparative Dentin
reparative Dentin is formed when
reparative Den is formed which procedure
reparative Den is formed which procedure
reparative Den is
formed so whenever you do direct pulp
cappings okay so whenever I'm going to
do direct pulp cappings so what is the
golden standard material for direct pulp
capping golden standard material for
direct pulp capping yes golden standard
material for direct pulp capping is
calcium hydroxide the type of calcium
hydroxide what I am using for the pulp
capping is called as diol which is a
fast setting hard setting calcium
hydroxide okay so that is one and the
best material for pulp capping what is
the best material for pulp
capping the best material for the pulp
capping is is MTA okay right MTA so
whenever you do direct pulp capping
direct pulp capping is going to trigger
the undifferentiated Mason K cells into
in the pulp to differentiate into ENT
blast and they secrete this reparative
Dentin reactionary Dentin is from
existing ento blast only whereas
reparative Dentin is from
undifferentiated oo blast that is a
difference very important question
reactionary Dentin is a reaction from
the existing Walla only whereas
reparative is from undifferentiated one
okay right
clear so a changes like Dental car is
aberration attrition all type of your uh
aberration and attritions and all these
things cutting of Dentin during your
cavity preparation will causes changes
those changes can be tracts sclerosis or
you will have nurst Denon and all these
can happen dead tracks you are very
familiar so dead tracks is a recent
diagram based question in one of the
examination they are black in the
transmitted light and white in the
reflected light okay sclerotic Den is
also called as transparent Dentin it is
a defense reaction of the Dentin that is
seen mainly in the case of your older
individuals
okay andur Dentin andur Dentin will
cause pain or not questioning your
operator andur Den
yes it no
pain normal Dentin can cause pain and
burst denting cannot cause pain it is
regularly hard dark in color look like a
Caris but it is basically seen in the
case of which type of
cares andur ton is seen in which type of
cares yes very good arrested
cares very good
so Junctions of Dentin Denon has a
junction with enamel Dentin has a
junction with cementum Denon has a
junction with pulp okay so now tell me
clinically Endo prospet which which of
these
Junctions okay which of these Junction
is
helpful to end the obturation which of
these Junction is is helpful to end your
obturation obturation should end at
which of these
Junctions yes obturation will end at
DJ very
good obturation should end
at D
CJ dentino cemental Junction is the
junction where your opulation should end
so already discussed there's a scalloped
with convexities towards the Dentin and
uh the scalloping will be greatest in
the case of occlusion areas that is your
stress braing areas coming the next one
is dentino Cal Junction so here they
have given you so this is an area where
epical Constructor will be there where
you are going to end your obturation so
this Landmark is very very important
when you're doing obturation okay and
these obturation that epical foramin it
is basically Ecentric it is not Center
or sometimes the epical foramin is
divided into multiple splits okay so
maybe sometimes you may have two to
three epical
foramin so two two three epical foramin
together that area is called as what
2 to three for means that area that
entire area is called as yes very good
the entire area is called as epical
Delta means it is something like a Delta
so this area looks like a Delta so this
is called as epical Delta so that
location is highly variable it varies
from teeth to teeth that is the main
thing and this is the point at which
your pulple tissue will be converted to
periapical tissue okay because at this
point until this point you'll be having
the pulple tissue after this point
you'll be having very epical
tissue next this complex the basically
the complex of Dent dtin pulpal Junction
complex we'll be learning in depth in
the pulp pulp video and everything
right next comes is the coronal Dentin
radicular Dentin the distance between
the incremental lines is more in the
case of your coronal Dentin whereas it
is less in the case of your radicular
Dentin extensive branches of uh ento
blastic process are seen here okay here
branching and collapsing with the
adjacent tubules will occur 4 mm of
Dentin deposition per day will occur
root radicular Dentin formation will be
less formed by the vento blast root
Dentin is basically formed by HS because
most of the root things are formed by HS
which is going to contain outer Anam
epithelium and inner anamal epithelium
more tubules will be there less tubules
will be there ter branches of the SOP
plastic process are more profused here
less
profused coming to pain okay what is
this pain in Dentin called
as pain in Dentin is called as yes
dentinal hypers sensitivity and which
theories explain this dentinal hypers
sensitivity best theory to explain the
dentinal hypers sensitivity is
hydrodynamic Theory so you have three
theories but the most uh most most
accepted theory is hydrodynamic Theory
so this is the diagram that is given so
most accepted theory is hydrodynamic
Theory what happens in hydrodynamic
theory hydrodynamic theory is basically
the movement of fluid you see we told
you right Dental lymph dentinal lymph or
dentinal fluid is going to move that
stimulate the nerves causing pain so
this is called as hydrodynamic Theory
the first Theory which failed is direct
inovation means that telling that Dentin
is going to have nerves the nerves
directly inovate and these nerves are
going to cause pain but this is
disproved by applying L you apply a to
Dentin will Dentin will not cause
pain you apply Al to Dentin or you apply
LA to
pulp so they have tried it okay people
are telling okay so Dentin is having
nurse okay let's La local anesthesia
it's not working so direct Invasion has
failed then the next Theory the other
the that came into existence is
transduction transduction is conduction
of impulse they're telling like how we
have discussed in CNS there is
conduction of impulse means one nerve is
connected to other nerve by a
synopsis and how this information is
being
transferred at the synopsis what is
present at the synopsis a
neurotransmitter is present okay then
they checked for neurotransmitters in
the dental pulp no neurotransmitters are
present in the dental bulp your
transduction theory fails your direct
Invasion Theory fails so the only Theory
which is explaining is fluid movement is
causing the pain that is called as
hydrodynamic Theory
clear clear clear
clear yes very good next goes is
hydrodynamic Theory okay a very
frequently Asked question hydram theory
was given by this okay given by I
remember it as stro liquid right
dentinal fluid is moving during stro
water will fluid the movement of fluid
will takes place okay that is okay very
simp simple question important point to
be noted according to okay this concept
slightly varies from book to book but I
just want to like these are straightway
lines from your orbons okay inward
movement during cold stimulus okay cold
stimulus what is going to happen to the
fluid for example assume that the fluid
level is this so whenever you
heat what happened to the fluid you take
a bowl heat the water you heat it when
you heat it water level raises or
Falls what happened to the water when
you heat it raises okay right so
whenever there is a
cold there will be inward movement
Whenever there is a heat or drying there
will be outward M simple concept this
concept that's what I'm telling this
concept varies from book to book but as
of now orans straight away they have
given this lines inward movement during
the cold stimulus outward movement
during drying or doing the heat stimulus
clear
clear I'm done with the major aspects of
Dentin this table is very very
important okay right I told you right
forming cells whenever you have forming
cells what are forming cells
osteoblasts osto
clasts act to
quites hyper
Ric Contra sites stellate reticulum we
have discussed Statum intermedium we
have
discussed ento blasts we have discussed
so all these formative cells are having
more more alkaline
phosphorus not
amas amast are also formative cells only
Amo blast formative cells which are not
having increasing in the alkaline
phosphat rest all formative cells are
having increasing in the alkaline
phosphat guys this table is very
important you have so many questions
given from this table like which which
enes which entic activity is more in the
reticulum which entic activity is more
in the intermedium which antic activ is
more in the osto sites OST are very
frequent aspr clear next comes the only
plus plus is for osto class okay acid
phosphor is increasing in the OST class
acid phosphites is increasing in the OST
apart from Acid phosph what are the
other which are increasing in the ostl
they our cytochrome oxidase is increased
okay cenic dehydrogen is increased suic
dehydrogen
is cytochrome oxidase and acid
phosphatase are increasing in the
osteoclasts done done done I'm moving
ahead okay then comes to pulp okay
number of Pulp organs are 52 permanent
are 32 primary are
20 volume of Pulp 0.38 CC so many times
repeated highest is going to be for
molars that two maxillary first molars I
hope you know what is coronal pulp and
radicular
Pulp there is something called as
accessory canals lateral canals okay so
they are basically formed as a
break and in that break dentinogenesis
does not takes place and they lead to
formation of accessory canals and these
lateral canals and accessary canals they
form blood vessels in
them during this HS formation that is
helpful in the
root so the main uses of this aary
canals and lateral canals is it is going
to communicate Endo plus pero that is
called as Endo perol lesions
means for example you consider this as a
teeth a teeth is having a deep pocket
for 2 to three
years a teeth is having a deep pocket
for two to three years okay you have a
deep pocket bacteria are there bacteria
are coming coming coming they reach this
accessory canals they start infecting
the
pulp so what is this classification of
endo perial leion called as this is
primary
pocket means primary perod Department
Wala the next one it is affecting the
endodontic pulp so it is primary pero
and secondary Endo
clear okay now I have one more case what
happened is there is a deep cares lesion
okay the fellow is having severe pain
did not came to the
department did not address the clinic
taken some medication then it has
infected the pulp necrotic pulp has
happened then there is a peral absis
then also he did not
came peral absis then also did not came
periapical absis become chronic absis
okay then finally what is what has
happened is there is infection that is
being spread from the periapical area to
form a bone loss and finally he his
tooth is moving lots of bone loss happen
okay now what is this case
this is called as
primary Endo it starts from Endo
department and secondarily it is going
for a pero Department with the bone loss
so it is called as primary Endo
secondary pero so these structures are
very very important okay so normally
only normally most of us we are not able
to fill the main Canal we are not doing
observations and properly so how can you
manage this accessory Canal small small
W very difficult okay so these are the
Endo perio Communications and they are
very difficult to clean that may lead to
poor prognosis that is the reason by
okay your accary canals are very very
important okay already concept of epical
foramin was discussed right epical
foramin where Anam and Dentin deposition
occur okay as a increases the epical
foramin size decreases epical foramin
are going to be the size will be more in
the case of maxilla that is 0.4 size
will be less in the case of mandible
that is 0.3 mm okay so epical foramin it
is is not mandatory to be present in the
central they can be present in the
lateral that is called as entric
sometimes two to three epical foramin
are present that is called as epical
Delta already discussed so this is how
epical Delta will be and upon obturation
proper obturation you can fill your
epical Delta like
this coming to the functions of the pulp
after the different functions of the
pulp the most important primary function
of the pulp what is the primary function
of the pulp the primary function of the
pulp is formation of Dentin which is the
most important function apart from this
okay one more function of the pulp is
induction okay what it is inducting it
is inducting the differentiation of
dental Lam and dental organ which helps
in the formation of tooth tooth
morphology determines the tooth
morphology formation Dentin formation
nutrition is giving nutrition to the
Dentin protection and sensory okay
because uh it has some Sensations that
is pain and it has immune cells lots of
immune cells are present in the pulp and
defense and reparative it helps in
formation of reparative Dentin right I
told you two types of Dentin one is
reactionary Dentin reactionary Dentin is
from reactionary Dentin is from existing
cells okay whereas reparative Dentin is
from whose cells reparative Dentin is
from cells of the
pulp the cells of the pulp the new cells
as Pani said new cells new cells are
going to come from undifferentiated
cells where undifferentiated cells are
present they are present in the pulp
they are coming from the pulp okay the
defense and reparative function is a
function of the pulp in which it is
helping Dentin okay so pulp what pulp is
doing pulp is giving food to the Dentin
pulp is protecting the Dentin pulp is
producing the reparative Dentin okay so
it is helping in all the ways to the
pulp like a good friend okay so very
close friend right so pulp is associated
with the Dentin so pulp is doing its job
in protecting the Dentin from all the
areas okay I told you pulp Dentin
complex the pulp Dentin complex is going
to have four layers so once you come
from the center Center is called as core
that is called as core pulp after which
you are going to have Rich Zone cell
Rich Zone then you are going to have
cellfree Zone the outer layer is called
as odontoblastic layer clear right they
can ask you from Center to out Outer to
in okay so rentastic layer is present in
the periphery okay so whenever you're
stress free cell free means stress free
you'll be well easy to remember right
okay then you have cell regone rich
people rich people rich people are high
H rich people are high H okay right and
the center one is called as coron very
simple nothing very too heavy soop
plastic layer is very very simple it is
periphery peripheral layer and the ENT
blast are tall colar cells in the
coronal pulp and they gradually become
flatter as they move to the radicular
pulp okay the cells are arranged in
paliside pattern very simple nothing too
heavy then comes the stress free set
stress free whenever you're free
well-being will be
more this is called a cell poor Jone
also approximately 40 Micron thickness
okay and here you don't have cells no
cells cell-free zone right no cells but
cell extensions will be there no nerves
but nerve extensions will be there okay
cell extensions no nerves nerve
extensions okay the nerve extensions are
called as fluxus of rashal
okay the fibroblast extensions are
called as cytoplasmic extensions of
fibroblast will be there here it is celf
freeone but no cells but extensions will
be there so this basing upon the
functional activity of a particular pulp
you can know the presence of self- free
zone or not so this selfy Zone may not
be seen in the case of Ang pulp or may
not be seen in the case of old pulp
because Ang pulp there will be rapid
formation of Dentin old pulp there will
be continuous formation of reparative
Dentin or reactionary that can be takes
place so there is the reason why self
fre zone is minimalistic in the case of
your young people and in the case of
your old
people then comes the cell rone because
it contains lots of cells it is high
high in the case of coronal pulp you
have fibras what are the predominant
cells in the
pulp predominant cells in the
pulp what are the predominant cells in
the
pulp the predominant cells in the pulp
are
fibroblasts what are the predominant
cells in the Ginga perio question what
are the predominant cells in the
Ginga what are the predominant cells in
the G yes answer is same what are the
predominant cells in the
PDL perodontal ligament what are the
predominant cells in the perodontal
ligament answer is same okay so right so
you have predominant cells and you have
undifferentiated Mason cells that can be
differentiated into any time so what are
the pulp cells are called as pulp cells
are useful for stem cells right pulp
stem cells you know pulp stem cells
which we have discussed in regenerative
Endodontics okay right so pulp stem
cells are basically used in regs what
are these types of cells pulp cells are
called
as dpsc Dental pulp stem cells what are
their property what is their
property yes yes someone is telling toy
not toy it is PL potent cells pulp cells
are called as PL poent P for p easy to
remember Pur poent right don't get
confused okay P for p pulp cells useful
for regenerative Endodontics so pury
poent cells has a capacity to give rise
to many other types of cells like the
pulple cells can be used in your stem
cell stem cell banking okay they can
give rise to nerve tissues they can give
rise to pulple tissues they can give
rise to many other tissues okay right so
P for p okay the next comes is as I said
like fibr blast Okay so what are the
types of fibers which are present in the
pulp one is elastic fibers okay which
are surrounding the blood vessels second
one is collagin fibers what of collagin
fibers are present in the
pulp anamel no collagin Dentin type one
pulp yes type one and type
three so which is predominant type one
type 1 is 55% type three is
45% sorry if I'm asking fetal pulp which
type of collagin is present in the Fatal
pulp yes
yes poin which is present in the Fatal
pulp
is type three similarly means type three
will be converted into type one in the
future any any such phenomenon occurring
somewhere I have discussed General
pathology type one converting into type
three yes guy three very good wound
healing so wound healing also the
initial type of Collin that we regularly
see is type three later the type three
will be converted to type one in the
pulp also fatal initially is type three
later it is converted into type one and
type
three right so where do you see type
three ciz normally I'm asking where do
you see type three
Collis yes one very good answer sh
mantle Dentin van of fibers reticular
fibers very good reticular connective
issue you have type three
Collin any disease having abnormality of
type three
Collin no no no Alberts is type four
sorry Alberts is type
four yes it is rubberman syndrome which
type of rubberman syndrome not all
rubberman syndromes which type of
rubberman
syndrome yes type
four type four rubberman syndrome he is
having an abnormality of type three
collagin that is called as vascular type
of rubberman syndrome okay here
reticular tissue will be damaged because
reticular tissue helps in blood vessels
formation of blood vessels so this
fellow is going have vascular problems
okay so the most dangerous type of
EDS the most dangerous type of EDS is
type four EDS because they have more
chances of death okay
done so in Ang pulp in Ang pulp we
already discussed type three will be
more so Ang pulp normally single fibral
will be there as a increases what is
going to happen as a increases the
vascular content decreases inrees means
the cellular content decreases the
fibrous content increases in the pulp
the pulp become more fibrous okay
greater concentration is found in the
most epical portion when compared with
the coronal middle 13 epical portion is
going to have more collagen as a
increases collagin increases as you move
from top to bottom in the epical 13 the
collagin will be more and this is the
phenomenon which is used by most of our
Ang endodontist as well as the Ang
dentist right whenever they open a new
Clinic whenever they start doing RCS
okay they keep this Photograph okay
right what is that photograph they
remove the entire shot of Pulp okay and
they keep the photograph what is the
instrument which is used to remove that
entire shot of
Pulp what is that instrument that fellow
is the root canal instrument which is
more prone to facture instrument which
is more prone to facture yes right that
is called a bar brouch which is more
prone to facture so what they do is they
insert this bar brouch deep into the
epical 1/3 because epical 1/3 concept
while what we learn is epical 13 is
going to have
more Collin so I'm going to turn engage
those collagin in my bar brouch and I'm
going to remove the entire pulp in a
single shot that is what the mechanism
there what is the mechanism which part
of root is having more
collagin which part of root is having
more Collin okay it is epical 1/3 okay
epical 1/3 which part of root is more
Pro prone for file
separation more prone for file
separation very good epical
1/3 Collin is more in epical
1/3 which part of root is more important
for an
endodontist you divide three parts which
part is more important for an
endodontist yes it is epical
1/3 which type of root facture has more
prognosis which type of root Factor has
more prognosis yes epical
13 okay right so this is again a diagram
that is taken from your Engle so there
was a study that is done comparing your
blood flow rates in different parts of
the body in comparison to the pulp the
blood flow rate is high in
spleen followed by heart where very
important physiology question blood flow
rate is high in spleen followed by heart
then comes the intestine and brain okay
pulp is coming after the brain okay very
very important the sequence they can ask
in sequence based questions in C or neat
they can ask
you so before going into that we'll be
discussing about the pulple
pressures so what is normal pulple
pressure
yes normal paral pressure is 5 to 10 mm
of HG if they're asking about HG if
they're asking selenar water what is
your
answer they're asking selenar water then
your answer is 10 to 15 cm of selenar
water so whenever there is increasing in
the pulpal pressure pulp is an closed
encapsulated cavity right closed by
Dentin from all the sides it's going to
cause pain so what is going to be the
pulpal pressure in the case of
reversible
pulpitis
13.5 irreversible
pulpitis
34.5 mm of
HG there is one Theory called as
stealing Theory what is the stealing
Theory stealing theory is going to
determine the pulple blood flow
influenced by the vascular tone of the
adjacent T like you have pulp inent what
you have you have Ginga you have PDL so
how this is weing like for example there
is a Vaso dilation you do
something you cause Vaso dilation in the
adjacent
tissue okay that lead to compression of
the pulpal blood flow when you cause
compression of the pulpal blood
flow there will be drop in the blood
flow so then the pulp will be in a State
of Shock like how we have decreasing the
blood flow the the pulp will be in a
State of shock but pulp is having an
internal quality okay that it is going
to reduce the pulpal perfusion but it's
going to maintain its viability for some
time like for example you we we
regularly do these manipulations right
whenever you keep this Matrix band okay
modify the pulp you cut the Ginga pulp
is going to get the blood supply from
all these areas through the epical
forment so this concept of how pulp is
going to get compromised because of the
manipulations in the edes tissue are
explained by a theory called as stealing
Theory right clear don't go very deep it
is a py concept for an usy this is more
than
sufficient okay then I'll be talking
about the nerve Supply what are the
nerves which are present in the
pul so nerves which are present in the
pulp are the predominant nerves which
are present in the pulp are C
fibers followed by a Delta fibers any
other fibers according to Engle it's
going to have a beta f fibers also but
make a note beta fibers are not going to
cause any pain so I'm least bothered so
beta fibers are not going to cause pain
the only fibers which are causing pain
are C fibers a Delta fibers entire body
what are the pain causing
fibers not in PP entire body what are
the pain causing
fibers Alpha fibers will not cause any
pain no no no no no same okay same a
Delta and C fibers are the pain causing
fibers whether it is a pulp or now if
I'm asking fastest
fibers velocity is fast in which
fibers normally velocity is fast in
mated fibers out of the fibers velocity
is fast in a alpha fibers if I'm asking
what are the fibers which are having
maximum velocity in the pulp is it can
be a beta or a
Delta predominant fibers are C fibers C
for c c for c c for Center C for core
fibers which are present in the core
fibers which are present in the center
are C fibers these are unmated fibers
fibers which are present in the
periphery are ad Delta fibers which are
melinated fibers and in most of your
pulp sensibility test that is your EP
heat test cold test what you are going
to
measure
mostly what fibers you testing you
testing a Delta fibers or C
fibers yes you are testing a Delta
fibers there is one Concept in pedo
right in pedo Department in primary
teeth and permanent teeth primary teeth
and permanent teeth pulp sensibility
tests are contraindicated
why in primary teeth and in permanent
teeth pulp sensibility tests are
contraindicated the reason is there is
no mization normally mization is going
to occur for to five years after the
eruption of a teeth into the oral cavity
so there is a problem with a Delta
fibers because a Delta fibers are the
only melinated fibers they are not
properly melinated in Ang permanent
teeth as well as in the primary teeth
that is a reason why pulp sensibility
tests are contraindicated because there
is no development of a Delta fibers
properly ad Delta fibers are going to
take four to five years after their
eruption into the oral cavity for their
formation of M sheet on
them so among these fibers which are the
fibers which are more they react fast to
the local
aesthesia the react yes they are C
fibers Let It Be C fibers present in the
center C fibers does not have any milein
sheet on them so as they don't have
milin sheet they reacts fast to the
local
anesthesia very
beautiful important points were given
related to the microvascularity of the
pulp from your Orbin so whether it is
arteries or whether it is veins they are
thin W in the pulp
and make a note pulpal arteries are as
big as arterials elsewhere present in
the body can you tell me what is the
number thickness
anyone Dimensions which are given in the
Orbin
5200
microns there is no branching in the
radicular
pulp sub odto blastic plues of
capillaries are
seen and these these capillaries are
seen these capillaries are seen right
throughout the pulp even they are seen
in the case of your cell po Jone that is
your self-free Zone
also okay the next one is concept of
parasites and sympathetic nerves
sympathetic nerves and parasites they
control the blood flow very important
Point both of these they control the
blood
flow High capillary pressure is seen in
the pulp we have already discussed 5 to
10 mm of HG or 10 to 15 cm of Salin or
water rapid blood flow and fenestration
capillaries are also present okay right
there second a question penetration
capillaries which type of capillaries in
the pulp helps in transformation of
metabolites the answer is penetration
capillaries the answer is pention
capillaries I told you lymph is there
lymphatic flow follows the course of the
blood vessel I told you lymph is there
in the pulp okay whereas your dentinal
fluid is called as dentinal lymph pulp
is also having the
lymph then comes it's a physiology
concept basing upon the semi
permeability capillaries which are
present in the blood are basically
divided into fenestration capillaries
continuous capillaries these are the two
types of capillaries which are present
in the
pulp we want fenestration capillaries
because fenestration capillaries helps
in transformation of metabolites in the
pulp very important finist sttion
capsularis the third type of capillaries
which are not present in the pulp but
physiology concept there are
discontinuous capillaries and the fourth
one are tight Junction capillaries type
one and type two are present in the
dental pulp that's what we have
discussed fenestration capillaries are
type one capillaries which helps in
transformation of metabolites through
the pores which are present in their
capillaries clear
clear clear I want your quick
response then comes the next one is Pulp
calcifications okay pulp calcifications
also called as pulp Stones so what type
of calcifications you regularly see in
the pulp recently done General pathology
so you have two different main two
different classifications metastatic
calcifications and dropic calcifications
dead and degenerated are associated with
the dropic calcifications so dead and
degenerated so pulp is going to have
some dead cells where the calcification
will occur so type of calcification that
is seen in the pulp is called as dropic
calcification can you tell me what are
the serum calcium levels and dropic
calcification serum calcium levels and
dropic
calcification very good normal the
answer is
normal norum what is serum calcium level
values value of serum calcium level
9 to 11 mg per dcil titani in titani
what is a
value tanate is less
than 6 mg per
decil see yes you have different types
of Pulp Stones true false fine defined
free attached and embedded and sometimes
the pulp Stones can appear as snow Strom
calcifications like tines pules
throughout the pulp so they are called
as pulp St so please do remember this
tag
line so which irrigation solution you
are going to use in
the whenever you have calcified canals
when you have pulp pulp Stones
Eda what is the pH of
Eda very good
7.3 percentage of Ed
177% of Ed very good Endo Endo Endo
integrated
content multiple pulp stones are seen
in multiple pulp stones are seen in
which condition yes rubberman EDS
multiple sinus openings on the face are
seen in which condition multiple sinus
openings yes multiple sinus openings
with sulfur granules are seen in the
case of Acom micosis okay what is the
drug of choice for Acom
micosis very good pencillin very good
any any colonies any Colony Type M like
colonies M like colonies are seen in
Acom micosis spider like colonies are
seen in Acom
micosis Ray like colonies are seen in
aom
micosis okay right so it's already
hitting eight so I want to close the
session okay hope this sort of
integrated
revision uh is useful I need your
response regarding this
so we'll be taking uh many more sessions
like quick revision fast revision okay
so if you feel it it's a little bit
fast recorded version will be available
on
the
website a few demo classes will be
posted on the
YouTube and I hope you know how to
decrease the speed okay right I mean
