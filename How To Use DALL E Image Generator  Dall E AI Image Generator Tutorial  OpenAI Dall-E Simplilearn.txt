pin comment so let's get started open AI
has unveiled its latest Innovation D 3
marking a significant evolution in the
AI driven text to image Arena the
advancement from Del 2 to Del 3 is
nothing short of astounding where D 2
fell short D 3 emerged as a formidable
competitor potentially outshining even
mid journey in its
capabilities this tool is not just an
impressive technological feat it's a
practical asset for personal and
professional Endeavors in today's
tutorial we will explore optimal
strategies for leveraging Del to enhance
efficiency and reduce expenses in design
related task remarkably Del 3 is
available at no cost the excitement
surrounding this tool is well Justified
now let's understand D 3 so D 3 is the
most recent version of open ai's AI
image generator and is now a component
of Microsoft Bing Creator AI suit
broadening its availability unlike its
predecessors D 3 can generate legit text
within images and offer surprisingly
accurate representations of historical
figures and celebrities if we talk about
ethical safeguards with its official
release Del 3 implemented specific
measures to prevent misuses ensuring
responsible and ethical use of its
Advanced features D 3 is also expected
to be integrated within the chat GPD
interface which we will be using in
today's tutorial and combining Cutting
Edge image generation with sophisticated
conversational AI so this presents a
lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurs
di 3 enables the creation of remarkable
movie posters album covers logos and
more without the need for extensive
design skills this open UPS new venues
for generating Revenue through the
creation and sale of such assets so
let's start exploring Dal in integrated
with Chad jpd so we have the chat jpd 4
version and we'll start with the D
prompts and first we'll create a logo
and we'll design a logo and for that
we'll write a prompt that would be
create a prompt for a specific type of
business example coffee shop or any and
you can name the specific coffee shop
that could be Cafe Aroma so for that
we'll write a prompt that would be
create
a logo so we'll create a logo for our at
tech company only simply learn so we'll
write a prom for that create a
logo for an attech
company name simply
loan so let's see what d responds to our
prompt and what image it will generate
or what logo it will generate and
deliver to
us so you can see that it has started
the process so you could see that Dal is
creating image and you could see on the
screen
that the hover is rounding and let's
wait what Dal provides us with this
promp
so you could see that here are the two
logo designs for the educational
technology company simply learn each
design reflects a balance of modernity
Simplicity and the essence of learning
so if you want to like upgrade or if you
want to make any improvements to these
logos you could just tell the Dal and
write the prompts for it that you need
the mention of the title or the name
simply learn in the logo so it will fit
to that and provide you with the new
logos and if you need any color
combinations or something you could just
provide the prompt for that so moving on
we will see another prompt that would be
for the movie poster so for the movie
poster we will like we can write a
prompt that could be create a movie
poster for a specific genre and we can
also name the movie so let's see we can
write a
prompt so that would be

poster for
a thriller
film and that would be
titled we'll title it the
dland so you could also write other
specifications also that if you want any
color combinations in the movie poster
or if you want any person doodle or any
something any objects mentioned in the
poster so you can also mention it in the
prompt so let's see what Dal responds to
this prompt so you could see like I like
this
poster so it's good so here are the two
M poster designed for the Thriller film
titled Thailand and each poster aims to
capture the suspense and mystery of the
film so if you want any upgrade or any
suggestions you can just tell the Dal
and it will do the provided results so
now we'll see the next prompt or the
next use case for the D you could also
create book covers with the help of
Dal so for that we'll write a prompt or
we could just write that would be design
a book cover for a specific genre
example mystery or Noel and here also we
can just
uh give the title name or the book name

this prompt so it has started creating
the
image so you could see now like totally
I like these book
covers so tale of James Fon tale of
James and Faron and the characters
are I say they are very good like Dal

extraordinary books so moving on uh now
we'll see the architectural design let's
see uh what Dal respond to that so we'll
write a problem for that that would be
create an architectural design of a
specific type of building example modern
house Willa so let's
see uh so we'll write a prompt
for luxury Villa create
an
architectural uh or yeah architectural
design
only of a luxury
Villa so let's see what di respond to
this and if you want any other
specification that you want any
measurements of the architectural design
or you need a particular scale sheet on
which this design should be printed so
you could ask the D to do that
also okay so you could see that it has
provided the architectural design of a
luxury Villa so this is the like the
outer design so you could also ask the D
to provide the inner design or the
blueprint of the luxury Villa so it's up
to you what you require so you could
just mold the prompts according to that
now M to the next prompt now we'll see
the 3D model so how Dal can create the
3D models using the prompt so we'll just
say that create a 3D model of a specific
image uh that could be any aircraft so
let's
see so we'll write uh create a 3D model
of a fifth generation
aircraft a 3D
model of
a fifth
generation fighter aircraft okay let's
see what does d respond to
this what kind of 3D model it will
provide so here the result you could see
that it has provided the fifth
generation
fighter and it has mentioned the
component of the fighter jet
also so here are the two designs of
fifth generation fighter aircraft
showcasing Advanced aerodynamic features
and stealth capabilities each design
reflects the sleek and aggressive nature
of modern military aviation technology
so please review them for your project
so you can review them and provide any
customizations you need for that so this
is how Dal creates the 3D model you just
have to write the prompts and D will do
the work for you now moving to the next
prompt and
here we can create tech product
prototype so we can create a prototype
design for a any ebike or solar power
ebike so let's try with that now we'll
write a problem for that that would
be uh create a
prototype and that would be
solar power only
okay and

so it has just uh like installed the
solar panel on the bike only ebike
only so if you need any modifications or
you just need
the like the balanced or the perfect
prototype you could add the features of
the ebike here so it will mold and
create the new images or the Prototype
design according to the prompts so you
could just go and have a
conversational talk with the D and it
will like refine these images and
provide you the new
images so let's see uh another prompt
that would be
the that could be around website

word and this is also
word so you could see that the D has
responded with the two designs for a
homepage of a Ral bike booking website
and I would definitely say that it has
provided a good
one so next we can uh generate the
images for an event poster or we can ask
it to design any cloth that could be
fashion design so let's see uh the next
one we will write for a event poster so
we will ask it that design an even
