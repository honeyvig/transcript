we will learn details regarding the
network algorithm used in multiple
applications to connect a Channel's node
hi guys and welcome to yet an
interesting video by simply learn
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to miss an update from
us now without further Ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
the algorithm
moving on with key points regarding the
algorithm
continuing with the principle used in
the Dixon's algorithm
as for the last topic we will look into
a solved example using the discharge
algorithm
let's move on to the first topic that is
Introduction to the algorithm
the distress algorithm was invented by
edscar w dextra
disregarded them were designed to find
the shortest path between the nodes of a
communication Channel
the distance algorithm is also used to
form a shortest part table for the given
graph
and it works on the principle of greedy
algorithm
now let's move on to some key points
regarding the algorithm
the first key point to be noted to solve
a distress algorithm as the algorithm is
closely linked to position of the nodes
in a graph
the next point is the attribute value
between the nodes of a channel
is used to deduce the shortest path
as for the last point we have the
initial value of all the nodes from the
current node is assumed to be infinite
to much practically understand the
functioning of the dextras algorithm
let's take a look at the principle for
the same
foreign
works as
if the distance of U that represents the
current node plus the length that is the
attribute value between node U that is a
current node and node V that is the
target node is less than the attribute
value to distance of the target node
and also the distance of the target node
is equal to the distance of current node
plus the length between Target node and
the current node
where distance U represents the source
node or the current node
and distance V represents the target
node or the destination node
to much better understand let's apply
this
for the given question let's find the
shortest path
in this given example we have three
different nodes node a b and c
using the previously discussed algorithm
principle we will deduce the shortest
path
for node 8 to the other nodes in the
graph that is the shortest path from
node a to node B and the shortest path
from node a to node C
for this let's take the node B first
according to the solution it should be
for node B on applying the algorithm
along with the values we have if 0 that
is the position of a is 0 plus the
target node attribute value that is 10.
is less than equal to infinite that is
initially as mentioned infinite value is
to be assumed
and this statement stands true so the
distance between node a to node B
becomes 10.
for the third step we will look into
distance between node a to node C that
would be 0 plus 40. that is the direct
connection between node a to node C
according to the example Which is less
than infinity again true so the distance
between note a to node C is 40.
Moving on but we have to find the
shortest path
so for this fourth step comes into
picture
that is for node C from node B on
applying the algorithm we have
10 that is the initial value of node B
and plus 15 that is the attribute value
between B and node C
which is 25 and is less than infinity
so the shortest path between node a to
node C becomes 25 instead of 40 which
was given through step 3.
using the same scenario and same steps
we will solve a much difficult question
and understand how the algorithm is used
then without further Ado let's move on
to the solved example using the textras
algorithm
okay
according to the given question
we have to use the distress algorithm
for the given graph and find the
shortest path from node a to node C
the point to be noted is we need to find
distance that is shortest between node a
to node C only
now let's take a look at the graph
and this is the given graph
with node a at the current node
and node C is to be the targeted node
but before we begin with the solution
for the given graph let's take a look at
some of the important points to remember
the first point the distance of node a
from all the other nodes is infinite in
the starting step as discussed earlier
in the example graph
the next point is the node with the
shortest value will become the next
current node
then we have
this graph is done to maintain a proper
shortest path value table which will be
very helpful during the solution of the
graph
now let's move on to the solution
to begin with we will make
shortest path table value
that is given through this
with three columns in it node column
value column and previous node
now let's start with the actual solution
to begin with the first step is to Mark
the current node that is node a
then the nodes that are directly
connected to the current node that is
node B and node d
Now using the value distance that is 3
for node a to node B and 8 for node a to
node D we will update our
table
where the point to be noted is that we
have updated the previous node as a for
both the nodes B and D
moving on now let's choose the next
current node that is
node B
for the next case because the shortest
path in the given table is 3 which is
less than 8.
now
the directly connected nodes to node br
node D and no d
similar to the case we did earlier we
will Mark the shortest distance from
node B to node D and OD let's reduce the
distance
the distance between node B to node D is
3 plus 5 that is equal to 8.
and then we have
distance from node B to node D that is 3
plus 6.
so the value is 9.
now we will update our
shortest path table and the new table
comes up to be
from node d
to node B we have 8 and node B to node e
we have 9. with the previous node as B
moving on let's decide the next current
node that is
D because the shortest distance is 8 in
comparison to 9 for node e
so the new current node is node D and
the directly connected nodes to node D
is node e and node f
the point to be noted is the current
node is chosen only from the unvisited
nodes
now for this we have
distance between node D to node e is 8
that is the previous value we did used
plus 3 that is the distance between node
D to node d and the total value comes up
to be 11.
then we have to node F from node T that
is 8 plus 2 that is the distance between
node D and node f
so the value becomes 10.
on updating the shortest path graph
table we have
the new distances that is node f as 10
value with the previous node as D and
there is no change with the node d
because in comparison to 8 11 is much
bigger
moving on let's choose the next current
node that is node e because in
comparison to value 10 from node F 9 is
smaller
now the node e is a current node and the
directly connected nodes are node F and
node C
now let's find the value between node C
and nodi
that will be 9 plus 9 that is the
distance between node e and node C so
the value totals come up to be 18.
and for node F and node e we have 9 plus
1 that is the distance between node e
and node F that comes up to be 10.
now let's compare with the graph table
where node f is originally at Value 10
and again the value is 10 so there's no
change and see we have infinite and the
value 18 is much smaller so the new
graph would be something like this with
node c as 18 value and previous node as
e
now let's decide the next current node
that is
node F because the distance value is
lowest in the given graph that is 10 and
for node C is 18.
and the directly connected node is node
C
then the distance comes up to be 10 plus
3 that is 13.
using this 13th value we can decide the
current value of C is 18 and the new
value is 13. in comparison 13 is
obviously less
so the new graphs comes out to be
for node C value 13 and the previous
node becomes f
with the completion of all the nodes in
the given graph we can deduce the
shortest path from node a to node C that
comes up to be
from node a to node D node D to node F
and node F to node C
and the total value comes up to be 13.
with this we have covered all the parts
regarding the functioning and the
working steps involved in the dikshas
algorithm
