$75,000 with years of experience it can
go to above $200,000 for Chief
Information officer level roles due to
the extremely critical nature of this
job role there is a demand across all
verticals including defense Health Care

if you want to become a cyber security
engineer in 2024 here is how you can
jump start your career in this field we
will split the entire learning path in
three major sections beginning with Core
Concepts level topics then we will move
on to intermediate skill-based topics
and eventually we will discuss what
topics to learn in Niche cyber security
skills let us start with core concept
level topics start with getting a
thorough introduction to cyber security
make sure to learn the basics of cyber
security including all the important
termin technology types of threats how
these threats work and what are the
working principles in cyber security
from there you can move on to mastering
networking fundamentals this is an
absolute must know to enter the field of
cyber security you need to be thorough
with how the internet works how the data
Highway functions right from the
function of operating systems to
understanding of TC pip OC model routing
and switching every single one of these
concepts are critically important make
sure to keep these skills handy at all
times since they help in understanding
the overarching concepts easily but it's
not just the networking part of
operating systems that you need to know
this is where the next important part
comes into the picture operating systems
Proficiency in Windows Linux and
possibly macos's operating systems
allows you to work across all domains
being Adept in each of these helps you
become better at safeguarding the fault
lines across them this is critical for
your day today working since you will be
directly iterating with these to perform
your daily tasks it is not unknown that
mathematics and computer science go hand
inand this extends to the field of cyber
security too you need to learn
cryptography where the knowledge of
encryption decryption cryptographic
algorithms and protocols is very
important next up is risk management
understanding risk assessment mitigation
strategies and compliance Frameworks
like gdpr and Hippa finally you should
also understand cyber security laws and
ethics awareness of legal and ethical
considerations in cyber security let us
now move on to two intermediate level
skill and tools based topics security
Technologies familiarity with firewalls
intrusion detection prevention systems
antivirus software and in Point Security
vulnerability assessment and penetration
testing hands-on experience with tools
like nessus Metasploit nmap and burp
Suite security operations incident
response threat hunting log analysis and
security information and event
management secure coding practices
knowledge of secure software development
practices and common vulnerabilities
like oos top 10 Cloud security
understanding of cloud computing
security principles and best practices
including Oz azure and Google Cloud
platform mobile security knowledge of
mobile application security testing and
best practices for securing mobile
devices now that you have mastered Core
Concepts and intermediate skills and
tools based on your interest you can
move on and choose one of the niche
fields for learning Niche cyber security
skills industrial Control Systems
security understanding of Scotta systems
plcs and protocols like modbus and DN M
P3 app security knowledge of securing
Internet of Things devices and protocols
blockchain security understanding of
blockchain technology and its security
implications thread intelligence
gathering analyzing and leveraging
thread intelligence to enhance cyber
security posture reverse engineering
skill in analyzing malware and
understanding Its Behavior red team blue
team exercises participating in
simulated attacks red team and defending
against them blue team with that said we
have reached towards the end of our
video this learning path covers a broad
range of topics and skills necessary for
a cyber security engineer in 2024
starting from foundational Concepts to
specialized areas within the field you
must make sure to stay updated and keep
on aligning this learning path based on
your requirements if you have any
questions about this learning path or
cyber Security in general that needs to
be answered make sure to let us know in
