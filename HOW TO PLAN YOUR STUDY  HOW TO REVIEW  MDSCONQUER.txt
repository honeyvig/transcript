yeah good evening one and all so there
are few important things that we need to
uh Implement in the preparation okay I
don't know like uh we have a very decent
time for the preparation let it be uh
your November in C or let it be the
upcoming neat exam okay so we have 10
months for the neat exam okay in and
around like 10 months and eight months
for in okay right so very very important
you have 10
months that turns around 300
days for your neat golden exam
and I hope the screen is visible right
now and you have a approximately 7 to 8
months of preparation
time okay that turns around like
uh 210 to 230
days for your
ini which will be in the month of
November I hope you clear with these
things we have discussed so many times I
hope you guys are clear with these
things okay 10 months for your
need and 7 to eight months for your inic
clear this is important very
important and Telangana students are not
eligible to November in so they directly
going to give the neat exam as the first
exam so you guys are going to take your
first exam in the next 300 days
okay so let's consider
neat okay let's consider NE that is 300
days 300 days is a very very
good
time for good
preparation and don't imagine that okay
300 days is a very good time so that I
can leisurely start or
uh I want to go with a slow pace I'll
enjoy my
internship I'll take leaves whenever I
want I'll take breaks in the preparation
come back and I'll do it don't don't
take these things granted the days the
those days are over but after seeing uh
NE 2024 the recent examination the
questions were in the known areas but it
were tricky okay so that requires more
conceptual reading you need to read more
understand more practice more so these
are more required so a simple 3 months
four months preparation like I see I was
talking to few of you few of your
seniors pgs in the college are telling
like three four months preparation is
sufficient to crack end up with a good
rank no those days are
over so this 2024 Pap is completely
against to those three to four months of
preparation and ending up a good rank
okay so you require more time and you
require more conceptual reading you
require more time to practice the mcqs
revise the mcqs revise the conceptual
reading and I hope you guys are very
very clear regarding this okay so the
most important thing is yes you need to
be aggressive you need to be aggressive
but make sure you're going in a right
way okay make sure you're going in the
right way so that is very very important
so this is an alarm sign for each and
every one of you people who are
targeting
high people who are targeting High okay
I don't know
can I know I think like 60 70 odd
students were there live good can I know
how
many how many of
you
really really want
to get in top 500 of all India my
question how many of you want to really
want to really want to get into top 500
if you are top 500 handed you're going
to get a government
seat so can I know the response how many
are really serious want to get into top
find yes I I see so many people
responding for
this yeah very good very good very good
right so now the next question is yes
you have time okay you have the time
which is sufficient for you to get into
top list okay so now you check it off
you have 300 days 300 days is a very
very good time extraordinary time if you
spend your time properly with books if
you spend your time properly with the
content practicing the content following
the checklists finishing the tasks on
time giving exams on time okay the most
important thing in the entire checklist
is giving exam on time okay because I
see people have a mindset of giving exam
only once the syllabus is done okay and
is there anyone on the group I hope like
most everyone of you has finished the
final BDS right is there anyone on the
group who has finished the entire
syllabus and given the final year Theory
exam who has read everything for the vaa
everything top to bottom anyone I'm not
in this list my preparation is always
incomplete okay we our preparation is
based so till this time till this time
till the last exam that you have given
uh few of you are repeating their exam
may be neat MDS okay let it be 2023 or
2024 but most of you the last exam will
be final BDS exam is it right I have
given my last exam is MDS final exam
okay right do you ask me my preparation
is complete 100%
is from from the time uh from my
schooling till 11th and 12th and
followed by BDS and MDS in any of the
exam in hundreds of the exams I have
given my preparation is always
incomplete always never it is complete
never okay the logic here is how many
years you read how much time you read
how whatever you do your preparation
cannot be complete do you accept
this do you accept this this statement
preparation is always incomplete and I
see
students uh like whenever I asked them
have we done with the recent exam have
you done with this exam they said like
I'm not done with the syllabus sir I
I'll try to finish it finish the exam or
give the exam after finishing the
syllabus syllabus cannot be covered yeah
I am teaching from past 10 years I'm
teaching from past 10 years syllabus is
incomplete we cannot cover okay it's
very huge whenever you teach something
the question can come from other side
whenever you teach something yesterday
some new invention will will be there
yesterday some new technique will come
into existence yesterday some new
equipment will come into existence
yesterday
a new disease will come into existence
new drug can come into existence
question can come from that area so
syllabus is always incomplete okay so
make sure you give exams on time this
preparation is not syllabus based exam
okay your your
preparation your prep is not syllabus
based it's not syllabus based it is time
based what is time based means by next
year this
time I'm not sure whether your syllabus
will be completed or not but I'm 100%
sure your exam will be completed and
result will be outed are you clear with
my statement do I accept with my
statement next year this time by this
time next year by April I'm not sure
whether you're going to finish the
syllabus I'm not sure whether I will
finish the syllabus I'm not sure whether
you're going to touch each and every McQ
on this website I'm not sure you're
going to watch each and every smart
video on the website but I'm very sure
your exam will be done your result will
be out okay people who has worked in a
better way they get a better rank people
who are not up to Mark they feel bad and
they may repeat this is 100% is true the
point here is it is a Time based
preparation not a syllabus based
preparation how much you read least
bothered how many times you read least
bothered what books you read least
bothered which coaching Center you are
from least bothered whether you're an
online student least bothered offline
least bothered which plan you took least
bothered most important is time next
year by this time exam will be done
result will be out so I request each and
every one of you conquer student with
all the positive energy whatever you
have okay around you taken from the
mentors or some XYZ factors make sure
run with the time make sure do things
with the time make sure try to cover the
syllabus with the time trust me even if
you finish 60 70 percentage of syllabus
you will be in the
list it's impossible even mentors cannot
finish 100 percentage of syllabus okay
if you finish 60 to 70 percentage of the
checklist whatever I'm stressing out to
do you're done you're in the list so
it's very simple I want you guys to come
into practical World practical world is
something which is impossible for 100%
is but okay do you think the topper the
topper is going to cover the syllabus
100% is no the topper is best among all
of us the ranker is best among all of us
okay someone is getting rank one someone
is getting state rank one someone is
getting college best rank someone is
getting the best rank among the batch
okay means they are better than others
that's the only that's the only
reference okay the only reference is yes
they are better than others it doesn't
mean they are they are idal it doesn't
mean they have done everything 100% is
are you clear C about this this is very
very important okay and I want you guys
to be more aggressive I don't know like
uh like now we have 7080 OD okay let let
me let me have a poll how many of you
have given general surgery exam how many
are done with general surgery exam
please how many are done
one 2 3 4
five this is yeah yeah you see so few
people are not responding guys come out
okay no one is going to see your marks
number one no one is going to see your
marks no one is going to talk about your
marks okay okay the point here is the
exam is going to give you a factor exam
is going to give you a Fear Factor exam
is going to tell you where you are at
exam is going to tell you how far you
have to run exam is going to tell you
what are the modifications that you need
to do in the preparation for a better
outcome now I'm giving an open statement
people who give exams regularly people
who analyze the exams regularly people
who identify their mistakes and people
who work on their mistakes are going to
be in the list
finally it's okay you may have to 6,000
MDS seats in the country okay it's not a
big deal uh you see 25,000 students are
going to give exam and you see 6,000
seats are there means every fourth
person is going to get a seit we don't
have a heavy uh brainstorming
competition here okay maybe you see like
thousand or 2,000 students are going to
prepare at their best but uh most of the
students okay the most of the students
they fall in other category okay so
every fourth or every fifth student is
going to get an MDS seat okay it's not
like 100 out of one it's not like 200
out of one okay every one of of the five
students is going to get a seat so
you're going to get a seat okay
that may be a government seat that that
may be a private seat that may be a
deemed seat that may be a state level
seat all India seat so many seats you
may get a clinical you may get a
non-clinical and again in the clinical
you have so many departments upper
departments lower departments passion
oriented departments non
clinicals lots of things are there lots
of options so don't worry about the
options pakka you will get a seat when
every fifth student is getting a seat I
hope like you guys will be in that five
of one not a deal but now I want you to
be more
aggressive here we require more like you
should be more serious about your goals
okay more punctual about your goals
don't find a reason for for your
inability for example like I was asking
like one of the student uh have we given
exam the student is going to tell like
I'm posted in Endo Department means
preparing a reason it sounds funny the
reason reason of not giving an exam is
posted in Endo
Department okay do you do you accept
this okay so don't come out with the
explanation for your failure or for your
inability okay make sure you try to keep
some space try to finish the exam try to
analyze the exam then post your
questions to the mentor not subject
oriented questions sir this is how I
have prepared this is what the marks I
got how can I improve
so this analysis is very very important
analyzing the question and understanding
the concept and whenever you see new
questions from new areas adding them to
your preparation moving ahead with a
good positive mindset in the entire
phase of the next 10 months is going to
give you extraordinary
ranks clear clear right before before
analyzing the question paper so these
are the few things like so let me like
now we have 75 to 80 students I think
like few students may see this in the
recorded version if they're free okay uh
right so I want a promise from all the
75 students okay all the 75 my team is
recording who's who are these 75
students live okay so all these 75
students give me one promise from next
time whether you finish the syllabus
completely or not I want you to take the
exams properly let it be a topic
specific or let it be a subject specific
a promise from all of you are you in for
this are you in all
7
78 let's take a because this is all for
you what I'm what who am I in this I'm
just a mentor I'm just a guide who going
to guide you let's take the exam nothing
wrong okay nothing wrong no one is going
to hit you no one is going to scold you
no one is going to make a comment on you
no one is going to pull your legs give
exam give exam it's on the website okay
I want every one of you to give exams
right okay let let's I see a very good
response thank you so much let's give
exams let's give exams okay let's give
more exams let's read more content let's
understand the content let's revise the
content again and again and again and
again okay right okay very good now
coming to
analysis now this time as it is a first
analysis I don't don't want to talk
about the marks and all these things so
I'm going to talk about the P pattern of
analysis so let's consider the final
exam okay let's consider the final exam
not about general surgery I'm talking
about one exam let's consider your final
exam so final exam will be for 240
questions okay so this is available in
part A and Part
B part A will be for 100 mcqs Part B
will be for 140 so 240 and I hope you
guys know this every right answer plus4
and every wrong answer minus one and and
I hope you know this
too so now what is the point is uh in
this 240
questions like I'm talking about the top
two th000 to 2,000 let's consider they
were top 1 to 2,000 creamy students
means students who has a very decent uh
decent round of reading okay so in this
top 2,000 2,000 students can able to
answer 160 to 180 questions their Jone
this is their
Jone their Jone okay if you go into top
500 top 200 The Jone The Jone will
decrease okay The Jone will decrease for
example maybe the top 500 has ability to
handle 180 to 200 questions and it's not
mandatory that all 200 out of 200 they
have they attempted will go right okay
right so their Jone so this is the Jone
they know the top 2,000 people they know
a Jone of 160 to 180 mcqs okay for
example let's consider as 180 mcqs so
these people who are in the top 2,000
they don't know how many mcqs they don't
know 60 mcqs they don't
know and these people who are in the top
500 they are acceptable to 200 mcqs but
they don't know 40
mcqs clear clear clear clear I want I
want your
response so in the second thing is so
this first fellow 2,000 below
fellows they know 180 Concepts out of
240
and 500 below people they know around
like 200 Concepts out of
240 they know out of 200 Concepts out of
240 now the next thing comes is accuracy
like you see you guys see regularly
you're giving exams okay do you accept
that even when when you know a
particular concept you're going wrong do
you accept this you know a concept but
even then after reading the concept
because of lack of revision or because
of confusion in the question or twist in
the question or some XYZ factors what is
happening is you're going wrong even
after knowing
it so that is that is how the people are
going to differ for example I'm talking
about one category that is 2,000
below 2,000 below so 2,000 below people
are having access to 20 180 questions
out of 240 I again in this 2,000 below
you have four categories category one is
500
below Category 2 is 1,000
below Category 3 is500 below and
category 4 is 2,000
below what is difference all these
people they know this 180 questions they
are good with this 180 Concepts but rank
is varying why rank is varying because
their accuracy in this 180 questions
will be High
For This 180 this 500 below students
means for example the 500 below
students have an accuracy
of around like 160 Plus or 160 to 170
Plus in this 180 questions and coming to
category B that is th000 below they are
having a
moderate what is that moderate their
range is 150 to 160 right answers 1,500
below
their range is 140 to 150 right answers
2,000 below their range is 130 to 140
right answers clear people know
everything okay these 2,000 students
they know all these 180 questions but
their accuracy in attempting a question
in a particular concept which they
already know is high here moderate here
and minimal and low here clear means
your reading is fine you and your friend
reading the the same content when you
give an exam if I'm talking about a
particular mcqs you know both of you
know the same content but your friend is
going to get five marks extra and you're
going to get five marks uh less the
reason of this five marks extra and five
marks low is basically accuracy how the
accuracy what what are the reasons for
what are the factors which are going to
control the accuracy anyone any any
reasons you have observed in in the
accuracy in the last couple of mon
months of your
reading any any one
reasons it is revision one important
reason is revision you revise the things
again and again again and again make
sure even if you know revise the things
the second one is give
exams because exams are going to tell
your weak
points you work on weak points
your marks will increase your accuracy
will increase you do revision your
accuracy will increase you are more
serious about everything around you
during the preparation phase everything
around you during reading okay your
accuracy will
increase reading properly question
reading properly reading the question
properly in the examination Hall
in the examination Hall reading the
question properly in the examination
Hall understanding the question properly
in the examination Hall will improve the
accuracy means the three
hours of your
exam you're more focused your accuracy
will increase so these are the things
which are going to make a difference
between a ranker who is in the range of
1,500 to 2,000 who's in the range of, to
1500 who is in the range of 500 to th000
who is 500 below all the students will
have same IQ okay and all the students
will read the same content okay but why
the approach is going to different why
there are few variations in their
rankings is basically because they may
be lagging in the
revision few of you who got a higher
rank may not be much focused on giving
exams even they give exams they don't
analyze the exams they give exams okay
that's all give the exam submit it see
the answers leave it they don't analyze
their weak points they don't work on
their weak points they may not be very
serious in the preparation ah cool Dias
sit and when one of your friend is
calling for a movie ah
cello that is your difference between
two friends like one friend who is more
serious if if a friend is calling for a
movie is going to tell you today I have
a class I have a PR live class I have to
attend it maybe tomorrow we can plan for
the movie or today I have a general
surgery examination okay we'll catch up
for the movie for the second show okay
for The Late Night show because I'll try
to finish the exam in the evening
session and I'll try to check out the
answers evening if if late evening if
you plan for a movie I can join so these
people I'm not asking you to quit the
plans I'm asking you to be more serious
about your goals okay so you can clearly
convey them to your friends that is what
seriousness seriousness is not something
like quitting the preparation okay
keeping a serious facial expressions
sitting at a corner okay reading always
that is is not seriousness seriousness
is making the priorities you make a
priority which is more important
watching a movie now before giving an
exam or watching a movie after giving an
exam okay so you prepare your
seriousness seriousness is not something
like you you're becoming a psychopath I
see like few students seriousness is
something like they want to become a
psychopath okay they don't want to talk
with their friends they don't want to
interact with anyone they don't want to
enjoy they don't want to go for a movie
okay they want to be serious okay shout
on everyone that is not that is not
seriousness seriousness is priorities
okay keeping exam or keeping preparation
as a first priority in the upcoming uh
couple of days is the most important I
see like last year I see once the exam
was thought to be on February 9th and uh
the exam was just a
second and the exam was postponed to
March 18th and once I see my offline
students I see uh a day before the
postponement there are like 60 70
students reading in the room once the
exam is postponed by 30 days I see no
one in the room like five people are
reading in the room that is not
seriousness okay that is that is not how
you behave once the exam is postponed
you you keep your priorities okay so
this is what the seriousness that what
we really require and uh and and
Performing your best in the examination
Hall is one of the important thing uh
just just a
minute getting so many calls I want to
keep the mobile on
silence you got it right you got it what
what are my four factors the four
factors which are completely in your
control the four factors which are
completely in your control is revision
okay keep time for revision make sure
make sure every day every day keep 10
percentage of your time for revision
okay uh gri how many hours you reading
per day Shan how many hours you reading
per day just just a rough idea it's not
mandatory okay how many hours you guys
are reading shti how many hours you you
you reading here okay right let it be
okay let's consider someone is selling
let's consider it is eight hours eight
hours you're reading or let's consider
it as 10 hours you're reading per day so
in 10 hours keep 10 percentage of time
only for revision means if you're
reading 10 hours keep one hour for
revision every day if you're reading 5
hours keep 30 minutes for revision every
day means every day 30 minutes will be
for revision like for example now
regularly I have regularly a student is
having a habit of sleeping at uh 10:00
or 11:00 in the night okay make sure the
last last 45 minutes or last half an
hour is a solid revision so whatever I
have done from the morning okay for
example today I have done uh General
pharmacology so what are the important
things in Pharmacology okay modes of
administration are important okay in
which what are the important points
which ma'am has discussed or which you
have written click those points try to
recollect those points whenever you
stuck at a particular point just open
your notes see it and close your eyes
and try to recol the other points okay
now clinical trials are there what are
phases phases one phase two phase three
phase four what is happening adverse
drug reactions are there zero order
kinetics is there first order kinetics
is is there what are the drugs following
zero kinetics yeah there's a one code
okay are are you able to recollect it or
not if you're not able to recollect open
the book and see close it again try to
recollect so this is how you have to do
the revision okay so every day last half
an hour or 45 minutes you have to
exclusively plan what you have done
today what you have done today try to
recollect it and the last 10 minutes
before you sleep check out what is
tomorrow's topic check out what what is
tomorrow's topic and what you need to do
what are the highlights of the topic
okay something like a trailer of
tomorrow's movie tomorrow you have a
movie of 8 hours or a 6 hours now you
should have a glance of the trailer for
the last 10 to 15 minutes plan your day
tomorrow before the before you sleep so
these are something which are going to
make you
more oriented towards your goal okay
next take the subject specific next they
they take the topic specific where you
losing an McQ McQ you're losing an McQ
in area which you already exposed or McQ
which is already exposed or McQ which
you are not exposed so identify them
mark them okay add some good qualities
okay so try to spend more quality of
time with yourself then you will find
out what is good and bad in you related
to the preparation and personally too
okay and make sure when whenever you
giving an exam let it be a topic
specific let it be a subject specific
you should be atmost focused it is not
something like you hear you hear a a
volume of songs on one side and you give
exam on other side in the middle of the
exam your mother is going to call you to
have dinner you keep your exam aside go
finish your dinner and come back this is
not how we give exam this is how your
final exam is going to be
done people sit in suine semi suine
position give exam this is how your
final exam is going to be no every exam
let it be a topic specific let it be a
subject specific that is your final exam
so if you follow the principles here you
can follow the same principles
there okay what is the mode of hearing a
class you you you sleep reclining and
hear a class on the bed how do you hear
the class you watch smart videos right
how do you watch a smart
video how I sitting now are able to see
how I'm sitting now to take a
class how you have to sit when you're
hearing a
class chitchatting with your mother on
one side and hearing a class right doing
head masses on one side and hearing a
class there are few girls last year I
have seen Pro live class they kept their
video on and mother is doing head masses
for the girl and girl is hearing the
class pharmacology even if you keep
atmost
Focus let let's take pharmacology you
keep atmost focus and you hear the class
you don't understand trust me you don't
understand pharmacology
okay have you remember those days like
how you used to fight to um tell the vaa
related to the sephos sporin
classification have you remember sephos
sporin classification nightmare for most
of the dental students during second
year
pharmacology do you accept it
pharmacology so normally if you hear the
class only you don't understand you keep
reclin sleeping position under
pillow okay come on be serious this is
seriousness hearing the class in which
you have to hear it you can understand
something you can grasp something from
the class okay so that's what I'm
telling like seriousness in the last
three hours in the final
exam will have a big impact on your life
how serious you are and how the things
you are going to maintain now you are
going to extend the same things over
there okay so this is a big big big eye
opening guys to all of you NE 2024 is
not in the Jone where students think
take things granted you have to be very
very serious about uh the 3 hours of the
exam let it be the time management Let
It Be house how focused you are in those
three hours has a bigger bigger impact
okay right so now I'll be talking about
uh like how to I told you right how to
analyze the paper analysis
so keep a book keep a
book keep a extra one exclusive book for
the analysis so in this
analysis you try
to make a
table so the table is going to tell
you number of
questions okay for example let it be a
question number okay let it be like
write down the write down the entire
analysis of a paper so that you can get
the pattern what is that question number
one in surgery exam for example there is
a question Pap of 120 mcqs so question
number one is right answer for you okay
is right answer for you and question
number two is the right answer for you
question number three is wrong okay is
wrong now you're analyzing why it is
wrong and I want you to drop in this
particular uh uh particular box okay so
questions which are right
right questions questions which are
right but but you are not
clear sometimes you don't know the
concept properly you'll be confused in
the exam but you keep something it will
be right clear questions which which you
know which are right questions which you
which are right which you not
clear not
clear third category questions which are
right but you don't know anything here
it is not clear option number two block
number two is not clear you know okay I
know thyroglossal duct Sy but whatever
question that is given in the exam I'm
not clear but it is right sometimes
question which you don't know the
concept which you don't know but by
fluke or by luck you kept right so these
are three categories of right questions
okay so what are three categories of
right questions okay you know you're
right it is right but you're not clear
you're right but you don't know the
concept clear with these three
categories of questions so after every
exam you have to analyze the paper and
write out how many questions fall under
this category how many questions fall
under this category how many questions
fall under this
category okay
now wrong answer categories so wrong
answer categories again you have three
categories wrong and you don't
know wrong and you're not
clear wrong and you know you know
everything about the question everything
about the thyroglossal duct C but you
went wrong so you have three categories
of questions with wrong answers three
categories of questions with right
answers so tell
me in these six categories which two
categories should be more for
you in the six categories which two
categories should be more for you after
analysis
which two
categories this category should be
more and this category should be
more because for example in an exam you
are going wrong for a question which you
don't know yes it is good it is good it
is accepted because you don't know the
concept and you went wrong or you did
not attempt it that is okay because the
ultimate goal of us to improve the
accuracy not to find out the answers of
the questions which you don't know why
you bothering about the questions which
you don't know for example you're giving
a final year Theory exam okay so there
are somewhere around like 20
Questions okay there around 20 questions
you know answers for 18 questions you'll
be more worried to perform better in the
18 questions or you are more worried to
perform the two questions which you
don't know which you want to create
which you want to find out so my goal
I'm telling it's let's focus on those 18
18 will give you good rank perform that
18 18 well and if you perform that 18
well and leave those last two questions
attempt them the paper Setter will be
very comfortable like super this fellow
is very good okay attempted well and
last slowly in the last two questions
even if your performance is not well
he's going to drop some extra marks for
you this is a simple logic that you have
to follow right so for questions
questions which are right and you know
should be more and questions which you
don't know and you are wrong should be
the next one okay so questions which you
are not clear what what may be the
reason if you're not clear you know the
concept but you're not clear here we
require
revision questions which you know but
you went wrong reason for that may be
overconfidence
maybe not reading the question properly
or not checking the options properly or
instead of like you overconfidence will
lead to in the examination your class
one will become class two class two will
become class three category two will
become Category 3 Category 3 will become
because you have overconfidence and you
simply Overlook the question and you you
forgot the question okay right
clear clear right so these two columns
are very
important not clear is basically due to
revision you're going wrong for a known
question is basically due to
overconfidence or not reading the
question properly so guys from this exam
like probably once you're done with
general surgery exam go back keep six
columns okay make sure drop how many
questions fall under each category and
try to
analyze the question paper and then
we'll try to find out the ways to
decrease your wrong answers and improve
your right answers this is the only
analysis implementation I want you to
follow for the next five
examinations after five examinations
we'll discuss few more techniques to
improve your wrong answers and to
increase your accuracy I don't want you
guys to end up with 2,000 rank I want
you guys to end up with 500 below or
th000 below the only mantra for a ranker
of 2, 2,500 to get into thousand below
is what what is that reading more books
right that's what we do right we want
more marks we read more
books you read more content join two
coaching Center get access to two more
apps a good methodology for a ranker of
2,00 to 2,500 to get into 500 below
th000 below is revision read the same
content again again don't read the
number of contents don't increase the
number of books don't increase the
materials here we require more accuracy
because the number of questions 2,000
ranker attempt will be same as the
number of questions 500 ranker or
thousand ranker attempt the only
difference is what is that number of
right answers and number of wrong
answers 2,000 Vell will have more right
answer more wrong answers and less right
answers when compared with the ranker
500 below but you see the number of
attempts of both 500 ranker as well as
2000 ranker are what are they are they
are
same okay so please give exams analyze
the exams understand where you're going
wrong and Implement your skills and time
in overcoming that particular Fear
Factor in overcoming that particular
Factor okay so now I see today uh
morning I got calls from few of you okay
sir less marks can you tell me the names
of other books what you have to read so
what you want to do you want to read
more books or you want to do more
revision okay let's focus on revision
okay so revision is important so let's
everyone focus on the revision I will
also try my best to revise the things
the same things again and again again
and again again and again on the group
so let's work with the strategy and
let's achieve our goals
clear clear clear
okay right okay so this is uh this is
what I feel like I need to discuss with
you today uh and uh the next one is uh
sh shall we have a brief outline of
pharmacology are you
ready okay first and foremost thing
about pharmacology
okay I I'm just going to talk the
outline of pharmacology so
pharmacology according to many
generations who are preparing for the
neat entrance examination or in entrance
exam this is the most difficult subject
of all all alltime difficult subject
even I see when I'm preparing uh
preparing 10 years back I see many of my
friends including me we are we have that
a glance of phobia towards the
pharmacology so I accept this
pharmacology is one of the toughest
subject and it will become more tough if
you don't read it in a proper way if you
don't read it in a proper way it is
normally tough if you don't read it in a
proper way it is going to be more tough
okay right now outline of
pharmacology uh so neat is going to
carry 14 to 16
marks in Pharmacology and this
pharmacology is covered
everywhere every subject is going to
have a pharmacology for example like you
take except probably um your community
except Community everywhere you have
pharmacology for example oral pathology
yes you have infections and infections
treatment plan is pharmacology oral
medicine you have pharmacology okay R
oral Radiology sometimes oral Radiology
they can give an inclined question like
for example whenever the patient is
going for radiotherapy okay so what are
the drugs to be given or something like
they can they can inter relate not
Radiology oral Radiology radiation
therapy related okay such a questions
can also come from pharmacology okay
right you see oral surgery pharmacology
Endo they can ask pharmacology because
whenever you have endodontic infections
conditions which require ANS conditions
which require uh like your antibiotics
or whenever for example like triple
antibiotic
paste is a pharmacology question what
are the drugs included in triple
antibiotic based is a pharmacology
question conservative yes pharmacology
question can so pharmacology question
can come from everywhere and
particularly when you're talking about
OS and GS okay and general medicine
pharmacology questions will be high
integrated questions for example like
your L
GA local anesthesia general anesthesia
are a part of pharmacology okay right
and Pharmacology can be system wise
again G drugs respiratory drugs renal
drugs Endocrinology related drugs CVS
drugs CNS drugs ANS drugs so it is a
system wise okay so the main reason of
planning to finish pharmacology ahead of
many other subjects is this year
particular this year is we'll get more
time more time for
revision and what I'm planning is like
for example once we are done with
pharmacology
I'll try to add one topic of
pharmacology revision along with every
other subject for example next like for
example you're doing community
Dentistry so I'm going to add two extra
days for Community dentistry and add CVS
drugs or next subject if I'm planning to
do
operative I'll add one day and I'll try
to add General pharmacology topic as a
revision so I want to do more revision
and forceful revision of for
pharmacology with you along with the
other subjects so that is the primary
reason why I want to start pharmacology
now
clear okay now now what is the plan plan
for pharmacology for example you asking
me checklist of
pharmacology let's don't jump into 100
books let's keep one book simple book
what is that
book spur Gupta stick on to Spur Gupta
and make sure
don't go very deep into all the topics
okay there are few topics which you have
to go deep okay what is that the topics
which I have given uh more time okay I
hope you have seen the schedule which
topics I have given more
time hope you have seen the schedule
right which topics I have given more
time yes I have given more time to
chemotherapy yes what are the other
topics which I given more time topics
which I have given more time is General
pharmacology you have you have seen like
some topics which I given only one day
those topics you don't need to go very
deep okay you stick on to Smart Video
followed by try to solve as many mcqs as
possible from spash
Gupta okay reading synopsis in spash
Gupta will take more time so I want you
to read synopsis okay so topics which I
have given more time is chemotherapy
General pharmacology the other important
topics are LA and GA but LA and GA I
want you to
cover like basing upon the convenience I
want either you can cover these things
along with the present subject or you
can cover these things along with oral
surgery or general surgery okay so we'll
we'll we'll try to plan and we'll try to
do it because oral surgery anyway you
have covered your La so now we'll try to
cover GA or if you're not done with LA
during your Oral Surgery you can plan
now so the main important topics the
major topics are
chemotherapy General
pharmacology LA and
GA okay the next comes for a
dentist emergency
drugs emergency drugs and the last
important is drug
interactions Dental drug interactions
dentist oriented drug interactions these
are the major topics of pharmacology for
these topics it's good as much as you do
for example like I'm going to give the
checklist of these five topics okay uh
chemotherapy chemotherapy I want you
guys to uh focus more on Smart
videos if possible try to read
synopsis of spash gup
for topics like penin sephos sporin
tetracyclin most of the antibiotics okay
most of the antibiotics and
anti-viral okay for these two topics
it's good if you read synopsis even if
it is okay because the most important
questions where 90% of the questions are
coming from they are covered in the
smart videos okay but if you have time
it's better you read for these topics
one is antibiotics second one is
antiviral okay right clear okay the next
one is once you're done with this so you
can come for the evening
activity activity on the WhatsApp okay
try to attend it and take the topic
specific
exam and if you're done with this
particular sequence repeat this sequence
again and again again and again again
and again no need to do anything extra
again and again oh yeah make sure you're
done with as many mcqs as possible in
spur Gupta and you see you see there are
more mcqs but the point here is the mcqs
will be overlapped means same McQ will
be given again and again again and again
okay okay so you see one drug of choice
question will be repeated four or five
times I hope like people who have solved
it they'll get to know don't see the
bulk of the book you see uh you try to
practice it so once you feel the
questions are overlapped okay make sure
you try to strike it off I don't know
like how many of you are doing doing on
hard copy and how many of you are doing
on soft copy but make sure overlapped
questions please do Strike It Off
questions which are unique please do
mark them so those unique questions you
are going to revise again again again
and again those striking of questions
you are not going to repeat again and
again clear Smart Video is going to give
you the basement what is required 90% of
the questions and this is going to be
the
practice okay same goes next one General
pharmacology same the checklist is same
clear L GA L ga la for example
La smart
videos smart videos will be in the
folder of oral
surgery I want you to focus on L
GA part of dental pulse mcqs here you
need to do EMP pulse mcqs okay similarly
I want you to read La synopsis
of dental pulse in your oral surgery
synopsis mcqs if time permit you can do
from oral surgery because oral surgery L
mcqs will not be on the it contains both
pharmacology based La mcqs as well as
clinical La mcqs that is they're going
to talk about what is PSA all your
blocks and everything whatever a to J
they're going to cover okay so you plan
accordingly if you have time yes it's
good you go back cover them if you don't
have time you can stick on to the
synopsis synopsis of dental pulse which
is very good pharmacology based synopsis
which will be covered in your oral
surgery then evening
activity okay then the topic specific
ex this is for La
clear now coming to ga
ga same as
pharmacology chemotherapy how you have
done chemotherapy GA no pulse okay stick
on to uh the
pharmacology part you try to check out
the video first try to finish the video
first so once you're done with the video
please try to check out the synopsis of
SP Gupta then try to solve the McQ of
spash Gupta evening activity and take
the topic specific
exam then comes the emergency drugs
emergency drugs will be a part of
medical emergencies will be a part of
Med emergencies okay what is the medical
emergency drug that is given in the case
of asthma for a patient on a dental
chair hypoglycemic shock what to be done
hyperglycemic shock what to be done okay
there is an anaphylactic uh uh shock for
a patient due to Allergy of La what drug
has to be given how much doses has to be
given which route it has to be given so
it is emergency drugs are preferably the
emergency medical emergency related
drugs of choice or normal drugs of
choice you can plan
accordingly which I'll be updating you
on the group okay and similarly drug
interactions drug interactions you have
uh a six to seven pages of uh textbook
based notes okay directly a few pics
from the textbook taken from medical
emergencies of malamed okay all the drug
interactions that a dentist has to know
this is available as
a this is available as a smart notes in
oral surgery
folder
clear these are the five important very
very important must do uh topics and
their checklists of pharmacology for an
MDS conquer student exclusively because
you have access to few content refined
content you can follow
this now the next one
is uh you you have the other topics like
what is the other topics gits git drugs
CVS drugs CNS drugs
ANS drugs Ral
drugs and uh Endocrinology Endocrinology
is going to talk about diabetic
drugs thyroid drugs antithyroid drugs
some all this all this stuff so in this
in this miscellaneous topics you have
covid drugs you have skeletal muszle
relaxants lots of things like opioids
NSS NSS NSS is very very important okay
NSS I want you guys to add
NSS also to the major topic because one
of the most commonly used drug in
dentistry right NSS NSS also please try
to uh add into the main topic and try to
do the same methodology how we have done
for the other the major major topics of
pharmacology now coming to G G and all
these things like CVS cnss and all these
things I want you to follow the same
checklist what is the
checklist first is smart video
