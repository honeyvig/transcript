hi venus
this is dr srikant from team inbd
conquer
now i am here to discuss one short
important topic okay so the word cpp acp
is
now very familiar most commonly seen in
the examination
so the full form of ctp acp
is kessin phosphopeptide
amorphous calcium phosphate okay
so ah this is basically
a milk derived protein okay you can see
casein which is
a milk derived protein okay so this cpp
acp is now
common in many ingredients okay one is
like you can see this in the toothpaste
okay as a paste form you can see in the
chewing gum forms that is trident
or recalident because again recall
dentist is the most commonly
word that is used in the examination
hall okay this is again present in
mi based okay so it is present in the mi
paste also so it is
uh like it is co it is in combination
used with composites
it is in combination used with many
other new advanced
restorative material also okay so these
materials are called as a smart material
so basically what is this uh casing
phosphor wefted amorphous calcium
phosphate if you go in detail
the very important things that you have
to make a note it is basically derived
from
protein okay so the wording is very very
important
it is basically derived from protein and
it is
a nanotechnology related protein okay so
it is a nanotechnology
related protein and it is developed from
the university of
melbourne okay so these are very
commonly asked questions
which is developed from the university
of
melbourne okay so as already discussed
it is a protein but it is derived from
the milk you can
underline the word casing casein
phosphorus is a
one that is derived from the milk
protein so proteins will always have
an ammonia acid sequence okay so again
ammonia acid sequence can be most
commonly asked question
the ammonia acid sequence in this is sir
sir sir and
glute glute okay so ser
you have three cells and two glutes that
is they can call it as ppp
and glute glute okay so this is an
ammonia acid sequence of this
gasin amorphous calcium phosphate okay
so
uh as already discussed it is most
commonly used in many many areas
so if you just normally take a dental
structure for example
seeing a simple dental structure like a
teeth
okay so the teeth is surrounded by
saliva in the oral cavity
and saliva has a normal ph of
around like seven okay sometimes it's
like six point seven to seven point two
is the ph
so what happens whenever you have the
bacteria and everything are added the ph
of saliva is going to drop
down and it's going to hit 5.2 to 5.5
which you can consider it as a critical
ph critical ph of
saliva most commonly asked question what
is the critical ph critical ph is 5.2 to
5.5
so whenever it hit it it it hits the
critical ph
what is going to happen it's very simple
like the uh the enamel starts
demineralizing
demineralization of enamel starts okay
so after again again after sometimes the
critical ph
may goes up and the ph may hits like
this then
again what happens is remineralization
occur what is lost is going to come back
so so this remineralization and
demineralization cycle
they moves around a particular value
that particular value is
critical ph so remineralization occurs
from the
things which are present in the saliva
so what is the extra advantage of adding
this
cpp acp is very simple like around the
teeth the cppacp this case in amorphous
calcium phosphate is going to form
an error okay so in this you will have
more in this you will have
more calcium and phosphorus when
compared to
a normal saliva so you'll have more
availability of these calcium and
phosphorus
in this particular leak around the
ground so
the chances of re-mineralization chances
of re-mineralization
uh remediation will be
high when
this particular cpp acp is induced and
that is the main reason why
this particular agent is being added
nowadays to the composite also
so whenever you have a composite which
contains cpp acp
whenever there is a critical ph that is
hitting you how
you will have demineralization so this
cpp acp that is present in the composite
is going to release into the
oral cavity and by which the
remineralization chances
will be increased okay i hope you are
very clear with this cppacp
this is becoming a most commonly used
term
in the recent examinations of integrated
inbd okay so this is very very important
for all the entrance examinations
okay this is a new thing okay a new
thing an advanced thing that is going to
like that that's as of now available in
the market but
uh may not be covered in the most of the
mcq books and textbooks so please do
make a note about this
cpp acp okay so you have some few things
like you have you can see
mi paste here you can see gcm my paste
here gc truth mouse again
tooth mouse is an important area where
cpp icp so they can sometimes they can
ask this
plus sometimes you can see my place this
is my paste plus this is c
tooth okay
plus is nothing but added fluorides in
it regularly cppsp is normal thing if
you have
cpp acp agent plus means you'll have
extra fluorides in it
i hope you are very clear about this
particular content stay tuned to the
group if you like this video please do
hit a like
okay and if you have any doubts or if
you if you feel like some more
content has to be added or some more
information has to be shared please do
drop your comments on the comment box
okay so we have collected few recent
advanced
rqs in in the last one to two months and
we have planned to decide a number of
videos on this like if you if you know
further argues you can drop it on
the comment box and we are ready to help
you out
