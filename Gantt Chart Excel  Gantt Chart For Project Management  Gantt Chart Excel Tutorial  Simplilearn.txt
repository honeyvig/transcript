let's get started with our one point
agenda for today's discussion that is
how to create gantt charts in excel
now for this particular example we are
going to use the employs data
now let's quickly get back to the
practical mode and enter into excel
now you can see that we are on excel
sheet right now
so let me expand my screen a little bit
so that the data is a little more
visible
yeah
so here on my screen you can see that we
have employees data so the first column
is the name of the employees and the
second column is the start dates of the
employees that when have they started
working with the organization and when
they have ended or resigned to their
position in that particular organization
and the duration gives us the number of
days they have worked in that particular
organization so to create a gantt chart
is really simple you just have to select
the data
and then go to the insert option and in
there you can see the charts icon
and select all charts and in that select
the bar chart and here you can see
the stacked bar chart select that and
press ok and there you go you have the
stacked bar chart right on your screen
let's expand this a little more so that
we have the clear visualization of the
dates as well
now you can
if you want you can change the
title as org data or employee data
and now we are partially done with our
chart now the next thing we have to do
is select the bar chart right click on
it select data and here select the add
icon
now you need to select the series name
so the series name is duration for our
gantt chart and series values are
let's select this
and select let's move a little
yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
gantt chart on my screen right here
select okay and it's done
and still now it's not complete yet so
to finish it you need to select the blue
colored bars here and right click on
them
and select format data series
go to the fill icon
and select no fill
and it's
done for now and you can see that there
is a difference in this particular
arrangement we had joe at the first
place and susan at the last place but
here you can see joe is in the last
place and susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse order
and there you go it should be done
and there you go you have your gantt
chart right on your screen
so i hope this was clear with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
