hello everyone and welcome to Simply
Lear in today's tutorial we are going to
learn how to install Kali Linux on
Virtual box and discuss various other
ways through which you can install K
Linux on your desktop operating system
and various kinds of operating systems
and I should mention that that Kali
Linux is a powerful tool for cyber
Security Professionals and Enthusiast so
today I will guide you through the inst
ination process step by step so let's
get straight into it and so first we
will install K Linux in Virtual box and
I will tell you other ways also from
that you can do that but today as it is
convenient way to install in Virtual box
using Windows simultaneously so we'll be
using virtual box and in between while
downloading the virtual box and the Kali
Linux while it would be downloading I
will tell you guys all the ways through
which we can install Kali Linux so if
you want to jump start to the
installation part you can watch the time
stamp to install it in the virtual box
and jump to it and if you want to see
other ways also just carry on with us

below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back and before commencing guys just a
quick info for you if you are an
aspiring cyber security professional
looking for online training and
certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security from MIT University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
a right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below so now
we'll move to setting up virtual box so
first thing we need to watch is
considerations and first we'll move to
virtual box
website so this is Oracle VM virtual box
we'll move to the download section and
here we have Windows host option so
we'll click on that and get this
application
downloaded so as it is downloading we'll
move to K Linux website
and we'll download the ISO file so that
we can install it in the virtual
box so here you can see that this is
64-bit version so we'll download the ISO
file and it is around
4GB so it would be taking time to
download and with this process we will
discuss the various ways with that you
can install Kali Linux in your system so
till then it gets downloaded so let's
discuss the ways with which you can
download the file and install on your
system so the number one ways direct
installation that is bare metal so this
involves installing Kali Linux directly
on the hardware as the primary operating
system so this method is straightforward
but erases all existing data on the disk
if not partition correctly then comes
the dual booting so dual booting allows
you to install Kali Linux alongside
another operating system such as Windows
or Mac OS this setup lets you choose
which OS to boot into at startup but it
requires careful disk partitioning and
boot loader configuration to ensure both
systems work without interference then
comes virtual machines so running Kali
Linux inside a virtual machine is a
popular choice for those who use
operating systems like Windows Mac OS or
other Linux distribution so tools like
vmw virtual box and parallel desktop
enable users to run K Linux in an
isolated environment we are using
virtual box here so this method is safe
as it doesn't affect the host operating
system and is ideal for testing and
educational purposes then comes live
boot so Kali Linux can be booted from a
USB stick or dvd without installation on
the hard drive so this live mode is
useful for temporary task and leaves no
Trace on the host computer once the USB
or dvd is removed it's also a good way
to test Khali without making any changes
to your system then comes persistent USB
similar to a live boot a persistent USB
installation allows you to save changes
and retain additional software
installations across reboots which the
standard live USB does not support then
comes windows subsystem for Linux that
is WSL for users on Windows 10 or
Windows 11 Kali Linux can be installed
as an application Through the Windows
subsystem for Linux that is WSL so this
allows you to run a Linux environment
directly in Windows without the need for
a dual boot setup or virtual machine
then comes doer containers so Kali Linux
can also run inside a doer container on
any system that supports Docker this is
a lightweight option that is
particularly useful for those who need
to run specific tools rather than the
whole K Linux environment then comes
Cloud deployment Ki Linux can be
deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS
Azure or Google Cloud this is beneficial
for performing security testing with
scalable resources now you'll see the
download option and first install
the virtual
box so here we have the virtual
box click on
that and follow the
process as Ive already installed the V
box on my system so we don't need to get
all the processes done here so guys you
can see that now we are installing the
virtual box as I will show you guys our
Kali Linux setup has also been
downloaded now moving back to Virtual
box so first thing we need to watch is
considerations for this number one would
be Hardware requirements that ensure
your system meets the hardware
requirements for the installation method
you choose and then comes the security
that is consider the security
implications especially for dual booting
and direct
installations this I'm talking about the
ways to install Kali Linux and the
purpose choose the installation method
based on your purpose example testing
learning professional and use and each
method suits different needs and setups
ranging from temporary use and learning
scenarios to Professional Security
testing environments so first we have to
make sure that virtual box is installed
on our system and if not we can download
it from the virtual box website as we
have downloaded it and to install
virtual box we need to have some enable
hardware virtualization I will show you
guys but before this we will install it
we don't need to alter anything so it's
showing that installing it will reset
your network connection and temporarily
disconnect you from the network proceed
with the installation now we'll proceed
with that and if there are missing
dependencies we can install that also
and then comes the ready ready to
install section so this is the final
step you can click on that and and get
the things installed but as I already
installed the virtual box on my system
so I won't be installing it again so I
will cancel this process and open the
virtual box for you guys and what I was
telling you guys is you need to have
enabled hardware
virtualization and what you can do that
is just open the task manager by
clicking control or delete so here's the
task manager moving here you could see
here that virtualization is enabled so
if it is not enabled you can go to the
Bio Section and enable it and now we
have the virtual box here and we have
downloaded the Kali Linux ISO file and
now we'll see the direct installation so
first you need to click on new and name
your
VM so we will name name it as K
Linux and we don't need to select any
ISO image type is Linux and the version
will select is 64bit Debian so Debian 11
16
64bit and once we check here also what
we have
downloaded so that's
64bit 20
24.2 change log
so here we will select da 11 bull size
64bit then click on next and here you
have to allocate around 1,000 MB of ram
I would be allocating around 248 MB and
the processor I would be dedicating
would be around
three so three processor I have
dedicated and now we'll click on the
next section and here we have the dis
size so how much disk size you want to
allocate this so I would allocate around
35 GB that is 38 GB then click on
next and here you can find the summary
that you have set up a new system named
Kali Linux and that is running guest to
type that is dean1 buze 64bit then we
have the base memory processor and the
dis size then we'll click on finish now
we'll click on the settings
we'll configure some of the settings for
the
wmware and now in the general section
only we'll click on Advanced and here we
have the shared clipboard and here we
will turn it to B directional so what it
does is we can Now operate The Mouse and
the keyboard option both in Windows and
this virtual box so after this we will
move to display section and make the
video memory to to Max so what this does
is this is the graphic
controller and we'll set here as VMS
VGA and click on the enable 3D
acceleration so this will allow virtual
machine to use host machine
gpus now we'll click on
storage and click on
empty and then select the DVD icon and
here we will choose the file
that is what we have downloaded Kali
Linux and after that we will move to
network we will go to settings again
we'll move to
network and under Network we'll switch
to attach to option to bridged
adapter so this will allow access
similar to your main system via SSH
connection now I'll click okay and now
we'll click on the
start as you could see that it is
powering VM
up so you could see the installation sa
here we'll click on
install and now the system is asking for
the language we'll select
English then the area that would be
United States or you could choose
accordingly what you have and then the
key map to use we'll use the American
English only
you could see the process is moving
on as we have already discussed the ways
to install Linux on our systems number
one was direct installation then we had
the Dual boting and then we had the
virtual machines that we are currently
doing and after that we have the live
boot so what it's doing is configure the
network your network is probably not
using the DHCP protocol Al natively the
DCB server may be slow or some Network
Hardware is not working properly okay
we'll click
continue and we won't configure this at
this time now he's asking about the host
name and we'll set it as Kali only and
now he's asking for the full name
so we'll click on that that would be the
username of our account and now is
asking for the
password so I will blur this
out so he's asking about the clock
select your time zone will select this
only
and for beginners we'll select guided
use entire disk and confirm all changes
to the disk and choose allinone
partition and finish
partitioning write the changes to
disk yes
now we have the softwares to
install and we'll
select the genome
to and replace
XF and move to continue
and you can choose a software you want
to install for new users the default
section is typically fine or you can use
genome and unselect the
xfc now you can see that we have
installed the GRUB boot loader on our
virtual disk when prompted and now we
have finished the installation and now
we'll reboot it and now we'll reboot the
system and make sure to remove the
installation media which is the case
means that is unmounting the ISO from
the virtual box
settings so you can see that our Ki
Linux has been
installed and while booting it has
removed all the installation
processes and you could find here the
username and with password we'll move
on so this is how we install K Linux on
Virtual
box and I will show you guys
some of the
commands that you can run here we'll
open the
terminal and first thing we need to do
is update the system we have opened the
terminal and write a command that would
be sud
sudo apt update and
and sudo app
upgrade and now it's asking for password
I will write the password
here now you can see it has started
working on the updation and upgradation
of all the directories present in Kali
Linux so you could see that the summary
is upgrading Z installing Zer and
removing Zer and not upgrading zero as
we don't have any installed dependencies
here as we have just installed the Kali
Linux and if you want we can run other
commands also so to display the current
directory in which directory you are
just write PWD so you are in home aisar
and if you want to know all the files
here you could just write LS so it will
list all the files and directories in
the current directory so you could see
that in absar we have desktop documents
downloads music pictures public
templates and videos and if you want to
navigate into something or navigate to
the home directory what you can write as
CD and this
sign now you are in the home directory
you check it you could just write PWD
here you are in the home directory that
is PWD abar now if you want to create a
new directory so for that you can write
the command mkd that is make directory
and name the folder as testore
directory and now you could write LS to
list all the files and check if the
folder is created or not so you could
see that testore D is here and we have
created the new folder if you want to
move into this folder you just need to
write the folder name that is testore D
so now you are in the folder to check
that you can write the command PWD and
here you are home abisa test directory
