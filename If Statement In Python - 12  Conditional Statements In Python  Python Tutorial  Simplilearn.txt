hi everyone welcome to another video
tutorial on the python series by simply
learn
in this video we are going to learn
about python if statements
in the previous video we have already
learnt about the different python
conditional statements
here we will focus on if statement and
look at a small project in the end
so let's get started
in programming languages conditions play
a very crucial role
they help us develop programs that can
satisfy all the business conditions and
perform well
so conditional statements are useful
when we have to decide that a certain
condition or certain part of a code
should run only if the condition is true
so the if statement is an example of
conditional statements
the program will first
evaluate the test condition
and will only execute the code block if
the test conditional expression is true
so here you can see the syntax of
if statement first we have the
if keyword and inside
parenthesis we are going to pass the
condition
and
if this condition evaluates to true then
we go inside the body of the if
statement which is this part of the
syntax
now
while developing a code for a business
problem you might have to use multiple
conditions
so the alif statement is used when we
have to check multiple conditions so
here you can see
if the first test expression evaluates
to false then you have the alif
condition and
if the lift condition evaluates to true
then we go inside the body of the
elf statement which is this part of the
statement or the syntax that i'm
highlighting
next
so sometimes you want to evaluate a
condition and take one path if it is
true
but specify an alternative path if it is
not so this is done with an
else clause
so the else code block will run if the
expression is false
so here you can see if the
condition for the alif statement
returns false then we have the body of
the
else statement
and finally
after
all the if alif and else statements have
been executed we will execute if there
are any other statements which are
present outside the if condition now
moving ahead
we will use if else and elif statements
to write a program that will solve a
business problem
so based on the location and total
amount of the items we are going to find
the sipping cost
the locations are a few states in the
united states
in the if statement project we will ask
the user to enter the amount of the
package or the item
and we'll also ask the user to input the
state name
so for the different states we'll define
the conditions using the total amount of
the items and print the shipping cost
so let me take you to my jupyter
notebook where we'll
do this project
okay so i am on my jupyter notebook let
me just rename this
notebook i'll say if statement
and
project
all right
so
let me go ahead and
give a comment i'll say
package
delivery
cost
based on
the location
and total amount
all right
first and foremost i'll go ahead and
create a variable called total
now this will be
a user input so i'm using the input
function
and here i'll pass the message as enter
the
amount
for
the item
all right
next
i'll assign
another
variable
called state this is also going to be a
user input so i'm using the input
function
and i'll say
enter the
state name
in
usa
so these are the two
inputs we are asking from the user that
is to pass the
amount for the item and the
state in the usa
all right now we'll start with our first
if statement i'll write if
state
equal to equal to let's say my first
state name is texas
give a colon
make sure the syntax you are writing is
correct
now i am going to use
another if statement so this becomes a
nested if statement now
i'll write if
total which is my
item amount so i'm checking if total
amount
is
less than or equal to
150
then
i'm going to print
shipping cost
in
texas
is
let's say
30
all right
now i'll pass my next condition using
elif statement
since i'm using multiple conditions so
hence i'm going to use
the alif statement this time i'll write
if total
is greater than 150 and
if my total amount is
less than or equal to 250 dollars
then i'll say
print
i made a spelling mistake this should be
shipping
i'll say print
shipping
cost
in
texas
is
let's say
20
so usually if your
amount of the item is high then the
sipping cost is low
so here you can see if the total amount
for the package or the item is less than
150 dollars then your shipping cost is
30 dollars
but if it is between 150 and 250 your
shipping cost is less which is 20
then i'll say else
print
shipping
cost
in
texas
is
five dollars
so what basically this means is
if your total is less than or equal to
150
then
the shipping cost would be
30
if your total amount lies between 150 to
250 dollars your shipping cost is 20
and if the
cost of the item or the package is more
than
250
the cost is
five dollars
so this is for texas state
now moving ahead
i'll write alif
this time
we'll check the condition for state
let's say florida
i'll
use a colon here and say if
my total is less than equal to 150
then we'll print
shipping
cost
in florida
is
let's say 45 dollars
i'll use the ellipse statement again
i'll say lf
total
if it is
more than 150 dollars and
if it is
less than or equal to 250 dollars
i'll write print
shipping
cost
in
florida
is
let's say 35 dollars
next
i'll
write my else statement i'll say
print
shipping
cost
in
florida is
let's say 10
if the cost of the item is more than 250
now one thing to note here is the
shipping cost is different for the
different states in the u.s
all right
now we'll move on to our
next state let me
give a space here
i'll say lf
state equal to equal to let's see we'll
take
virginia now
i'll see if total
is
less than or equal to 150
dollars
will print
shipping
cost
in
virginia
is
let's say 23 dollars
all right
just scroll down
next i'll write my ellip
statement i'll say alif
total
is
greater than 150 dollars and
total
is
less than equal to two fifty dollars
then
will
print
just copy this message
paste it here
and we'll save shipping cost in virginia
is
15
next
we'll write our
else statement
else
print
replace the message again i'll say
shipping cost in virginia
is five dollars
in case the cost for the
items is more than two hundred and fifty
dollars
now moving to our final state
i'll write another alif statement i'll
say alif state equal to
equal to let's say new jersey
if
total
is less than equal to 150 dollars
then
we'll print
just paste the message here i'll say
shipping cost in
new jersey
is
let's say 40 dollars
now i'll say alif
total
if it is greater than 150 dollars and if
total is less than equal to 250 dollars
will print
just put this within double quotes
and
i'll say shipping cost in
new jersey
is
let's say
10 dollars
i'll say else
print
my shipping cost
is
free
in case
the
total amount for the items is
more than 250 dollars
right
finally
we'll have our
else statement where i'm going to print
invalid
state
name
in case the user enters any other state
apart from new jersey virginia florida
and texas
all right
so
we have our small project ready let me
just
run through it
so first we are declaring two variables
total and state and we are taking this
as user input so the user is going to
input the
amount for the item or the amount for
the package and then the user will input
the state
so we have the four states defined here
and we are checking the
shipping cost
for these four states
based on
the amount for the items
all right
now let me go ahead and run it
so here you can see we have our first
user input enter the amount for the item
let's see
i have my amount as
125
dollars
and
the next input is enter the state name
in usa i'll say
let's say florida
if i run this
it gives me the shipping cost in florida
is 45 dollars
let's go to the top and see what we have
now our total was
100 125
which is
less than 150 dollars and hence
it has printed shipping cost in florida
is 45
let's
run this again
this time i'll say
let's see my
item costs
255 dollars
in the state let's say new jersey
let's run it
you see here it gives us the message
shipping cost is free now the reason
being if you see
this part of the code
for state new jersey if the
total
amount for the items is
more than 250 dollars
the shipping cost is free
now let's try for another state
this time we'll see for virginia
let's say my
amount is
190
and my state is
virginia
if i run it it gives me the shipping
cost in virginia is 15
let's check our code
so here i have entered my
item amount to be 190 so it lies between
150 and 250 dollars and hence it has
printed the message that shipping cost
in virginia is 15
now let me enter another
state name that we have not
defined in our code let's say i have
my item amount as
290 dollars
and
the state name
i'll give us let's say colorado
if i run it it gives us the message as
invalid state which is present in the
last part of our code so
since we haven't defined any
shipping cost for colorado it has given
us the message that the state i am
trying to search for is invalid
you can check for
another state or any other country name
anything that is not
part of our
project
let's see i'll enter my amount as
hundred dollars
and this time i'll enter my state name
as
let's say ohio
and we'll run it it again gives us
invalid state
let's try out one last time i have my
package amount as 350 dollars
and let's see
my state is
alaska
again it says invalid state name because
we haven't defined any
condition for
alaska state
so this was a very simple project that
we did using
arip statement we saw how to write
nested if and we saw how to use the alif
and the
else statement
all right
so that brings us to the end of this
video tutorial on f statements in python
i hope it was useful and informative if
