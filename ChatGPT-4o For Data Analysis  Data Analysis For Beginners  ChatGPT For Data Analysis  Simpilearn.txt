hey everyone today data analysis has
taken a big leap forward with the new AI
tool called chat jpd 40 that is
developed by open Ai and this tool isn't
just for chatting it can look at large
amounts of data and find important
patterns and information in this
tutorial we will show you how CH GPT 40
can help with data analysis for instance
a small business might use it to figure
out which products are selling best and
predict what will be the popular in
future this makes Chad gp4 and 40 a
great tool for anyone who wants to make
better decisions based on data so join
us to see how this powerful AI can make
analyzing data easier and more effective
so let's start exploring the official
document and those who want to jump
straight to data analysis using chat
jp40 can directly jump to it with the
time stamp mentioned in the description
box craving a career upgrade subscribe
like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so here's the open a documentation
and you could see the new features
introduced with the CH GPD 40 so these
are the improvements uh one is the
updated and interactive bar graphs or
pie charts that you you can create and
these are the features that you could
see here you could change the color you
could download it and what we have is
you could upate the latest file versions
directly from Google Drive and Microsoft
One drive and we have the interaction
with tables and charts in a new
expandable view that I showed you here
that is here you can expand it in the
new window and you can customize and
download charts for presentations and
documents moreover you can create the
presentation also that will'll see in
further
and here we have how data analysis Works
in chat
jbt you could directly upload the files
from Google Drive and Microsoft One
drive I will show you guys how we can do
that and where this option is and we can
work on tables in real
time and there we have customized
presentation ready charts that is you
can create a presentation with all the
charts based on a data provided by you
and moreover a compreh security and
privacy feature so with that guys we'll
move to chat GPT and here we have the
chat GPT 40 version so before commencing
guys there's a quick info for you if
you're one of the aspiring data analyst
looking for online training and
graduating from the best universities or
a professional who elicits to switch
careers with data analytics by learning
from the experts then try giving a show
to Simply learns Purdue postgraduate
program in data analytics in
collaboration with IBM you can find the
link in the description box and pin
comand so let's get started with data
analysis part so this is the PIN section
or the insert section where you can have
the options to connect to Google Drive
connect to Microsoft One drive and you
can upload it from the computer this
option was already there that is upload
from computer and you can upload at
least or at Max the 10 files that could
be around Excel files or documents so
the max limit is 10 and if you have
connected to Google Drive I'll show you
guys uh I'm not connecting
you but you guys can connect it to and
you could upload it from there also and
there's another cool update that is
ability to quote directly in your chat
uh so while chatting with chat gbt I'll
show you guys how we can do that and you
could find some new changes that is in
the layout so this is the profile
section it used to be at the left bottom
but now it's move to the top right and
making it more accessible than ever so
let's start with the data analysis part
and the first thing we need is data so
you can find it on kager or you could
ask chat gypt 4 to provide the data I'll
show you guys so this is the kagle
website you can sign in here and click
on data sets you can find all the data
sets here that would be around Computer
Science Education classification
computer vision or or else you could
move back to chat
GPD and you could ask the chat GPT for
model to generate a data and provide it
in Excel format so we'll ask him we'll
not ask him can you we'll just ask him
provide a data
set that I can use for data
analysis
and provide in CSV
format so you could see that it has a
respond
that I can provide a sample data set and
he has started generating the data set
here so you could see that he has
provided only 10 rows and he is saying
that I will now generate this data set
in CSV format first he has provided the
visual presentation on the screen and
now is generating the CSV format so if
you want more data like if you want 100
rows or thousand rows you could specify
in the prompt and chat jpt will generate
that for you
so we already have the data I will
import that data you could import it
from here or else you can imported from
your Google Drive so we have a sales
data here we will open
it so we have the sales data here so the
first step we need to do is data
cleaning so this is the crucial step to
ensure that the accuracy of our analysis
is at its best so we can do that by
handling missing values that is missing
values can disto total analysis and here
chat gb4 can suggest methods to impute
these values such as using the mean
median or a sophisticated approach Based
on data patterns and after handling the
missing values we will remove duplicates
and outlier detection so we'll ask CH
GPT clean the
data if
needed so we can just write a simple
prom that would be clean the data if
needed and this is also a new feature
you can see the visual presentation of
the data here that we have 100 rows here
and the columns provided that is sales
ID date product category quantity and
price per unit and total sales so this
is also a new feature that
okay uh we just headed
back we'll move back to our chat GPT
chat here
okay so here we are so you could see
that jjy has cleaned the data and he has
provided that it has checked for missing
values checked for duplicates and ensure
consistent formatting and he's
saying okay okay so now we will ask him
that execute
these
steps
and provide the clean
data as CHT has provided that these
would the steps to clean the data and
let's
see so he has provided a new CSV file
with the clean sales data we will
download
it and ask him to use the same file
only use this new C
cleaned sales data CSV
file for further
analysis so you could see that he is
providing what analysis we can do
further but once our data is clean the
next step is visualization so
visualizations help us understand the
data better by providing a graphical
representation so the first thing we
will do is
we will create a prompt for generating
the histograms and we'll do that for the
age distribution part so we'll write a
prompt that generate a
histogram generat a histogram to
visualize the distribution of customer
ages to
visualize the
distribution of customer
ages and and what I was telling you guys
is this code button if you just select
the text and you would find this reply
section just click on that and you could
see that it has selected the text or
what you want to get or the prompts
started with chat jpd so
we'll make it cross and you could see
that it has provided the histogram
here and these are the new features here
and we would see that he's providing a
notification that interactive charts of
this type are not yet supported that is
histogram don't have the color Change
option I will show you the color Change
option in the bar chart section so these
features are also new you can download
the chart from here only and this is the
expand chart if you click on that you
could see that you could expand the
chart here and continue chat with chat
GPD here so this is the interactive
section so you could see that has proved
the histogram that is showing the
distribution of customer ages and the
age range are from 18 to 70 years with
the distribution visualized in 15 bins
that he has created 15 bins Here and Now
moving to another visualization that we
will do by sales by region so before
that I will open the CSV file that is
provided by the chat GPT so you guys can
also see what data he has provided
so this is the clean sales data and you
could see that we have columns sales ID
date product category quantity price per
item total sales region and sales
person so now moving back to chity so
now we will create a bar chart showing
total sales by region so we'll enter
this prompt that create a bar
chart showing total sales
by
region so what we are doing here is we
are creating bar charts or histogram
charts but we can do that for only two
columns if we want to create these data
visualization charts we need two columns
to do so so you could see that he has
provided the response and created the
bar chart here and this is the
interactive section you could see that
here's an option to switch to static
chart if we click on that we can't like
we are not getting any information we
scroll on that and if I enable this
option you could see that I can visually
see how many numbers this bar is
indicating and after that we have the
change color
section you can change the color of the
data set
provided so we can change it to any
color that is provided here or you could
just write the color code
here and similarly we have other two
options that is download and another is
the the expand chart
section and if you need uh what code it
has done to figure out this bar graph so
this is the code you could use any ID to
do so if you don't want the
presentations or the visualizations of
the bar charts here you could use your
ID and use the Python language and he
will provide the code for you just take
your data set and read it through pandas
and generate the bar
charts so moving to next section that is
category wise sales section so here we
will generate a pie chart showing the
proportion of sales for each product
category so for that we'll write a
prompt generate a pie
chart showing the proportion of
sales for each product
category so you could see that it has
started generating the pie chart and
this is also an interactive
section if you click on that you would
be seeing a static pie chart and if you
want to change the color you can change
for any section that could be clothing
Electronics furniture or
kitchen and similarly we have the
download section and the expand chart
section so this is how this new chat jpd
4 model is better than chat jpd
4 that you could use a more interactive
pie charts you could change the colors
for that and you can just H over these
bar charts and found all the information
according to them so after this data
visualization now we'll move to
statistical analysis so this will help
us uncover patterns and relationships in
the data
so the first thing we'll do is
correlation analysis and for that we'll
write the prompt analyze the correlation
between age and purchase amount so this
correlation analysis help us understand
the relationship between two variables
so this can indicate if older customers
tend to spend more or less so we will
find out that by analyzing the data and
we provide a prom to chat gy that
analyze
the correlation between age and purchase
amount so let's see what it
provides uh so here's the response by
chj you could see a scatter plot that
shows the relationship between customer
age and total sales that is with a
calculated correlation coefficient of
approximately 0.16 so this indicates a
weak positive correlation
between age and purchase amount
suggesting that as customer age
increases there's a slight tendency for
total sales to increase as well so you
could just see the scatter Pro here that
if the age increases so it is not
correlated to sales as you would see an
empty graph here so till 40 to 50 years
of age or the 70 years of age you could
find what amount they have spent here
that is the total sales accumulated by
these
ages so now moving to sales Trend so
here will perform a Time series analysis
of purchase amount or the given dates so
what does this do is time series
analysis allows us to examine how sales
amount changes over time helping us
identify Trends and seasonal patterns so
for that we'll write a
prompt performance
time series
analysis of purchase
amount or given
dates so you could see that chgb has
provided us the response and here is the
time series plot showing total sales or
the given dates and each point when the
plot represents the total sales for a
particular
day so through this you can find out and
the businesses find out which is the
seasonal part of the year and where to
stock up their stocks for these kind of
dates and after that you could also do
customer segmentation so what does this
do is so we can use clustering here to
segment customers based on age income
and purchase amount so clustering group
customers into segments based on
similarities this is useful for targeted
marketing and personalized
services and after that we have the
advanced usage for data analysis here we
can draw a predictive modeling table and
do the Market Basket analysis and
perform a customer lifetime value
analysis so we will see one of those and
what will do is we'll perform a Market
Basket analysis and perform an
association rule mining to find
frequency bought to gather
products so the theory behind this is
the association rule mining helps
identify patterns of products that are
often purchased together aiding in
Inventory management and cross selling
strategies so for that we'll write a
prompt that so perform an association
rule mining to find frequently bought
together products so for that we'll
write a prompt here performance
Association rle mining
to find frequently
bought products
together so let's see for this prompt
what does CH4 respond to
us uh so you could see that he is
providing a code here but we don't need
a code here we need the
analysis
don't provide
code do the market pket
analysis and provide
visualizations so you could see that uh
chat JT has
provided the response that given the
limitations in this environment so he is
not able to do the Market Basket
analysis here so but he can help us how
we can perform this in an ID so he
providing you can install the required
libraries then prepare the data and here
is providing the example code so you
could see there are some limitations to
chat GPT 4 also that he can't do
Advanced Data
analysis so you could use the code in
your ID and do the Market Basket an is
there so there are some limitations to
chat GPT 4 also and now we will ask chat
GPT can you create a presentation based
on the data set and we'll provide a data
set to it
also so we'll provide a sample sales
data and we'll ask him can you create a
presentation or PowerPoint
presentation based on this data
set and only
provide data
visualization
graphs so you can see that j4 has
started analyzing the data and he is
stating that and and he will start by
creating a data visualization from the
provided data set and compile them into
PowerPoint
presentation so you could see that CH4
has provided us the response and these
are all the presentations or the
paragraphs that he has created and now
we have downloaded the presentation here
we will open
that and here's the presentation that is
created by J jpd 40 so with that guys we
have come to the end of this session
that is TAA analysis using CHT 40 and we
have covered data cleaning visualization
statistical analysis Advanced usage and
integration and creating a presentation
using CH GPT 4 so thank you guys for
