hey everyone i am bravo khandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
fractional or 0 1 knapsack problem
we shall begin our session by discussing
what is knapsack problem
then we will go into the details and
discuss the zero and knapsack problem
after that we will look into its
implementation in the code editor
then we will discuss the fractional
knapsack problem
finally we will dive into its
implementation in the code editor
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learns
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with the topic what is knapsack
problem
the knapsack problem is used to explain
both the problem and the solution
it derives its name from the fact that
the limited number of things that may be
carried in a fixed size knapsack
given a set of items with varying
weights and values the goal is to pack
as much as value as possible into the
knapsack while staying within the weight
limit
now let's discuss zero one knapsack
problem
first we will be given weights and
values of n items in this case six items
on the left
we will put these items in a knapsack of
capacity w or in this case 10 kgs to get
the maximum total value in the knapsack
then we will have to fill this snapsack
but we can't break the item so we must
either pick the entire item or not pick
at all
due to this sometimes it may even lead
to a knapsack with some spare space left
with it
now let's try to implement this in the
correlator
we will start with the utility function
that will return the maximum of two
integer
int
max
we will return
if a is greater than b
then
a else
p
we will now write a function to return
the maximum value that can be put in a
knapsack of capacity w
and
and
capital w
comma and
wt for the weight
comma
and
value
comma
and
we will declare end i
comma w
we will create a vector
inside a vector
okay
n plus 1
comma
vector
and
capital w plus one
now we will build a table k
in bottom up manner
so for
i equals to 0
i less than equals to n
i plus plus
we will have another for loop inside it
follow
with small w equals to zero
the small w will be less than equals to
capital w
with small w plus plus
now if
i is equals to zero
or
w is equals to zero
then we will have k
at i
comma w
is equals to zero
else
if
weight at i minus 1
is less than equals to w
then
k
at i
comma w
will be equals to
max of
value
at i minus 1.
plus
k at i minus 1
comma
w minus
wt
where wt is at
i minus one
comma
k
at i minus 1
comma w
else
we will have k
at i
comma w
is equals to
k
at i minus 1
comma w
now we will
return a
at n
comma w
now we will write the main block
we will start with and
value array
which will have
elements as
60 100 comma 120
and
weight will be equals to
10 comma 20 comma 30.
and the maximum capacity the capital w
will be equals to 50
now let's find the size of the value
array so end
n is equals to
size of
val
divided by
size of
well
at zeroth location
now we will print
see out
knapsack
at capital w comma wt
comma
where
comma n
and return it as zero
let's compile it
as you can see we are getting the value
as 220
which means we are getting it because we
are taking the elements with weight
equals to 20 and 30 which comes out to
be as 50.
let's get back to our slides

we have now discussed zero one knapsack
problem
now
let's discuss the fractional knapsack
problem
similar to the zero one knapsack problem
we will be given the weights and the
value of n items
in this case six items on the left we
will also be getting a knapsack with
capacity w or in our case 10 kgs to the
right
now we have to get the maximum total
value in the knapsack
then we will have to keep filling this
knapsack but unlike zero one knapsack
we can break an item to get a maximum
value of knapsack
here we will break this 3kg item into a
2kg
and 1 kg item to fill the knapsack
now let's try to implement this in the
code editor
we will start with the structure for an
item which stores weight and
corresponding value of item
so
struct
item
and
value
comma
weight
we will write the constructor as item
the argument as end where
comma
and
wt wait
where this
value
will be equals to well
and this
weight
will be equals to fit
now we will write a comparison function
to sort items according to value by
weight ratio
so
boolean function
cmp
with
argument as struct
item
a
comma
struct
item
now
level
r1
is equals to
double
a dot value
divided by
purple
a dot
weight
similarly we will write it
double
r2
which will be equals to
double
p dot
value
divided by
double
dot
wait
now we will return
r1
greater than r2
which means it will return true if r1 is
greater than r2
now we will write the main function to
solve the problem
so
double
f knapsack
with argument as and
capital w
comma
struct
item
error
comma and
and
we will first sort the item on the basis
of ratio
so sort
error
comma
arr
plus n
comma cmp
now
and
current weight
is equals to
zero
and double
final
value
is equals to
zero point zero
this will be result value in knapsack
so for
and
i is equals to zero
where i is less than n
and i plus plus
now if adding the item won't overflow
then we will add it completely so if
current weight
plus
air
arr
die
dot weight
is less than
equals to capital w
then
current weight
plus equals to
arr
dot wait
and
final
value
will be plus equals to
arr
at i
dot
value
now if we can't add a current item then
we will add fractional part of it so
else
and
remain
is equals to
w minus
current weight
then
final value
will be plus equals to
arr
at i
dot
multiplied by
double
remain
divided by
double
arr
dot
weight
now we will break
then we will return
final value
now let's write our main block
we will start with defining and
w equals to 50
this will be a weight of the knapsack
and
item
arr
equals to
element as 60 comma 10
comma
100 comma 20
comma
120
comma 30.
we will find the size of
n
and
n equals to
size of
arr
divided by size of
arr
at zeroth location
now we will make the function call so c
out
maximum
value
and obtain
first two
f
knapsack
w
comma error
comma n
execute this
as you can see we are getting the
maximum value as 240
that means our function is working
