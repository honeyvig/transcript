the future is in the cloud and Cloud
Engineers are The Architects building
the digital infrastructure of Tomorrow
by 2025 it's estimated that the world
will store an astounding 200 zaby that
is 2 billion terabytes of data in the
cloud and The Architects building this
digital infrastructure are Cloud
Engineers the best part Cloud
engineering offers a rewarding career
path with immense potential in the
United States alone the average base
salary for an Cloud engineer is around
$137,000 per year if you are looking for
a stimulating career with excellent
earning potential Cloud engineering
might be the perfect fit for you this
guide is your road map to success in the
cloud field we will walk you through a
step-by-step process transforming your
daily routine into a springboard for a
cloud engineering career so buckle up
and get ready to embark on the journey
to become a cloud engineer all right so
without further Ado let's get started
all right so the first thing that you
should start with is computer networking
so think of cloud as a giant network of
interconnected computers these computers
store and run applications you access
like web services emails and file
storage without understanding how data
travels across this network it's like
trying to navigate a City without
knowing the streets or signs in the
cloud data needs to move seamlessly
between servers databases and user
devices networking is the backbone that
makes this possible ensuring reliable
and efficient communication so by
understanding networking Concepts like
IP addresses protocols and subnetting
you can work better on some things like
first design and configure secure Cloud
networks so you will know how to set up
secure connections between different
parts of your Cloud infrastructure such
as between virtual machines databases
and external services this ures that
data reaches the right destination
safely protecting against the authority
access and cyber threats so second we
have is optimize Network performance so
with a solid grasp of networking you can
troubleshoot network issues identify
Bott legs and Implement solutions to
enhance data flow this ensures that
applications run smoothly providing a
better user experience and improving
overall system efficiency then at third
we have is choose the right cloud
services
so yes this is the third point so
different Cloud providers offer varying
Network features and capabilities so by
understanding the basics of networking
you can make informed decisions about
which Services best meet your needs this
helps you leverage the strengths of
different Cloud offerings to build a
more effective and efficient
infrastructure now that you have a grasp
of the underlying Network let's dive
into the operating system and powering
Cloud environments so the second thing
that is important for Cloud engineering
is knowledge of operating system so most
Cloud platforms run on Linux based
operating systems being comfortable with
Linux allows you to interact with and
manage Cloud resources directly imagine
it like having a house key knowing how
to use the key that is the Linux
commands so Linux commands grants you
access and control over your Cloud
environment so Linux provides the
foundation for many cloud services and
understanding it helps you navigate and
manage your Cloud infrastructure
efficiently so by learning Linux Basics
like user management file system and the
CLI that is command line you can first
manage your Cloud instances so you will
be able to configure settings install
software and troubleshoot issues
directly on the cloud servers this
Hands-On control means you can quickly
adapt to your environment to meet the
needs of your applications and services
ensuring everything runs
smoothly then second is automate tasks
so Linux scripting allows you to
automate repetitive task saving you time
and effort in managing your Cloud
infrastructure whether it's your
scheduling backups monitoring system
performance or deploying updates
automation streamlines operations and
reduces the chance of human error so
third is work efficiently with Cloud
tools so many Cloud management tools
have Linux foundation so familiarity
with Linux makes it easier to use them
efficiently from orchest isation
platforms like kubernetes to
configuration management tools like
anible knowing Linux helps you leverage
these tools to their full potential
enhancing your productivity and
Effectiveness as a cloud engineer all
right so this was about why knowledge of
operating system is important to become
a cloud engineer so with an
understanding of network and operating
system we can explore the concept of
virtualization which is another
important thing if you want to become a
cloud engineer so virtualization is a
GameChanger in cloud computing it allows
you to create multiple virtual machines
on a single physical layer think of it
like having multiple apartments in one
building each VM act as a separate
computer with its own operating system
and resources this capability maximize
the use of physical hardware and
provides the flexibility to run
different applications independently on
the same physical infrastructure so how
it helps so understanding virtualization
empowers you to optimize resource
utilization which is our first point so
by creating VMS instead of using
dedicated physical servers you can
efficiently utilize Cloud resources and
reduce cost this means you can run
multiple applications on same Hardware
making the most out of the available
resources and improving overall
efficiency then there is scale
applications up or down need more
computing power for your application
just create additional VMS need to scale
down simply shut down VMS you don't need
virtualization provides this flexibility
allowing you to adjust resources based
on on the demand without the need for
additional physical Hardware then there
is test and deploy applications safely
so create isolated VMS environments for
testing new application without
affecting existing ones this isolation
ensures that any issues or bugs in the
application do not impact your
production environment allowing for
safer and more efficient development and
deployment processes all right so data
is the fuel that drives most Cloud
applications let's understand how they
play a crucial role in Cloud engineering
so let's understand about database so
data is the lifeblood of most Cloud
applications database is store and
manage this data efficiently
understanding databases is crucial for
interacting with and managing the
information powering your Cloud
applications so by learning about
database types like relational that is
SQL and nosql and Concepts like data
quering and administration you can
choose the right database for your
application so different databases are
Suited for different types of data
knowing the functionalities of each
helps you select the most efficient
solution for your needs next is work
with Cloud managed databases so many
Cloud platforms offer managed databases
Services understanding database Basics
equips you to utilize these Services
efficiently and manage your Cloud
applications data with ease the next is
troubleshoot data related issues if your
Cloud application encounters data access
problems your database knowledge allows
you to diagnose and resolve them
efficiently so in these ways database
helps a cloud computing or Cloud
engineer now that you have built a
strong foundation in networking
operating systems virtualization and
databases it's time to take your Cloud
engineering Journey to the next level
certifications think of them like badges
that showcase your expertise in specific
Cloud platforms so get certified so
Cloud certifications validate your
understanding of a particular Cloud
platform's technology and services
they act as a stamp of approval showing
employeers you have interested time and
effort in learning the platform and its
functionalities each major cloud
provider that is AWS Azure gcp offers
its own certification programs consider
which Cloud platform you find most
