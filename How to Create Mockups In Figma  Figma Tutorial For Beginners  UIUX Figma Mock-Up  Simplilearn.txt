hey everyone welcome back to our Channel
today we are going to talk about
something super useful for designers how
to create mockups in figma using easy
plugins but first let's break down what
mockups are and why they are important a
mockup is basically a realistic version
of your design that shows what it will
look like when used in real life it
could be for a mobile app a website or
even a physical product think of it like
a polished version of your design that
gives everyone clients developers and
even end users a clear picture of the
final product before it's built so why
do we need mockups here are a few simple
reasons number one clear communication
mockups help you explain your design
ideas to clients or teammates instead of
just talking about it they can see
exactly what it will look like number
two early feedback by showing a markup
you can get feedback early on in the
process this lets you make changes
before development saving time and
effort later number three is user
testing mockups also help when testing
how real people interact with your
design it's easier to see if something
works when it's shown in realistic way
and number four is marketing and
presentations once your mockup is ready
you can use it to Showcase your work and
presentations or even marketing
materials it makes everything look
professional so in today's video I'll
show you how to create mockups right
inside figma using some simple plugins
these tools make it easy to turn your
designs into realistic previews whether
you need to show them on devices like
phones and tablets or create something
more advanced like 3D
models craving a career upgrade

let's jump in and start creating some
awesome mockups okay let's start with
the demo so as you might be having a
project you'll be having your frames for
this demo I have taken the frames from
the figma community so number one on the
list is artboard studio mockup so it's a
powerful plugin in fitma that allows you
to create realistic mockups using
pre-built templates of devices it's
simple to use and comes with both free
and premium options so here's how to get
started so so open figma and you can go
to the plugins and browse plugins in
community like this so you have to
search for artboard studio mockups and
install the plugin so once installed you
can find it by going to plugins and then
you will find artboard Studio markups
like how I can find and then launch it
so after launching the plugin you'll be
able to browse through various device
mockups such as phones tablets and
laptops so these markups are designed
with both light and dark themes now you
can filter the templates to see only
free items because here it's a
combination of paid items which you'll
get it in the premium version and free
items so you can filter the templates to
see only free items by selecting the
free filter from the menu so right now I
can only find this free so let's create
a mobile app design so we'll select a
phone mockup that fit the project let me
just arrange this for clarity so once
selected the mockup will appear on your
fmar canvas like this which is ready to
be customized so as you can see each
mockup comes with frame where you can
plays Your Design so you just have to
copy your app screen from your figma
file and paste it into this Frame like
for example you can just copy this and
paste it here so if your design doesn't
fit perfectly like this into the markup
you don't have to worry you can adjust
it by using the scale tool to resize
your design so that it fits within the
frame so just press K and here you can
actually you know check the dimension
like for example the dimension of iPhone
2 is 402 into 874 so you can you can
change the dimensions either you can do
it that way or you can manually resize
it also like this uh I think it's done
no it's not yeah but I I personally
think it's easier to you know give
Dimensions it's easier to adjust that
way so you can similarly do it for this
Frame also now let's work on this Frame
we copy this Frame paste it over here
I'll just show you so here the dimension
is 402 874 so let's give it here
so now this perfectly
fits yeah so once your design is placed
correctly now click the frame again and
select render selected frame click the
frame and then select render selected
frame you have to just wait for a moment
so the plug-in will generate a rendered
mockup as you can see with the device
and your design in place I'll just zoom
it up for you so you can export so once
you're satisfied with this mockup you
can export the file the export the
mockup is a high resolution p P or a JPG
so you can export the mockup as a high
resolution PNG or jpg you can use export
function in figma and make sure to
select a high quality for a crisp and
clean mockup so artboard is basically
used because it provides a fast way to
generate realistic device mockups as you
have seen without needing to manually
create them and you get a professional
presentation with minimal efforts making
it perfect for client work portfolios or
marketing material now clay mockups 3D
is another useful plugin that helps you
visualize your designs in 3D so you can
rotate and position the mockups to
Showcase Your Design from different
angles so for that also you can go to
plugins and you can search for clay
mockups 3D and again install it I have
already installed it so I have it over
here so after launching the plug-in
select the device you want to use for
your mockup so you'll find various
options like iPhones iPad MacBook or you
know you can do it in blank in a browser
or anything so for example let's select
iPhone itself because we have an app
frame now you have to select the figma
frame you want to showcase and click
load frame in the plugin so this is the
frame and as you can see your design
will be placed on the selected device
now the best part about CL markups 3D is
that it lets you rotate the device to
Showcase Your Design from different
angles so you can manually rotate it in
3D space or use a preset camera angle so
this is perfect for creating Dynamic
views of your mockups showing how they
would look like in real life from
various perspectives now as you can see
you can also change the device color to
match your Brand's theme for example you
can switch from white to black or use
custom colors here to highlight certain
aspects of your design so there are also
options for lighting and shadow effects
which add to realism of the mockup so
once you satisfi the design again you
can export it by Saving as an image the
plugin will generate a high quality
image of your mockup with all the
customizations you have applied now
figma Community is a vast resource where
designers share their UI kits templates
markups and more so so you can easily
find pre-made mockups that suit your
project or use UI kits as starting
points for your design so you can just
go to figma
community and you can search for
different mockup templates by just
typing mockups over
here and you can browse through the
available options many designers offer
free and paid mockup templates are
complete with Device frames and
background for example you can find
mockups for iPhones or Android Mac and
even smartw watches so once you find a
markup or UI kit you just have to click
duplicate to add it to your figma
workspace and now you have the access to
all the layers and components allowing
you to fully customize the design so you
can just open this in figma you can go
to devices and as you can see these are
different mockups so you can just select
you can even go for iPad if you
want you can just control C or command C
go to your workspace and yes your mockup
is ready and as already shown before you
just have to select the frame resize it
and save it that's it now to take your
mockups to the next level let's add some
animation using Jitter now Jitter is an
online tool that allows you to create
quick and simple animations without any
coding so for
that you have to go to j. video now
jiter is a web based tool so you don't
need to download any software you can
also sign up for free to save and Export
your projects so Jitter integrates
smoothly with figma so you can import
your designs directly so inside jit you
can click on import and choose the figma
option choose open in figma go to
untitle unfortunately I forgot to save
my file press run after that you can
select a frame I'll select the first
frame copy it and then click open in jit
so once you have imported Your Design
you can animate specific elements so you
can click on any part of your mockup
such as a button text or image and
you'll see animation options like fade
and slide r zoom and mode for example
let's click this button go to animate
new animation see you can see fade in
you you can even you know adjust the
timing you can find tune how long each
animation takes by adjusting the timing
slider so this is the timing slider if
you want certain elements to animate
faster or slower you can tweak the
duration accordingly so Jitter also
allows you to adjust delays between
animations so that they don't all happen
at once so like for example you could
have your logo animate first followed by
the app interface elements Etc so this
is a very great tool because animations
help you communicate interactions making
it easier for your audience to
understand how your design works and D
is simple to use but powerful enough to
create professional grade animations
without any coding knowledge so I've
just given you a rough idea you can you
know go through each of the options and
explore it's quite simple it's quite
easy now the next one is design stripe
now design stripe is a fantastic tool
for adding custom background your
mockups it provides an easy way to
create vibrant customizable 3D
illustrations and backrounds that
perfectly complement your mockups now
design strip gives you the ability to
adjust colors Styles and elements making
it easy to match the design with your
brand or project so first head to design
strip website and sign up a login if you
already have an account once logged in
you'll see a wide selection of templates
including various 3D markups so let's
just go through those templates now to
get started you have to select a 3D
markup template from the design Stripes
Library for example you might choose a
3D phone or computer illustration now
design stripe offers a variety of
illustration Styles like flat clay style
or high detailed 3D renderings now for
this demo let's choose a phone mockup
now once the mockup is selected you can
customize different elements so as you
can see use design Stripes Color Picker
to adjust the colors of the device and
other objects in the scene so you can
change the background for example device
frame or even customize small details
like shadows and highlights you can also
add or remove objects around the device
such as plans tables or whatever is
present and in this way you can design
the background now our next step is to
add the design into this markup right so
just click here and now what you have to
do is you have to go back to your figma
and Export the frame or screen that you
want to place for example I want this
Frame so I'll select this
Frame I'll go to export export option
and just export the file so this is the
option to export it's in the right
bottom of the page I've already exported
so now you can just upload that image
perfect I even don't have to do any
adjustments this is just perfect but
then if you want if you have any issues
you can adjust the size and alignment of
your design so that it will fit
perfectly with the 3D device so if
needed you can also tweak the angle of
the 3D markup or change the perspective
to highlight different parts of your
design so once you're happy with the
look of the markup you can export it as
a high resolution PNG let's just apply
and see what this just cool cool isn't
it now you can just export it so design
stripe is a really cool tool because you
can modify everything from colors to
scene elements giving you full control
over how your mockup will look like and
the plugin allows you to quickly
generate high quality 3D visuals that
add depth and realism to your mockups
and even without any 3D modeling
knowledge you can create stunning
professional looking 3D mockups for your
design and that's it R for today's demo
