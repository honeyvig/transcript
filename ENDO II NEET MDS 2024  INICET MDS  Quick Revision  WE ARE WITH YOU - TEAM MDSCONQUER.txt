yeah having us uh this is dr srikant
from team mds conquer
so now we'll be discussing few important
concepts of ender so let's start in the
quick revision without wasting any time
okay the first important aspect is the
length of the working area of
instruments in ender
so normally the length of the working
areas in instruments in indo
is going to be 16 millimeters means
whatever may be the
length of the file for example you have
files of 21
millimeters you have files of
24 millimeters you have files of 28
millimeters
whatever may be the length of the file
the working area will be only 16
millimeters means
the area which comes in contact with the
instrumentation everything will be 16
millimeters
per files reamers and most of the
instruments in android
and you need to make a note about the
dg16 explorer that is endodontic
explorer where dz is nothing but called
as david green 16 is nothing but the
working area is again 16 millimeters
here
okay think next one is active gp active
gp is nothing but gic coated gp okay so
active gp is nothing but a gic ported gp
and one more important thing anything
which activates the
gatta pacha which makes it more useful
is also called as active gp but better
to go with gic coated even calcium
hydroxide coated gp is also called as
active gp even chlor accident
coated gp is also called as activity so
we'll just make a note about the calcium
hydroxide ph of calcium hydroxide ranges
from 10 to 11
and calcium hydroxide was introduced
into endo by hermann
whereas the percentage of chloroxylation
used in indo is
two percentages whereas the amount of
chlorexin used in period that is the
amount of chloroxylamine used in the
mouthwashes is 0.12 percentage if you
don't find 0.12 percentage then the
better option is going to be 0.2
percentage indoor 2 percent is
perio 0.12 or 0.2 percentage
jumping into the next part i'm talking
about the
nerves in dental pulp okay so if you
talk about the nerves in dental pulp
dental pulp has a
a delta
c fibers and a beta a beta are less in
number but a beta are also present okay
right
so it is a delta a delta are present in
the periphery c fibers are present in
the core c fibers are present in the
center
c fibers are unmyelinated fibers whereas
a delta and beta fibers are myelinated
fibers whenever you give la
the first fibers which which get
anesthetized by alia is unmalnet fibers
those c fibers
so next we are talking about the
uh pulpal pressure so when i'm talking
about the purple pressure so normal
pulpal pressure is 5 to 10 milligrams
millimeters of hg
or you can consider it as 10 to 15
centimeters of water if you are
comparing with water it is 10 to 15
centimeters if you are comparing with hd
it is 5 to 10 millimeters of hd
which is almost equal to the portal
pressure the portal pressure is also the
same that is five to ten millimeters of
energy
or ten to fifteen centimeters of saline
or water
okay next important thing that you have
to make you notice irreversible bulbatis
irreversible reversible palpations okay
so reversible pulpit is it is 13.5
millimeters of energy irreversible
pulpit is it is
34.5 millimeters of each
next one is root intersection okay now
when you are preparing
the root end
in the case of your micro surgery okay
or in the case of endodontic surgery
so traditional endodontics it is 45
degrees angle whereas in the modern
endodontics it is 0 to 10 degrees angle
the basic
reason for modifying 45 degrees to 10
degrees is
lesser exposure lesser exposure of the
dentinal tubules in 45 degrees angle you
will have more exposure of dentinal
chemicals more chances of free infection
whereas in zero to 10 degrees lesser
exposure of the tentatives number of
dental algebras are exposed is less
less in
number of
dental tubules exposed so that's going
to be an advantage that is the reason
why it was dropped down to 0 to 10
degrees in modern endodontics when
compared with the traditional anaerobics
but do make a note about riddle solution
riddle solution uh first of all the main
advantage of riddle solution it helps in
identifying the missed canals it helps
in identifying the accessory channels
and everything because
and that too on a radiograph because
basically this solution has a radio
opaque material
okay so this radio
opaque material helps in identifying the
extra things which are being missed with
the help of multiple radiographs
basically the solution consists of seven
percentage of edta
five percentages of nervous here and a
radio back material
next one is tip angle in endo
tip angle in endo is
75 degrees plus or minus 15 degrees
next one is glass bead sterilizer
so glass bit silence is a type of
it's a type of dry heat okay so it's
type of dry heat your power points and
most of the things will be sterilized by
glass bit sterilizer do make a note of
the temperature of glass bit that is 425
to 475 degrees fahrenheit and 218 to 248
degree centigrade see whether they are
giving
a temperature based question on foreign
heat or centigrade and most of the
situations they are going to give
centigrade for an indian exams for
example if you are preparing for imbd or
any other exams it will be probable in
the foreign
but before attempting the question
related to the temperatures make sure
you just see which units are being given
so regular temperature of contact
contact temperature we maintain is 15
seconds 5 seconds 5 seconds is the
regular one
that is most commonly used for files and
rumors
10 seconds is used for power points and
15 seconds is used for bursts and do
make a note in the sterilization aspect
particularly auto clip contact period is
very very important autoclave regularly
121 degree centigrade
15 lbs and 15 minutes okay contact
period is 15 minutes
or whenever the temperature is being
increased
particularly in the case of autoclave
you have something called as flash
sterilization of autograph
where you are going to increase the
temperature that is 134 degree
centigrade
the time contact period now will be
three minutes and the pressure will be
more that is 30 lbs okay that is 130 for
3 minutes and 30 lbs whereas the normal
autoclave temperature is
1 21 degree centigrade 15 lbs and 15
minutes and do make a note of these two
temperatures which are very very
important
right so next one is
of course we have discussed this so many
times that is the classification of
instrument damage so whenever repeatedly
doing
the biomechanical preparation with the
same instrument
so upon microscopic examination you can
clearly find the instrument damage which
is being classed into six classes so
whenever there is a bend in the
instrument that is class one
class two is straightening of the
twisted flutes normally fluids will be
twisted so whenever the twisted fluids
are being striped that is class two
peeling of the metal at the blade edges
is class three clockwise twist is called
as class four
and
uh clocking of the instrument along its
long axis is called as classified and
full fracture of the instrument complete
factor the instrument is called as
classics and do make a note this is
something new but you can go back and
check your pp books okay
and diagram based question is also very
common if you don't have people books
you can use google and check this
particular classification a question can
be predicted from this area of course
point number 11 was already given in the
recent need examination that is
scientists or a bubble test
basically the solution is used this
neigh was here and the purpose of this
test is
identification of a misconception
whenever the bubbles are going to come
you assume or predict that there is a
vital pulp which is not being removed
and and you are going to find a
misconception okay uh what what are the
internal measurement of choice in the
case of your weeping cannons weeping
kernels are nothing but canals where
there is a constant discharge of the bus
those are called as beeping generals in
such cases
you have to keep
calcium hydroxide as a dressing material
next we need to talk about machine
solution
so making solution
basically consisting of five parts of 36
percentage of nacl and five parts of 30
percent is of h2o2
30 percent is a phase 2 32 35 percent is
of h2o it is called as
superoxide we are very familiar okay so
proxy is basically
30 to 35 percentage of h2o2 by weight or
100 days of
oxygen by volume means 30 to 35
percentage of h2o2 by weight is going to
release 100 days of oxygen by volume
and it contains one part of 0.2
percentage of ether which is basically
used to remove the debris
whereas after few days the microsolution
is being modified in which 36 percentage
of hcl is being replaced by
is being replaced by 20 days of naoh and
there is one more important thing that
you have to make a note about is micro
aberration micro aberration regularly we
use
18 percent of hcl okay that is being
modified to eleven percent is okay
that's being modified to eleven
percentage of hcl
by
crawl okay crawl has been modified it
from eighteen percent is initial to the
eleven percentage because eleven percent
is was again a question that is given in
2018 need to make a note 18 percentage
option is also there as it is being
modified and it is being advanced the
percentage is being decreased from 18 to
11 so it's better to go with 11 percent
as an answer rather than 18
next one is wavelength of pulse oximetry
so we are very familiar that pulse
oximetry is very familiarly used in the
fobit 19.
and apart from this pulse oximetry is
one of the vitality procedure
which is very very familiar okay the
next vitality procedure uh which is very
very important is lazer tripler flow
meter so pulse oximetry helps in
determining the oxygen saturation levels
of the pump
right so pulse oximeter has a wavelength
you have to make a node that is 660
nanometers and 940 nanometers two
wavelengths you have to remember
next is
beans root canal modification is a very
familiar question that is frequently
asked in the exams type one is one one
type two is two one type three is two
two type four is one two do make around
this very important and later it's being
modified by vertices which has divided
into eight that is one one two one one
two one
two two one two two one two
one two one two and three and three
three and three is eight
you need to make a note about the fish
zones
that you can remember with i
c
i
s okay that is nothing but i c i s i for
infection
c for contamination i for irritation as
for stimulation and i hope you remember
all these diagrams which i have
discussed vigorously when we are taking
the regular classes and the predominant
cells in the case of infection zone are
polymorph nucleosides and its center
zone
and contamination you have more
lymphocytes
or you can they can ask your round cells
are more predominant in contamination
zone irritation zone you have class
macrophages okay and it is clinically
more significant okay and cholesterol
crystals are also seen this is
clinically more significant zone is
irritation zone of course
stimulation zone you have blush cells
means
make a note
the healing always takes from periphery
to the center whereas the infection
spreads from center to the peripheral
centre means infection zone it's most to
the periphery stimulation whereas
healing whenever the root canal therapy
is done the healing starts from the
periphery zone that is the stimulation
and it moves to the center
and next one 19 19 point i will be
talking about forms of gut apache
so gut apache normally available in the
department will be beta firm whenever
this beta form is being heated it will
be converted into alpha form whenever it
is overheated uncontrolled heating it is
going to convert it into gamma gamma
form is the most unstable form most
useless form whereas beta form is most
commonly used in the lateral
condensation technique alpha form is
most commonly used in the techniques
where the heat is used thermomechanical
vertical compaction all these techniques
we use alpha form basically beta form is
going to convert into alpha form in and
around temperature like
56 to 64 degrees centigrade
okay right and i hope uh most of these
points were already covered in your
classes in the pp books if time permits
please go back and have a glance if you
are not clear with this and 20th
question is a very familiar question
repeated so many times in need in ironic
cd two canal configuration the mandible
are in scissors is seen around in around
41.4 percentage of cases mb2 is again a
familiar question mb2 percentage in the
case of maxillary first molar in the
microscope not to the naked eye in the
microscope is around 95 percentages of
cases
so i don't want to discuss much about
daily classification in this
classification type 1 type 2 type 3 are
very familiar animal animal dentin and
i'm identity and pulp type 4 is
non-vital type 5 is evolution okay
evolution sorry type six is a fracture
of the
root fracture type seven is the
displacement of the teeth type eight is
crown and fracture and type nine is any
sort of damage related to the primary
tip
working length method of determining the
case of open apex cases or blunderbuss
channels is by using the powerpoints and
do make it not already discussed paper
points is still list
by
what method
yes it is dry heat stimulation method
that's nothing but called as paper
points
and
root canal irrigation solution showing
allergic reactions is potassium iodide
as well as chlorexit both options are
there better to go with potassium iodide
as the best option
25 pi index periapical index which is
taken on the radiograph so the grade one
is the normal periapical area grade two
is
a smaller changes grade three is changes
with mineral loss grade four is
periodontitis with radial lucent areas
grade five is severe periodontitis with
revolutionaries
so
