yeah I just want to explain how MDS
coner is going to work for you guys to
make it very simple and clear okay so
once you kept a request for us okay uh
about the free demo okay there will be
free demo for MDS conquer okay we are
going to give you the free demo to
satisfy the student if they're able to
catch up our frequency and if they are
happy with us with us so they can be a
part of this after the free demo once
you keep a request we are going to add
you in a particular group okay basing
upon the batch that is available or free
for you so once you're added you need to
go to the DP of the P DP of the
particular group which gives information
about the week discussion or the 15 days
discussion pattern how it's going to be
so regularly the discussions will be at
the time of 8: to 9:30 this is to help
the interns particularly because they
are accessible or free at that
particular time or the house Wes or the
clinicians because many of them they
work in clinics and they want to go for
this course as an apartment time so this
is accessible for you guys uh if you
want to have a live discussion in the
WhatsApp you can be available in the
range of 8 to 9:3 if you are having some
work it will be in your WhatsApp only so
that whenever you free you can scroll up
and you can write the discussion so if
you go into the schedule the schedule
will be uh in the range of uh Monday to
Friday so once the Friday is done there
will be revision you can have a look
over this Saturday the revision and
Sunday at 10:00 two sections will be
there at 10:00 to 1:00 and uh from 2:00
to 5:00 preferably uh if you have any
other work you can give the examination
within 7 days at Max but preferably uh
uh our rules said like we need to follow
these sections according to the need so
once you join the group so then I I'll
just give a hint at how the discussions
will go on in this particular group so
this is how the recent discussion that
has happened tonight and uh you can have
have a look over like there will be
pneumonics Cotes pics or voice noes uh
that are posted in the group uh
this motivation everything like the
questions explanation uh important stuff
that is covered in the neat recent neat
everything will be enlighted and
highlighted by A Perfect mentors in the
Toppers of previous examination guiding
you in a better way so once you are done
with your demo and if you like to be and
if you like and if you want to be a part
of this group okay uh for example this
group our strength is uh in and around
231 okay so this is the first batch and
the second batch crosses 152 so so this
is how we work so once you're done uh
you need to uh we are going to send you
a payment link okay if you like and if
you want to have a part of this we are
going to send a payment link for example
uh so we sent a payment link okay you
need to open the payment link so
directly site will be open the payment
link gate so this is this is how the
payment process is like you can pay you
can click on the pay now button so once
you click on this pay now button uh
the next sheet will be opened where you
need email address phone number quantity
one and the amount that you are paying
you can just edit it okay the minimum
payment for the installment Bas is 2,000
and 2,000 and you can just over you can
just press over the next button to go
for the payment once you're done with
the payment you we are going to send you
need to send your screenshot of the
payment to our uh consent WhatsApp
number that is 98942 7971 once you done
with that we are going to send a
confirmation mail to your mail once it
is open you will get a password and a
username okay uh so with that password
and username you can just log in you can
just log in uh our
site so once you log in uh so you need
to go for the visit site once you look
you can go for the visit side you can
see the scrolling uh and everything like
everything detailed so you need to open
Button called as an a take
test so once you open a take test these
are the two tests that are available if
you want to go through just you press
press on the icon on the particular
question paper the question paper will
be displayed scrolling will be displayed
this is this this test Series this type
of mode of uh covering all the questions
in a single shot one by one like for
example if you want to go for 240
question you can just press on the icon
and if you want to go for 11 11 you can
just press on the icon for example if
you're answering the 11th question okay
if you're answering 111 okay if you
marked option A and if you want to save
it can press the save
button so the button icon will be
changed you can you can look over the
icon or else if you want to keep 113 as
a
review so the review will be in the
orange color so if you want to continue
this is how uh this is actually not a
neat pattern but it is just made to make
the stuff simplified simplified in the
sense like this Hi-Fi thing is like once
you download it once you press take exam
all the questions will be on the screen
even if your net is off even if your net
has an low signal no signal area you can
just uh complete the question and at
submit and at submitting you need net
again so whereas the rest of the
patterns where we get practiced uh they
need all time perfect net because if you
want to stick on press onto the next
button again it is requiring it requires
uh the net okay the net the or the
network uh for for proceeding to the
next question so I prefer like this is
good for my students and there are no
complaints from any of us because
majority of the students still we impose
them to give on the laptop or disktop
they just prefer to give in the mobile
so I I prefer this is very accessible uh
for an individual to give in the mobile
and one more Advantage is like once
you're done with exam you can just press
the submit button uh this is a unique
way of getting like uh answer with a
question green color if you went wrong
in a particular answer what option you
have made will be in the red color and
everything so it's very simple to uh
uh copy uh the MDS conus stuff also it's
just like simply selecting all the
question paper dragging from one to last
just copy it and once you copy it open
an MS word anything that is present on
your lapis or on the mobiles and just P
okay uh whereas of them they of the
online test series they they won't
allow the question B because we have a
habit of sharing the things so they
don't want things to be shared okay we
have all sort of questions diagram based
questions case discussion questions uh
match the following assertion reason
based all the types of mcqs which
are neat as well as as as well as PGI or
any sort of uh government job oriented
examinations okay this is how we work
okay and thank you for hearing this
video and I mean uh this video is mainly
done to just simplify because these are
the most common questions that are asked
by many of our students okay it is not
uh for the publicity wise it's it's
about
making the stuff easy and simple for our
students thank you Dr shant
[Applause]
