and AI tools complemented by 35 Plus
dedicated resources all right guys so
let's start with the first topic all
right so let's understand what is
digital marketing so digital marketing
is the art of using the internet to
promote products or services to people
who might be interested in them instead
of relying solely on traditional methods
like newspaper ads or Flyers digital
marketing takes advantage of online
platforms like website social media
emails and search engines did you know
that a whooping 89% of Americans go
online every day and about 31% are
online nearly all the time this means
it's super important to be online too by
having ads and stuff online you can make
your brand known give customers a great
experience and even get more people
interested in what you offer by using
digital channels like social media paper
click ads search engine optimization and
email marketing to connect with existing
customers and then you can measure your
success in numbers tracking websites
visits and social media engagement email
open rates and more are also used in
this this data helps you understand
what's working and what's not allowing
you to adjust your strategy to maximize
the results all right so this was about
digital marketing now let's understand
how is digital marketing different from
traditional marketing so digital
marketing and traditional marketing are
like two sides of a coin they both aim
to promote products or services but they
do it in different ways here's how it
works first traditional marketing
traditional marketing is like shouting
across the crowded playground to get
everyone's attention so in traditional
marketing let's say tv ads and
billboards think commercial and giant
posters trying to reach a lot of people
atance second example would be
newspapers and flyers spreading messages
through printed materials delivered to
homes or handed out to streets and now
let's talk about the digital marketing
aspect so digital marketing however is
like Whispering directly in the ear of a
person who wants a particular product so
let's say online ads placing ads on
websites or search engines that people
who are already interested in your steps
will see next is social media connecting
with people on platforms like Facebook
and Instagram where you can show them
why your product is the best then
another example would be targeted emails
sending messages directly to people who
might be interested like offering a
discount on their first product purchase
is another benefit of digital marketing
so basically digital marketing is kind
of more specific and targeted marketing
all right now let's understand how it
actually works so how digital marketing
Works digital marketing works by
leveraging the power of the internet and
Technology to connect with the potential
customers this involves using online
tools to reach and engage with their
audience where they spend most of their
time that is the internet so let's have
a look at some first on the list is SE
so this helps your website show up in
higher search engine results making it
more likely for people to find you when
they search for something you offer for
example when someone in your area
searches for a freshly baked pastries
SEO ensures that your bakery's website
appears at the top of the search results
this increases the chance of local
customer finding your bakery online when
they're looking for baked goods all
right so this was about the SEO now
coming to the next one which is content
marketing so this involves creating
useful and interesting content like
blogs videos and social media posts can
attract and retain customers for example
you could create engaging content such
as blog post about the history of
pastries tutorial videos on cake
decoration or photos of your latest
Creations on social media this content
not only showcases your expertise but
also keeps your audience engaged and
interested in what you offer next on the
list is social media marketing so this
social media marketing involves using
platforms like Facebook Instagram and
Twitter to connect connect with your
audience and share content that
encourages them to interact with your
brand for example you can use delicious
images of your Bak Goods interact with
customers by responding to comments and
messages and even run contest or
promotions to attract more people to
your store that is the bakery all right
coming to the next one which is email
marketing so email marketing is like
having a personal connection with your
customers it involves using email to
connect with potential and existing
customers it's essentially sending
commercial messages but with a
permission based approach people who
sign up for your email list are
essentially giving you the green light
to send them information for example you
can collect email address from your
customers who visits the bakery and you
can send them regular updates about new
pasty flavors special promotions or
upcoming events at your bakery this
personalized communication keeps your
brand top of mind and encourages to
repeat the business next is payperclick
that is PPC advertising so payper click
or PPC advertising is an online
advertising model where advertisers pay
a fee each time their ad is clicked so
it's a way of buying visits to your
website rather than attempting to earn
those visits organically PPC ads
typically appear alongside search engine
results or on social media platforms and
advertisers bed on keyword to display
their ads to the relevant audiences so
example for this you could create ads
that appear when people search for terms
like best bakery in your town or Target
social media users based on their
interest in baking or deserts with PPC
you only pay when someone clicks on your
ad making it cost effective way to
attract potential customers to your
Baker's website or social media profiles
now that we have discussed the types of
digital marketing strategies let us
understand how you can Implement each of
these strategies so first identify your
audience the first step is understanding
who you want to reach imagine them as
people who might be interested in your
product or services this is like
picturing the people who would love your
bakery are they busy professionals
looking for a quick breakfast pastry or
maybe families with Sweet Tooth
understanding your ideal customers help
your tailor your marketing efforts the
next is choose your channels next you
pick the online platforms where your
target audience hangs out think of these
as virtual stomping grounds like social
media sites or search engines think of
online platforms as virtual
neighborhoods if your target audience is
young families Instagram might be the
great place to Showcase your colorful
cupcake all right next one is creating
engaging content once you know where
your audience is you can create content
that will grab their attention this
could be informative blog post
eye-catching videos or even fun social
media post this is like taking
mouthwatering pictures of your cupcakes
and bread you can even film short videos
of your frosting a cake or decorating
cookies to show your skills similar to
what all the foodie channels are doing
nowadays on YouTube and Instagram then
next is spreading the word so now that
you have a great content you need to get
it seen right you can use various
strategies like online advertising
social media promotion or even
influencer marketing that is partnering
with people your audience trust for
example you can put a post like mention
someone who will give you a pasty treat
and you can even run a contest or
giveaways like this post and tag a
friend who loves cake for a chance to
win a free slice and you can also do
collaboration with some foodie channels
that are famous next is tracking and
analyzing digital marketing Types on

Trends on search engine results pages
scps to boost visibility typically seen
on Google or Bing sem involves bidding
on keywords relevant to products or
Services when users search with those
keywords adds from successful biders
appear prominently it's like a shortcut
to be seen when people are looking for
something specific online advertisers
pay when someone clicks on their ad
which is known as payer click that is
PPC the goal is to attract potential
customers actively seeking related
information sem complement search engine
optimization that is SEO efforts by
providing immediate visibility this
Dynamic marketing approach allows
businesses to tailor campaigns measure
performance and adjust strategies
quickly contributing to a more agile and
responsive online presence all right so
this was about search engine marketing
now let's understand why is it important
so with more people relying on the
internet to discover and buy products
search engine marketing has become a
vital for expanding a company's online
presence the majority of new website
visitors come from search engine queries
SCM ensures that companies only pay for
ads when they lead to actual visits
making it a costeffective marketing
strategy moreover each visitors
contributes to improving a website's
ranking in organic search results unlike
social media where users aren't actively
seeking products or services consumers
using search engines are often ready to
make a purchase the intent driven
approach makes sem powerful tool for
connecting with potential customers who
are actively seeking relevant
information ultimately boosting a
company's chances of making
sales so this was about why sem is
important now let's have a look at the
difference between sem and
SEO so search engine marketing and
search engine optimizations play pivotal
roles in online marketing ASM involves
paying search engines like Google or
displaying ads and search results on the
other hand SEO does not require payments
to Google instead businesses aim to
secure a free sport in search results by
offering the most relevant content for
specific keywords sem is like a shortcut
where you pay for immediate visibility
while SEO is a long-term strategy
earning visibility organically ideally
combining both is a smart approach SEO
drives consistent traffic over time
especially at the top of the marketing
funnel while sem with its paid ads is a
cost effective way to boost conversions
at the bottom of the funnel it's a
dynamic duo for comprehensive online
marketing strategy so this was about the
difference between search engine
marketing and search engine optimization
now let's understand how it works that
is how sem works so search engine
marketing works like a online
advertising when you search on Google
you see some results at the top with a
small ad tag those are sem ads
businesses pay to show their ads there
it's like putting up a billboard where
lots of people can see it here's how it
works first business choose a specific
words that is keywords related to what
they offer when someone searches using
these words if the business is Bid
enough money their ad can show up the
more they bid the higher the chance of
their ad gets seen imagine you have a
local bakery and you want want more
people to know about your delicious
cupcakes this is where search engine
marketing comes in let's say someone is
in your town is craving for cupcakes and
types yummy cupcakes near me into Google
if you have set up sem campaign and bid
on the right keywords like yummy
cupcakes your bakery's ad may appear at
the top of the search results with a
little ad tag now picture a person
seeing your ad and thinking oh that's
look tasty they click on your ad visit
your Bakery website and maybe even place
an order for cupcakes so in this example
sem helped your bakery get noticed when
someone was actively searching for what
you offer
cupcakes you paid a bit to Google but in
return you gathered a new customer it's
like putting up a sign saying hey we
have the cupcakes you're looking for
when someone is out searching for a
sweet treat now let's understand about
sem tools so search engine marketing
tools first we have is Sam Rush Sam Rush
is a tool that helps you know what
people are searching for online it tells
you about popular keywords what your
competitors are doing and how your
website is doing compared to others it's
like a map of making your website stand
out in online crowd then there is Google
ads Keyword Planner Google ads Keyword
Planner is a tool by Google that helps
you pick the best words for your online
ads if you're a baker it suggest words
like delicious cupcakes or fresh
pastries to reach more people it's like
a helper for choosing the right words to
get noticed then there is Google Trends
so Google Trends shows what popular on
the internet right now whether it's a
new dance or the latest gadget it helps
you stay updated on what people are
talking about it's like a trending watch
friend keeping you in the loop all right
now moving on to the next topic which is
how do add auctions work so Google Bing
and Yahoo use an auction system for ads
during every user search in the Google
ad auction various factors decide which
ad appears on the top of the search
results this includes the quality score
from Google ads Google paperclick
platform it's not just about the budget
relevance matters even if a campaign has
smaller budget it can beat a bigger one
if the content is more fitting similar
to organic rankings factors like trust
signals and web traffic also influence
who wins the ad space in Google auction
these ads go through an auction process
with each user search in Google ads
auction the ads position isn't solely
determined by the campaign's budget the
quality score earned through Google ads
plays a significant role unlike a state
forward budget race the option plays
relevance a smaller budget can Triumph
if the ad is more relevant to the user
search additionally organic search
factors like trust signals and web
traffic also wait in ensuring that
auction isn't so only about money but
about showing the most fitting ads to
users so this was about how ad auctions
work now let's understand sem campaign
strategy so in sem campaign strategy
first we have is keyword research so
discover what keywords people use when
searching for your product or service
for instance if you run a cupcake shop
identify terms like tasty cupcakes near
me select these keywords to connect with
potential customer actively looking for
what you
offer so next is campaign creation
establish your online advertising
campaign craft straightforward ads with
appealing language for the cupcake shop
an ad could be delicious cupcakes order
Now set a budget for how much you are
willing to pay when someone clicks on
your ad keeping it simple and engaging
to attract
attention the next is measurement and
optimization evaluate the performance of
your ads track clicks and conversions if
results aren't satisfying adjust your
ads or
keywords constantly Define your approach
based on what resonates best with your
audience to improve outcomes over
time so this was about the SCM campaign
strategy so in this video we have
understood the importance of sem
differentiated from SEO understood how
it works discovered essential sem tools
unravel the Dynamics of AD auctions and
master effective campaign strategies and
what we're going to do is start out with
search engine optimization okay so
search engine optimization or organic
search we have a mixture of paid and
free so there's a lot of different
platforms but if you're focusing on SEO
you certainly need to use an SEO
platform so there's sem Rush okay you
also have Google search console which is
free so if you don't have a SEO platform
form you definitely need to be using
Google search console and so we'll take
a closer look at that there's Google
Keyword Planner which is actually
situated under Google ads and so if
you're running Google campaigns on
Google search Network or even the
Display Network you have access to a
great tool called keybord planner and if
you know anything about SEO you'll know
that using Google's Keyword Planner is a
good tool so we'll take a look at that
MZ is a premium tool meaning they have a
trial that you can sign up for to test
drive it but it's another SEO platform
and it does cost money got a great tool
in screaming frog that's a paid version
again not too expensive we'll talk a
little bit more about that and then we
have you know a tool in HRS that help us
with all aspects of SEO primarily
focusing on off page so these are just
some examples that we're going to hone
in on but this is just a small subset of
what really is available out there in
the market so let's go ahead and dive a
little bit deeper and understand why we
use some of these tools well the first
reason when we talk about SEO is to find
relevant keywords not only do we want to
find relevant keywords we want to find
relevant keywords with high volume and
low competition okay we wouldn't want to
find non-relevant keywords with high
competition low volume that wouldn't
make sense so we need a tool to kind of
help us put it all together together and
so the tool of choice for us is Google's
Keyword Planner and Google's Keyword
Planner helps us hone in on keywords we
may be interested in optimizing for
because not only one are they relevant
but two they're going to have high
volume and low competition so let's take
a look at an example in Google's Keyword
Planner so here I am I'm in Google's
Keyword Planner and as I mentioned
before Google's Keyword Planner is
situated under Google ads okay so you
have to have a Google ads account to use
Google's Keyword Planner and so when
you're in Google ads you simply go to
tools and then under Tools you're going
to select Keyword Planner so what we
want to do is look for keywords we're
focusing on organic search not
necessarily paid search so organic
search we want to hone in on some
keywords so let's just use one of the
examples that Google's given us here
mail delivery so we're we're going to
just type in mail delivery and get some
results so notice I can enter a domain
as a filter and so in other words hey I
could say look hone in on keywords
related to this website if I wanted to
but I'm asking Google hey just give me
something closely related to mail
delivery because that's my business so
I'm going to click click get results
notice I can add another key to it if I
wanted to but I'm just going to stick
with one keyword but there are certainly
other keywords that I can certainly hone
in on if mail delivery is my business
and so let's just hone in on that one
keyword mail delivery we want to be
found organically for that keyword so
what Google Keyword Planner does is not
only give us the keyword and other
keywords relevant to that but it gives
us the average monthly search volumes
and this is an average over the course
of the last 12 months and notice here I
get a column for competition so I'm able
to see whether that's a very competitive
keyword or not and then just to give you
an extra Edge when you're choosing
keywords you can get a sense of what the
keyword May cost if you wanted to bid on
that for paid search so for mail
delivery I can see it's anywhere between
$746 and at the top of the page high
range
$16.61 so that should alert me to the
fact that hey if I'm going to try and
optimize for this keyword I know it's
competitive because not only Google is
telling me it's competitive by telling
me high competition but I know that the
cost per click seems a little bit high
and what is a little bit High well you
know I could see some other keywords
here that you know a dollar to $3 okay I
could see some other ones that are even
lower than the $7 they suggesting so
that's a indication that the keyword is
highly competitive so the idea here
using Google's Keyword Planner is one we
want to get an idea of what other
keywords are out there that are relevant
so it helps stimulate some ideas for
relevancy two we can get an average
monthly search volume so we want to know
on average over the past 12 months how
many search queries I can expect from
this keyword and then three I can get a
sense of the competition how competitive
is this keyword so if I try to optimize
for this keyword and I want to rank for
organically is it competitive if it's
competitive then it's probably going to
take me a bit longer to be found for
this keyword on page one of Google so
that's the whole idea behind Google's
Keyword Planner and note that you could
change some of the settings here so if
you want to choose a different language
okay you can hone in on a longer or
shorter period of time you can even
choose a specific location so I chose
Texas I can certainly choose the entire
United states to get a sense of what the
volume would be for the total us so you
have settings that you can change and
manipulate to get you the data you need
to choose keywords so that's the whole
idea behind Google's Keyword Planner to
find relevant keywords high volume low
competition now alternatively I can
certainly use another tool to find
keywords so I have a Moz account so I
logged into MZ and Moz has a tool called
keyword Explorer so if I use that same
keyword I used in Google's Keyword
Planner mail delivery I'm going to ask M
to give me some data on that keyword so
this is for the entire United States and
again I can change that if I wanted to
okay so I can hone in on a specific
country or different country so what Ma
is telling me hey for this keyword in
the entire United States I'm looking at
anywhere from
115,000 to
30,000 on monthly volume now what M does
is they give you a difficulty score so a
difficulty score is a score between one
and 100 and so I can see this is pretty
much right down the middle in terms of
difficulty okay so if it's zero it's an
easy keyword if it's if it's 100 it's
very difficult and then that means you
have a lot of competitors who are
optimizing for this keyword that are
ranking for this keyword and so MZ gives
us the volume they give us the
competition and they just like Google's
Keyword Planner gives us some other
keywords that we can potentially hone in
on so here I could see keyword delivery
plans delivery services Etc so I can see
a lot more suggestions than what's
listed here so Moz delivers a bunch of
other analysis uh related to the keyword
you know they also give you some good
keyword suggestions so Moz is a good
alternative tool and we'll be coming
back back to Mo related to SEO for some
other of its features but for now if you
don't want to necessarily use Google's
Keyword Planner because maybe you're not
running Google ads you can always use
Moz now remember MZ has basically a
freemium version meaning you can sign up
for a free account and you can sign up
for a free account as a test trial and
you could test it for period of days and
leverage its tools during that free
trial to get a better sense of how these
tools work so we want to be able to use
mods we want to be able to use Google's
Keyword Planner not only to search for
all those relevant keywords available to
you but we want to be able to choose
keywords with high volume and low
difficulty low competition we also want
to select primary and second keywords
wisely so remember when you optimize
you're optimizing a page for more than
one keyword so you want to be able to
have a nice portfolio of diverse
relevant keywords when with high search
volume and low difficulty and then you
want to be able to identify those
keywords that your competitors are
ranking for so Moz gives you that
information and so we want to be able to
leverage the tools available to us to
choose the right keywords so if you need
any more information on this we got a
nice webinar on keyword research for SEO
so take a look at that video on YouTube
uh to get more specific details about
about using SEO tools for keyword
research and all about keyword research
in general for SEO so let's talk about
some other reasons under SEO why we
would use some of these tools available
to us well we want to be able to
understand the search engines and how
they crawl and index our site okay we
also want to check the correct format of
the site map and we want to monitor
backlinks okay we also want to analyze
linking to our web page okay which ones
are good which ones are not good okay we
also want to perform some competitor
analysis so these are some of the
reasons why other than keyword research
why would would we use some of these SEO
tools so we have tools available to us
Majestic HRS again mods let's take a
look at Google search console and I want
to hone in on Google search console
because it is free and it's a must if
you're going to work work on SEO you
need to be working in Google search
console and so the whole key behind
Google search console is you have a
website and you need to get that site
verified once it's verified once Google
can recognize that you are associated
with this website then you're going to
be able to see some important
information so here I'm looking at a
website and what am I looking at I'm
looking at something called coverage
under index so what does coverage mean
well going back to what we just said we
want to be able to understand how
Google's crawling and indexing our pages
and so what Google does is through this
platform search console is they're
letting us know once they go to our
website and start crawling it and they
pull these Pages back to their server
they're letting us know if we actually
have any issues so here I could see I
have some issues with 112 page PES and
some of those issues are listed down
here so there could be a crawl issue a
44 you know redirect okay so you could
see there's some five unique issues
across 112 pages so here I could see
submitted URL marked no index there's a
hundred of those pages we have some
redirect errors there's seven pages that
you know fall victim to this error and
so we can really hone in on what the ER
is and address the error okay so if
Google's telling us hey this is an issue
and you want that page indexed by Google
then we should probably address the
error and so that's the great thing here
about going into Google search console
is you can under index go to coverage
and get a sense of what Google's
indexing and what they're not indexing
so these are the errors I can see
they've certainly were able to crawl an
index 9,115
Pages uh they were able to crawl okay
and they excluded
54,000 plus pages and then we also have
some pages with some warnings so this is
kind of an overview of what Google Sees
when they crawl our site so when they
say crawl they're coming to our site
they're following links on the site and
every link they follow they're either
going to index that page or they're
going to report to you an error or an
issue that they found if we want these
pages in index we need to address the
issues the errors and so that's the
beauty of this report here is Google is
telling us firsthand what the issues are
so we also want to take a look at the
sitemap so you have an opportunity to
submit a sitemap and a sitemap is just a
formatted file that includes all your
website URLs and so you're going to have
this file sitting in your root directory
and your problem probably going to call
it or should call it sitemap.xml XML
being the format so once you have this
file you're just going to let Google
know that that file exists so you're
going to enter in the sitemap URL so if
it's in the root directory all you're
going to do is type in sitemap.xml and
click submit so once you've done it just
like this site is done what Google's
going to do is say hey look we see you
submitted this and we last read it a
couple days ago and we could see that
that we discovered 1,419 URLs so I can
go back under coverage and I can see
some of the issues that they found but
if I go back under sitemaps I can see
that these are the URLs they discovered
via the sitemap and so the whole point
of a Sit map is we want to be able to
get and push the URLs to Google not have
Google come to our site and discover
them so this is a quicker faster more
efficient way to communicate with Google
all the URL
that you have on your site that you want
Google to index and so that's the beauty
of search console now while we're in
search console we might as well take a
look at some of the other features it
has and so one of the most important
features under search console is this
mobile usability report so Google is a
staunch believer in mobile first so
nowadays most people start and finish a
lot of their searches a lot of their
behavior on mobile so they begin it on
mobile and they may end it on mobile so
if they don't end it on mobile then you
know perhaps they'll go into a store or
perhaps they'll go via desktop but
Google is a staunch believer and
definitely a lot of what's going on
today starts with mobile so they want
you to understand how your site fars Via
Mobile and when I say fars Via Mobile is
it mobile friendly is it responsive is
it loading quick enough you know is it
formatted to Google standards and so if
there are any issues Google's going to
let you know what those issues are so
here I could see Google's recognized 206
pages with four different issues okay so
here I can see what those issues are
just like the coverage issues we can see
specifically what they are and so here I
can see for 206 Pages text too small to
read click elements too close together
the viewport not set to device width and
then content wider than the screen so
there's 10 pages that fit under this
error and if I actually click on it the
error I could see what those 10 pages
are and so when we're done we can
actually when we address the issues we
can actually have Google validate
whether the fix has been made so you can
definitely use this as a means of
communicating directly with Google
telling Google look I see what the
issues are I'm going to fix them and
then I want you to validate them okay so
this this is important because if you
can communicate with Google and let them
know hey we do recognize the errors we
are fixing the errors please validate
them you know it's going to draw
Google's attention Google's going to
validate them and get these Pages index
quicker um so if you ignore the issues
and the errors especially for mobile
then you stand the chance of your pages
not getting index so the mobile
usability report to me is an important
report because we want to better
understand and whether Google's picking
up issues on mobile and if they are we
want to address them get Google valid
them so Google can index them quicker
now there's another report that is of
interest to you or may be of interest to
you in Google search console and that's
the links report so the links report in
Google search conso tells us what pages
have the most links okay so here we can
see the homepage has 26,000 plus links
if we hone in on interior Pages we can
see the links to those pages okay so we
can get a sense of what are the top link
pages from external links meaning links
on other websites pointing to these
pages I can also see internal links so
Google's recognizing links from within
my website from one page to another so
external links internal links both
factors for SEO when ranking so then I
could see top linking sites what sites
are linking to my site and then I can
see top linking text so Google search
console is giving me kind of an overview
of what my linking structure looks like
okay so externally I want links from
other websites pointing to various pages
of my site and I certainly want my pages
linking to one another on my site and so
i' be able to better understand what
that structure looks like using Google
search consoles links report okay
there's one more report that I think
interest in Google search console and
that's the performance report so the
performance report is a report that
actually you can link up with Google
analytics so you could see the same
report in analytics if you're able to
link up Google search console with
analytics and you should be able to do
that all you need to do is make sure you
use the same email address that you use
for analytics and search console so it
needs to be the same email address you
could certainly link up the two and have
this data imported into Google analytics
so what is this data that we're talking
about well it's called performance so
what we can actually see is the queries
the actual queries people are typing in
to Google so when they're typing them
into Google we can actually see how many
Impressions the keyword queries received
and how many clicks the keyword queries
received and then I can see click the
rate and average position Okay so here I
can see for this particular keyword on
the first line I could see over the
course of the last 3 months it received
29,285 Impressions so what does that
mean that means this keyword was used at
Le or typed in as a query at least that
many times and that's how many times my
listing appeared in the Google search
results Pages based on this particular
query and so as a result
of somebody typing in this query 209,000
plus times this site received 120,000
plus clicks so to get a sense of the
click through rate all you would need to
do and Google can obviously do this for
you is you would simply just divide the
2092979267
[Music]
so over half of the clicks occur when
this listing appears for this keyword
okay so we can get a sense of the click
the rate for each one okay and you could
simply just use the filtering here now
we can also see average position okay so
we could see a little bit more than that
too we can go from queries to Pages we
can go from pages to countries so we get
a sense of how many Impressions and
clicks I'm receiving by country and
importantly we can see by device so here
I can see a majority of the people who
conduct a search related to my website
primarily do it on desktop now I
mentioned the beauty of the Google
search console performance report is
that you can link it up to Google
analytics and when you do that all you
need to do then is go to acquisition
Google search console and then from
there you could choose landing pages
countries devices or queries so I see
the same data that I see in search
console but this time I'm looking at it
in Google analytics and so here I can
see what my search queries are my clicks
my Impressions my clickd rate buy search
query and then the average position so
that's the great thing about that
performance report is that when I link
up Google search console with analytics
I'm able to see that data in analytics
so that's an added bonus so to speak now
let's talk about some other reasons why
we are going to use these SEO tools
available to us and so we already listed
a number of different reasons ranging
from site maps to keyword research but
we also want to hone in on you know what
domains are driving links to our site so
I showed you an example in search
console we also want to hey maybe
identify and disavow poor backlinks so
search console is a great tool for that
because if we don't want to be
associated with a particular website we
can certainly disavow that link we could
track a number of follow and no follow
links okay we could track our website's
rankings we can measure clickthrough
rates and Impressions just as we did
with search console we could track
keyword ranking for desktop mobile cross
locations just as we just did with the
search console performance report we can
identify top performing gaining and
losing keywords again the performance
report so we could certainly look at the
Google search console report but if you
have a platform like MZ you can
certainly also look at a lot of that
data available so for example rankings
so if you have a Maz account we can
certainly go into rankings okay and we
can see for the keywords that we've
chosen that we want to optimize for we
can certainly see where they rank the
great thing about MZ is it's a great
tool not only for rankings and onpage
optimization but for off-page
optimization as well so if I go ahead
and take a look at a domain for example
I'm just going to type in this domain
I'm going to be able to get what they
call a domain Authority so a score out
of one and 100 I'm able to see how
authoritative my domain is and how
authoritative a domain is is based on
the quality of links pointing to it so
Moz gives me some good insight sites as
to how many linking domains how many
inbound links I have ranking keywords
and it goes into detail as well so here
if I click on the linking domains I'm
going to be act able to see the actual
domains pointing to my site as an
external link and not only can I see the
domains I can actually see the domain
authority of those domains so if there's
a domain for example that doesn't have a
good domain Authority and the site
appears a bit scammy per se then we can
disavow that so I can certainly look at
all the domains that are linking to me
and then I can highlight the ones that
have poor domain Authority what Moz even
takes it a step further they also give
me a Spam score so Moz is able to
measure how spammy a website is so if I
have a combination of say a low domain
Authority and a high spam score for then
I probably want to disavow myself from
that site and so I can use this report
here you could see here as I keep going
down for example I could see this
particular website has a domain
authority of 26 and it has a Spam score
of 16% so not a good combination this
should alert me to the fact that hey
this particular site because it has so
many links pointing to me or it has at
least one L link pointing to me that I
probably want to disavow myself because
it's probably hurting my own domain
Authority so that's the great thing
about this linking domains report is I'm
able to hone in on not only who's link
linking to me meaning domain but how
many linking domains does that domain
have what's the spam score of that
domain what's the domain authority of
that domain and then I can get into a
little bit more detail and I actually
see you know all the links pointing to
that domain so it really goes into
detail about backlinks domain Authority
spam Etc everything you need to use in
order to measure off page SEO so that's
the great thing about MZ is they have
not only on page SEO tools but off-page
SEO tools and Moz is a premium so to
speak so here you could see if you just
go to
m.com free-- tools you'll be able to use
some of these tools available to you not
just for SEO but also for local SEO as
well so here you like some of these
tools you can start your free 30-day
trial so I use and lean on Moz a lot for
all that it has to offer from choosing
keywords to rankings report to checking
issues on my website to even checking
who's linking to me so this fits in the
mold with everything I need to do for
SEO so in addition to that keyword
research video you could certainly lean
on some other webinars that we've done
in the past on SEO so we've done a
webinar on SEO tools and we've also done
a webinar on SEO tips and tricks so if
you want any more information about the
tools we covered or SEO in general take

keyword research is like finding the
words people type into search engines
it's vital for online success picture it
as using the right words to get noticed
on Google by knowing that words people
use you can make your content match what
they're looking for this is crucial
because it means the right people find
your website it's not just about being
at the top of the Google it's about
talking in a way that makes sense to
your audience keyword research is like a
guide helping you know where your
audience is looking it's the key to
making sure your website is easy to find
and has what people are searching for
the significance of research lies in its
ability to line your online presence
with the actual language your audience
uses it ensures that your content
resonates with their queries attracting
a relevant audience interest in your
offerings essentially keyword research
is a strategic tool that not only boosts
search engine rankings but also
establishes a connection between your
content and specific terms your audience
employs making your online presence both
accessible and meaningful all right so
this was about what is keyword research
and why is it important now let's
understand how to do a keyword research
using chat GPT for that let's go to
google.com so as you can see we have
opened Google Now all we have to do is
to write first of all we'll write
aipm AI PM all right so AI PRM or AI PRM
for chat gbt you can type now let's open
the first link we'll click on the first
link so this is basically an extension
it is a Marketplace of prompts they
provide you prompts that you don't have
to type the whole prompt they have
pre-made prompts that you can use all
right now we can click on this add to
Chrome button over here ADD
extension
right so as you can see this is a whole
new outlook of this chat gbt this is
aprm prompt extension so basically they
give you pre-made prompts as you can see
this you used SE optimized content
writer fully SE optimized article
including so there are numerous as we
can see four five80 prompts so you can
choose accordingly whichever prompt you
want and you can also search over here
and this is topic activity sort by you
can also sort and prompts SP page you
can customize it according to yourself
so as you can see here is the topic uh
we can go to topic and we can select so
we want to basically do uh keyword
research we'll go to SEO we'll click on
SEO after that in activity we can select
this uh keywords all right now as you
can see there are numerous prompts
according to what we have selected that
YouTube SEO keyword generator SEO
optimize your Google business profile
Etc so we can select as per our choice
so what I have figured out which is best
is this one keyword analysis I repeat
keyword analysis so as we can see find
the table of best keywords with search
volume CPC paid difficulty Su difficulty
so for those who don't know about uh CPC
so uh CPC or cost per click is a measure
in online advertising that represents
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on your ad it's essentially the cost of
each interaction with your advertisement
higher the CPC values often indicate
more competitive keywords or advertising
spaces and as you can see pay difficulty
is also written so pay difficulty refers
to how challenging it is to compete for
a particular keyword in paid advertising
a higher paid difficulty score means
that it might be more expensive or
competitive to bid for that keyword in
paid search campaigns so now there is
SEO difficulty so SEO difficulty
basically is a measure of how hard it is
to rank organically for a specific
keyword in search engine res
a higher Su difficulty suggests that it
might be more challenging to optimize
your content to appear higher in unpaid
organic search results for that keyword
it takes into account factors like
competition and the existing strength of
other Pages ranking for the same keyword
so these are the meanings of these
things as we can see so we have already
clicked on this now as you can see seed
keyword that you search for so let's say
uh I'm searching for cloud Computing
let's
say cloud computing and let's click on
this so as we can see they are creating
all these now let's explore keywords
related to cloud computing along with
the respective search volume all right
so as you can see keyword these are the
keywords that we got and these are the
search volumes so we all know what
search volume is the number of searches
and the CPC as we already discussed what
is CPC again if somebody wants to know
about it CPC or cost click is a measure
in online advertising that represents
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on your ad so these are the amount you
pay when someone clicks on these ads all
right so paid difficulty again it refers
to how challenging it is to compete for
a particular keyword in paid advertising
so this is paid difficulty of each of
these keywords then SEO difficulty SEO
difficulty is a measure of how hard it
is to rank organically for a specific
keyword in search engine results so
these are the uh suq difficulty so we
can select accordingly and the table
index is a mix of 100 keywords including
longtail LSI so longtail keywords are
also there as you can see we'll discuss
longtail keywords also after this so
this is how you can do keyword research
using chat GPT we'll do one or two more
demos regarding this so let's do another
example so we are going to select
keyword analysis and and then we'll have
to put seed keyword remember to select
SEO first of all here we can see SEO and
then in activity you have to select
keywords because we are doing the
keyword research all right now after
selecting this keyword analysis we want
Bas we basically want all these things
like search volume CPC PID difficulty
ESO difficulty so that we can choose the
right keywords accordingly so let's see
here we have to put the seed keyword so
let's say the seed keyword is is let's
say
devops all right let's click on
this so they are giving us the keywords
a lot of keywords they usually give
let's explore the keyword analysis for
devops so as you can see high search
volume very high search volume high so
these search volumes regarding these
keywords are shown and the CPC is also
showing and paid difficulty SEO
difficulty as well so we basically want
the SEO difficulty is to minimum like
minimum or like medium so we can search
or extract those keywords accordingly so
they have written this table includes a
mix of 100 relevant longtail keywords
LSI keywords and FAQ related to devops
it provides insights into search volume
CPC cost per click pay difficulty and
SEO difficulty to help optimize your
content and reach the target audience
effectively so through this you can
select these keywords and I think if
we'll click on continue it'll keep on
going for more keywords so as you can
see longtail keywords now it is showing
so these are LSI keywords so we will
discuss these uh terms longtail longtail
keywords LSI keywords after some time
later in this I repeat later in this
video so this is how you can simply do a
keyword research using chat GPT again
this keyword research is completely free
you have you don't have to pay a single
Buck regarding this now let's try
another method of doing a keyword
research for that all you have to do do
is to go to Google and we'll
type
keywords
everywhere all right so here's the first
link let's click on this this is another
extension install for Chrome we'll click
on install for Chrome now let it open
and now we can click on add to Chrome to
just add this extension in our Chrome
browser as you can see ADD extension so
I think it is added now now all we have
to do is to pin this one
all right so now uh let's go to chat GPT
let's open a new
one so as you can see this is keywords
everywhere icon please continue as you
can see clarify explain reite so for
that to use this extensions powers or
functionality all we have to do is to
click on this template button all right
now here the thing is first of all we'll
select choose a category similarly that
we have done previously choose a
category so as you can see copywriting
marketing SEO social media productivity
professionals we'll select SEO because
we want to do keyword research then in
subcategory we can select keyword
research and because we want to do
keyword research then there's a template
so here we can see first is keyword
strategy so you can click on keyword
strategy if you want to do basically a
strategize the keyword so basically I'll
tell you what keyword strategy is
keyword strategy involves planning like
how to use specific words or phrases in
your content to achieve specific goals
like it's about selecting and targeting
keywords that align with your overall
objectives whether it's to boost website
traffic increase conversions or enhance
your online visibility then there is get
search intent for keywords so it I
repeat so it itself tells what it is
like intent understanding search intent
for keywords means grasping the reason
behind someone online search it involves
figuring out what a person is looking
for when they type a particular keyword
into a search engine aligning your
content with users intent ensures that
your information meets their needs
improving the relevance of your content
then here is related keyword generator
so a related keyword generator is a term
or phrase closely connected to the main
keyword you're targeting including
related keywords in your content helps
search engines understand the content
and relevance of your page it's a way to
capture a broader range of search
queries related to your main topic then
there is longtail keyword so basically a
longtail keyword is a more specific and
detailed phrase usually consisting of
three or more words while these phrases
may have lower search volumes
individually they often attract a more
targeted audience longtail keywords can
be valuable for Niche topics are
generally easier to rank for than
broader more competitive terms so these
are all these things so let's say first
of all I want to to search for related
keyword generator and so first of all as
you can see category SEO subcategory
keyword research templates select
accordingly whichever you want I've
explained all these related keyword
generator I want basically when we'll
select related keyword generator this
will come up language is English we want
in English only here is the seed keyword
we'll have to write this is total
keywords how many keywords do we want we
can select accordingly basically I want
40 itself so this is a promt template
that automatically gets created whenever
you select a particular template so
let's say if I want to select keyword
strategy so it will create itself a
different kind of prompt so if I'll
select long tail then a different kind
of prompt will be generated so this is a
self-made itself it'll create a prompt
all you have to do is to write a seed
keyword over here so let's say as I said
I want related keyword generator and
let's type here devops
all right so total keywords I want 40
itself I'll click on execute
template all right so these are the 40
keywords that we wanted so related
keyword generator continues integration
infrastructure as Cod Dockers kubernetes
shenkin and they're also telling me the
search intent informational so all of
these keywords are informational so
firstly they'll create a table regarding
these keywords after that they will
basically list of same keywords separate
separated by commas as you can see same
keywords are separated by commas so that
you can easily use them wherever you
want all right so this we have selected
for the what we call Related keyword
generator now let's select another one
let's click on template again we'll go
to related or let's say longtail keyword
generator now we'll put devops
again
yes all right so as you can see
I think we'll have to select another new
chat we'll have to create all right now
again we'll go to template longtail
keyword generator devops and let's say
this time we want
50 all right so we'll see whenever we
are doing this editing here also it is
getting edited so let's type 60 then it
will get 60 and whenever we'll type
devops this will also get edited as you
can see so this is a prompt now we'll
click on execute template let's see how
it
goes so these are basically a longtail
keywords as you can see not a single
keyword devops best practices kubernets
deployment genis automation site
reliability engineer Etc basically the
search intent of all these keywords is
like informational this one we can see
commercial commercial transactional
deployment so they also show the search
intent and these all are the keywords
separated with commas there are 60 total
keywords now let's do another one we go
to template and we'll type let's say
this time we'll type mobile itself now
let's see the keyword strategy for
mobile we have typed mobile as a seat
keyword now execute
template so as you can see category
keyword search intent title and they're
also telling us the title about as you
can see Let It complete this one then
we'll show show this so it has generated
the table as you can see please note
that this table includes 24 entries to
maintain Clarity and conciseness if you
need additional keywords or adjustments
feel free to let me know we can click on
this continue to create more but let's
first just see as we can see first of
all types here there is device types
category mobile phone search intent
navigational and we can see title is

by registering your business on the
Google ads platform so simply go to
Google or the ads. goole.com log in with

right that they give you a foucher for
£400 in the UK yeah where you can if you

so you should be able to get those those
ad vouchers as well so it gives you lots
of suggestions on the goals that you can
achieve the power of Google advertising
for your business and it gives you some
case studies as well and what I really
like about the Google ads program that
you can actually get freeof charge
personalized support Y and by scheduling
a meet meeting with a Google ads expert
and I would highly um sort of uh
recommend you use that surface because
they can really help you with setting up
your first Google ads
campaign so let's go into this system we
can click Start now yeah or you can sign
in if you have an existing account so if
you click Start now it'll probably
immediately log in to my existing
account but what it will do it will
actually give you an overview of the
Google ads accounts that you already
have yeah or you can create a new Google
ads account so this step forms the
backbone for your online identity and it
gets you with an an seamless integration
between your business and the Google ads
um
environment as it were so very practical
steps to get you started on the Google
ads platform effectively so let's go on
to create a new Google ads
account so create a new
account and here it goes into the
process of creating a new Google ads
account so you need to add business
information you can then go straight
into creating your ads and set up your
budget now you can case go straight into
your first campaign and in the process
you will actually fill in your data to
sign up but what I advise you do here is
to skip the campaign creation that
you're not ready and then you will go in
a proper setup for your Google
ads so there's different elements that
you can do here so you give your billing
country you give your time zone your
garcy if you want personalized campaign
guidance I would certainly advise you
take that as I mentioned earlier yeah
you fill that data in and then you click
submit and then yes to continue I'll
I'll select no for now so click submit
and then you're basically all done and
then uh The Next Step what's going to
happen is actually you need to go
through the verification process now a
few more steps here the details are very
important if you go through the entire
process like your business name your
physical location your contact
information it's not about getting the
data but it's about crafting your
digital presence yeah so it goes beyond
checkboxes make sure that you add every
step yeah that you fill in every step in
the Pro
process okay so the next step is that
you will go through the verification
process when you've done that process it
is very important that you are going to
verify your account so how do you verify
your account you go back to your main
Google ads dashboard and I will explain
this dashboard a little later and you
click here on the billing and here you
see Advertiser
verification yes so here is where you go
into verification
to make sure that Google recognizes your
account and understands that you are the
actual business owner of this account so
that gives you an extra level of
security and integrity on your Google
ads account and once you verify it yes
so B Google has then r R your business
details and you can ensure your accuracy
but it can also gives you a good
foundation for this for your advertising
experience so it's more than Security
checks it's about making sure that your
data is correct and you have a solid
basis to start your journey in the
Google advertising

if you use these tools in setting up
your campaign it's also very important
to look at the structure of your gole
Google ads and the standard structure of
a Google ads campaign is to in it's
threefold there is the campaign level
there is the ad group and within the ad
group sits the um sit the ads and the
ads they inherit the setting of the ad
group and the ad group they inherit the
setting of The campaigns on campaign
level you talk about the objectives of
your campaign you look at the um the the
bidding strategy that you have for your
campaign in the the price that you the
budget that you want to assign in the ad
groups you can look at your keywords and
you can specify your ads as well so very
important that you think about that
structure and that will really help you
into uh organizing your campaign in a
structured
manner okay having gone through this
dashboard now let's jump into the Google
ads base Basics and create a campaign
and picking the right keywords so to
create a campaign you just go to the
campaign step and you click here the
plus to start or I can click here on the
campaign step I'm getting an overview of
my
campaigns and um but in this case I just
click on the campaign tab on the plus
button and that will take me to the sort
of the starting screen of my um Google
ads setup so I can decide my campaign
goal I can set a budget and I can pick a
bidding strategy so this is the
beginning of your ad game here you state
what you want do you want more clicks do
you want leads do you want brand
awareness how much do you want to spend
what is your bidding strategy do you
want to set it or do you want Google to
handle it yeah do you want more clicks
more
conversions and when you start this
process you're on the way to create your
first ads plan so here you
see
the different types of campaign
objectives that you can select and each
objective will kind of pre-select the
digital narrative within Google ads so
they serve different purposes whether it
is driving sales or driving website
traffic um or whether it is capturing
leads whether it is promoting your app
whether it is a local store visit
whether it is sales or a product and
brand consideration or you can also
decide to create a campaign without
selecting any of these and that is for
the more experienced people who can who
know exactly what to specify but if you
click one of these then Google will
automatically prepopulate kind of the
settings for you in the uh in the Google
ads screens that will follow so aligning
these types with your goals is very
important and they ensure that you get a
very impactful digital marketing
approach to your customers so let's
click on one of them yes so let's click
for instance on the uh we want website
traffic so here you see what type of
conversions that you want yes so that
could be page views that could submit
lead forms it could subscribe so you can
specify these conversions and you just
click here you click on continue and
here you select the campaign sort of
type that you want to select want to to
to run do you want a search campaign do
you want a display campaign do you want
Google to sort of Select it for you yeah
do you want a shopping campaign a video
campaign or do you want a demand gen
where you run ads on Youtube Gmail and
various other channels so let's say
we're going to create a um let's start
with a search campaign yeah so you put
in your website your website address
which in my case would be this website
you're going to give your campaign a
name and you click continue I'm going to
start a new campaign and here it's very
important that you specify the bidding
strategy that you set as you know Google
ADS works with an auction system you put
in a bid for when what you will pay uh
when people click on your ad and then
Google in the auction when people have
actually put in one of your keywords
Google will then use different methods
for making sure that the um the the best
bit in combination of various other
factors wins as it were and shows up at
the top of the uh the advertising
listings on Google ads now the the
highest bidder doesn't necessarily be at
automatically be at the number one spot
there is also a quality score of your ad
that is impacting whether or not you
would show at the top so your financial
uh core rest on the budget and the
bidding strategy so determine your daily
budget yeah align it with your
advertising objectives and uh it's very
important how how you want to set this
do you want to run it for conversions do
you want to run it for clicks yep so you
can set a maximum cost per click or you
can let Google set that automatically
for you yep and when you're happy with
how you set it you click next and then
you specify where you want to show your
ads yep so here you see you can specify
y the for the Google search campaign you
can specify the search Network you can
also show search ads on the Display
Network you can look at the network the
locations the languages you can specify
specific audiences or you can also do
some keyword matching for your search
campaigns there's various location
options they work very powerful yes so
you can spe specify by language you can
select audience segments so for instance
I would just do an advertisement on a
specific
sector so I can say give me just people
that are interested in
travel and they will then be added to uh
they will then be targeted with your
your
ads yep and then here you're going to
specify your uh the type of keyword
match that you want
so uh so that is very important and as
you can see in the Google search ads the
keywords are very important but I'll
come back to that in a minute what I
first want to do is go through the more
settings where you will sort of open up
additional functionality that will make
you use um give you a more advanced use
of the Google ads like how do you want
to rot rate your ads is there a start
and an end date for your campaign do you
have a specific ad schedule do you have
campaign URL options that is where you
want to um to track your campaigns or
Are there specific brand restrictions
that you do not want to associate with
your ads and the placement of your ads
so particularly on the ad schedule my
recommendation would be to select all
day when you start your ads let Google
decide what is the best timings for your
ads that gives the best response what
you will see when you set up your ads
that you set up multiple ads and Google
will mix and match the ads and will'll
select the best combination of the ads
that will give you the best performance
and we'll also select the best timings
so the first couple of days that your
advertising campaign is running Google
will be in what we say learning mode and
it will do all the tests it will run the
various options of your ads and it will
sort of slowly calibrate your ad
campaign to the best format the best
settings and the best
structure so this type of
control yeah is not about just Reaching
Your Right audience but it also does it
at the most opportune moments the best
times so it maximizes the effectiveness
of your uh your ads so very important
part of this is your keywords as I just
mentioned so for search campaigns here
is where you can specify your keywords
so what you can do you can get
suggestions from Google by entering your
website address and then Google will and
will sort of select the best keywords
for you and you can use those for your
search ads which means that every time
somebody types in any of these keywords
your ad will show to the to those people
depending on your bidding strategy or
you can add your own keywords based on
your keyword research and the tool that
I showed you earlier the Google Keyword
Planner is a fantastic tool that can
help you if in building those um those
those keyword lists for you now I'm not
going to go into the details here of
keyword uh research that may be the
topic for a future uh campaign so it's
very important that you align your
keywords with your business and that the
keywords resonate with your target
audience and make sure that you use the
key Google Keyword Planner to find the
right keywords or any other tool tools
that uh that are available in the market
the keyword is fundamental for your
search campaign it's not about what you
say in your ad but it is also how do
those keywords resonate with your
audience good that concludes the basic
setup of your ads on a campaign level
and on an ad group level
we're now going to look at our next demo
where we're going to look at
targeting and also where we're going to
look at how to create an
ad so as we shift Focus the spotlight
turns now to defining and refining your
target
audience and particularly this will be
important when you set up a display
campaign and when you go into the
campaign settings for the display and
you follow the menu down here you get to
the targeting option and that is the
first place where you can specify your
the which people you target with your
display ads so this is where you can
identify demographics interests and
behaviors that resonate with your brand
so this ensures if you set that that
your ads are played to those people that
are most likely to engage with your
Brands so navigating through these
audience setting is not about casting a
wiet it is about Precision about
reaching the right people at the right
time so let's click on the targeting and
you see here that you hone in on various
areas you can hone in on audience
segments demographics keywords topics
and placement
and here while you're going through
these targeting options you can keep
track of your um estimated number of
Impressions and your estimated
performance for your ads so exploring
this array of audio targeting options
audience targeting options is about
tailoring your message to different
personalities different audiences and so
at audience
segments that is where you can select
audiences who are particularly
interested in travel or lifestyle and
hobbies and there is literally hundreds
of segments that people can um can
select yeah you can search for any
segment you can let's say here let's do
um train
Enthusiast just taking a random topic
yeah let's see what comes up and here is
train
information train hobby traveling by
train um so everything to do with trains
that you can pick here you can even
probably take miniature trains so you
can Target those people very
specifically that ensures that your ad
is not visible but also relevant to
specific segments of your target
audience so that is through the audience
segments and again if you pick one so
say um train information then here you
see how your weekly estimates are um are
changing yeah so you can SC by selecting
you put them in your Target and then you
see how your um advertising campaign is
likely to perform so let's stay away
from the train let's go to uh um
Adventure
travel for instance and now you get all
those people that are interested in
adventure
vacations activity
holidays Wildlife trips Etc and again
you see how your performance is changing
so that is the audience segments we then
going to go to the next level that is
demographics we're targeting male let's
say um between
25 and 44 years with a slightly higher
higher household income let's say the
top um 21 so we're going for the the top
uh tier and again your estimates are
being adjusted and then you can go to
the next one you can add targeting so
you can Target keywords so this is for
instance I am tar targeting those people
that have a specific interest in
Kilimanjaro for instance and um ke Lian
jaro yep and I can add that as a keyword
if I want and
Morocco and you see how my weekly
estimates are becoming more and more
specific I can add keyword ideas through
for my website as well so let's say that
is done and then we can go to the the
final uh targeting which was by topics
yeah or you can even Target by
placements so if we want Adventure
magazines yeah so Adventure magazines
you can then select those magazines or
those online Publications where your ads
will show so you can ask by default ask
Google to select this for you but if
you're very experienced in your industry
you know specific magazines where you
want to place your ad then very likely
you will find them in the list here it
takes a little while to go through this
list of thousands if not hundreds of
thousands of online Publications but
then you can really Target very specific
by magazine while it is doing this let's
go to the optimized targeting which is
on which means Google will actually help
you get more viewable Impressions yeah
find people beyond your targeting
signals so that is what Google will help
you to fine tune your um uh your
targeting and um give you even better
results for your campaign yes so we
targeted the adventure Channel Adventure
magazine so here are 253 websites there
are YouTube channels that you can Target
YouTube videos apps and app categories
where your ad can show so this is a very
good section where you can make your ads
reach the right people so that is one
area where you can
feature um where you can be very
specific in the targeting of your ad
that is within the display campaign
settings
you can also Target People based on
behavior and one very important
behavior is um what they have done on
your website in the
past yeah and that is what we're going
to look at next as part of this audience
uh segmentation and audience targeting
we're going to look at how can I
leverage activities from people behavior
of people for instance visiting my
website or buying a product yeah how can
I how can I capitalize on those um on
those people and maybe put them in a
separate audience that I can then Target
with my ads this is what we call
retargeting and I can Target people with
an ad once they ficient at my website
for a particular product P page for
instance and I'm sure you've experienced
that yourself that you were visiting an
ad and that you or that you were
visiting a product on a website and then
you put a product in the basket but you
decide not to buy that product and then
the next time you go on Facebook or on
YouTube you actually see a product for
that ad so that is the next section that
we will be looking
at a new feature in Google ads are
conversion goals conversion goals help
you organize your conversion actions so
that you can more move more easily
towards achieving your advertising
objectives so actions that you want your
customers to take or conversion actions
are grouped together based on related
categories to form these conversion
goals so how do you get there you go
here to goals you click on
conversions and here you have a summary
of your conversion goals for example the
purchase conversion or the Subscribe
conversion goal would automatically
contain all conversion actions from
people to subscribe to a particular form
and this simplifies your conversion
management and it improves your campaign
performance so very powerful new aspect
within Google ads to manage your
conversions in one central place so how
do you set a a conversion you set it up
here in the new conversion
action so you can set up a conversion
action for your website for your apps or
for phone calls or you can import data
from Google or from Salesforce or other
um tools but the most important one
again is getting conversion tracking
setup for your website so when you click
on that you can then put in your website
domain you can click
scan and it will then scan the website
if it's already set up to measure
conversions which basically means have
you already set up conversion tags on
your
website so Google ads can track those
web pages so you can it has been set up
so you can actually create specific
conversion actions you can do that from
website events you can also create
conversion actions manually by using
specific code so if you use transaction
specific values transaction ideas yeah
so then you can use this option but the
easiest one is to use the create
conversion action from website event so
you can actually accept suggestion or
for setting up a conversion goal you can
also add a conversion goal so you can
select a category for
instance um a subscribe the event type
could be a page load on this website and
then you just click
add the URL is required for that would
be the about us yeah and then I click
add and then the the code has been the
conversion goal has been created I click
save and
continue and then it sets up this
conversion
action where of course I need to make
sure I set it up properly with a Google
tag through Google tag manager now this
section is not about teaching you how to
use Google tag manager we have a
separate video for that but I just want
to make you aware of the process of how
to do that that you can also email the
instructions to your Web Master yep so
let's say if we want to email the
instruction then we'll just put in the
email address and then it's uh sent or
you can also set it up yourself and then
what you do is you get a piece of
code where you that you basically need
to copy and that you need to paste in
the Google tag manager so you can use
Google tag manager that's where you use
this particular piece of code you can
also install manually and here is the
piece of code that you need to install
on every page of the
website so then Google can see that that
is a tag for those specifical specific
conversion goals that um Google then can
then start
tracking good you can test the
installation as well but I'll just want
to make you aware where you go to set
that
up okay so those are the conversion
goals in
Google the last topic of this
demo the last topic of this demo is ADD
placements and the networks to add
networks and the actual creation of ads
this is very important it is like
choosing the stage for your performance
and exploring the various options
including the Google search Network the
Display Network and YouTube is vital to
align your uh your ads with your
advertising of network your advertising
objectives so the
different ad options that you have they
start with the Google search Network the
Google search Network places your ads in
search engine results that gives you
visibility for your ads when users
actively search for related content the
next area is the Display Network that
showcases your ad across a multitude of
websites and apps thereby having a big
reach of your uh your ads YouTube as a
video platform offers a very extensive
advertising platform with lots of
advertising opportunities and different
um different versions of ads and
tailoring your approach to each
platform will amplify the effectiveness
of your ad strategy to make sure that
you get maximum impact on your ads now
let's go to the fun part of Google ads
and that is the actual creation of your
ads so we'll head to over to the ads we
go to the campaigns click a campaign
here is the campaign we're going to
first create a search ads which is let's
say for website
traffic we go to continue and here is
the search ad that we're going to create
we'll add our
website and we'll click
continue and we'll start a new campaign
and where we're going to is the keywords
and the ads so we have already set up
the keywords we're going now straight to
the actual ads and this is a very
important section where you are a able
to set up your Google search ads they
are based on um
the a combination of headlines up to 15
and
descriptions up to
four and a number of extensions like
site links or call outs and different
other
extensions okay you can set that all up
and then Google will mix and Ma match
those different elements of your ads to
come up with the ad with the best
performance and what's really nice here
is they show you a preview of what the
ad will look like with the different
headlines and the different
descriptions and here you see your
campaign optimization score with the
weekly estimates of how many conversions
and how many what your weekly cost is
here you see your ad strength and here
you see at the moment it is poor because
I need to make the description more more
unique so you can get ideas and you'll
see that this area will become more and
more advanced and more and more driven
by artificial intelligence in the future
yeah to make sure that you get the best
ads possible for your
market so again this is a short demo I'm
not going to go into every little detail
yeah but this is where you create your
search ads so that is the first
area the second area where you create
your ads is of course for the display
campaigns so if I go back to Google
ads and I am going to create a new
campaign but now I'm going to create a
brand awareness Campa campaign for
display ads again here I say
russia.com I click continue I'm going to
go start
new and here I can of course we've been
through all these settings remember the
campaign settings the budget and the
bidding and the targeting and here we go
to the
ads and here you can
specify the URL your business name you
can add up to 15 images so where you
upload an image let's say we're going to
use the image of this room and you see
here in different formats and we're
going to add this images as well so
we're going to click
save and then you can add a text you
could even add a video you can add a
headline and here you will see what the
ad will looks look
like now make sure that you have
switched off your ad blocker if you have
set up an ad blocker and because when
you have an ad blocker then this the the
the preview of the ad will not show so I
need to add the final URL I need to add
the https for
this yep so here is the final URL with
the business name and now in a bit the
ad should show up we should have the bus
business name two images One headline so
we'll add um welcome to riat for
Russia and a
description book your
adventure holiday
now okay and then here you see how the
ad would look
like very simple very straightforward
but it is all about of course the
quality of the images the headlines that
you're using the description that you're
using but at least this gives you an
idea of what an ad looks like and how
you would create that within the display
um ad
category so here is a few
tips yes so uh add copy is very
important yeah relevant visuals and
formulate clear call to actions they are
the fundamental elements of your in of
your ads compelling ad copy is about
Clarity and enticement and about having
a concise message and be different so
the integration of the relevant visuals

like this video click the like button
below and subscribe to our um our
Network so you get access to other
videos that we will be publishing in the
near future what social media marketing
actually means what is it yeah and we
got to put this in the context of the
definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the basic concept has not
changed if you look at the definition of
marketing it's the activity of creating
community iting delivering and
exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your
customers so two very important aspects
here there is value and there is
customer and that is what we capture in
the marketing concept you put the
customer at the core of what you do yeah
because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
marketing in that context then the
second part of the social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content the
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the um the
currency of social media if you have
really good content that you can share
on the internet
yeah using various multip multiple
social media channels like Facebook like
YouTube or like video or like Instagram
or blogging you name it yeah people will
engage with your
content and then when people start
engaging with your content they may come
back for more content that you supply
and they will then become part of your
community so Community is a very
important aspect of your social media
definition with really good content you
can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running
campaigns yeah and a campaign makes it
relevant for
businesses because when you run a
campaign you have a goal for your
campaign you have an objective you have
a start you have an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that with a
customer at in the core of what you
do yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media marketing
is very basic it says the use of social
media to develop a company's brand
increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most important aspect
here is that you need to have an outcome
you need to have a result which is
customer related
and that is where the sales element
comes in you do this to get the customer
to do something and in the end that is
buying your product or your
service yeah so social media marketing
is not the
Tactical combination of your social
media networks yeah to um to reach as
many people there needs to be a goal to
it and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your social media marketing so keep
that in mind everything you do with your
social media marketing in the end comes
down to reaching your goals or achieving
your objectives of developing your
company's brand increase website traffic
or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is
data is
intelligence is
knowledge in the early days of marketing
the biggest problem has always been how
to measure the the success of your
marketing campaigns if I ran adverts in
a magazine how do I measure the
effectiveness if I do a PR campaign and
they write about me in the newspaper how
do I measure the effectiveness of that
how can I track that when somebody buys
a product it actually is as a result of
the pr campaign that I Ran So in the
early pre- interet days yeah we the only
way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through loyalty card or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to relate that to
your marketing then the internet emerged
and all of a sudden I could track
traffic to my
website yeah I could see how many people
visit my website are these people that
visit my website for the first time are
they returning visitors what are the
most popular pages that they see how
long do they stay on my website and are
they actually buying my
products yeah so that was a major
advancement of marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure engagement
how many people are having conversations
with us I could even measure sentiments
are people positive about my brand are
they negative about my Brands I could
track the effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the
effectiveness of my advertising
campaigns that I ran online so today's
reality is that we can measure
everything we can measure clicks we can
measure transactions we can measure
engagements we can measure return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people may respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running so it's a very
important aspect of your digital uh your
social media
marketing so as I mentioned earlier
social media is a complete complely new
way for businesses to engage with their
customers yeah you can no longer go
without it it's a new channel to Market
it is a new channel for engagement with
your customers it is a new channel to
learn it's a new channel to listen to
find out what's happening in the market
so it's now it's it's it's there in
every aspect of your business and not
only for the marketing department it's
there for the sales department it's
there for Logistics it's there for the
customer service department it's there
for the HR department using social media
for your recruitment is a very important
element of social media marketing yes so
keep that in mind that social media
marketing is no not a fat it is there
and it's there to stay and it touches
every aspect of your
business now to summarize this there are
three areas where social media has
changed the way businesses operate first
of all there is the connection social
media is a new way to connect with your
stakeholders yeah and stakeholders in
this case can be customers they can be
prospects influencers your own employees
using social media for
internal and not only on a local scale
this happens nowadays on a global scale
the internet allows you to sell locally
to a global audience if you want to yeah
so you can you
can cover the world you can Target
specific audiences wherever they are so
the connection aspect the targeting
aspect yeah the the market where you
want to sell your product is opened up
through social media and that is a big
benefit for business the second area
where social media has changed
businesses fundamentally is in the
interaction site it's not just about
connecting with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their terms on
their preferred platform and remember in
social media land the customer is in the
driving seat if you're not interacting
with them on their terms you're going to
miss the train it's not about you don't
liking Facebook or
LinkedIn yeah as long as your customers
are on Facebook you better be on
Facebook otherwise you're going to miss
the
boat yeah because if you don't interact
with them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
with them
yep so it's the connection aspect it's
the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this yeah what we talked about
can be done and you can track every
aspect of your social media marketing at
a customer level and it gives you the
key performance indicators like
conversion ratios sales ratios customer
satisfaction ratios and ultimately
return burn on
investment and there are tools nowaday
that let you manage and track all these
areas in one conglomerated system yeah
HubSpot is for instance a tool that you
can use for that and they integrate all
your marketing and customer data and
campaigns in one system that um you can
use for
that all right so without further Ado
let's start with the first step stry
which is Select platform before diving
into the diverse landscape of social
media it's crucial to carefully consider
your business schools target audience
and the content strategy choosing the
right social media platforms can
significantly impact your Brand's online
presence and overall success Begin by

tutorials product demos and brand
storytelling so it is again one of the
most important tool all right now coming

video content and creative challenges so

audience so understanding your audience
involves grasping what you are trying to
connect with and tailoring your content
accordingly for instance if your target
audience is techy IND uals incorporate
content related to the latest gadgets

ensuring a more targeted and impactful
marketing strategy now let us move on to
our next one which is setting up social
media marketing objectives or goals in
the realm of social media marketing
setting clear goals defining objectives
and establishing measurable metrics are
crucial components of a strategic
approach let's delve into each aspect
the first first one that is coming into
my mind is goals goals are Broad and
overachieving statements that articulate
when you aim to achieve through your
social media efforts for example
increasing brand awareness online this
goal provides a general direction
indicating a desire to enhance the
visibility and recognition of your brand
within the online space it sets a tone
for your social media strategy but lacks
the specificity needed for direct
measurement now let us move on to the
next next one which is objectives
objectives are specific measurable and
time bound Milestone desire to achieve a
broader goal for example increase the
number of new fans on social media
platforms by 20% within the next quarter
or boast post engagement by 15% over the
next 6 months or achieve a 25% growth in
the web traffic from social media
channels in the next year these were the
certain examples which showcases what
are your objectives objectives break
down the broader goal into actionable
and measurable components they provide a
road map for achieving the overachieving
goal of increase brand awareness
offering clear targets and timelines the
next and the most important one is
metrics metrics are quantifiable
parameters used to measure the
performance and success of your social
media efforts for example the number of
new fans or followers what is the post
engagement rate or growth percentage in
the web traffic
metrics are specific data points that
help assess progress towards objectives
they provide tangible numerical evidence
of a social media performance for the
goal of increasing brand awareness the
choosen metrics should align with the
defined objectives such as tracking the
increase in followers engagement rates
and website traffic originating from
social platforms by aligning goals
objectives and metrics businesses create
a structured framework that not only
guides their social media activities but
also enables a systematic evaluation of
success or areas that may need
adjustment this disciplined approach
enhances the effectiveness of social
media marketing efforts and contributes
to the overall success of the digital
strategy now let us move on to our next
one which is very very important that is
conducting social media audit and
Analysis once you have established your
social media marketing destination
it's imperative to assess your current
position again to determine your
standing point before embarking on a
journey this evaluation process often is
concurrent with setting objectives is
analogous to recognizing that attempting
to reach the moon is futile if your
flying machine can even take off so what
are the areas where you can perform
audit and
Analysis so guys let us discuss each one
of them one by one the first one is

presence assess the strength weaknesses

strategies investigate social media

competitors identify potential gaps or
weaknesses in their approach so that you

essential aspect of this phase involves
keyword research a critical exercise to
discern what your customers are actively
searching for utilize tools like Google

going The Meta business weite used to be
known as the Facebook business manager

the meta business suite and the meta

your pages your teams how you can post
Etc so if you go on Facebook there are
two places there is the Facebook
business manager and there is the meta
business suite and that is a bit
confusing yeah so let's talk about the
difference between the two so the
Facebook business manager and The Meta
business suite are two different
applications and they serve different
purposes yeah though the Facebook
business manager is designed for
businesses that rely on Facebook for
their marketing and advertising efforts
while the meta business Suite is
designed for businesses that want to
manage their total online press
yeah the metab business manager is free
and it helps you manage your Facebook
page the advertising and all your assets
in one place once you have a Facebook P
business page it is essential to have
met a business manager as further
development of your Facebook and your

you to create and track your ad
campaigns that you are managing it helps
you access and control billing settings
and create custom audiences for your ads
and you have the the option to allocate
specific tasks across your team but it's
very much focused on um on Facebook and
the core functionality of managing your
Facebook page but the business um also
by the way the business manager gives
you the ability to manage your meta
pixels or your Facebook pixels that you
can use for retargeting so everything
you want to do with your Facebook page
you can do with within the Facebook
business manager but Facebook learned or
meta learned that people wanted more
people wanted to manage their Instagram
do their posting do their content
calendar so they needed more
functionality and that's where Facebook
came out with the meta business Suite
that is a centralized area to manage
your Facebook your Instagram your
messaging in one place so you can save
time to manage your business and to
manage your connections and develop
relationships with more people so cross
functionality is one of the business
suite's most appealing features so the
ability to view all your social
activities as a glance in One dashboard
manage multiple Facebook inboxes and
making your Community Management very
simple to do you can also create and
schedule posts and stories on both
Facebook and Instagram through the meta
business uh the business suite and it's
also a great tool for managing and
tracking your page insights and managing
tracking trends that can help you better
understand your
audiences so in summary meta business

Facebook and Instagram you it also gives
you detail about age and gender of your
followers it gives them where are they
coming
from yeah the top cities or the top
countries so so you can Benchmark this
data with
competitors yeah you can also look at
your content so the content is a very
important one this is probably in my
opinion one of the most important TS in
the uh meta insights section so this
dissects your posts and it shows you how
each of your post is
doing when it comes to number of people
reached number of people that have seen
the post number of people that have seen
the video you can watch uh split it by
post and by stories you can split it by
let's just do photo posts no photo post
mostly were were video posts yep and you
can specify the columns here as well so
I want to see the type of post
yeah so I can then apply and it gives
you lots of information here you see on
the videos how many minutes people
viewed the post how many Impressions
that you got the reach of the post and
the most important one is the engagement
on the post and that is this button is
the reactions likes comments and share
this is a critical column in your
Facebook in uh your Facebook insights
yeah if I order this from top
down yeah so here then I see those posts
with the highest engagement over the
last 28 days and this is where you can
learn what posts work and what posts do
not work and that is golden information
because if you know this post works then
why not make more of those posts so
people can um so you can get in similar
engagement level and overall it can help
you in driving your engagement
levels so very useful reports you can
see what posts are stealing the shows
what posts need a bit of
tweaking and it can help you in making
sure that you hit the right content with
the right the right people with the
right content so think about this tab
the content tab as checking what posts
work and what though posts don't work
and you can use that to optimize your
posts for um in the future so there's a
lot more in here you can get audience
information here as well and we'll talk
about that in a um in a later demo on
how to develop audiences in your
Facebook your your meta
insights right let's move on let's go to
the fourth and final demo of this video
which is about collaboration and Team
Management let's go back to the meta
business Suite in this demo will dive
into the world of collaboration and Team
Management within your meta business
Suite So Meta business Suite is not just
an act for you it's not a solo act it is
about getting your whole marketing team
on Facebook on the metab business Suite
yep and that can help you in kind of
supercharging your uh your management of
your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's break down how you can add team
members because teamwork is like the
secret source that can really make your
better meta business Suite come to life
so it is very useful to get your team
online so so it helps you keep people in
the loop you can assign specific
roles yeah so everybody knows what
they're doing what they're supposed to
be doing when they get on uh on the meta
business suite and very important even
if your page is across or if your team
is across multiple locations you can
still work as a team in managing your um
your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's go down to the basics the first of
this is building your team so what
you're going to do you're going to move
to the business settings and here you
see
people yeah already you here see an
overview of the people that
are available on this business
account that can use and there's
currently one that is me and I've done
another one which is me on another email
and the invite has been sent but I
haven't accepted it but let's go and
click an invite let's first look here on
the people button that is basically that
leads you to this scream if I click here
on invite people you can then go through
a number of
steps yeah so in this section you can
select
people once you've select those people
you can assign their access you can
assign business assets to those people
you can review the invitation and then
you can send it out so let's go through
this process so we're going to enter the
email again we're going to do just
myself
[Music]
uh yep and I can get temporary access or
for the advanced option I can remove but
I'm just doing it yes so this is
actually quite useful temporary access
for instance if you want like an agency
you want them to have a quick look at
your Facebook insights for instance you
can just give them temporary access for
the day and then you want to switch it
off yeah on uh that particular uh that
particular time frame we're not going to
do that I'm just going to click
next and then here you can specify the
access that you want to give to this
person
yeah so you can give the person partial
access or you can give the person full
control so partial access is the K they
can only work on the tasks and the
business assets assigned to them basic
access yeah which was formerly the
employee role is the default access that
everyone gets when they are added okay
so that is what you can set you can
integrate with um with apps and
different Integrations like the Facebook
pixel that people can view them and
manage them I'm not going to do this in
this case or you can give somebody full
control which is like an admin role yeah
so that would be the business admin role
and they can manage everything including
settings people tools business asset
they can delete a business account yeah
so does not include the advanced options
so you need to be careful with this but
once you give somebody full
control yep then um they are basically
an admin for that so click shared then
there you can also look at the financial
information like transactions invoices
account spent and payment method so that
could be for your finance manager for
instance so I am just going to be full
control yeah so I'm happy with that no
no let's not do this I am actually none
I'm just going to be a basic control and
I click next I can then assign business
assets so there is the Facebook page
there is the ad account I can assign
products I can assign the Instagram
account the Commerce account I can
assign pixels data sets so lots of stuff
that I can uh assign here okay so the
Facebook page and the Instagram account
that's what I want this person to be
assigned I can then review business
assets not assigned sign business assets
I then here need probably need to
specify can manage the content yeah so
insights add oh select the business
asset so the real for Russia page yep I
can then assign content Community
activity ads insights and leads okay
that's all I want to get and then I'll
click next and then I'm going to send an
invitation to Mark markm man.com and as
soon as I accept the
invitation I will then show up on this
list as we saw here yeah and accept it
and I am then part of the team that
manages the um that manage the Facebook
or The Meta business suite for this
particular page right so that's a wrap

in today's video we're going to look at
another topic and that is the topic of
how to use the meta business Suite to
create and plan your posts and your
stories so in the demo we're going to
cover the following topics we're going
to look at how do you create a post on
Facebook and on
Instagram how do you plan your content
and how do you use the content
calendar what are the
notifications uh that you need to work
on and that you can set up and where do
you set them up in the meta business
Suite we'll look at the inbox the
messages and comments and how you can
automate responses and then finally
we'll dig a bit deeper into the stories
how can you create stories used
The Meta business
Suite there are many social media
posting and planning tools like hoot
suets like Soho social buffer Sprout
social they all work really well and
they allow you to schedule and manage
posts on your social media channels on
Facebook on X on Instagram and many
other platforms however there are
various reasons why you want to choose
to met business suite for your posting
over other
platforms first of all meta business
Suite is developed by meta ensuring a
seamless integration with Facebook and
Instagram and making sure that you can
leverage all the functionality in
Facebook and Instagram within your
posting in uh The Meta business Suite
also content published through the meta
business Suite May have a slight
advantage in the algorithmic reach on
Facebook and Instagram basically
Facebook will reward you for using meta
business s to post your content by
giving you a wider reach for your post
it ALS also gives you access to new
features and updates within Facebook
yeah and Instagram faster than other
tools like hoot
site they offer better security measures
and compliance with platform policies
within the meta business suite and
direct access to support is available
within the meta business Suite as well
so that will expedite your issues
resolution so Facebook the publishing
facilities within the meta business
manager they are designed specifically
for Facebook and Instagram so that makes
it much
friendlier easier for you to use than
some of the other
platforms good so let's delve into the
posting and Publishing on Facebook and
Instagram let me go to the real life
dashboard so here you see the
dashboard and let me first show you how
to um create a post there are various
roots
that you can use to create a post there
is here the create Post Yeah you can
also go through the planner you can go
through the content so there are various
ways that you can get into but let me
show you the create post uh the simple
approach I'm clicking here create post
and I'm then getting to the basic screen
for creating a post yep so here you see
all the elements that you need to do yep
so first of all you're going to specify
the platform that you want to post and
I've selected here Facebook and
Instagram I can then add the photo I can
use a template and here I can use
specific text then here I see the
scheduling options I can set my privacy
settings and here you see the preview
either in the Facebook feed or in the
Instagram feed so I'm going to add a
photo I can actually upload from the
desktop or add from the file manager
we'll look into the file manager in a
bit but I'm clicking upload from desktop
and then here I can go to let's say for
Russia picking this photo the photo is
now being uploaded and here I see what
the post is going to look like then here
I can add a text and I can say
winter
promotion yeah in RI for Russia I see
here how the text is being added yes so
I can completely see how the post is
being set up I can add all the stuff
that I can add on Facebook as well yep I
see the Facebook feed preview I can go
for the Instagram feed
preview I can look at the desktop and
the mobile
version so it's a fully
featured um posting platform within the
meta business pie yeah so now a few um
things of course before finalizing the
post take advantage of this preview
feature in the business Suite yeah so
make sure that your visuals and your
caption displays as intended and that
there are no formatting issues so making
sure that the post looks exactly like
you want it to look and then when you're
happy with the post you click either
publish or you can say finish
later
so I can also schedule the post yes so
I'm clicking here publish and then the
post will be published this may take a
moment or you can set here your
scheduling
options yeah so you see now that the
post is
published so but I actually I'm going to
delete it in a minute because I don't
want this post to go live yeah so if I
can want to create that post I can also
say the scheduling options and I can set
a date and a time for my post okay so
that gives it to you in a
nutshell and what we're going to do now
is let's look at this F F manager in a
bit more detail the file manager is a
tool that meta business Suite um has put
together to allow you to add and
organize your assets for your business
account yep assets like your photos like
your ads like videos Etc so with file
manager you can collaborate on files and
folders you can assign access to
creative assets and you can plan your
content
more efficiently so you can manage your
image and video files for use in your
posts or your stories or your videos you
can upload multiple assets at the same
time for later use you can create albums
to organize and access your creative
assets and you can share your assets
with other people in your team so how do
you access the um file manager you can
go here to all tools
and then within the all tools you see
here file manager so click on that and
that takes you to your file manager
where you can create folders and where
you can add sort of creatives in your
folder so if I go to this folder and I
can uh check the folder and here you see
one of the um the assets that I've added
into this file manager clicking here I
can straightly bring it into my creative
posts yep so I can use it to create a
story or I can delete it I can look at
my folder setting yeah here you can see
which people have access to the folders
I can assign Partners to the folders I
can edit these folder the permissions so
very useful tool and particularly if you
have lots of assets for your products
then this can be a very helpful tool in
managing those
assets so that that takes me then a step
deeper to the content Tab In The Meta
business Suite as well yeah that is
where you can find all your published
and drafts and scheduled posts including
your reals your video posts your stories
your photos and your live videos you can
see what is published what is scheduled
what is drawn
what is expiring what is
expired yeah you can add your reals you
can even export the data and still still
access to your create post or your
create
real here you can see the date published
of the post you can see the status of
the post if it has been boosted or not
yeah if it what's the distribution for
the Post how many you see then some some
statistics on the posts as well and
we'll dive deeper into the insights
later in the third video but here you
can already see The Impressions the
reach the players and very important the
reactions the engagement that you had on
the different posts so very useful tool
yes so you can within this tool you can
manage your post you can create post as
well and there's also access here to
your ab tests if you want to test posts
on their uh their effectiveness you can
also within the content and I like that
you can see your feed and your grit yeah
so here you see your Facebook feed this
one is that I've just published although
I've deleted it as well but um yeah and
here you see your Instagram feed you can
see your mentions and your tags so it's
almost like managing your feed as well
well and here you see your collections
within your file manager like Facebook
photos playlists and series that you've
can create
it very useful tool that um you can use
to manage your content together with the
file
manager right so that concludes the
posting element yeah let's now go into
the next level of managing your post and
that is through the planner the planner
can be accessed by clicking the planner
button here on the menu in the metab
business Suite dashboard so if I click
on the Planner yeah you can access your
kind of your content dashboard and
within this dashboard you can have a
total overview of what you have posted
and what you're going to post
and you can see some basic information
about your different posts as well yeah
and it's a very useful visual tool to
plan your content and to plan ahead of
your content so you click on the planner
tab as I mentioned yeah it also features
this calendar that helps you plan
schedule and visualize what count
content you want to share and when you
want to share it you you can also use
this calendar to coordinate your content
with holidays and special events what is
going on and you can also use it to
manage your creative access your
creative
assets yep so here you see the goals
that you can specify you can add goals
yeah so here for instance I want to
increase reach you can specify that for
a specific period and then here you see
how you fair
against reaching the objective of the
goal that you've set there's also the
moments now unfortunately moments does
not work in most of the markets
currently it's only working in the US so
here you will see what sort of events
are coming up like holidays National
events or you can specify your own
events and that's always good with your
posting of your content
because you can then relate your content
to the events that are relevant in your
market so you can look at your content
type yeah so you can have all your
content showing in your calendar or you
can look at your stories your reals or
your ads and here you can specify set it
by week or by
month and it gives you as I said earlier
a fantastic overview of what you have
done and what you're going to do it also
and that's what I really like about it
gives you a um gives you kind of a a
library of the posts that you have done
in the
past so the content calendar yeah is
very important it's also called an
editorial col calendar it's used by the
marketing team to plan and schedule your
content across your Facebook and your
Instagram so it serves as a road map for
your social media marketing strategy and
it makes sure that you will be
consistent and
cohesive with your posting yeah and it's
a very important tool that marketing
teams are using some key elements of
your calendar yeah it outlines the type
of content you plan to share that's
number one yeah it helps you scheduling
it includes the specific dates and times
for when your posts will be or for when
your content will be
published yeah so you can schedule it
forward as well what are the posts that
you are planning in the coming
months good content calendars have an
integration of your different social
media
channels yep so that is very useful
because then you can select and show the
post for each sort of um channel that
you're using the calendar often include
themes or topics for postings yeah so
you have a diverse range of content that
you're scheduling there's also alignment
with your campaigns in your content
calendar so it aligns with your broader
marketing campaigns or events so your
social media efforts they're really cont
contributing to it to sort of achieving
your marketing objectives good content
calendars they have collaboration
features so multiple team members can
contribute or review so you can
coordinate your efforts across your
posting and by pling planning and
scheduling your content in advance yeah
it's just a matter of efficiency it
helps streamline your content creation
and your posting process and finally a
good content calendar helps with the
communication within your marketing team
so everybody is aware of what is being
scheduled what posts are coming and they
can plan their tasks
accordingly now that we looked at the
publishing and planning side of your
content and your posts let's look at the
notifications
very important part of your Facebook and
Instagram presence unfortunately metab
business Suite allows you to receive
notifications related to your Facebook
and your Instagram business accounts
whether you get those on messaging or
whether you get them on your email so
what are notifications they are kind of
alerts or messages that inform
people yeah and it's mainly you of
course and your marketing team that are
working on the meta business Suite as
well about specific activities updates
or
interactions with the meta business weed
platform so what are the features of the
notifications in the meta business Suite
so here we go into the notifications
button that we can access through the
meta business Suite menu so click on
notifications
yeah so first of all you can customize
your
notifications yeah so you can customize
the notification preferences based on
your settings and your priorities you
can receive real time updates on
relevant activities so that keeps you in
the loop and you can explore the
advanced notification settings and in
the advanced notification settings you
can tailor your notifications based on
specific activities so you're getting
prompt sort of um messages about events
that are critical to your
business so here's the overview yeah so
here there's no new
notifications here are the other
notifications that are coming in these
are notifications from within your um
within your Facebook or your Instagram
here you can filter your
notifications yeah so you can have uh
set for Action needed message reminders
comments
recommendations notifications only for
Facebook or Instagram or your business
account here you can set Market read and
here you have the settings of your
notification and here you can
specify what notifications you want to
have and most notifications that will go
within your team your marketing team
will go through
email yeah so you can set notifications
for Facebook for um yeah for your page
for messages for comments for
announcements for
suggestions other Communications like
tags like shares and here are you can
set your business email notifications
for business permissions roles ad
accounts pixels and more yeah so that
goes um quite
deep so let me dig a bit deeper in the
type of notifications you can get via
your email that could be activity alerts
yeah so they include alerts about
activities on your business Pages like
new likes comments or shares there can
be page insights so users may receive
notifications about insights and
analytics related to the performance of
the business page there could be alerts
on messenger
interactions yeah so if you use the
messenger for customer communication you
may receive notifications about new uh
customer
messages could be um alerts or
notifications around ad campaign
updates so information about your ad
performance the budget charges or budget
changes or other AD campaign related
events there could be page management
alerts yeah important actions or changes
related to the management of your
business page there could be platform
announcements from
meta yeah they may use the notifications
to in uh communicate important platform
announcements updates or
changes there could be notifications
related to security and finally
notifications around events and
reminders so very useful tool to use
important to make sure that you set the
right
preferences and make sure that you check
it regularly yeah what the notifications
are that you are getting
in besides the
notifications another important area is
your in
inbox and within your inbox you have
your messages you have your comments and
your automated
responses so you can access that by
clicking on the inbox in your
menu yeah and metab business we offer
several features related to this
communication and engagement within your
inbox they enable your your business to
effectively manage your communication
and your engagement on Facebook and on
Instagram so a centralized inbox is very
handy that you can have that because it
streamlines your responses and it makes
sure you and you sort of you respond
timely and
consistently with your
audience so if you look at the menu your
centralized Hub as it were this is where
you can manage your entire entire inbox
you can look at just the messages
messenger Instagram yeah on WhatsApp
Facebook comments Instagram
comments yep so here you see all the
messages whether it's unread if it needs
followup you can label it here is the
filters that you can specify here you
see the people that communicate with you
then here you see the community or the
sort of the communication that is being
done so really useful if I go here to
myself yeah what you see for the users
as well that have enabled that you can
see their profile details as well and
you can set a label could be like a new
customer or a prospect you can add
labels yeah so that can be like a mini
sort of CRM system to manage the
communication with your prospects for
instance
yes so that is the um the
inbox
so and that is sort of the um the the
dashboard that you have for your inbook
box so again we'll look at your
messenger yeah so that's all the private
messages that you receiv received within
your Facebook and Instagram business
account the
comments yeah they focus on comments
that you get with within your Facebook
or your Instagram business page so this
is where you can efficiently Monitor and
respond to comments so that can really
help you with developing your engagement
with your
audience so what I really like about the
inbox is that you can also set up
automations so you can set up automated
responses to messages messages that you
received within your um within your
inbox so they can be customized and
triggered based on specific keywords
based on Greetings or specific questions
that you get and they are very useful to
provide instant replies and managing
manage your customer inquiries
efficiently so they can be
configured yeah to acknowledge a reedt
of a message or provide basic
information or guide users to relevant
sources Sant relevant resources so let's
have a look if I click on the
automations yeah then here you see there
is basically a um a library of
automations that you can set
up and some here you can see the ones
that you have already set up and that
you have activated so for instance I
have already activated an instant reply
or or I've activated identify unanswered
messages yeah my away message is not on
or I can create an Automation and then
here you see the library of kind of
templates that you can choose from you
can greet people yeah share information
organize messages send a confirmation or
followup yes
so you start with templates so it is not
a huge library of templates that you
have but at least it allows you to to
use to look at specific um sort of
common sort of scenarios that you can
can face and you can set sort of
alterations for
those right let's go back and let's go
to the final demo in this video and that
is take a bit of a deeper look into
creating
stories So Stories offer a very Dynamic
and engaging format for content sharing
yeah because of their temporary nature
and their interactive features and Prime
placement don't forget that yeah it
makes them a very valuable tool for
businesses that want to enhance the
Young engagement on their social media
presence and connect with their
audiences and make the content more
authentic and
immediate stories also help increasing
the visibilities because they appear at
the top of a users feeds so that
provides Prime real estate for
visibility and it makes it more likely
that users will see your content and
engage with your
content yes so and there are lots of
Engagement opportunities as stories are
designed to be interactive with features
like polls questions quizzes swipe up um
links yeah and it connects with your
audience in a much more engaging
way
so let's have a look at the stories how
you create
them yeah so here we say create
story yeah what I like about stories is
that they
provide the opportunity to share kind of
raw unfiltered content to your users so
you can give your your followers a
behind the scenes look at your business
or the personal life and makes your
posts a lot of a lot more
authentic yeah so you can build stronger
relations with your uh with your
audience there's also a thing like fomo
as we call it it's the fear of missing
out because of the temporary nature of
stories they typically last for 24 hours
it creates a sent of
urgencies yeah so you encourage users to
check your stories regularly because
they feel I don't want to miss anything
that you are um that you are posting in
your
stories it's kind of known that people
for instance on Instagram will spend
more time in the stories and in the news
feeds yep and businesses use that they
businesses know that stories yeah their
algorithm they often prioritize stories
making them more likely to appear on the
users uh feeds so and another big
feature of stories by the way is the
highlights feature particularly on
Instagram so you can create story
highlights which are collections of past
stories that you can feature on your
profile permanently so that is a
fantastic way to Showcase important
information or key aspects of your brand
I always say it's like the menu of your
website yeah you can actually have that
in the highlights on your
Instagram so and finally the power of
stories is also that they offer
advertising opportunities both in
Facebook and in Instagram so businesses
can use that to reach a broader audience
and promote products or
Services of course it's not as user
friendly as on on the mobile but at
least you have some functionality on the
um that you can have on the mobile as
well so add photo video we're going to
go into the same photo here
open yep so here you see the photo and
here you see how the story is being
uploaded yep so you can then add your
text as well so you can click
edit yep so here you can see I can crop
I can text or I can add stickers so
let's add text so the text will be I'm
I'm going to put it here yeah
so uh
winter
promotion yeah put that
here and then we have text is blue or
text is red let's make it yellow
here we go font I can
choose yep and then I can say let's
stick with that and here I can say I'm
going to add a sticker as well yes so
you have a whole library of stickers it
is again not as advanced as you have on
the mobile but at least you can do a bit
on the yeah so then I can click apply I
can add my multiple um media of
course I can schedule it I can share it
straight away or I can schedule it and I
can set my privacy settings as well so
really good functionality within the
meta business Suite so create the
stories here or create them on Facebook
or Instagram itself on the mobile but at
least you have some functionality on
that here as well to Leverage The Power
of the stories there are two additional
items in the old tools that you need to
be aware of that can help you with your
content creation and your content
planning if I click here on all
tools then in the menu you will see here
sound
collection sound collection is a
fantastic tool to enhance your video and
audio content which with free music or
sound effects that you can use in your
posts and it's a hidden sort of Secret
In The Meta business Suite but it gives
you a great collection of hundreds of
sound files that you can add to your
videos or your um your photos or your
your stories and there you can sort by
genre by Mood by duration by vocals by
tempos you can add it to favorites there
is as you you can see here over 10,
13,28 to soundtracks in there that you
can can use and they're all free of
charge so there's tracks there's sound
effects and it is very handy little tool
that you have in the meta business
manager so the other one that I want you
to be aware of if I go back home and
back into the old tools is the
collaboration Center so here in the
manage you see your collaboration Center
and that is where you can sort of
structure your Partnerships with Brands
and with
influencers so you can sort of assign uh
Brands and partners that you want to
collaborate with on your posts and with
the whole growth in the influencer
marketing uh area this is a very useful
part that you can um can can set up to
manage those relationships we're going

thereby it ensures that everybody is
aligned contributing collectively to

suite of tool with lots of valuable
insights like audience management
audience engagement metrics like ad
performance yeah and it is a One-Stop
shop to manage everything you need to do
uh in managing your Facebook and your
Instagram now we've been through various
um areas of it like we looked at the
dashboard we looked at the um posting
scheduling managing your content we
found a treasure of tools and
functionalities and in today's session
we're going to look at three specific
areas we're going to dive into the
Commerce manager and we're going to be
talking about some very important
changes that meta has announced in 2023
about managing your shop we're going to
look at Facebook and Instagram ads I'm
going to show you the process of
creating an ad and how to manage your
your audiences and then we're going to
conclude the video
with demo about the Facebook and meta
insights that you can
get right let's kick off demo one the
Commerce
manager now it's important to understand
that meta has made some very important
announcements in managing your Facebook
shop in response to the current economic
downturn meta is investing heavily in Ai
and automation tool to boost campaign
performance through shop advertising and
The Meta Advantage Suite of ads and
we'll come back to that in a little bit
yeah what that uh that means but it
means that shops
are scaling down in
functionality but promoting your
products through advertising is kind of
scaling up in um in Facebook and
Instagram so the shop ads are going to
be Consolidated Under The Meta
advantage and they facilitate easier
shop setup with inapp
checkout yeah so particularly for the
markets where you already have checkout
functionality within the Facebook app
yeah this is a very important
announcement that although the shop is
going to sort of deep be defocused the
advertising of your products is going to
get more center stage and thereby you
can promote more of your products to
your target
audiences Now new shop tools that are
coming out like ratings reviews they're
being tested and support for shops
without checkout and that's very
important to understand understand if
you haven't got a checkout functionality
in your shop yeah and that will be in
most of the countries except in the US
and I believe in India they support for
the shops will be
discontinued with a focus on helping the
US businesses in adding the checkout to
their existing shops basically what meta
is doing is to optimize the whole
shopping experience in the US market and
then rolling that out across other
markets which means that some of the
shop functionality and opening up a new
shop in Facebook in other markets like
Europe and like Asia is going to be
limited so this strategic change aims to
optimize the shopping experiences
support businesses and learn from the
experiences in the US before a global
roll out so remember as I said
discontinued support for shops without
checkouts in various markets like Europe
and Asia and um for those markets you
can start focusing and focus increase
your focus on personalized ads reels and
messaging and in the US the emphasis is
on aiding businesses in imp implementing
the checkout with support for shops
linking to a website it until sort of
first quarter of 2024 so now this is
clear let's start with looking at the
metac Commerce manager yeah the Commerce
manager is the essential core of your
online store and it simplifies all your
store tasks with a userfriendly
interface so it enables you to manage
your products to process your orders and
deliver excellent customer service to
your customers who buy your products Now
by centralizing all e-commerce
activities meta business Commerce
manager helps you to focus on selling
your product through Facebook and
Instagram and that is of course a
fantastic opportunity that you have to
add an additional sales channel to your
um your current sales
operation so let's get into the
demo so here we see the meta business
Suite port
and to get into the Commerce manager we
go to um down here we look at all the
tools and then we see here down here the
Commerce button we click on there and
this takes you to the Commerce manager
interface and here is your
dashboard yeah so here you see the
overview but it gives you access to
activities like adding products to your
catalogue like customizing your shop or
publishing your shop it gives you shop
insights it gives you things to do on
your catalog your shops offers that you
have it gives you your top products so
it gives you some basic insights it
gives you your top taged content and the
maybe some questions you have that you
can get answers from through the
FAQ so here you see the
important elements of managing your shop
there is your catalog that's where you
start of course yeah there is the
different shops you may have and you can
manage your shops here you can run
promotions you can promote your product
through ads you can get insights you may
have a to-do list with things to
optimize your shop and here you go to
the
settings yeah of course always important
to start with the settings and you can
have a look at the details of your shop
there's the general settings of your
shop yeah like your account info like
your email there is your localization of
your shop but you can specify the
currency the language the product
details the shipping inform information
you have the settings for your catalog
for your business assets for your
checkout mid method permissions very
important you can assign permissions to
different users colleagues in your
organization or your agency yeah what
they can do within the Commerce manager
and then there is your customer support
where you can uh manage your claims your
um back email address details shop
contact information and what have you
right so that's important to understand
all the different items that you can go
through within your cont your Commerce
manager so let's go and have a let's add
a product yeah so first you're going to
do here to your back to your home to
your overview yeah and there are various
ways that you can start adding products
to your catalog yes so you can here add
products to your catalog directly
here yep and then there is the catalog
menu here where you can set items have
product sets the data sources where are
your products coming from yeah and then
there's the um the events as well that
you can
specify okay so let's go quickly here at
one item is very important that is the
data sources basically where are your
products coming
from yeah now here you get from your
current product catalog you see here
what the status is of your catalog yeah
and particularly when products come in
from a to um a Commerce site like
Shopify there may be issues with various
products that you need to have a look at
but here we can click on add an item or
add an item here yes so I'm just going
to click here in general add an item and
here you see the different ways that you
can add a product it can be done through
a data feed it can be done manually or
it can be done through a pixel
yeah that you can bring it in through a
pixel from another
website so look at the
manual yeah so if I'm just going to
click here on manual then here you see
the
manual let's have a look here you see
the
manual process for adding a
product yep so you can just click a new
item well here is an item you can add an
image for your item you can add a title
the description a website link the price
for your product you can add a sales
price a Facebook product category
condition of the product availability
the status yeah so lots of stuff that
you can add here for your product and
once you've done that yeah you then just
click upload
items so back in your dashboard you can
then click here on manage your catalog
and this is where you can see all the
products in your catalog and the status
and what the stock availability and the
price and of course if you have hundreds
of products you may want to set some
filters yeah check on attributes for
your
products yep so that is how you can add
products to your catalog and how you can
manage your catalog as well so another
way to upload your items is through a
data feed and that's a very important
one yeah so you can actually just enter
a Google Sheets yep and you can download
in a template of the format for the uh
the Google Sheets that you want to
upload with your product information but
you can also enter a URL from a server
or a hosting website and this URL is
very important when you want to work
with external e-commerce stores like for
instance Shopify the process there is
that you would um download kind of a a
Facebook app within your Shopify account
and that sets the connection with uh
between Shopify and the Facebook uh
Commerce the Facebook shop or there may
be other e-commerce platforms where they
will actually give you a
URL and that's where you can add that
URL and that sets a link and the good
thing often about these Sol uh these
these Solutions is that there will be a
live link between your e-commerce
platform and your Facebook shop that
means when there is changes in your
product catalog in your Ecommerce
platform it will automatically be
uploaded in your Facebook Commerce data
source or your Facebook Commerce catalog
right back to the overview so let's look
at how you can edit your shop now
remember the recent store changes yeah
so in most markets you can no longer
create a new shop but you can edit an
existing
shop and in some markets where there is
the inapp checkout functionality like in
the US you will still be able to create
new shops and manage your shops so let's
click here on shops and here you see the
shop that I have yep and it's um here I
can see the live
shop so here you see how the Sho the
shop looks like yep so um I can look at
the products
and I can look at the categories I can
search within the shop here you see a
version
history yep or I can close this and I
can here I can edit my shop I can edit
the layout of the shop and I can edit
the settings of the
shop so here you see the homepage I can
look at collections I can optimize the
layout I can add banners for offers
I can add a carousel of um of products
or collections to the Carousel and here
I can have suggestions for you yeah or a
dynamic product and it serves the
product that is relevant for the
customer yep but remember this is going
to scale down in the future yeah you
will no longer be able to see a shop and
actually on most sort of face Facebook
pages you already see that many Facebook
pages have already removed the shop
because of the limited functionalities
that you have these
days okay so that is the shop that you
can um edit in the layout and here in
the settings you can edit the visibility
the inventory the website content the
categories
yep and um again lots of stuff that you
can uh can manage
here the final thing we want to do in
the Facebook Commerce is to see how we
can do a promotion yep and if we go back
to the Commerce manager and the um the
dashboard of the Commerce manager we can
click here on
promotions and here you see offers
and this is where we can create offers
and we can see an overview of our active
offers our scheduled offers and offers
that expired so let's have a look at the
create
offer functionality click on this and
here you can see your offer category so
I can have an amount of I can do a sale
I can do a free shipping I can do a buy
product X and get product y here here's
the name of your offer and here you can
see the different if you want to use a
promo code if you don't want to use a
promo code then you take this or you can
get a CO a code that people have to
enter and here you see the summary of
the offer so we're going to give the
name of the offer is uh spring
promotion yep no other changes it's an
automatic yes so no other details up
here to enter here we do the type or we
do doing a percentage of or a flat
amount so let's say we're doing a
20% discount uh here you can select your
products we can say apply to the entire
shop or select some specific products
I'm going to do it for the entire shop
and then I can do include products that
already have a sales price or I canot
include them the offer applies only once
per item or I can say let's do it per
order here see what the offer would look
like yep and here you can set the start
date and the end date of your offer if
I'm happy with all these settings I can
then click here create offer and then
the offer will be live on my
shop okay here is the summer uh sorry
here's the um the summary so the offer
has being created it gives you some some
tips so you can feature the offer in the
shop
there's to offer
details yeah the discount ID the
visibility the start date we haven't
specified an end date yeah for all the
customers we can look at the customers
the product and then we see it's for all
products and then if we're happy with
this we'll just click cancel yeah so
that concludes the um the the promotion
and you see how simple it is to add a
promotion so now let's look at the last
section I want to cover in the Commerce
manager and that is the advertising that
you can schedule in the Commerce manager
now let's talk about Advantage Plus you
may have heard me talking about that
earlier in this video where it talks
about the um uh the changes that
Facebook announced in 2023 in the
Commerce manager so what are Advantage
Plus catalog ads they have been launched
on August the 15th in 2023 for
e-commerce and real retail advertisers
really helping them enhance the ad
efficiency so the Advantage Plus ads
they use Ai and machine learning where
they automatically sort of create up to
150 creative combinations of the ads so
it eliminates manual steps in the ad
creation allowing advertisers to learn
much more efficiently how which ads work
and which ads don't work and how to
maximize their budget efficiently so the
roll out of Advantage Plus provides
advertisers with new and innovative ways
to optimize campaigns and thereby you
can get fantastic new insights that can
help in developing your advertising
strategies small businesses will also be
able to use Advantage Plus create ative
and Advantage Plus audience to create
ads through their Facebook page so it's
not just through the Commerce manager
but small businesses can take advantage
of it as well so it's about creating a
personalized audience based on your page
detail and automatically adjust over
time to help you reach more and relevant
customers for your um for your ads so
here you can see
the what you can do so if you want to
get started with Advantage catalog ads
so you can add your product you can
setup tracking through a pixel and then
you can create your ad and if I click on
create ad you want to know which ad
account you would like to advertise with
and then you select the in this case the
riat for Russia and then that takes you
to your advertising setup and this
basically is a um a sub set of the uh
the Facebook or The Meta advertising
platform that we will go through in a
minute once we've concluded the Commerce
manager section yep so that's um what I
want to say about the ads and then
finally let's look at the insights so
here in the insights you can get date
details knowledge information about your
catalog your performance your audiences
your tagged content you can get in
details about awareness and there is the
helicopter overview of your shop
performance as well well we had very
little activity in our shop because yeah
we have a very basically no real shop in
this Facebook account but here again you
will get all the details about your shop
if you have a full operating shop within
the Commerce
manager right that concludes the
Commerce manager so now let's look at
the advertising on Instagram and
Facebook that you can manage through the
meta business suite and we'll go there
by various ways you can go into the
advertising yeah so Facebook and or meta
is very keen to get you to advertise and
so you see in your feeds you see posts
that you can boost um here on the um the
the basic menu you go into advertising
here if you click on the all tools you
can go to ads and these are all
subsections of what you can do in the
advertising if you really want to go to
the full advertising platform of meta
you click here on ads
manager this is the dashboard of your
um account in The Meta business Suite
when it comes to advertising you can see
if there are problems with your
advertising account there is the payment
method that you can set you can even
create a Facebook page from here you can
verify your email address and um here
you have access to the ads manager menu
as well and this is where you can have
an overview of your campaigns there is
your ads reporting very important
section is the audiences that you can
create within your ads manager and
Target various audiences with your ads
there is in uh billing and payments and
your ad account setting and here is an
overview to all the tools in the ad
manager yeah business settings SC um the
integration with the Commerce Center and
lots of other stuff when it comes to
your uh your ads in Facebook and
Instagram so let's go to the
campaigns yeah what we want to do is to
show you the powerful features in this
demo of the ads manager when it comes to
creating an ad in Facebook and in
Instagram yeah in this video to take you
through the entire ads manager that
would be um too long we'll do a separate
video on that but here I just want to
give you you a quick highlight on how
easy it is to create a new campaign so
here you see the current campaigns that
I have yep so now I'm not running any
campaigns they're all in draft mode but
here you see the typical structure for a
payperclick advertising campaign you
have campaigns under campaigns you have
ad sets and under ad sets you have ads
and the ads they inherit the settings of
the adsets and the adsets inherit the
settings of the campaign so in the
campaigns you would set your budget in
the adsets you would set your targeting
and here are the specific ads so it's
all related to each other but it's a
multi-dimensional approach in updating
and managing your advertising campaigns
in um in meta so let's create a new
campaign and then you'll see how it
develops s so we want first to look at
the campaign objective yeah so based on
what the objective is for your campaign
meta will come back to you with the
ideal settings for that particular
objective so it could be lead generation
it could be engagement it could be
driving traffic like sending people to a
destination like your website or an app
or your Instagram profile great for
getting link clicks landing page views
Etc so let's click on traffic and here
I'm going to continue so now it's going
to ask me a number of
questions yes so and I just have to go
through those questions when it comes
for the campaign when it comes to the ad
set and when it comes to the ad yeah so
we have the campaign name we have the
special ad categories if you want to do
yeah so there are special categories
that Facebook or meta wants to know
about whether it's related to credit
employment social issues elections yeah
because there may be different
requirements this was sort of set up
after the um I think it were the 2018
elections in the US and the brexit um El
sort of um uh poll uh on on how
advertising was kind of abused to reach
audiences with kind of false information
so now when you do advertise for social
issues and elections or politics then
there are very specific
requirements yeah but we say they're not
applicable here we go to the campaign
details yeah I can edit this the buying
type is an auction so the highest bidder
with the best quality ad will get the
best position for the ad you can do you
can change this as well uh you can do by
auction or by reservation but that is
where you will have to pay more yep and
then here's the campaign objective that
we've set at the beginning of the
process which is objective of traffic
yeah you can then set do you want to do
testing for your
ad yep and you will let Facebook create
different versions of your ads and then
it will run the different versions and
it will look at what ad will give the
best performance and do you want to make
it an advanced campaign budget yeah so
it will distribute your budget across
current currently delivering ad sets to
get more results yeah but I'm going to
leave that off and I'm going to click to
next so that's my campaign settings
we're then going to the ad set and in
the ad set you're going to look at your
conversion location would that be your
website or a landing page an app on
messenger or your Instagram profile so
let's send traffic to my
website yep and then here you see your
estimated daily results how many people
you will reach and how many link clicks
I'm going to set the performance goal I
want to maximize the number of
clicks yeah what would I want to do yeah
to spend what do I want to spend
basically I can say I'm going to spend
let's say um
one dollar or one pound in this case per
result call I can have more options here
I can say different bit strategies that
I can have yeah I can say what is the
maximum spend or what is the cost per
result call what am I prepared to spend
per kind of um click as it were yeah I'm
going to leave at that and here you have
Dynamic
creative yeah I can also leave this
blank by the way because I have my
budget setting further down below so
Dynamic creative I would just provide
creative elements such as images and
headlines and then meta will
automatically generate the perfect ads
for you a very interesting um process um
I'm going to leave it off for now
because I want going to show you how an
ad may look like and how you can develop
that so my daily budget I'm setting it
at20 a day yeah here's the start date
and I can set an end date yeah so I'm
going to set the star date a bit further
yeah because I don't want it to start
and send a t date don't need to send an
end date yep and here is the budg and
scheduling you can now schedule budget
and greases on certain days I'm not
going to do that at the start of the
campaign because I want Facebook or meta
in this case decide what works best for
me yep so and then ad scheduling I can
specify but again I'm going to run all
the ads at the same time and then here
you have your audience controls so this
is set criteria for where ADS can be
delivered so this is we have sort of
location we have age we can look at
existing custom audiences that we have
created over time I can look at audience
suggestions yep so um so that is part of
the Advantage Plus audience that I
created that I discussed with you
earlier yep and here you have your
placements and there is let meta decide
for you where your ad is going to be
shown or you can decide for manual
placement yep and then is the more
placement you select the better it is
yeah but let the Advance Plus yeah show
more options here there's brand safety
and suitability pro for instance prevent
your ads from appearing near content
that's not conducive to your brand for
instance if you are a holiday
destination and you advertise on
Facebook you don't want to be shown um
next to an article or a a post about um
about an airline disaster yes so we're
going to hide these options manual
placements so also want you to be aware
where you can select which platforms do
you want to advertise on Facebook
Facebook's Audience Network on Instagram
or on messenger shop is no longer
available we talked about that yep and
here you go then in your ads so this is
the placement of the ads where do you
want to show your ads in the feeds in
the stories in stream ads the search
results in messages but again we'll let
Facebook or meta decide on all of this
okay so I'm going back to Advantage Plus
placement where you use Facebook's
artificial intelligence and machine
learning to give you the best placements
based on meta's understanding of your um
your audience so click next yep and then
is um we're going to go to the ad yeah
so Facebook suggest make a carousel ad
yeah so here we go into the um the ad
creation so the Facebook page that we're
going to base this on is let me have a
look R for
Russia yeah we're going to manually
upload creatives or we can get it from
the cat catalog yeah and here you see
your preview these are the products for
my catalog yeah so I'm just going to
leave it for this product for now yes so
you're going to look at the format I
wanted a
carousel now I have two products in my
Carousel so they should probably come up
now yeah so um so here is the second
product no so but that's how it would
look like or you can do a collection you
can do multi- Advertiser ads so and I
can um have the catalog for the ad
creative as I said could be a product
set I have multiple products I can make
Carousel cards as well yeah I can turn
it in a slides show lots and lots of
opportunities and here you have your
headline and your description yeah so
the headline is carpet I can take that
out I can say
um spring
promotion sort of Atlas
Mountains
carpet yeah so that should now be added
here under the um the ad and here you
see shop now button I can add to this
description that will show up at the uh
the top describe your link which would
be
fantastic handmade
carpets from the
bers in the Atlas
Mountains let's
see yeah on bigger ads you see that that
would show up here at the um the front
so yep and then you are um basically
having your primary text let me have a
look I think that is actually the text
that I wanted up
here let me have a look at
that there it is yeah so that is the
text that I wanted there and here the
call to action that would be shop now
but I have a whole range of call to
action
yeah so keep that as shop now then where
do I drive people to I drive them to my
shop and that is the website do I want
to build a URL par parameter so I can
track my campaign in the uh in in
analytics yeah I'm not going to set it
up I can choose an app if I want to so
lots of stuff that I can do here I can
set up the tracking through the re pixel
I can select the pixel I'm not going to
go into those details and here is the
URL parameter that I want to build for
the tracking but here is the basic
version of my ad yep and now it's a
matter of pressing publish and then the
next thing that will happen that
Facebook will look at the ad they will
evaluate the ad and once they approve
the ad yeah then the campaign will go
live yep so here's the business location
and currency I'm just clicking next
that's the payment information they
still need my credit card details I
don't want to do that yeah so I'm not
going to give them the details so I want
to skip that so I'm not going to publish
this campaign for now but at least it
gives you an overview of how to create a
campaign in the flow of campaign ad set
and ads there's a lot more to it
obviously but at least this gives you a
high level overview so if that is on the
campaign setting there are two more
important areas that is your audience
creation so you can create separate
audiences that you can then add as an
audience for your ad campaign yes so if
you click create you can create a custom
audiences a lookalike audience or what
we say a saved audience yeah if I click
on Saved audience what you're going to
do you can specify the audience with the
name yeah and by the location but you
can then do a detailed targeting based
on demographics interests or behaviors
so I can just click here let's say
somebody who is excited about travel
yeah so could be frequent
Travelers yeah and there's a whole range
of uh things that you can add here and
in your um your audio a and you will see
that it will sort of impact your
audience size as well so you can do by
Behavior yeah or by uh by interest so um
and there's a whole sort of let's say I
want to do
California yeah so I can California
place people who are either interested
there yeah so I can Target by location
as well if I want so this is the really
powerful um aspect of payperclick
campaigns on meta and also on Google
yeah on the targeting so I'm going to
cancel this I can also create an
audience or we say a custom audience and
this is uh these are audiences based on
people who have done a specific behavior
like visiting your website and this is
what we call the retargeting so Facebook
allows you to Target people who have
visited your website a particular page
which means the next day they could get
an advert of your Facebook ad of the the
product that they saw on your website so
it's all to do with the retargeting and
the pixel marketing now I'm not going to
go into that because that's beyond the
scope of this video but this is where
you would set it all
up okay and then of course within your
advertising you have your ads reporting
section as
well where you can look at the account
name yeah for the um yeah you can look
at reach Impressions frequency amount
spent and attribution setting now I
haven't got any campaigns running so I
don't see any details here yeah also
because the period is but let's say if
we can
select um let me have a look let's say
no I haven't run any Facebook campaigns
on this campaign so I can't show you any
data but this is where you can create
your advertising reports where you can
select all these breakdowns and bring
them into your
report good that's it on the Facebook
and Instagram ads
and what we're going to do now is move
to the next demo the final demo of this
series which is everything to do with
the meta insights to access the insights
in The Meta business Suite you go to the
main dashboard and you click on all
tools and you scroll down in analyzing

Insight section where you learn about um
about it your your Facebook page and

engagement around your activities on

towards goals that you've specified like
increase reach for instance and here you
see your activity the content that we
placed and how uh and if we did any
advertising
M so that is sort of your high level
summary if you click here on view all

this dashboard this is where you get a
very detailed breakdown into your
audiences yeah so you can understand
your audience's characteristics and
behaviors and you can develop your
content strategies for a more personal
ized and engaging customer experience so

clicks and minutes viewed of um your
page and you scroll down you can see
advertising what you've done or what
others have done and your post frequency

say hey you need to start advertising
and post more so boost for reach takes
you straight into the advertising or
create post takes you to your uh your
content and your post and scheduling
section within uh The Meta business
Suite so very important here and that is
the most important
reports in your uh Insight which is your
audience report which is your content
report and your performance report yeah
so let's have a look at these three
reports and see what we get if I look at
audience here again you can go straight
into advertising or creating a post but
what you want to have here want to look
at is how did my followers
grow yeah and how did on both Facebook
and on Instagram yeah what are the most
important cities where people are from

gender so that's your current audience
it gives you potential audience where
what you can get yeah the top cities
top countries top other pages that you
can learn
from yeah so great information that you
can get here on your audience that you

your content yeah to me this is probably
the most important section of your meta
insights here you see what content works
and what doesn't work yeah for your
Facebook post your stories and your
Instagram post and stories whether those
posts are photos or videos or text Post
Yeah so here you have your high level
overview of you can select for Facebook

engagement but the real spicy details
you can find under content here you can
see every post and story and video that
you did yeah and you can see here what
is the title what is the date published
and what else you can see here is
information about reach and Impressions
and further details that you get yeah so
and this makes it so exciting because
here you can see which posts have the
highest engagement levels like reactions
like comments and shares and you can
order these from high to low so I can
now see what post has been my most
engaging post when it comes to reactions
in the last 28 days I can say make that
in the last 90
days yeah I can now see what has been my
most popular post over the last 90 days
when it comes to reactions and comments
and share and the nice thing then is by
clicking on that post you see what the
post was about and then you can say hey
if that post worked then can we make the
other post similar to this post because
for this post we know that that post
Works yep so very useful information you
can get here about your content and use
that to your advantage yeah so we looked
at the audience we looked at the content
so now let's look at the performance of
the videos and the reals again I can see
your summary I can also go down straight
into the
details yep and here you see total
minutes of Feud um compared to the
previous period you see what is organic
what is paid and again what were your
most import the most popular posts when
it comes to minutes
viewed yeah for the the period that you
selected so here in the sense I'm final
details about your
audience yeah for your your videos and
the retentions now we haven't got any
earnings on videos so that kind of
summarizes everything there is to know
about the insights a fantastic pool of
data that you can use to kind of look at
Trends yeah so you can kind of predict
of what is going to happen and you can
stay ahead of the curve with what you
learn from your meta insights so very
useful and um take this uh information

as a lead this is because they have
interacted with your business website
and allowed you to reach out to them now

type of content you can share for
instance videos are effective on social
media but you cannot include directly
them into the mail so if your audience
is on Twitter keep in mind that long
blogs might need to be linked or
shortened always prioritize providing
value ensuring each piece of content
serves a particular purpose all right
now the next one is generation database
you might have the best potential

the platforms where you can effectively
promote your affiliate products social
media platforms like Instagram Facebook
and Twitter are great for reaching a
broad audience additionally content
platforms such as YouTube and blogging
sites allow you to create valuable
content and drive traffic to your

with potential customers and provide
helpful recommendations so now let's

Google and let's type
Q now we'll click on
this all right continue with
Google all right so here it is Cura
so here you can also promote the
affiliate links because there's a
traffic over here as well so all you
have to do is to just select the
category which you want to promote let
just say let's just say we are promoting
a v protein brand you are promoting a v
protein brand so we'll click on this and
we can also type here best W routine

similarly like what what is the best way

answer each and every questions and
attach the affiliate link of that
particular product this is also a way as
you can see if you click on questions
and the these are the questions some
people have used as well I think and
they have
mentioned so this is a great way for
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing you can do like this as well a
lot of people do like this another way
is through YouTube whether you're
building a website YouTube channel or
any other platform it's crucial to
acknowledge that you must reveal the use
of affiliate links the Federal Trade
Commission that is FTC mandates
transparency when earning income through
endorsements emphasizing the importance
of openly disclosing such affiliations
so as I said YouTube is a great way of
promoting or doing affiliate marketing
so let's take the same example again
best way protein we'll be taking this
example only so as you can see there are
multiple INF lers out there and let's
just select this video so you can
promote or like do affiliate marketing
in videos in your own videos because a
lot of traffic after Google comes to
YouTube and the traffic you can navigate
that
traffic yeah so you can navigate that
traffic to your affiliate link so as we
can see this guy has attached an
affiliate link and also get up to 40% on
this protein powder so you can click on
this and and he can get a commission out
of it
and make sure that the product you are
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing is the right product and then
only you can build a relationship with
your audiences so as you can see this
guy has done that so you can do that and
this guy has like 3 lakh 40,000 views
and let's say he's getting 2,000 or
3,000 clicks on this protein by suggest
in them so you'll get the commission a
lot of commission from that so this is a
nice way of promoting or doing the
affiliate marketing and this is how this
is a great way in fact this is the best
way I would say to do the affiliate
marketing because it is quite easy so
he's basically navigating that views or
that traffic to the affiliate link so

your website these are the main services
that digital marketing agencies offered

online and reach more customers all
right so these were the services that
were offered and now let's move on to
the interesting part of this video which
is how to set up a digital marketing
agency with $0 so the first step here
would be start with market research so
market research is crucial first step
for any business including a digital
marketing agency by understanding your
target audience their needs and the
demand for your services you can tailor
your offerings to meet those needs
effectively analyzing your competitors
helps you identify what makes your
agency unique and where you can stand
out in the market to analyze your
existing customer base to understand
their demographics preferences and needs
start with looking for industry Trends
to identify popular services and
emerging demands in the market the next
you can do is conduct surveys to gather
direct feedback from potential customers
about their pain points and preferences

is undertake comprehensive market
research to comprehend your target
audience their pain points and the
demand for your chosen Services next is
analyze competitors to identify Market
GS and opportunities that can set your
agency apart in the digital marketing
landscape all right so these were the
things that you can do in market
research so this was about doing the
market research Next Step would be
address legal requirements yes making
sure your digital marketing agency
follows the rules is super important
when getting started this means
officially setting up your business by
registering it and picking a good name
you have got to do things by the book to
make sure your agency stays on the right
side of the law it's smart to get advice
from legal experts to make sure you're
following all the local rules and also
to create the contracts with your
clients taking care of these legal
things from the beginning helps build a
strong foundation for your agency makes
clients trust you and avoids problems
down the road all right so once you're
done with this then you can go forward
and building a social media presence so
yeah building a social media presence on
platforms like Facebook and Instagram is
really important for businesses these
platforms have lots of people using them
every day so it's good way to reach
potential customers by post postponing
interesting and engaging content
business can get people interested in
what they have to offer they can also
use paid advertising on these platforms
to reach even more people this can help
generate leads which means finding the
potential customers who are interested
in what the business is selling by being
active on Facebook and Instagram a
business can build community of people
who like and follow them which can lead
to more sales and stronger connection
with customers so paying attention to
these platforms and building a strong
presence there can really help the
business to grow all right so once you
have started building a social media
presence then you can start with finding
a niche when you're starting in digital
marketing it's good idea to find a
specific area that you're really good at
this would be things like social media
marketing making websites or helping
business to show up in higher Google
searches by focusing on one of these
things you can become an expert in that
area and stand out from other digital
marketers for example if you're really
good at making websites you can focus on
that and become known for it when
businesses need a new website they'll
come to you because they know you are
the best at it the same goes for the
other areas like social media marketing
or helping businesses with their Google
ads all right so this was about finding
a niche now next you can do is create a
website all right so first you can start
by creating a website for your business
this is like having an online store or
office where people can come and learn
about what you do it's a bit of having a
shop on the internet next you can create
a logo of your business a logo is like a
special picture that represents your
business you can use a free tool called
canva to make a logo that looks nice and
shows what your business is about after
that you can use a free website builder
called vix to actually make your website
vix is like a tool that helps you put
together all the parts of your website
like pictures text and buttons without
needing to know how to code by doing
these things you can have a nice looking
website with a logo that represents your
business and you can do it all for free
this can help your business look more
professional and make it easier for
people to find you online so once you
are done with creating the website then
you can attract leads with Organic
advertising so attracting leads with
Organic advertising means promoting your
business without paying for ads instead
you use things like social media making
helpful content and improving your
website so that it shows up higher in
the Google searches for example on
social media you can post interesting
things about business that people will
want to share with their friends with
content marketing you can create useful
articles or videos that people will find
their search for things related to your
business and with SEO you can make sure
your website is set up in a way that
makes it more likely to show up when
people search for things you offer by
using these methods you can attract
people to your business without having
to spend money on ads all right so this
is how you can attract leads with
Organic advertising now next step would
be building networks so building
networks means going to events seminars
and workshops where you can meet people
who might want to use your service or
who work in the same industry as you by
doing this you can make friends with
other businesses and learn about the
newest trends in digital marketing this
can help you find new clients and also
get tips from others in the same line of
work so building network is a good way
to make connections and stay up to date
with what's happening in the digital
marketing world all right so next step
is content marketing so content
marketing is like telling a good story
to people who might be interested in
what you are selling so instead of just
saying buy this you create helpful or
interesting things like articles videos
or pictures that help people want to see
this can make people trust you more and
see you as an expert in what you do it's
like building a strong wall around your
business to protect it and make it all
stand out when you do content marketing
you're not just trying to sell something
right away you're trying to make people
interested in what you do by giving them
something valuable this can bring more
people to your business without you
having to chase after them it's like
making a magnet that pulls customers to
you instead of having to push hard to
get their attention so content marketing
is a smart way to show people that you
know your stuff and to bring more
customers to your business without being
too pushy all right now the next step is
gather feedback so Gathering feedback is
an important part of running a business
it means collecting comments reviews
from your customers to understand what
they like and what could be improved
good firms Yelp and Google my business
are all places where customers can
feedback about their experience with the
business good firms is a platform where
business can be reviewed and red by
their customers helping other people
decide if they want to use that business
too Yelp is a website where people can
find a review find and review local
businesses like restaurants or shops
Google my business is a tool that lets
business manage their online presence
including customer ruts by gathering
feedback on these platforms business can
learn what they are doing and where they
can make changes to better serve their
customers it's a way for business to
listen to their customers and improve
their products or Services based on what
people are seeing these were the steps
to make a digital marketing agency

your website stand out in the vast
online world making it more likely for
people to find and visit it so SEO is
like the friendly guide that ensures
your website gets the attention it
deserves bringing in more visitors and
potential
customers and for doing so a tool is
very crucial and one of the best tool
out there is SEO powerit so SEO powerit
stand out as the best solution for all
your SEO and digital marketing
requirements it offers four powerful
tools like rank tracker website auditor
SEO spy glass and Link assistant
providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SU SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a onstop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SE power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back links and
Link building and first we'll have to
focus on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understanding of keyword and overall
market dynamics so first of all we'll
have to create a project over here so
over here we'll have to type the URL of
this website and
so I will just type
here bof.com it's an e-commerce site all
right so now we'll click on next then
again we'll connect on next and here you
can enter the keywords if you want and
if you don't want then you can proceed
by clicking on
next here you can add more search
engines Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean
it's your choice if you want to add it
or not I just don't want to add all
these Google and Yahoo are sufficient
then we'll click on
finish all right so our project is
getting ready all right so it is loaded
so first of all we'll start by
understanding the menu bar so the menu
bar is like the control center like of
rank tracker offering a set of drop down
menus that help you manage your projects
and preferences so let's understand
first so this is file so this menu
handles basic commands relating to your
project such as opening closing and
saving files it's your go-to for
managing project files efficiently then
there is preferences as we can see here
in preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
trailering rank tracker to suit your
needs then there is window so window
this menu provides a list of supported
hot Keys like keyboard shortcuts and
allows you to quickly switch between
different modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation and action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the
assistance all right then here comes the
project as you can see project this menu
is like a project management Hub it
displays a drop- down list of all the
projects currently open in rank tracker
allowing you to easily switch between
them so only one project is there so it
is showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and then open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
projects with this command you can do
that then close this option allows you
to exit then as you can see check all so
check all rankings in all the open
projects simultaneously with this
command it streamlines the process of
gathering information across your
various projects then you can also login
like found in the SEO power Cloud login
area this is where you log to access
Cloud related features all right so this
was about the menu bar now coming to the
sidebar so quickly let's understand this
one so first of all there is the
dashboard as you can see project
dashboard this is your project Central
Hub it provides a visual summary of key
statistics related to your organic
traffic ranking progress and how well
your competitors are doing it serves as
a quick gateway to all main project
sections then there is rank tracking for
in this module you will find a list of
keywords you're targeting it shows their
ranking history traffic statistics
keyword efficiency index Kei keyword
difficulty and other essential data that
you may need to update regularly so it
is like that all right now now as we can
see next is keyword research so here it
is so here you can explore new keyword
ideas using over 20 different tools like
it is in there the module allows you to
analyze and categorize new keywords into
groups and move them to Target keyword
section all right so as you can see
these are that 20 different tools the
tools that we are talking about then
there is Sur analysis that is SCP
analysis this is for in-depth keyword
analysis
it provides you detailed analytical
report on websites competing with you
for the same queries then competitors
research this module enables you to
research on competitors based on domain
or topic domain strength it offers
overall report on your website's SEO
strength showing how it evolves over
time then there is reports this module
is for generating and you know
delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research we click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as we can see all right so now now here
you can type the name of the competitor
and click search so let's just say I
want to type the name of the competitor
the sold store let's
say all right now I'll click on
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profile
all right so this is what it is this is
the result and as we can see keywords
and this is organic traffic this is URL
of the sold
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and access their performance
weekend you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely rank tracker to recommend
the most relevant ones within your
specific
Niche now after this you can explore
keywords with various keyword research
methods like keyword Gap search console
Keyword Planner autocomplete tools
related searches keyword combination Etc
so as you can see all these are over
here you can have a look at these and
explore these meanwhile we can explore
this keyword sandbox as you can see
keyword sandbox with the help of this we
can filter our our keywords which is the
next step all right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
factors such as search volume as we can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficult is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like track
like we can see so it's your choice you
can filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
tracked now your keywords will appear
also in the tracked keyword so like I
have tracked this one and this one so in
tracked keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and and then we'll type
the website that is
de.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as we can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all we'll
explore similarly that we explored in
the previous one so this is the menu bar
and I think we have explored this and
this is the sidebar it is bit different
from that so let's explore the sidebar
so site structure we have as you can see
this section organizes all the elements
of a website including its pages and
resources it provides like a visual map
of the site along with an audit
dashboard that accesses various Su
factors
so as you can see page audit over here
now the page audit will do the page
level analysis so this was the function
of page audit then domain strength is
there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with a little demo so first we have to
create a project that we already created
and wait till the tool crawls and
collects all the pages on your website
so that we have done already now we'll
go to site audit so as you can see here
under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit we'll address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool all
right so next we can do is visualization
as you can see over here under site
audit we click on that now to ensure
visualization basically is used to
ensure your site is well structured the
tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly Sport and address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections redirects broken links and more
so this is what it is used for on the
right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click depth as we can see
click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side side this is
the right side and if you switch to
internal page link as you can see you'll
click on that you can see how the
internal link are spreaded like it is
bit different sorting by Page views if
you
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we're not able to figure it out as
of now for that I think we'll be needing
a Google analytics account and we'll
know to log in with that all right so
after reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in Rand
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say want to
write
joggers
watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts slider
and you can write as many as gers you
want
jacket
hoodies
shs all right I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have rote the keywords over
here now we'll click on create map now
the program will take few moments to
harvest all data for the keywords and
the tool automatically identifies the
pages most relevant to your keyword
group or specific keyword so this is
showing only one it should at least show
five because website auditor will
suggest the top five most fitting pages
for each keyword of group
so we must add more keywords I believe
we can add manually or we can just have
a look at rank tracker also like
hellfire club shirt we can
see can add
that all right
eight all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just hover
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it
is all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map now with the ready
keyword map ensure your landing page is
optimized for Target keywords now we'll
go to content audit first so here we can
adjust the target settings set the
default search engine for competitor
page and assign a specific one for the
current page so as you can see they are
showing the errors and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and as it is showing make your page meta
description approximately 22 word long
so it is showing how to fix also
basically and it will talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as we can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily you know edit this
site also and properly write an SEO
optimized title so as you can see 33.2%
optimization rate is there it is showing
and other than that we can click on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description tags and you can see how
those fit into the intersections the
recommended number of characters based
on the best SEO practices so as you can
see 3111 160 you can easily edit that
and make it SEO friendly also all your
target keywords will show up in the
mapped keywords as you can see the map
keyboard hood is
so the green here it is green so green
means okay okay orange if it was orange
it means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as we can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keywords this
section will list the keywords that have
been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so so you can
also include
these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so now let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking backlinks it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type bof.com
all right now we'll click on
next SE power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say We'll click on
so these were the number of backlinks so
I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while SEO spy glass
collects backlinks statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of backlinks that this site
has
130,000 domains
9,622 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the data
so search engines prioritize websites
that have backlinks from reputable
domains conversely an abundance of
backlinks from spammy sites can
negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on any
efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the backlinks already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SEO
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find the pages linking
to your site for that to gather all the
back links directed to your site you
need to initiate a new project in SEO
spy class that we already did and now we
can navigate to backlinks
profile we click on back
links all right so the tool will examine
its index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful metrics
essential for further analysis
so as we can see backlink page domain in
link rank linked page links back so all
the backlink pages are there it is also
showing
130k backlinks all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one
like.
in.org
g.net like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary wiget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of pack links you can also see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over uh any cell in the back
links domains columns you'll see the
icon of expanding the list of URLs to
look through so as you can see these are
the backlink page list of
URLs all right
now let's move on to the referral
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referral traffic module this is
the referral traic module under back
rink profile this is backlink profile if
you want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click

stats or this also will work on this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics or the backlinks in the
project after the task finishes you'll
see the results in the workspace you can
then switch between views linking
domains and backlink pages so the
linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referal session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to

summary you can like including key
metrics you ditify both the strengths
and weaknesses of your site now we can
peek at your competitors's backlink
profile also so now is the moment to

let's like the Sol the sold
store.com I'll WR the spelling is wrong
the sold store it
is all right click then there is
Snitch doco
doin all
right and one more is there let's
write
nra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
you'll see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors domains as we can
see
b.com the sold store snitch.com
now you can easily compare on the basis
of different metrics there are various
Matrix over here and as you can see
there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
bof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics all right now coming
to the next step which is spot the
dangerous links before progressing to
actual link building phase it's crucial
to address one final task identify and
remove potential and harmful backlinks
so for that we will go to backlink
profile then the penalty risk so
backlink profile this then we'll go to
penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisable to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
posst minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on the particular link
as you can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will tasked updated
backlink base data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy glass now let's do the link
building with link link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assists in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and backlink and Target
settings all right so as we can see uh
we can like first of all we'll type
b.com right
now so as we have provided the web
address select your desired Target
country so Target entry over here and
the language also you can select from
this and other than this the app's
search engine will be tailored
automatically according to your
preferences Additionally you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is the
app will analyze the backlink profiles
of potential prospects and eliminate
those containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on
create all right so this is the layout
now so first by default this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can s select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see six predetermined methods or
the configure a customized search this
one configure a customize search using
the expert mode this is the expert mode
basically so these options enable you to
conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect you're
seeking if you lack seed keywords you
can utilize the get keyword suggestion
feature this function automatically
identifies your top 20 ranking keywords
that generate the highest traffic
all right so now step two would be let's
say let's explore this one guest posting
top 100 blocks we'll click on this all
right so by employing this search
technique you can identify the top 100
prospects ranked by organic traffic
using specific search operators related
to your seat keywords to initiate the
search input the seat keywords here you
will write down the seat keyword so
let's say I just want to write winter
Weare
all right
and you can also do the search engine
settings but I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on
this so these are the contact
information this is the page previews
and this is the prospect preview
and additional details are also there
you can select or unselect all the
results to be moved to the prospects
like
this right so then we'll click on move
to projects on Hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects
all right so these are the prospect that
you that we have moved now that we have
possess a recently compiled list of
potential links it is crucial to access
their quality and prioritize the ones we
intend to reach out to initially we'll
go to
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL and update so here is the update
and select contact info so as you can
see contact info we'll click on okay now
that we have settled on the list of
factors you would like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated
like I'll click on uh contact
information and press okay like
that all right can do for this one
also all right so the next step is to
reach out to prospects utilize the app
to initiate Outreach directly taking the
convenience of having all the contact
details at your disposal by connecting
your email account to link assistant you
can centralize and organize your
campaigns corespondence if efficiently
within the application begin reaching
out from the app since you already have
everyone's contact info simply link your
email to link assistant and all your
campaign messages will be saved in one
spot so you can just click on this and
then email so as you can see domain.
operations. web.com it has taken the
information from contact info and once
you have linked your account or email
then you can it will update over here
and then you can simply send it apply
and okay so as you can see dear owner
