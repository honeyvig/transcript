meet Joey a digital marketer he works as
the head of digital marketing for Amazon
but how did Joey get here a few years
ago Joey began to see a large number of
opportunities popping up in the field of
digital marketing to begin his entry
into the field he needed to understand
what exactly digital marketing was and
what was so great about it first Joey
learned that digital marketing was a
form of marketing through which you
could advertise to people digitally
digital marketing leveraged different
channels like search engines websites
social media platforms emails and mobile
applications it would give marketers the
opportunity to interact with and
understand their audience better and to
increase the trust in their brand
digital marketing would also show
marketers advertisements to People based
on their actions and preferences on the
internet while being less expensive than
traditional forms of advertising after
understanding the main concepts of
digital marketing Joey realized there
was more to digital marketing than he
initially thought there were also many
types of digital marketing types like
content marketing search engine
optimization payperclick social media
Mar marketing email marketing and
affiliate marketing and once he
understood those types he set up a
digital marketing campaign for his
uncle's e-commerce website let's have a
look at what he came up with first Joey
created content like blogs videos
infographics and case studies so that he
could generate audience interest in the
Brand's products or
services this was content marketing next
he needed his audience to actually see
his content the first step was to create
content on specific search keywords that
were relevant to the target audience
Joey would make optimizations on the
website and have credible websites
linking back to the content and lo and
behold the website began ranking on the
first page of the search results by
continuous optimizations Joey would
continue to improve the ranking and
ultimately make the website rank at the
first position this was SEO or search
engine optimization and Joey could do
all of this without spending a single
penny he could also Drive traffic to the
website with
advertisements but for this he would
have to pay a certain fee each time the
ads were clicked he could have text ads
that show up in search engine results
image ads and video ads that show up in
websites and much more this was possible
with the help of PPC or payperclick
however Joey wasn't done yet to reach a
larger audience he needed to tap into
social media platforms he would use
social media platforms like LinkedIn
YouTube Facebook and Instagram to
advertise the Brand's content he would
use these platforms to advertise the
Brand's products or services with posts
images videos and more to bring out the
Brand's story and engage with the
Brand's audience who spend a lot of time
on social media like PPC he could use
the platform to advertise the Brand's
products or services with text image and
video ads which needed to be paid for
that's social media marketing Joey
realized that a large amount of the
audience weren't visiting the Brand's
website a second time he needed to keep
them engaged nurture them to make sure
they purchased the product for this he
would send them emails that help them
better understand the products they
visited on the website and assist them
in the buying process he would also send
emails to advertise his products or
services to potential customers that is
with email marketing and finally
although Joey was able to grow the
Brand's funnel he wanted more traffic
from thirdparty websites this could be
achieved with affiliate marketing
Affiliates would promote the brand or
product to their audiences for a fee
with the help of email signups
registrations conversions subscriptions
Etc after setting all of this up Joey
had the hardest part of the process to
get through the wait now as we wait for
the results let's take a break and look

forms of marketing involves engaging and

complemented by 35 Plus dedicated
resources all right guys so let's start
with the first topic all right so let's
understand what is digital marketing so
digital marketing is the art of using
the internet to promote products or
services to people who might be
interested in them instead of relying
solely on traditional methods like
newspaper ads or Flyers digital
marketing takes advantage of online
platforms like we website social media
emails and search engines did you know
that a whooping 89% of Americans go
online every day and about 31% are
online nearly all the time this means
it's super important to be online too by
having ads and stuff online you can make
your brand known give customers a great
experience and even get more people
interested in what you offer by using
digital channels like social media
paperclick ads search engine
optimization and email marketing to
connect with ex existing customers and
then you can measure your success in
numbers tracking websites visits and
social media engagement email open rates
and more are also used in this this data
helps you understand what's working and
what's not allowing you to adjust your
strategy to maximize the results all
right so this was about digital
marketing now let's understand how is
digital marketing different from
traditional marketing so digital
marketing and traditional marketing are
like two sides of a coin they both aim
to promote products orice services but
they do it in different ways here's how
it works first traditional marketing
traditional marketing is like shouting
across the crowed playground to get
everyone's attention so in traditional
marketing let's say tv ads and
billboards think commercial and giant
posters trying to reach a lot of people
at once second example would be
newspapers and flyers spreading messages
through printed materials delivered to
homes or handed out to streets and now
let's talk about the digital marketing
aspect so digital marketing however is
like Whispering directly in the ear of a
person who wants a particular product so
let's say online ads placing ads on
websites or search engines that people
who are already interested in your steps
will see next is social media connecting
with people on platforms like Facebook
and Instagram where you can show them
why your product is the best then
another example would be targeted emails
sending messages directly to people who
might be interested like offering a
discount on their first product purchase
is another benefit of digital marketing
so basically digital marketing is kind
of more specific and targeted marketing
all right now let's understand how it
actually works so how digital marketing
Works digital marketing works by
leveraging the power of the internet and
Technology to connect with the potential
customers this involves using online
tools to reach and engage with their
audience where they spend most of their
time that is the the internet so let's
have a look at some first on the list is
SE so this helps your website show up in
higher search engine results making it
more likely for people to find you when
they search for something you offer for
example when someone in your area
searches for a freshly baked pastries
SEO ensures that your bakery's website
appears at the top of the search results
this increases the chance of local
customer finding your bakery online when
they're looking for B Goods all right so
this was about the SEO now coming to the
next one which is content marketing so
this involves creating useful and
interesting content like blogs videos
and social media post can attract and
retain customers for example you could
create engaging content such as blog
post about the history of pastries
tutorial videos on cake decoration or
photos of your latest Creations on
social media this content not only
showcases your expertise but also keeps
your audience engaged and interest Ed in
what you offer next on the list is
social media marketing so this social
media marketing involves using platforms
like Facebook Instagram and Twitter to
connect with their audience and share
content that encourages them to interact
with the brand for example you can use
delicious images of your Baker Goods
interact with customers by responding to
comments and messages and even run
contest or promotions to attract more
people to your store that is the baker
all right coming to the next one which
is is email marketing so email marketing
is like having a personal connection
with your customers it involves using
email to connect with potential and
existing customers it's essentially
sending commercial messages but with a
permission based approach people who
sign up for your email list are
essentially giving you the green light
to send them information for example you
can collect email address from your
customers who visits the bakery and you
can send them regular updates about new
pasty flavors special promotions or up
upcoming events at your bakery this
personalized communication keeps your
brand top of mind and encourages to
repeat the business next is payer click
that is PPC advertising so payper click
or PPC advertising is an online
advertising model where advertisers pay
a fee each time their ad is clicked so
it's a way of buying visits to your
website rather than attempting to earn
those visits organically PPC ads
typically appear alongside search engine
results or on soci social media
platforms and advertisers bid on keyword
to display their ads to the relevant
audiences so example for this you could
create ads that appear when people
search for terms like best bakery in
your town or Target social media users
based on their interest in baking or
deserts with PPC you only pay when
someone clicks on your ad making it cost
effective way to attract potential
customers to your Baker's website or
social media profiles now that we have
discussed the types of digital marketing
strategies let us understand how you can
Implement each of these strategies so
first identify your audience the first
step is understanding who you want to
reach imagine them as people who might
be interested in your product or
services this is like picturing the
people who would love your bakery are
they busy professionals looking for a
quick breakfast P or maybe families with
Sweet Tooth understanding your ideal
customers help your tailor your
marketing efforts the next is choose
your Channel channels next you pick the
online platforms where your target
audience hangs out think of these as
virtual stomping grounds like social
media sites or search engines think of
online platforms as virtual
neighborhoods if your target audience is
young families Instagram might be the
great place to Showcase your colorful
cupcake all right next one is creating
engaging content once you know where
your audience is you can create content
that will grab their attention this
could be informative blog post
eye-catching videos or even fun social
media post this is like taking
mouthwatering pictures of your cupcakes
and bread you can even film short videos
of your frosting of cake or decorating
cookies to show your skills similar to
what all the foodie channels are doing
nowadays on YouTube and Instagram then
next is spreading the word so now that
you have a great content you need to get
it seen right you can use various
strategies like online advertising
social media promotion or even
influencer marketing that is partnering
with people your audience trust for
example you can put a post like mention
someone who will give you a pasty treat
and you can even run a contest or
giveaways like this post and tag a
friend who loves cake for a chance to
win a free slice and you can also do
collaboration with some foodie channels
that are famous next is tracking and
analyzing digital marketing Types on
measurement you can track how well your
campaign are performing and adjust your
strategy based on the data for example

see what works and and what doesn't so
you can Define your strategy for even

engine results pages scps to boost
visibility typically seen on Google or
Bing sem involves bidding on keywords
relevant to products or Services when
users search with those keywords ads
from successful biders appear
prominently it's like a shortcut to be
seen when people people are looking for
something specific online advertisers
pay when someone clicks on their ad
which is known as pay per click that is
PPC the goal is to attract potential
customers actively seeking related
information sem complements search
engine optimization that is SEO efforts
by providing immediate visibility this
Dynamic marketing approach allows
businesses to tailor campaigns measure
performance and adjust strategies
quickly contributing to a more agile and
responsive online presence all right so
this was about search engine marketing
now let's understand why is it important
so with more people relying on the
internet to discover and buy products
search engine marketing has become a
vital for expanding a company's online
presence the majority of new website
visitors come from search engine queries
SC ensures that companies only pay for
ads when they lead to actual visits
making it a costeffective marketing
strategy moreover each visitors
contributes to improving a website's
ranking in organic search results unlike
social media where users aren't actively
seeking products or Services consumers
using search engines are often ready to
make a purchase the intent driven
approach makes sem powerful tool for
connecting with potential customers who
are actively seeking relevant
information ultimately boosting a
company's chances of making
sales so this was about why sem is
important now let's have a look at the
difference between sem and
SEO so search engine marketing and
search engine optimizations play pivotal
roles in online marketing SC involves
paying search engines like Google or
displaying ads in search results on the
other hand SEO does not require payments
to Google instead businesses aim to
secure a free sport in search results by
offering the most relevant content for
specific keywords sem is like a shortcut
where you pay for immediate visibility
while SEO is a long-term strategy
earning visibility organically ideally
combining both is a smart approach SEO
drives consistent traffic over time
especially at the top of the marketing
funnel while sem with its paid ads is a
coste effective way to boost conversions
at the bottom of the funnel it's a
dynamic duo for comprehensive online
marketing strategy so this was about the
difference between search engine
marketing and search engine optimization
now let's understand how it works that
that is how sem works so search engine
marketing works like a online
advertising when you search on Google
you see some results at the top with a
small ad tag those are sem ads
businesses pay to show their ads there
it's like putting up a billboard where
lots of people can see it here's how it
works first business choose a specific
words that is keywords related to what
they offer when someone searches using
these words if the business is Bid
enough money their ad can show up the
more they bid the higher the chance of
their ad gets seen imagine you have a
local bakery and you want more people to
know about your delicious cupcakes this
is where search engine marketing comes
in let's say someone is in your town is
craving for cupcakes and types yummy
cupcakes near me into Google if you have
set up sem campaign and bid on the right
keywords like yummy cupcakes your
bakery's ad may appear at the top of the
search results with a little ad tag now
picture a person seeing your ad and
thinking oh that's look tasty they click
on your ad visit your Bakery website and
maybe even place an order for cupcakes
so in this example sem helped your
bakery get noticed when someone was
actively searching for what you offer
cupcakes you paid a bit to Google but in
return you gathered a new customer it's
like putting up a sign saying hey we
have the cupcakes you're looking for
when some one is out searching for a
sweet treat now let's understand about
sem tools so search engine marketing
tools first we have is Sam Rush Sam Rush
is a tool that helps you know what
people are searching for online it tells
you about popular keywords what your
competitors are doing and how your
website is doing compared to others it's
like a map of making your website stand
out in online crowd then there is Google
ads Keyword Planner Google ads Keyword
Planner is a tool by Google that helps
you pick the best words for your online
ads if you're a baker it suggests words
like delicious cupcakes or fresh
pastries to reach more people it's like
a helper for choosing the right words to
get noticed then there is Google Trends
so Google Trends shows what popular on
the internet right now whether it's a
new dance or the latest gadget it helps
you stay updated on what people are
talking about it's like a trending watch
friend keeping you in the loop all right
now moving on to the next topic which is
how do add auctions work so Google Bing
and Yahoo use an auction system for ads
during every user search in the Google
ad auction various factors decide which
ad appears on the top of the search
results this includes the quality score
from Google ads Google paperclick
platform it's not just about the budget
relevance matters even if a campaign has
smaller budget it can beat a bigger one
if the content is more fitting similar
to organic rankings factors like trust
signals and web traffic also influence
who wins the ad space in Google auction
these ads go through an auction process
with each user search in Google ads
auction the ads position isn't solely
determined by the campaign's budget the
quality score earned through Google ads
plays a significant role unlike a state
forward budget race the auction plays
relevance a smaller budget can Triumph
if the ad is more relevant to the user
search additionally organic search
factors like trust signals and web
traffic also wait in ensuring that
auction isn't solely about money but
about showing the most fitting ads to
users so this was about how add auctions
work now let's understand sem campaign
strategy so in sem campaign strategy
first we have is keyword research so
discover what keywords people use when
searching for your product or service
for instance if you run a cupcake shop
identify terms like tasty cupcakes near
me select these keywords to connect with
potential customer actively looking for
what you
offer so next is campaign creation
establish your online advertising
campaign craft straightforward ads with
appealing language for the cupcake shop
an ad could be delicious cupcakes order
Now set a budget for how much you are
willing to pay when someone clicks on
your ad keeping it it simple and
engaging to attract
attention the next is measurement and
optimization evaluate the performance of
your ads track clicks and conversions if
results aren't satisfying adjust your
ads or
keywords constantly Define your approach
based on what resonates best with your
audience to improve outcomes over
time so this was about the sem campaign
strategy so in this video we have
understood the importance of sem
differentiated from SEO understood how
it works discovered essential sem tools
unrel the Dynamics of add auctions and
mastered effective sem campaign
strategies and what we're going to do is
start out with search engine
optimization okay so search engine of
optimization or organic search we have a
mixture of paid and free so there's a
lot of different platforms but if you're
focusing on SEO you certainly need to
use an SEO platform so there's sem Rush
okay you also have Google search console
which is free so if you don't have a SEO
platform you definitely need to be using
Google search console and so we'll take
a closer look at that there's Google
Keyword Planner which is actually
situated under Google ads and so if
you're running Google campaigns on
Google search Network or even the
Display Network you have access to a
great tool called keyboard planner and
if you know anything about SEO you'll
know that using Google's Keyword Planner
is a good tool so we'll take a look at
that Moz is a premium tool meaning they
have a free trial that you can sign up
for to test drive it but it's another
SEO platform and it does cost money got
a great tool in screaming frog that's a
paid version again not too expensive
we'll talk a little bit more about that
and then we have you know a tool in HRS
that help us with all aspects of SEO
primarily focusing on off page so these
are just some examples that we're going
to hone in on but this is just a small
subset of what really is available out
there in the market so let's go ahead
and dive a little bit deeper and
understand why we use some of these
tools well the first reason when we talk
about SEO is to find relevant keywords
not only do we want to find relevant
keywords we want to find relevant
keywords with high volume and low
competition I okay we wouldn't want to
find non-relevant keywords with high
competition low volume that wouldn't
make sense so we need a tool to kind of
help us put it all together and so the
tool of choice for us is Google's
Keyword Planner and Google's Keyword
Planner helps us hone in on keywords we
may be interested in optimizing for
because not only one are they relevant
but two they're going to have high
volume and low competition so let's take
a look add an example in Google's
Keyword Planner so here I am I'm in
Google's Keyword Planner and as I
mentioned before Google's Keyword
Planner is situated under Google ads
okay so you have to have a Google ads
account to use Google's Keyword Planner
and so when you're in Google ads you
simply go to tools and then under Tools
you're going to select Keyword Planner
so what we want to do is look for
keywords we're focusing on organic
search not necessarily paid search so
organic search we want to hone in on
some keywords so let's just use one of
the examples that Google's given us here
mail delivery so we're going to just
type in mail delivery and get some
results so notice I can enter a domain
as a filter and so in other words hey I
could say look hone in on keywords
related to this website if I want to to
but I'm asking Google hey just give me
something closely related to mail
delivery cuz that's my business so I'm
going to click click get results notice
I can add another key to if I wanted to
but I'm just going to stick with one
keyword but there are certainly other
keywords that I can certainly hone in on
if mail delivery is my business and so
let's just tone in on that one keyword
mail delivery we want to be found
organically for that keyword so what
Google Keyword Planner does is not only
give us the keyword and other keywords
relevant to that but it gives gives us
the average monthly search volumes and
this is an average over the course of
the last 12 months and notice here I get
a column for competition so I'm able to
see whether that's a very competitive
keyword or not and then just to give you
an extra Edge when you're choosing
keywords you can get a sense of what the
keyword May cost if you wanted to bid on
that for paid search so for mail
delivery I can see it's any where
between
$746 and at the top of the page high
range
$16.61 so that should alert me to the
fact that hey if I'm going to try and
optimize for this keyword I know it's
competitive because not only Google is
telling me it's competitive by telling
me high competition but I know that the
cost per click seems a little bit high
and what is a little bit High well you
know I can see some other keywords here
that you know a dollar to $3 okay I can
see some other ones that are even lower
than the $7 they're suggesting so that's
a indication that the keyword is highly
competitive so the idea here using
Google's Keyword Planner is one we want
to get an idea of what other keywords
are out there that are relevant so it
helps stimulate some ideas for relevancy
two we can get an average monthly search
volum so we want to know on average over
the past 12 months how many search
queries I can expect from this key
keyword and then three I can get a sense
of the competition how competitive is
this keyword so if I try to optimize for
this keyword and I want to rank for it
organically is it competitive if it's
competitive then it's probably going to
take me a bit longer to be found for
this keyword on page one of Google so
that's the whole idea behind Google's
Keyword Planner and note that you could
change some of the settings here so if
you want to choose a different language
okay can hone in on a longer or shorter
period of time you can even choose a
specific location so I chose texes I can
certainly choose the entire United
States to get a sense of what the volume
would be for the total us so you have
settings that you can change and
manipulate to get you the data you need
to choose keywords so that's the whole
idea behind Google's Keyword Planner
toine relevant keywords high volume low
competition now Al alternatively I can
certainly use another tool to find
keywords so I have a Moz account so I
logged in MZ and MZ has a tool called
keyword Explorer so if I use that same
keyword I used in Google's keyword plan
or mail delivery I'm going to ask MZ to
give me some data on that keyword so
this is for the entire United States and
again I can change that if I wanted to
okay so I can hone in on a specific
country or different country so what m
is telling me hey for this keyword in
the entire United States I'm looking at
anywhere from
115,000 to 30,000 on monthly volume now
what M does is they give you a
difficulty score so a difficulty score
is a score between 1 and 100 and so I
can see this is pretty much right down
the middle in terms of difficulty okay
so if it's zero it's an easy keyword if
it's if it's 100 it's very difficult and
then that means you have a lot of
competitors who are optimizing for this
keyword that are ranking for this
keyword and so MZ gives us the volume
they give us the competition and they
just like Google's Keyword Planner gives
us some other keywords that we can
potentially hone in on so here I could
see keyword delivery plans delivery
services Etc so I can see a lot more
suggestions than what's listed here so
mods delivers a bunch of other analysis
uh related to the keyword you know they
also give you some good keyword
suggestions so Moz is a good alternative
tool and we'll be coming back to Moz
related to SEO for some other of its
features but for now if you don't want
to necessarily use Google's Keyword
Planner because maybe you're not running
Google ads you can always use Moz now
remember Moz has basically a freemium
version meaning you can sign up for a
free account and you can sign up for a
free account as a test trial and you
could test it for period of days and
leverage its tools during that free
trial to get a better sense of how these
tools work so we want to be able to use
mods we want to be able to use Google's
Keyword Planner not only to search for
all those relevant keywords available to
you but we want to be able to choose
keywords with high volume and low
difficulty low competition we also want
to select primary and second keywords
wisely so remember when you optimize
you're optimizing a page for more than
one keyword so you want to be able to
have a nice portfolio of diverse
relevant keywords with high search
volume and low difficulty and then you
want to be able to identify those
keywords that your competitors are
ranking for so Moz gives you that
information and so we want to be able to
leverage the tools available to us to
choose the right keywords so if you need
any more information on this we got a
nice web inar on keyword research for
SEO so take a look at that video on
YouTube uh to get more specific details
about using SEO tools for keyword
research and all about keyword research
in general for SEO so let's talk about
some other reasons under SEO why we
would use some of these tools available
to us well we want to be able to
understand the search engines and how
they crawl and index our site okay we
also want to check the correct format of
the S map and we want to monitor
backlinks okay we also want to analyze
linking to our web page okay which ones
are good which ones are not good okay we
also want to perform some competitor
analysis so these are some of the
reasons why other than keyword research
why would would use some of these SEO
tools so we have tools available to us
Majestic HRS again Ms let's take a look
look at Google search console and I want
to hone in on Google search console
because it is free and it's a must if
you're going to work on SEO you need to
be working in Google search console and
so the whole key behind Google search
console is you have a website and you
need to get that site verified once it's
verified once Google can recognize that
you are associated with this website
then you're going to be able to see some
important information so here I'm
looking at a website and what am I
looking at I'm looking at something
called coverage under index so what does
coverage mean well going back to what we
just said we want to be able to
understand how Google's crawling and
indexing our pages and so what Google
does is through this platform search
console is they're letting us know once
they go to our website and start
crawling it and they pull these Pages
back to their server server they're
letting us know if we actually have any
issues so here I could see I have some
issues with 112 pages and some of those
issues are listed down here so there
could be a crawl issue a 44 you know
redirect okay so you could see there's
some five unique issues across 112 pages
so here I can see submitted URL marked
no index there's 100 of those pages we
have some redirect errors there's seven
pages that you know fall victim to this
error and so we can really hone in um
what the ER is and address the error
okay so if Google's telling us hey this
is an issue and you want that page index
by Google then we should probably
address the error and so that's the
great thing here about going into Google
search console is you can under index go
to coverage and get a sense of what
Google's indexing and what they're non
indexing so these are the errors I can
see they've certainly were able to crawl
and index
9,5 Pages uh they were able to crawl
okay and they excluded
54,000 plus pages and then we also have
some pages with some warnings so this is
kind of an overview of what Google Sees
when they crawl our site so when they
say crawl they're coming to our site
they're following links on the site and
every link they follow follow they're
either going to index that page or
they're going to report to you an error
or an issue that they found if we want
these Pages index we need to address the
issues the errors and so that's the
beauty of this report here is Google is
telling us firsthand what the issues are
so we also want to take a look at the
sitemap so you have an opportunity to
submit a sitemap and a sitemap is just a
formatted file that includes all your
website URLs and so you're going to have
this file sitting in your root directory
and you're probably going to call it or
should call it sitemap.xml XML being the
format so once you have this file you're
just going to let Google know that that
file exists so you're going to enter in
the sitemap URL so if it's in the root
directory all you're going to do is type
in sitemap.xml and click submit so once
you've done it just like this side is
done what Google's going to do is say
hey look we see you've submitted this
and we last read it a couple days ago
and we could see that we discovered
1,419 URLs so I can go back under
coverage and I can see some of the
issues that they found but if I go back
under sitemaps I can see that these are
the URLs they discovered via the sit map
and so the whole point of a sitemap is
we want to be able to get and push the
URLs to Google not have Google come to
our site and discover them so this is a
quicker faster more efficient way to
communicate with Google all the URLs
that you have on your site that you want
Google to index and so that's the beauty
of search console now while we're in
search console we might as well take a
look at some of the other features it
has and so one of the most important
features under search console is this
mobile usability report so Google is a
staunch believer in mobile first so
nowadays most people start and finish a
lot of their searches a lot of their
behavior on mobile so they begin it on
mobile and they may end it on mobile so
if they don't end it on mobile then you
know perhaps they'll go into a store or
perhaps they'll go via desktop but
Google is a staunch believer and
definitely a lot of what's going on
today starts with mobile so they want
you to understand how your site fares
Via Mobile and when I say fares Via
Mobile is it mobile friendly is it
responsive is it loading quick enough
you know is it formatted to Google
standards and so if there are any issues
Google's going to let you know what
those issues are so here I could see
Google's recognized 206 pages with four
different issues okay so here I can see
what those issues are just like the
coverage issues we can see specific
spefically what they are and so here I
can see for 206 Pages text too small to
read click elements too close together
the viewport not set to device width and
then content wider than the screen so
there's 10 pages that fit under this
eror and if I actually click on it the
error I can see what those 10 pages are
and so when we're done we can actually
when we address the issues we can
actually have Google validate whether
the fix has been made so you can
definitely use this as a means of
communicating directly with Google
telling Google look I see what the
issues are I'm going to fix them and
then I want you to validate them okay so
this is important because if you can
communicate with Google and let them
know hey we do recognize the errors we
are fixing the errors please validate
them you know it's going to draw
Google's attention Google's going to
validate them and get these Pages index
quicker um so if you ignore the issues
and the errors especially for mobile
then you stand the chance of your pages
not getting index so the mobile
usability report to me is an important
report because we want to better
understand whether Google's picking up
issues on mobile and if they are we want
to address them get Google valid them so
Google can index them quicker now
there's another report that is of
interest to you or may be of interest to
you in Google search console and that's
the links report so the links report in
Google search conso tells us what pages
have the most links okay so here we can
see the homepage has 26,000 plus links
if we hone in on interior Pages we can
see the links to those pages okay so we
can get a sense of what are the top link
pages from external links meaning links
on other websites pointing to these
pages I can also see internal links so
Google's recognizing links from within
my website from one page to another
another so external links internal links
both factors for SEO when ranking so
then I can see top linking sites what
sites are linking to my site and then I
can see top linking text so Google
search console is giving me kind of an
overview of what my linking structure
looks like okay so externally I want
links from other websites pointing to
various pages on my site and I certainly
want my pages linking to one another on
my site and so I'd be able to better
understand what that structure looks
like using Google search consoles links
report okay there's one more report that
I think's of interest in Google search
console and that's the performance
report so the performance report is a
report that actually you can link up
with Google analytics so you could see
the same report in analytics if you're
able to link up Google search console
with analytics and you should be able to
do that all you need to do is make make
sure you use the same email address that
you use for analytics and search console
so it needs to be the same email address
you could certainly link up the two and
have this data imported into Google
analytics so what is this data that
we're talking about well it's called
performance so what we can actually see
is the queries the actual queries people
are typing in to Google so when they're
typing them into Google we can actually
see how many impressions the keyword
queries received and how many clicks the
keyword queries received and then I can
see click the rate and average position
okay so here I can see for this
particular keyword on the first line I
could see over the course of the last 3
months it received
29,285 Impressions so what does that
mean that means this keyword was used at
Le or typed in as a query at least that
many times and that's how many times my
listing appeared in the Google search
results Pages based on this particular
query and so as a result of somebody
typing in this query 209,000 plus times
this site received 120,000 plus clicks
so to get a sense of the click through
rate all you would need to do and Google
can obviously do this for you is you
would simply just divide the
29,029 into the
12,397 okay so that's really going to
give you that's going to give you your
click the rate and the click theough
rate in this case is 57% so over half of
the clicks occur when this listing
appears for this keyword okay so we can
get a sense of the click the rate for
each one okay and you could simply just
use the filtering here now we can also
see average position okay so we could
see a little bit more than that too we
can go from queries to Pages we can go
from pages to countries so we get a
sense of how many Impressions and clicks
I'm receiving by country and importantly
we can see by device so here I can see a
majority of the people who conduct a
search related to my website primarily
do it on desktop now I mentioned the
beauty of the Google search console
performance report is that you can link
it up to Google analytics and when you
do that all you need to do then is go to
acquisition Google search console and
then from there you could choose landing
pages countries devices or queries so I
can see the same data that I see in
search console but this time I'm looking
at it in Google analytics and so here I
can see what my search queries are my
clicks my Impressions my click theate
buy search query and then the average
position so that's the great thing about
that performance report is that when I
link up Google search console with
analytics I'm able to see that data in
analytics so that's an added bonus so to
speak now let's talk about some of
reasons why we are going to use these
SEO tools available to us and so we
already listed a number of different
reasons ranging from s maps to keyword
research but we also want to hone in on
you know what domains are driving links
to our site so I showed you an ex
example in search console we also want
to hey maybe identify and disavow poor
back links so search console is a great
tool for that because if we don't want
to be associated with a particular
website we can certainly disavow that
link we could track a number of follow
and no follow links okay we could track
our website's rankings we can measure
click through rates and Impressions just
as we did with search console we could
track keyword ranking for desk Des toop
mobile cross locations just as we just
did with the search console performance
report we can identify top performing
gaining and losing keywords again the
performance report so we could certainly
look at the Google search console report
but if you have a platform like MZ you
can certainly also look at a lot of that
data available so for example rankings
so if you have a Moz account we can
certainly go into rankings okay and we
can see for the keywords that we've
chosen that we want optimize for we can
certainly see where they rank the great
thing about MZ is it's a great tool not
only for rankings and onpage
optimization but for off-page
optimization as well so if I go ahead
and take a look at a domain for example
I'm just going to type in this domain
I'm going to be able to get what they
call a domain Authority so a score out
of one and 100 I'm able to see how
authoritative my domain is and how
authoritative a domain is is based on
the quality of links pointing to it so
Moz gives me some good insights as to
how many linking domains how many
inbound links I have ranking keywords
and it goes into detail as well so here
if I click on the linking domains I'm
going to be actually able to see the
actual domains pointing to my site as an
external link and not only can I see the
domains I can actually see the domain
authority of those domains so if there's
a domain for example that doesn't have a
good domain Authority and the site
appears a bit scammy per se then we can
disavow that so I can certainly look at
all the domains that are linking to me
and then I can highlight the ones that
have for domain Authority what Moz even
takes it a step further they also give
me a Spam score so Moz is able to
measure how spammy a website is so if I
have a combination of say a low domain
Authority and a high spam score then I
probably want to disavow myself from
that site and so I can use this report
here you could see here as I keep going
down for example I could see this
particular website has a domain
authority of 26 and it has a Spam score
of 16% so not a good combination this
should alert me to the fact that hey
this particular site because it has so
many links pointing to me or it has at
least one link pointing to me that I
probably want to disavow myself because
it's probably hurting my own domain
Authority so that's the great thing
about this linking domains report is I'm
able to hone in on not only who's link
linking to me meaning domain but how
many linking domains does that domain
have what's the spam score that domain
what's the domain authority of that
domain and then I can get into a little
bit more detail and I actually see you
know all the links pointing to that
domain so it really goes into detail
about backlinks domain Authority spam
Etc everything you need to use in order
to measure off page SEO so that's the
great thing about m is they have not
only onpage SEO tools but off-page SEO
tools and mods is a premium so to speak
so here you could see if you just go to
mod.com free-- tools you'll be able to
use some of these tools available to you
not just for SEO but also for local SEO
as well so here you like some of these
tools you can start your free 30-day
trial so I use and lean on Mo a lot for
all that it has to offer from choosing
keywords to rankings report to checking
issues on my website to even checking
who's linking to me so this fits in the
mold with everything I need to do for
SEO so in addition to that keyword
research video you could certainly lean
on some other webinars that we've done
in the past on SEO so we've done a
webinar on SEO tools and we've also done
a webinar on SEO tips and tricks so if

with the actual language your audience
uses it ensures that your content
resonates with their queries attracting
a relevant audience interest in your
offerings essentially keyword research
is a strategic tool that not only boosts
search engine rankings but also
establishes a connection between your
content and specific terms your audience
employs making your online presence both
accessible and meaningful all right so
this was about what is keyword research
and why is it important now let's
understand how to do a keyword research
using chat GPT for that let's go to
google.com so as you can see we have
opened Google Now all we have to do is
to write first of all we'll write AI PM
AI PRM all right so AI PRM or AI PRM for
chat gbt you can type now now let's open
the first link we'll click on the first
link so this is basically an extension
it is a Marketplace of prompt say
provide you prompts that you don't have
to type the whole prompt they have
pre-made prompts that you can use all
right now we can click on this add to
Chrome button over here ADD
extension
right so as you can see this is a whole
new outlook of this chat gbt this is
aipm prompt extension so basically they
give you pre-made prompts as you can see
this you used SE optimized content
writer fully SE optimized article
including so there are numerous as we
can see 4 580 prompts so you can choose
accordingly whichever prompt you want
and you can also search over here and
this is topic activi sort by you can
also sort and prompts page you can
customize it according to yourself so as
you can see here is the topic uh we can
go to topic and we can select so we want
to basically do a keyword research we'll
go to SEO we'll click on SEO after that
in activity we can select this uh
keywords all right now as we can see
there are numerous prompts according to
what we have selected that YouTube SEO
keyword generator SEO optimize your
Google business profile Etc so we can
select as per our choice so what I have
figured out which is best is this one
keyword analysis I repeat keyword
analysis so as we can see find the table
of best keywords with search volume CPC
paid difficulty Su difficulty so for
those who don't know about uh CPC so uh
CPC or cost per click is a measure in
online advertising that represents the
amount you pay when someone clicks on
your ad it's essentially the cost of
each interaction with your advertisement
higher the CPC values often indicate
more competitive keywords or advertising
spaces and as you can see paid
difficulty is also written so paid
difficulty refers to how challenging it
is to compete for a particular keyword
in paid advertising a higher paid
difficulty score means that it might be
more expensive or competitive to bid for
that keyword in paid search campaigns so
now there is SE difficulty so SEO
difficulty basically is a measure of how
hard it is to rank organically for a
specific keyword in search engine
results a higher Su difficulty suggests
that it might be more challenging to
optimize your content to appear higher
in unpaid organic search results for
that keyword it takes into account
factors like competition and the
existing strength of other Pages ranking
for the same keyword so these are the
meanings of these things as we can see
so we have already clicked on this now
as you can see seed keyword that you
search for so let's say uh I'm searching
for cloud computing let's
say cloud computing and let's click on
this so as we can see they are creating
all these now let's explore keywords
related to cloud computing along with
the respective search volume all right
so as we can can see keyword these are
the keywords that we got and these are
the search volumes so we all know what
search volume is the number of searches
and the CPC as we already discussed what
is CPC again if somebody wants to know
about it CPC or cost per click is a
measure in online advertising that
represents the amount you pay when
someone clicks on your ad so these are
the amount you pay when someone clicks
on these ads all right so paid
difficulty again it refers to how
challenging it is to compete for a
particular keyword in paid advertising
so this is paid difficulty of each of
these keywords then SEO difficulty SEO
difficulty is a measure of how hard it
is to rank organically for a specific
keyword in search engine results so
these are the uh Su difficulty so we can
select accordingly and the table index
is a mix of 100 keywords including
longtail LSI so longtail keywords are
also there as you can see we'll discuss
longtail keywords also after this so
this is how you can do keyword research
using chat GPT we'll do one or two more
demos regarding this so let's do another
example so we are going to select
keyword analysis and then we'll have to
put seed keyword remember to select SEO
first of all here we can see SEO and
then in activity you have to select
keywords because we are doing the
keyword research all right now after
selecting this keyword analysis we want
basic we basically want all these things
like search volume CPC PID ASO
difficulty so that we can choose the
right keywords accordingly so let's see
here we have to put the seed keyword so
let's say the seed key is let's say
devops all right let's click on
this so they are giving us the keywords
a lot of keywords they usually give
let's explore the keyword analysis for
devops so as you can see high search
volume very high search volume high so
these search volumes regarding these
keywords are shown and the CPC is also
showing and paid difficulty SEO
difficulty as well so we basically want
the SEO difficulty is to minimum like
minimum or like medium so we can search
or extract those keywords accordingly so
they have written this table includes a
mix of 100 relevant longtail keywords
LSI keywords and FAQ related to devops
it provides insights into search volume
CPC cost per click PID difficulty and
SEO difficulty to help optimize your
content and reach the target audience
effectively so through this you can
select these keywords and I think if
you'll click on continue it'll keep on
going for more keywords so as you can
see longtail keywords now it is showing
so these are LSI keywords so we will
discuss these uh terms long tail
longtail keywords LSI keywords after
some time later in this I repeat later
in this video so this is how you can
simply do a keyword research using chat
GPT again this keyword research is
completely free you have you don't have
to pay a single Buck regarding this now
let's try another method of doing a
keyword research for that all we have to
do is to go to Google and we'll
type
keywords
everywhere all right so here's the first
link let's click on this this is another
extension install for Chrome we'll click
on install for Chrome now let it open
and now we can click on add to Chrome to
just add this extension in our Chrome
browser as you can see ADD extension so
I think it is added now now all we have
to do is to pin this one all right so
now uh let's go to chat GPT or let's
open a new
one so as you can see this is keywords
everywhere icon please continue as you
can see clarify explain rewrite so for
that to use this extensions powers or
for functionality all we have to do is
to click on this template button all
right now here the thing is first of all
we'll select choose a category similarly
that we have done previously choose a
category so as you can see copyrighting
marketing SEO social media productivity
professionals we'll select SEO because
we want to do keyword research then in
subcategory we can select keyword
research and because we want to do
keyword research then there's a template
so here we can see first is keyword
strategy so you can click on keyword
strategy if you want to do basically a
strategize the keyword so basically I'll
tell you what keyword strategy is
keyword strategy involves planning like
how to use specific words or phrases in
your content to achieve specific goals
like it's about selecting and targeting
keywords that align with your overall
objectives whether it's to boost website
traffic increase conversions or enhance
your online visibility then there is get
search intent for keywords so tell I
repeat so it itself tells what it is
like intent understanding search intent
for keywords means grasping the reason
behind someone online search it involves
figuring out what a person is looking
for when they type a particular keyword
into a search engine aligning your
content with users intent ensures that
your information meets their needs
improving the relevance of your content
then here is related keyword generator
so a related keyword generator is a term
or phrase closely connected to the main
keyword you targeting including related
keywords in your content helps search
engines understand the content and
relevance of your page it's a way to
capture a broader range of search
queries related to your main topic then
there is longtail gyw word so basically
a longtail gyw word is a more specific
and detailed phrase usually consisting
of three or more words while these
phrases may have lower search volumes
individually they often attract a more
targeted audience longtail keywords can
be valuable for Niche topics
are generally easier to rank for than
broader more competitive terms so these
are all these things so let's say first
of all I want to search for related
keyword generator and so first of all as
you can see category SEO subcategory
keyword research templates select
accordingly whichever you want I've
explained all these related keyword
generator I want basically when we'll
select related keyword generator this
will come up language is English we want
in English only here is the seed keyword
we'll have to write right this is total
keywords how many keywords do we want we
can select accordingly basically I want
40 itself so this is a prompt template
that automatically gets created whenever
you select a particular template so
let's say if I want to select keyword
strategy so it will create itself a
different kind of prompt so if I'll
select long tail then a different kind
of prompt will be generated so this is a
self-made itself it will create a prompt
all you have to do is to write a seed
keyword over here so let's say as I said
I want a related keyword generator and
let's type here
devops all right so total keywords I
want 40 itself I'll click on execute
template all right so these are the 40
keywords that we wanted so related
keyword generator continues integration
infrastructure as code Dockers
kubernetes shenkin and they're also
telling me the search intent in
informational so all of these keywords
are informational so firstly they'll
create a table regarding these keywords
after that they will basically list of
same keywords separated by commas as we
can see same keywords are separated by
commas so that you can easily use them
wherever you want all right so this we
have selected for the what we call
Related keyword generator now let's
select another one let's click on
template again we'll go to related or
let's say longtail keyword generator now
we'll put devops

see I think we'll have to select another
new chat we'll have to create all right

keyword generator devops and let's say

history of Google ads so born out of the
digital revolution in the late 1990s
early 2000s Google ads formerly known by
the way as Google AdWords traces it
Roots back to early 2000s it was

competitive leral landscape yeah the
journey goes beyond the basics so we're

groundwork and how and look at how you
register your business on the Google ads
platform so let's kick off our journey
by registering your business on the
Google ads platform so simply go to
Google or to ads. goole.com log in with
your Google account and initiate a
process of connecting your business with
this extensive online audience but
before that let me quickly show you this
ads. goole.com page it gives you lots of

goole.com and you get to this website
which is kind of the entrance to Google
ads and on this website you find lots of
information about the Google ads
platform form you even see here on the
top right that they give you a foucher
for £400 in the UK yeah where you can if
you spend 400 on uh on Advertising so
you'll see they do that across the world
so you should be able to get those uh
those ad vouches as well so it gives you
lots of suggestions on the goals that
you can achieve the power of Google
advertising for your business and it
gives you some case studies as well and
what I really like about the Google ads
program that you can actually get freeof
charge personalized support yep and by
scheduling a meet meeting with a Google
ads expert and I would highly um sort of
uh recommend you use that surface
because they can really help you with
setting up your first Google ads
campaign so let's go into this system we
can click Start now yeah or you can sign
in if you have an existing account so if
you click Start now it'll probably
immediately log in to my existing
account but what it will do it will
actually give you an overview of the
Google ads accounts that you already
have yeah or you can create a new Google
ads account so this step forms the
backbone for your your online identity
and it gets you with an an seamless
integration between your business and
the Google ads um environment as it were
so very practical steps to get you
started on the Google ads platform
effectively so let's go on to create a
new Google ads
account so create a new account and here
is it goes into the process of creating
a new Google ads account so you need to
add business information you can then go
straight into creating your ad and set
up your budget now you can case go
straight into your first campaign and in
the process you will actually fill in
your data to sign up but what I advise
you do here is to skip the campaign
creation that you're not ready and then
you will go in a proper setup for your
Google
ads so there's different elements that
you can do here so you give your billing
country you give your time zone your
currency if you want personalized
campaign guidance I would certainly
advise you take that as I mentioned
earlier yeah you fill that data in and
then you click submit and then yes to
continue I'll I'll select no for now so
click submit and then you're basically
all done and then uh The Next Step
what's going to happen is actually you
need to go through the verification
process now a few more steps here the
details are very important if you go
through the entire process like your
business name your physical location
your contact information it's not about
getting the data but it's about crafting
your digital presence
yeah so it goes beyond checkboxes make
sure that you add every step yeah and
that you fill in every step in the
process okay so the next step is that
you will go through the verification
process when you've done that process it
is very important that you are going to
verify your account so how do you verify
your account you go back to your main
Google ads dashboard and I will explain
this dashboard a little later and you
click here on the billing and here you
see Advertiser
verification yes so here is where you go
into
verification
to make sure that Google recognizes your
account and understands that you are the
actual business owner of this account so
that gives you an extra level of
security and integrity on your Google
ads account and once you verify it yes
so B Google has then reviewed your
business details and you can ensure your
accuracy but it can also give you a good
foundation for this for your advertising
experience so it's more than Security
checks it's about making sure that your
data is correct and you have a solid

makes it helps you to make sure that
your advertising efforts are not just
active but that they are effectively
aligned with your overal business
goals okay now a very important part is
the toolbox that you get in here yeah so
in the toolbox you get information to
plan your campaigns like a Keyword
Planner a performance planner a reach
planner there is your shared Library
where you get access to your audience
manager your exclusion lists your brand
lists yeah the content the Google tag um
that you can get here we'll talk about
it later troubleshooting
actions more info about budgets and
bidding so a lot of e extra additional
aspects you can get here in your uh your
toolbox that you will definitely need in
executing your campaign and uh a number
of these tools we will discuss in our
demo it's very important that you master
the tools that you have here because
they will make the execution of your
campaigns and planning them a lot easier
if you use these tools in setting up
your campaign it's also very important
to look at the structure of your Google
ads and the standard structure of a
Google ads campaign is to in in three
fold there is the campaign level there
is the ad group and within the ad group
sits the um C the ads and the ads they
inherit a setting of the ad group and
the ad group the inherit the setting of
The campaigns on campaign level you talk
about the objectives of your campaign
you look at the um the the bidding
strategy that you have for your campaign
in the the price that you the budget
that you want to assign in the ad groups
you can look at your keywords and you
can specify your ads as well so very
important that you think about that
structure and that will really help you
into organizing your campaign in a
structured
manner okay having gone through this
dashboard now let's jump into the Google
ads Basics and create a campaign and
picking the right keywords so to create
a campaign you just go to the campaigns
stab and you click here the plus to
start or I can click here on the
campaign stab I'm getting an overview of
my
campaigns and um but in this case I just
click on the campaign tab on the plus
button and that will take me to the sort
of the starting screen of my um Google
ad setup so I can decide my campaign
goal I can set a budget and I can pick a
bidding strategy so this is the
beginning of your ad game here you state
what you want do you want more clicks do
you want leads do you want brand to work
Fess how much do you want to spend what
is your bidding strategy do you want to
set it or do you want Google to handle
it yeah do you want more clicks more
conversions and when you start this
process you're on the way to create your
first ads plan so here you
see
the different types of campaign
objectives that you can select and each
objective will kind of
pre-select the digital narrative within
Google ads so they serve different
purposes whether it is driving sales or
driving website traffic um or whether it
is capturing leads whether it is
promoting your app whether it is a local
store visit whether it is sales or a
product and brand consideration ation or
you can also decide to create a campaign
without selecting any of these and that
is for the more experienced people who
can who know exactly what to specify but
if you click one of these then Google
will automatically prepopulate kind of
the settings for you in the uh in the
Google ads screens that will follow so
aligning these types with your goals is
very important and they ensure that you
get a very impactful digital marketing
approach to your customers so let's
click on one of them yes so let's click
for instance on the uh we want website
traffic so here you see what type of
conversions that you want yes so that
could be page views that could submit
lead forms it could subscribe so you can
specify these conversions and you just
click here you click on continue and
here you select the campaign sort of
type that you want to select want to to
to run do you want a search campaign do
you want the display campaign do you
want Google to sort of Select it for you
yeah do you want a shopping campaign a
video campaign or do you want a demand
gen where you run ads on Youtube Gmail
and various other channels so let's say
we're going to create a um let's start
with a search campaign yeah so you put
in your website your website address
which in my case would be this website
you're going to give your campaign a
name and you click continue I'm going to
start a new campaign and here it's very
important that you specify the bidding
strategy that you set as you know Google
ADS works with an auction system you put
in a bid for when what you will pay uh
when people click on your ads and then
Google in the auction when people have
actually put in one of your keywords
Google will then use different methods
for making sure that the um the the best
bit in combination of various other
factors wins as it were and shows up at
the top of the uh the advertising
listings on Google ads now the the
highest bidder doesn't necessarily be at
automatically be at the the number one
spot there is also a quality score of
your ad that is impacting whether or not
you would show at the top so your
financial uh core rest on the budget and
the bidding strategy so determine your
daily budget yeah align it with your
advertising objectives and uh it's very
important how you want to set this do
you want to run it for conversions do
you want to run it for clicks yep so you
can set a maximum cost per click or you
can let Google set that automatically
for you yep and when you're happy with
how you set it you click next
and then you specify where you want to
show your
ads yep so here you see you can specify
the for the Google search campaign you
can specify the search Network you can
also show search ads on the Display
Network you can look at the network the
locations the languages you can specify
specific audiences or you can also do
some keyword matching for your search
campaigns there's various location
options they work very powerful yeah so
you can spe specify by language you can
select audience segments so for instance
I would just do an advertisement on a
specific
sector so I can say give me just people
that are interested in
travel and they will then be added to uh
they will then be targeted with your
your ad
yep and then here you're going to
specify your uh the type of keyword
match that you want
so uh so that is very important and as
you can see in the Google search ads the
keywords are very important but I'll
come back to that in a minute what I
first want to do is go through the more
settings where you will sort of open up
additional functionality that will make
you use um give you a more advanced use
of the Google ads like how do you want
to rotate your ads is there a start and
an end date for your campaign do you
have a specific ad schedule do you have
campaign URL options that is where you
want to um to track your campaigns or
Are there specific brand restrictions
that you do not want to associate with
your ad and the placement of your ads so
particularly on the ad schedule my
recommendation would be to select all
day when you start your ads let Google
decide what is the best timings for your
ads that gives the best response what
you will see when you set up your ads
that you set up multiple ads and Google
will mix and match the ads and will
select the best combination of the ads
that will give you you the best
performance and will also select the
best timings so the first couple of days
that your advertising campaign is
running Google will be in what we say
learning mode and it will do all the
tests it will run the various options of
your ads and it will sort of slowly
calibrate your ad campaign to the best
format the best settings and the best
structure so this type of control
yeah is not about just Reaching Your
Right audience but it also does it at
the most opportune moment the best times
so it maximizes the effectiveness of
your uh your ads so very important part
of this is your keywords as I just
mentioned so for search campaigns here
is where you can specify your keywords
so what you can do you can get
suggestions from Google by entering your
website address and then Google will and
will sort of select the best keywords
for you and you can use those for your
search ads which means that every time
somebody types in any of these keywords
your ad will show to the to those people
depending on your bidding strategy or
you can add your own keywords based on
your keyword research and the tool that
I showed you earlier the Google Keyword
Planner is a fantastic tool that can
help you in building those um those
those keyword lists for you now I'm not
going to go into the details here of
keyword uh research that may be the
topic for a future uh campaign so it's
very important that you align your
keywords with your business and that the
keywords resonate
with your target audience and make sure
that you use the key Google Keyword
Planner to find the right keywords or
any other tools that uh that are
available in the market the keyword is
fundamental for your search campaign
it's not about what you say in your ad
but it is also how do those keywords
resonate with your
audience good that con includes the
basic setup of your ads on a campaign
level and on an ad group
level we're now going to look at our
next demo where we're going to look at
targeting and also where we're going to
look at how to create an
ad so as we shift Focus the spotlight
turns now to defining and refining your
target
audience and particularly this will be
important when you set up a display
campaign and when you go into the
campaign settings for the display and
you follow the menu down here you get to
the targeting option and that is the
first place where you can specify your
the which people you target with your
display ads so this is where you can
identify demographics interests and
behaviors that resonate with your brand
so this ensures if you set that that
your ads are displayed to those people
that are most likely to engage with your
brand so navigating through this
audience setting is not about casting a
wiet it is about Precision about
reaching the right people at the right
time so let's click on the targeting and
you see here that you hone in on various
areas you can hone in on audience
segments demographics keywords topics
and placement and here while you're
going through these targeting options
you can keep track of your um estimated
number of Impressions and your estimated
performance for your ads so exploring
this array of audio Target options
audience targeting options is about
tailoring your message to different
personalities different audiences so
look at audience
segments that is where you can select
audiences who are particularly
interested in travel or lifestyle and
hobbies and there is literally hundreds
of segments that people can um can
select yeah you can search for any
segment you can let's say here let's do
do um train
enthusiasts just taking a random topic
yeah let's see what comes up and here is
train
information train hobby traveling by
train um so everything to do with trains
that you can pick here you can even
probably take miniature trains so you
can Target those people very
specifically that ensures that your ad
is not visible but also relevant to
specific segments of your target
audience so that is through the audience
segments and again if you pick one so
say um train information then here you
see how your weekly estimates are um are
changing yeah so you can SC by selecting
you put them in your Target and then you
see how your um advertising campaign is
likely to perform so let's stay away
from the train let's go to um Adventure
travel for instance and now you get all
those people that are interested in
adventure
vacations activity
holidays Wildlife trips Etc and again
you see how your performance is changing
so that is the audience segments we then
going go to the next level that is
demographics we're targeting male let's
say um
between 25 and 44 years with a slightly
higher higher household income let's say
the top um 21 so we're going for the the
top uh
tier and again your estimates are being
adjusted and then you can go to the next
one you can add targeting so you can
Target keywords so this is for instance
I am targeting those people that have a
specific interest in Kilimanjaro for
instance and um ke Lian jaro yep and I
can add that as a keyword if I want and
Morocco and you see how my weekly
estimates are becoming more and more
specific I can add keyword ideas through
for my website as well so let's say that
is done and then we can go to the the
final uh targeting which was by topics
yeah or you can even Target by
placements so if we want Adventure
magazines yeah so Adventure magazines
you can can then select those magazines
or those online Publications where your
ads will show so you can ask by default
ask Google to select this for you but if
you're very experienced in your industry
you know specific magazines where you
want to place your ad then very likely
you will find them in the list here it
takes a little while to go through this
list of thousands if not hundreds of
thousands of online Publications but
then you can really Target is very
specific by magazine while it is doing
this let's go to the optimized targeting
which is on which means Google will
actually help you get more viewable
Impressions yeah find people beyond your
targeting signals so that is what Google
will help you to F tune your um uh your
targeting and um give you even better
results for your campaign yes so
targeted the adventure channnel
adventure magazine so here are 253
websites there are YouTube channels that
you can Target YouTube videos apps and
app categories where your ad can show so
this is a very good section where you
can make your ads reach the right people
so that is one area where you can
feature
[Music]
um where you can be very specific in the
targeting of your ad that is within the
display campaign
settings you can also Target People
based on
behavior and one very important behavior
is um what they have done on your
website in the
past yeah and that is what we're going
to look at next as part of this audience
uh segmentation and audience targeting
we're going to look at how can I
leverage activities from people behavior
of people for instance visiting my
website or buying a product how can I
how can I capitalize on those um on
those people and maybe put them in a
separate audience that I can then Target
with my ads this is what we call
retargeting and I can Target people with
an ad once they fited my website for a
particular product P page for instance
and I'm sure you've experienced that
yourself that you were visiting an ad
and that you that you were visiting a
product on a website and then you put a
product in the basket but you decide not
to buy that product and then the next
time you go on Facebook or on YouTube
you actually see a product for that ad
so that is the next section that we will
will be looking
at a new feature in Google ads are
conversion
goals conversion goals help you organize
your conversion actions so that you can
more move more easily towards achieving
your advertising objectives so actions
that you want your customers to take or
conversion actions are grouped together
based on related categories to form
these conversion goals
so how do you get there you go here to
goals you click on
conversions and here you have a summary
of your conversion goals for example the
purchase conversion or the Subscribe
conversion goal would automatically
contain all conversion actions from
people to subscribe to a particular form
and this simplifies your conversion
management and it improves your campaign
performance so very powerful new aspect
within Google ads to manage your
conversions in one central place so how
do you set a pay conversion you set it
up here in the new conversion
action so you can set up a conversion
action for your website for your apps or
for phone calls or you can import data
from Google or from Salesforce or other
um tools but the most important one
again is getting conversion tracking set
up for your website so when you click on
that you can then put in your website
domain you can click
scan and it will then scan the website
if it's already set up to measure
conversions which basically means have
you already set up conversion tags on
your
website so Google ads can track those
web pages so you can it has been set up
so you can actually create specific
conversion actions you can do that from
website events you can also create
conversion actions manually by using
specific code so if you use transaction
specific values transaction ideas yes so
then you can use this option but the
easiest one is to use the create
conversion action from website event so
you can actually accept suggestion or
for setting up a conversion goal you can
also add a conversion goal so you can
select a category for
instance um a subscribe the event type
could be a page load on this website and
then you just click
add the URL is required for that would
be the about about us yeah and then I
click add and then the the code has been
the conversion goal has been created I
click save and
continue and then it sets up this
conversion
action where of course I need to make
sure I set it up properly with a Google
tag through Google tag manager now this
section is not about teaching you how to
use Google tech manager we have a
separate video for that but I just want
to make you aware of the process of how
to do that you can also email the
instructions to your Web Master yep so
let's say if we want to email the
instruction then we'll just put in the
email address and then it's uh sent or
you can also set it up yourself and then
what you do is you get a piece of code
where you that you basically need to
copy and that you need to paste in the
Google tag manager so you can use the
Google tag manager that's where you use
this particular piece of code you can
also install manually and here is the
piece of code that you need to install
on every page of the
website so then Google can see that that
is a tag for those specifical specific
conversion goals that um Google that can
then start
tracking good you can test the
installation as well but I'll just want
to make you aware where you go to set
that
up okay so those are the conversion
goals in
Google the last topic of this
demo the last topic of this demo is ADD
placements and the network the ad
networks and the actual creation of ads
this is very important it is like
choosing the stage for your performance
and exploring the various options
including the Google search Network the
Display Network and YouTube is vital to
align your uh your ads with your
advertising of network your advertising
objectives so the
different add options that you have they
start with the Google search Network the
Google search networ nwor places your
ads in search engine results that gives
you visibility for your ads when users
actively search for related content the
next area is the Display Network that
showcases your ad across a multitude of
websites and apps thereby having a big
reach of your uh your ads YouTube as a
video platform offers a very extensive
advertising platform with lots of
advertising opportunities and different
um different versions of ads and
tailoring your approach to each
platform will amplify the effectiveness
of your ad strategy to make sure that
you get maximum impact on your ads now
let's go to the fun part of Google ads
and that is the actual creation of your
ads so we'll head to over to the ads we
go to the campaigns click a campaign
here is the campaign we're going to
first create a search ads which is let's
say for website
traffic we go to continue and here is
the search ad that we're going to create
We'll add our
website and we'll click
continue and we'll start a new campaign
and where we're going to is the keywords
and the ads so we have already set up
the keywords going now straight to the
actual ads and this is a very important
section where you are able to set up
your Google search ads they are based on
um
the a combination of headlines up to 15
and
descriptions up to
four and a number of extensions
like site links or call outs and
different other
extensions okay you can set that all up
and then Google will mix and Ma match
those different elements of your ads to
come up with the ad with the best
performance and what's really nice here
is they show you a preview of what the
ad will look like with the different
headlines and the different descriptions
and here you see your campaign
optimization score with the weekly
estimates of how many conversions and
how many what your weekly cost is here
you see your ad strength and here you
see at the moment it is poor because I
need to make the description more more
unique so you can get ideas and you'll
see that this area will become more and
more advanced and more and more driven
by artif icial intelligence in the
future yeah to make sure that you get
the best ads possible for your
market so again this is a short demo I'm
not going to go into every little detail
yeah but this is where you create your
search ads so that is the first
area the second area where you create
your ads is of course for the display
campaigns so if I go back to Google
Google
ads and I am going to create a new
campaign but now I'm going to create a
brand awareness campaign for display ads
again here I say riat far
russia. I click continue I'm going to go
start
new and here I can of course we've been
through all these settings remember the
campaign settings the budget and the
bidding and the target
and here we go to the
ads and here you can
specify the URL your business name you
can add up to 15 images so where you
upload an image let's say we're going to
use the image of this room and you see
here in different formats and we're
going to add this images as well so
we're going to click
save and then you can add a text you
could even add a video you can add a
headline and here you will see what the
ad will looks look
like now make sure that you have
switched off your ad blocker if you have
set up an ad blocker and because when
you have an ad blocker then this the the
the preview of the ad will not show so I
need to add the final URL I need to add
the http s for
this yep so here is the final URL with
the business name and now in a bit the
ad should show up we should have the
business name two images One headline so
we'll add um welcome to riat for
Russia and a
description book your
adventure holiday now
okay and then here you see how the ad
would look
like very simple very straightforward
but it is all about of course the
quality of the images the headlines that
you're using the description that you're
using but at least this gives you an
idea of what an ad looks like and how
you would create that within the display
um ad
category so here is a few tips
yes so uh add copy is very important
yeah relevant visuals and formulate
clear call to actions they are the
fundamental elements of your in of your
ads compelling ad copy is about Clarity
and enticement and about having a
concise message and be different so the
integration of the relevant visuals that
enhances the overall appeal
now calls to action I can't emphasize
enough and the uh they guide users on
the desired next steps and that will
drive
conversions so keep that in mind and

in your advertising behaviors remember
if you like this video click the like
button below and subscribe to our um our
Network so you get access to other
videos that we will be publishing in the
near future what social media marketing
actually means what is it yeah and we
got to put this in the context of the
definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the B basic concept has
not changed if you look at the
definition of marketing it's the
activity of creating
communicating delivering and exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your customers
so two very important aspects here there
is value and there is customer and that
is what we capture in the marketing
concept you put the customer at the core
of what you do yeah because when you do
that you automatically will look at what
value are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
marketing in that context then the
second part of the social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content they're
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the uh um the
currency of social media if you have
really good content that you can share
on the internet yeah using various
multip multiple social media channels
like Facebook like YouTube or like video
or like Instagram or blogging you name
it yeah people will engage with your
content and then when people start
engaging with your content they may come
back for more content that you supply
and they will then become part of your
community so Community is a very
important aspect of your social media
definition with really good content you
can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running
campaigns yeah and a campaign
makes it relevant for
businesses because when you run a
campaign you have a goal for your
campaign you have an objective you have
a start date you have an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that with a
customer at in the core of what you
do yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media
marketing is very basic it says the use
of social media to develop a company's
brand increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most important aspect
here here is that you need to have an
outcome you need to have a result which
is customer
related and that is where the sales
element comes in you do this to get the
customer to do something and in the end
that is buying your product or your
service yeah so social media marketing
is not the Tactical
combination of your social media
networks yeah to um to reach as many
people there needs to be a goal to it
and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your social media marketing so keep
that in mind everything you do with your
social media marketing in the end comes
down to reaching your goals or achieving
your objectives of developing your
company's brand increasing website
traffic or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is
data is intelligence
is
knowledge in the early days of marketing
the biggest problem has always been how
to measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and they write about me
in a newspaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a PR product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I Ran So in the early pre
internet days yeah we the only way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through Loyalty cards or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to relate that to
your marketing then the internet emerged
and all of a sudden I could track
traffic to my
website yeah I could see how many people
visit my website are these people that
visit my website for the first time are
they returning visitors what are the
most popular pages that they see how
long do they stay on my website and are
they actually buying my
products yeah so that was a major
advancement of marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure
engagement how many people are having
conversations with us I could even
measure sentiments are people positive
about my brand are they negative about
my Brands I could track the
effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the
effectiveness of my advertising
campaigns that I ran online so today's
reality is that we can measure
everything we can measure clicks we can
measure transactions we can measure
engagements we can measure return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people may respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running so it's a very
important aspect of your digital uh your
social media
marketing so as I mentioned earlier
social media is a completely new way for
businesses to engage with their
customers yeah you can no longer go
without it it's a new channel to Market
it is a new channel for engagement with
your customers it is a new channel to
learn it's a new channel to listen to
find out what's happening in the market
so it's now it's it's it's there in
every aspect of your business and not
only for the marketing department it's
there for the sales department it's
there for Logistics it's there for the
customer service department is there for
the HR department using social media for
your recruitment is a very important
element of social media marketing yes so
keep that in mind that social media
marketing
is no not a fat it is there and it's
there to stay and it touches every
aspect of your
business now to summarize this there are
three areas where social media has
changed the way businesses operate first
of all there is the connection social
media is a new way to connect with your
stakeholders yeah and stakeholders in
this case can be customers they can be
prospects influencers your own employees
using social media for
internal and not only on a local scale
this happens nowadays on a global scale
the internet allows you to sell locally
to a global audience if you want to yeah
so you can you
can cover the world you can Target
specific audiences wherever they are so
the connection aspect the targeting
aspect yeah the the market where you
want to sell your product is opened up
through social media and that is a big
benefit for business the second area
where social media has changed
businesses fundamentally is in the
interaction side it's not just about
connecting with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their term
on their preferred platform and remember
in social media land the customer is in
the driving seat if you're not
interacting with them on their terms
you're going to miss the train it's not
about you don't liking Facebook or
LinkedIn yeah as long as your customers
are on Facebook you better be on
Facebook otherwise you're going to miss
the boat
yeah because if you don't interact with
them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
with
them yep so it's the connection aspect
it's the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this yeah what we talked about
can be done and you can track every
aspect of your social media marketing at
a customer level and it gives you the
key performance indicators like
conversion ratios sales ratios customer
satisfaction ratios and ultimately
return on
investment and there are tools nowaday
that let you manage and track all these
areas in one conglomerated system yeah
HubSpot is for instance a tool that you
can use for that and they integrate all
your marketing and customer data and
campaigns in one system that um you can
use for
that all right so without further Ado
let's start with the first strategy
which is Select platform before diving
into the diverse landscape of social
media it's crucial to carefully consider
your business schools target audience
and the content strategy choosing the
right social media platforms can
significantly impact your Brand's online
presence and overall success Begin by
utilizing single platform and as you
gain Proficiency in managing campaigns
gradually expand to incorporate
additional platforms so first we can say
Facebook as the most popular social
media platform Facebook remains a smart
choice for almost any business it allows
you to boost brand awareness gain
followers generate leads and engage with
their audience the next we have is
Instagram so Instagram known for its
visual appeal Instagram is excellent for
showcasing products lifestyle content
and behind the scenes glimpses

businesses in Fashion Beauty travel and
lifestyle all right then there is
Twitter so with its real time updates

is essential it's a professional
networking platform where you can
connect with industry peers share
through leadership content and build
business relationships so it's a very
effective app all right now next is
YouTube video content continues to
dominate and YouTube is the goto
platform for sharing video tutorials
product demos and brand storytelling so
it is again one of the most important
tool all right now coming to the next
one which is Tik Tok especially popular
among younger audiences Tik Tok offers
short form video content and creative
challenges so once you have selected
your platform then you can proceed to
knowing your audience so understanding
your audience involves grasping what you
are trying to connect with and tailoring
your content accordingly for instance if
you're Target audiences techy
individuals incorporate content related
to the latest gadgets and Tech Trends

recipes and lifestyle tips would

groups it's like to speaking the Lang of
your audience whether it's through

offer identify gaps or weakness in their
strategy that you can capitalize on

audience interest but also encourages
them to return your subsequent episodes

anticipation it allows for a more
structured storytelling approach
fostering a deeper connection with your
audience explaining what the series is
about now share the purpose benefits and
what viewers can expect each post should
provide value educate entertain or
Inspire your audience use a mix of
formats images videos carousal or or

do fill out all the profile fill out all

keywords use relevant keywords in your
profile description for better
discoverability then there is hashtag
optimization research and use relevant

popular and Niche specific tags then
avoid overusing hashtags quality matters
more than quantity then time
optimization post when your audience is
most active use social media analytics
tools to identify optimal posting times
different platforms have varing PE CS so
you have to look into that so this was
about
optimization next strategy is create a
Content calendar so yeah developing a
Content calendar is a vital component of
an social media marketing strategy this
involves planning and scheduling your
content in advance ensuring a consistent
and organized approach to your online
presence a Content calendar helps in

track and evaluate your content efforts
regularly monitor the performance of
your campaigns by assigning audience

strategy is a dynamic approach to
engaging and content with your audience

social media marketing road map the
first thing is to identify a marketing
problem so guys identifying Market
problem is a foundational step in
devising an effective social media
marketing strategy it involves a
comprehensive evaluation of various
aspects that may hinder your business
growth addressing these issues
strategically can pave the way for
successful social media campaigns
firstly consider the challenge of
inadequate brand awareness and publicity
if you're target audience is not
familiar with your brand it's crucial to
focus efforts on increasingly visibility
through engaging content and targeted
campaigns next is the declining sales
from traditional Channel signals that
need shied in marketing approach Embrace
social media platforms to reach a wider
audience and explore new avenues for
sales if I talk about the third one a
decline in fresh leads also Demands a
reassessment of lead generation
strategies so that you have to utilize
social media expansive reach to attract
and convert potential customers if
Rising operating costs are affecting
profitability social media can offer
cost-effective Marketing Solutions
leveraging these platforms can optimize
resource allocation and enhance overall
efficiency customers defection due to
poor service also highlights the
importance of using social media as a
customer service tool address concerns
promptly and showcase positive
experiences to build loyalty lastly if
your content isn't generating desired
engagement Define your strategy analyze
audience preferences experiment with
content formats and encourage
interaction to increase shares and
engagement by pinpointing these
challenges you can tailor your social
media efforts to address specific needs
ensuring a more targeted and impactful
marketing strategy now let us move on to
our next one which is setting up social
media marketing objectives or goals in
the realm of social media marketing
setting clear goals go defining
objectives and establishing measurable
metrics are crucial components of a
strategic approach let's delve into each
aspect the first one that is coming into
my mind is goals goals are Broad and
overachieving statements that articulate
when you aim to achieve through your
social media efforts for example
increasing brand awareness online this
goal provides a general direction
indicating a desire to enhance the
visibility and recognition of your brand
Within the online space it sets a tone
for your social media strategy but lacks
the specificity needed for direct
measurement now let us move on to the
next one which is objectives objectives
are specific measurable and time bound
Milestone desire to achieve a broader
goal for example increase the number of
new fans on social media platforms by
20% within the next quarter or boast
post engagement by 15% over the next 6
months or achieve a 25% growth in the
web traffic from social media channels
in the next year these were the certain
examples which showcases what are your
objectives objectives break down the
broader goal into actionable and
measurable components they provide a
road map for achieving the overachieving
goal of increased brand awareness
offering clear targets and timelines the
next and the most important one is
metrics metrics are quantifiable
parameters used to measure the
performance and success of your social
media efforts for example the number of
new fans or followers what is the post
engagement rate or growth percentage in
the web traffic metrics are specific
data points that help assess progress
towards objectives they provide tangible
numerical evidence of a social media
performance for the goal of increasing
brand awareness the choosen metrics
should align with the defined objectives
such as tracking the increase in
followers engagement rates and website
traffic originating from social
platforms by aligning goals objectives
and metrics businesses create a
structured framework that not only
guides their social media activities but
also enables a systematic evaluation of
success or areas that may need
adjustment this disciplined approach
enhances the effectiveness of social
media marketing efforts and contributes
to the overall success of the digital
strategy now let us move on to our next
one which is very very important that is
conducting social media audit and
Analysis once you have established your
social media marketing destination it's
imperative to assess your current
position again to determine your
standing point before embarking on a
journey this evaluation process often is
concurrent with setting objectives is
analogous to recognizing that attempting
to reach the moon is futile if your
flying machine can even take off so what
are the are as where you can perform
audit and
Analysis so guys let us discuss each one
of them one by one the first one is

presence assess the strength weaknesses

online presence to identify areas for
improvement next is analyzing
competitive strategies investigate
social media tactics and performance of
your competitors identify potential gaps
or weaknesses in their approach so that
you can capitalize on the third one is
understanding your audience and their
Journeys study your customers exploring
demographics psychographics online
behaviors and historical preferences map

essential aspect of this phase involves
keyword research a critical exercise to
discern what your customers are actively
searching for utilize tools like Google

facilitates this process aiding in
identifying the key terms and phrases
that align with your audience interests

comprehensive evaluation which not only
informs your social media strategy but
also positions you to leverage
opportunities and address weaknesses
effectively the next one is develop a
social Brand Story like every other

your teams how you can post Etc so if
you go on Facebook Facebook there are
two places there is the Facebook
business manager and there is the meta
Business site and that is a bit
confusing yeah so let's talk about the
difference between the two so the
Facebook business manager and The Meta
business suite are two different
applications and they serve different
purposes yeah though the Facebook
business manager is designed for
businesses that rely on Facebook for
their marketing and advertising efforts
while the meta business Suite is
designed for businesses that want to
manage their total online presence yeah
the meta business manager is free and it
helps you manage your Facebook page the
advertising and all your assets in one
place once you have a Facebook page bu
business page it is essential to have
met a business B manager as further
development of your Facebook and your
Instagram so the business manager allows
you to create and track your ad
campaigns that you are managing it helps
you access and control billing settings
and create custom audiences for your ads
and you have the the option to allocate
specific tasks across your team but it's
very much focused on um on Facebook and
the core functionality of managing your
Facebook page but the business um also
by the way the business manager gives
you the ability to manage your meta
pixels or your Facebook pixels that you
can use for retargeting so everything
you want to do with your Facebook page
you can do within the Facebook business
manager but Facebook learned or meta
learned that people wanted more people
wanted to manage their Instagram do
their posting do their content calendar
so they needed more functionality and
that's where Facebook came out with the
meta business Suite that is a
centralized area to manage your Facebook
your Instagram your messaging in one
place so you can save time to manage
your business and to manage your
connections and develop relationships
with more people so cross functionality
is one of the business suite's most
appealing features so the ability to
view all your social activities at a
glance in One dashboard manage multiple
Facebook inboxes and making your
Community Management very simple to do
you can also create and schedule posts
and stories on both Facebook and
Instagram through the meta business uh
the business suite and it's also a great
tool for managing and tracking your page
insights and managing tracking trends
that can help you better understand your
audiences so in summary meta business
Suite is an application that should be
used if you are looking for an easier
way to post engage with your communities
across Facebook and your Instagram
business accounts where the meta
business manager is a site to be used if
you're looking to run ad campaigns with
a team in control your business account
settings and manage your Facebook page
so here are the two introduction screens
here's the screen for the business
manager that you will see but what we're
going to FOC focus on today is the meta
business Suite so if I click here it
takes me to the welcome screen of the

where you you can specify the settings
in using your meta business
with right so this is what the dashboard

dig in there and let's go into a bit
more details there's dedicated areas for
advertising and for your pages okay so
if I click here on the all tools I show
that there is dedicated areas for
advertising on an ad level or even on an
ad manager level yeah and it's very
important that you understand how you

explore them it's where the advertising
magic happens so it gives you kind of
the backp pass entrance to all your ads
when you want to check on your ads want
to tweak them or see how they're
performing this is the place where you
want to go so it is a must to understand
how to use these ads yeah and and how to
use the ads manager we'll go later this
is a series of three videos in the third
video we're going to get more details on
accessing the ads manager and the ads
yeah there's also the section on the
pages these are like the shop window of
Facebook and Instagram pres manage them

the page settings
yeah so it allows you to set the pages
the the details of your pages it sets
the Privacy for your pages it sets the
locations you can link accounts videos
branded content lots of elements that
you can set here for your pages so go
through that make sure that you
understand how to manage this okay so it
opened a new window so I can just close
that window to go back to my business
manager to my business Suite I have to
say Okay so most important thing here
this dashboard gives you access to all
the functionality of your meta business
suite and a very important button to
close this section with is on the
settings and in the settings you can set
up your language billing ad account
settings and you may have seen this
earlier when we've set up the um the
account in the business manager yeah so
if you want to revisit that if you want
to make changes then you can do that
here in the settings
area now that you understand the
dashboard let's dig a bit deeper into a
very important section in The Meta
business Suites which are your meta
insights that is not just another tool
it is the data Hub of your Facebook and
Instagram presence where you can get
information about your audience about
how your pages are doing and whether
your advertising is achieving its
objectives it gives you kind of a cheat
cheet for making decisions you want to
know about who your audience is you want
to know where they are insights gives
you the data you're in curious about
your face Facebook page performance
check it out on the Insight in on the
insights you want to know how your ads
are performing meta Insight will give
you the detail so this is basically
where you go to become a strategic
thinker armed with real time information
about your Facebook and your Instagram
presence so let's have a look at this
let's go to the
insights yes so heading over to the meta
page so let's go to the old tools
yep and there's two different ways of
going there you can access that through
your page or you can access it here
through your
insights and this is where you're going
to get a gold mine of
information about your pres on Facebook
yes so and it sorts it neatly into
sections like page views followers
engagement and um your content you want
to know how many View use your code here
you can see how many you got you want to
know how your ads are running here you
can see how they are doing you want to
know your audience you want to know more
about your followers about your
Instagram followers here is where you
can find all that information and all
that knowledge now these aren not just
numbers on the screen these numbers they
tell you what is happening and they can
help you refine
your Facebook strategy it helps you to
tweak your Instagram and your Facebook
strategy and it can helps you in
checking how your audience is
responding yeah it is really good
information so take for instance
information about your audience yeah it
gives you the followers it gives you on
Facebook and Instagram you it also gives
you detail about age and gender of your
follower
it gives them where are they coming
from yeah the top cities or the top
countries so you can Benchmark this data
with
competitors yeah you can also look at
your content so the content is a very
important one this is probably in my
opinion one of the most important TAPS
in the uh meta insights section so so
this dissects your posts and it shows
you how each of your post is
doing when it comes to number of people
reached number of people that have seen
the post number of people that have seen
the video you can watch uh split it by
post and by stories you can splits it by
let's just do photo post no photo post
mostly we're we're video posts yep and
you can specify the columns here as well
so I want to see the type of
post yeah so I can then apply and it
gives you lots of information here you
see on the videos how many minutes
people viewed the post how many
Impressions that you got the reach of
the post and the most important one is
the engagement on the post and that is
this button is the reactions likes
comments and share this is a critical
column in your Facebook in uh your
Facebook insights yeah if I order this
from top
down yeah so here then I see those posts
with the highest engagement over the
last 28 days and this is where you can
learn what posts work and what posts do
not work and that is golden information
because if you know this post works then
why not make more of those posts so
people can um so you can get in similar
engagement level and overall it can help
you in driving your engagement
levels so very useful reports you can
see what posts are stealing the show
what post need a bit of
tweaking and it can help you in making
sure that you hit the right content with
the right the right people with the
right content so think about this tab
the content tab as checking what posts
work and what don't posts don't work and
you can use that to optimize your posts
for um in the future so there's a lot
more in here you can get audience
information here as well and we'll talk
about that in a um in a later demo on
how to develop audiences in your
Facebook your your meta
insights right let's move on let's go to
the fourth and final demo of this video
which is about collaboration and Team
Management let's go back to the meta
business Suite in this demo we'll dive
into the world of collaboration and Team
Management Within in your meta business
Suite So Meta business Suite is not just
an act for you it's not a solo act it is
about getting your whole marketing team
on Facebook on the meta business Suite
yep and that can help you in kind of
supercharging your uh your management of
your Facebook and your Instagram so
let's break down how you can add team
members because teamwork is like the
secret source that can really make your
beta meta business Suite come to life so
it is very useful to get your team
online so it helps you keep people in
the loop you can assign specific
roles yeah so everybody knows what
they're doing what they're supposed to
be doing when they get on the on the
meta business suite and very important
even if your page is across or if your
team is is across multiple locations you
can still work as a team in managing
your um your Facebook and your Instagram
so let's go down to the basics the first
of this is building your team so what
you're going to do you're going to move
to the business settings and here you
see
people yeah already you here see an
overview of the people that
are available on this business
account that can use and there's
currently one that is me and I've done
another one which is me on another email
and the invite has been sent but I
haven't accepted it but let's go and
click an invite let's first look here on
the people button that is basically that
leads you to this scream if I click here
on invite
people you can then go through a number
of
steps yeah so in this section you can
select
people once you've select those people
you can assign their access you can
assign business assets to those people
you can review the invitation and then
you can send it out so let's go through
this process so we're going to enter the
email again we're going to do just
myself uh
yep and I can get temporary access or
for the advanced option I can remove but
I'm just doing it yeah so this is
actually quite useful temporary access
for instance if you want like an agency
you want them to have a quick look at
your Facebook insights for instance you
can just give them temporary access for
the day and then you want to switch it
off yeah on uh that particular uh that
particular time frame we're not going to
going to do that I'm just going to click
next and then here you can specify the
aess that you want to give to this
person yeah so you can give the person
partial access or you can give the
person full control so partial exess is
the okay they can only work on the tasks
and the business assets assigned to them
basic access yeah which was formerly the
employee role is the default access that
everyone gets when they are added okay
so that is what you can set you can
integrate with um with apps and
different in Integrations like the
Facebook pixel that people can view them
and manage them I'm not going to do this
in this case or you can give somebody
full control which is like an admin role
yeah so that would be the business admin
role and they can manage everything
including settings people tools business
assets they can delete a business
account yeah so does not include the
advanced options so you need to be
careful with this but once you give
somebody full
control yep then um they are basically
an admin for that so click shared then
there you can also look at the financial
information like transactions invoices
account spend and payment method so that
could be for your finance manager for
instance so I am just going to be full
control yeah so I'm happy with that no
no let's not do this I am actually none
I'm just going to be a basic control and
I click next I can then assign business
assets so there is the Facebook page
there is the ad account I can assign
products I can assign the Instagram
account the Commerce account I can
assign pixels
data sets so lots of stuff that I can
assign here okay so the Facebook page
and the Instagram account that's what I
want this person to be assigned I can
then review business assets not assigned
sign business assets I then here need
probably need to specify can manage the
content yeah so insights adds oh select
a business asset so the real Foria page
yep I can then assign content Community
activity ads insights and leads okay
that's all I want to get and then I'll
click next and then I'm going to send an
invitation to Mark markm man.com and as
soon as I accept the
invitation I will then show up on this
list as we saw here yeah and accept it
and I am then part of the team that
manages the um that manage the Facebook
or The Meta business suite for this
particular page right so that's a wrap
an introduction to The Meta business
Suite let me summarize yeah the meta

than some of the other
platforms good so let's delve into the
posting and Publishing on Facebook and
Instagram let me go to the real life
dashboard so here you see the
dashboard and let me first show you how
to um create a post there are various
roots that you can use to create a post
there is here the create Post Yeah you
can also go through the planner you can
go through the content so there are
various ways that you can get into but
let me show you the create post uh the
simple approach I'm clicking here create
post and I'm then getting to the basic
screen for creating a post yep so here
you see all the elements that you need
to do yep so first of all you're going
to specify the platform that you want to
post and I've selected here Facebook and
Instagram I can then add the photo I can
use a template and here I can use
specific text then here I see the
scheduling options I can set my privacy
settings and here you see the preview
either in the Facebook feed or in the
Instagram feed so I'm going to add a
photo I can actually upload from the
desktop or add from the file manager
we'll look into the file manager in a
bit but I'm clicking upload from desktop
and then here I can go to let's say for
Russia picking this photo the photo is
now being uploaded and here I see what
the post is going to look like then here
I can add a text and I can say
winter
promotion yeah in R for Russia I see
here how the text is being added yes so
I can completely see how the post is
being set up I can add all the stuff
that I can add on Facebook as well
yep I see the Facebook feed preview I
can go for the Instagram feed
preview I can look at the desktop and
the mobile version so it's a fully
featured um posting platform within the
meta business pie yeah so now a few um
things of course before finalizing the
post take advantage of this preview
feature in the business Suite yeah so
make sure that your visuals and your
caption displays as intended and that
there are no formatting issues so making
sure that the post looks exactly like
you want it to look and then when you're
happy with the post you click either
publish or you can say finish
later
so I can also schedule the post yes so
I'm clicking here publish and then the
post will be published this may take a
moment or you can set here your
scheduling
options yeah so you see now that the
post is
published so but I actually I'm going to
delete it in a minute because I don't
want this post to go live yeah so if I
can want to create that post I can also
say the scheduling options and I can set
a date at a time for my post okay so
that gives it to you in a
nutshell and what we're going to do now
is let's look at this file manager in a
bit more detail the file manager is a
tool that metab business Suite um has
put together to allow you to add and
organize your assets for your business
account yep assets like your photos like
your ads like videos Etc so with file
manager you can collaborate on files and
folders you can assign access to
creative assets and you can plan your
content more efficiently so you can
manage your image and video files for
use in your posts or your stories or
your videos you can upload multiple
assets at the same time for later use
you can create albums to organize and
access your creative assets and you can
share your assets with other people in
your team so how do you access the um
file manager you can go here to all
tools and then within the all tools you
see here file manager so click on that
and that takes you to your file manager
where you can create folders and where
you can add sort of creatives in your
folder so if I go to this folder and I
can
uh check the folder and here you see one
of the um the assets that I've added
into this file manager clicking here I
can straightly bring it into my creative
posts yep so I can use it to create a
story or I can delete it I can look at
my folder setting yeah here you can see
which people have access to the folders
I can assign Partners to the folders I
can edit these folder the permissions
so very useful tool and particularly if
you have lots of assets for your
products then this can be a very helpful
tool in managing those
assets so that that takes me then a step
deeper to the content Tab In The Meta
business Suite as well yeah that is
where you can find all your published
and drafts and scheduled posts including
your real
your video posts your stories your
photos and your live videos you can see
what is published what is scheduled what
is draft what is expiring what is
expired yeah you can add your reels you
can even export the data and still still
access to your create post or your
create
real here you can see the date published
of the post you can see the status of
the post if it has been boosted or not
yeah if it what's the distribution for
the Post how many you see then some some
some statistics on the posts as well and
we'll dive deeper into the insights
later in the third video but here you
can already see The Impressions the
reach the players and very important the
reactions the engagement that you had on
the different posts so very useful tool
yes so you can within this tool you can
manage your post you can create posts as
well and there's also access here to
your ab tests if you want to test posts
on their uh their effectiveness you can
also within the content and I like that
you can see your feed and your GD yeah
so here you see your Facebook feed this
one is that I've just published although
I've deleted it as well but um yeah and
here you see your Instagram feed you can
see your mentions and your tags so it's
almost like managing your feed as well
and here you see your collections within
your file manager like Facebook photos
playlists and series that you've can
created very useful tool that um you can
use to manage your content together with
the file
manager right so that concludes the
posting element yeah let's now go into
the next level of managing your posts
and that is through the planner the
planner can be accessed by clicking the
planner button here on the menu in the
metab business Suite dashboard so if I
click on the Planner yeah you can access
your kind of your content dashboard and
within this dashboard you can have a
total overview of what you have posted
and what you're going to
post and you can see some basic
information about your different posts
as well yeah and it's a very useful
visual tool to plan your content and to
plan ahead of your content so you click
on the planner tab as I mentioned yeah
it also features this calendar
that helps you plan schedule and
visualize what count content you want to
share and when you want to share it you
can also use this calendar to coordinate
your content with holidays and special
events what is going on and you can also
use it to manage your creative access
your creative
assets yep so here you see the goals
that you can specify you can add goals
yeah so here for instance I want to
increase reach you can specify that for
a specific period and then here you see
how you fair against reaching the
objective of the goal that you've set
there's also the moments now
unfortunately moments does not work in
most of the markets currently it's only
working in the US so here you will see
what sort of events are coming up like
like holidays National events or you can
specify your own events and that's
always good with your posting of your
content because you can then relate your
content to the events that are relevant
in your
market so you can look at your content
type yeah so you can have all your
content showing in your calendar or you
can look at your stories your reals or
your ads and here you can specify set it
by week or by
month and it gives you as I said earlier
a fantastic overview of what you have
done and what you're going to do it also
and that's what I really like about it
gives you a um gives you kind of a a
library of the posts that you have done
in the
past so the content calendar yeah is
very important it's also called an
editorial col calendar it's used by the
marketing team to plan and schedule your
content across your Facebook and your
Instagram so it serves as a road map for
your social media marketing strategy and
it makes sure that you will be
consistent and
cohesive with your
posting yeah and it's a very important
tool that marketing teams are using so
some key elements of your calendar yeah
it outlines the type of content you plan
to share that's number one yeah it helps
you scheduling it includes the specific
dates and times for when your posts will
be for when your content will be
published yeah so you can schedule it
forward as well what are the posts that
you are planning in the coming
months good content calendars have an
integration of your different social
media
channels yep so that is very useful
because then you can select and show the
post for each sort of um channel that
you're using the calendar often include
themes or topics for postings yeah so
you have a diverse range of content that
you're scheduling there's also alignment
with your campaigns in your content
calendar so it aligns with your broader
marketing campaigns or events so your
social media efforts they're really
contributing to it to sort of achieving
your marketing objectives good content
calendars they have collaboration
features so multiple team members can
contribute or review so you can
coordinate your efforts across your
posting and by pling planning and
scheduling your content in advance yeah
it's just a matter of efficiency it
helps streamline your content creation
and your posting process and finally a
good content calendar helps with the
communication within your marketing team
so everybody is aware of what is being
scheduled what poats are coming and they
can plan their tasks
accordingly now that we looked at the
publishing and planning side of your
content and your posts let's look at the
notifications a very important part of
your Facebook and Instagram presence
unfortunately metab business Suite
allows you to receive
notifications related to your Facebook
and your Instagram business accounts
whether you get those on messaging or
whether you get them on your email so
what are notifications they are kind of
alerts or messages that inform
people yeah and it's mainly you of
course and your marketing team that are
working on the meta business Suite as
well about specific activities updates
or interactions with the meta business
weed
platform so what are the features of the
notifications in the meta business Suite
so here we go in to the notifications
button that we can access through the
meta business Suite menu so click on
notifications yeah so first of all you
can customize your
notifications yeah so you can customize
the notification preferences based on
your settings and your priorities you
can receive realtime updates on relevant
activities so that keeps you in the Loop
and you can explore the advanced
notification settings and in the
advanced notification settings you can
tailor your notifications based on
specific activities so you getting
prompt sort of um messages about events
that are critical to your
business so here's the overview yes so
here there's no new
notifications here are the other
notifications
that are coming in these are
notifications from within your um within
your Facebook or your Instagram here you
can filter your
notifications yeah so you can have uh
set for Action needed message reminders
comments
recommendations notifications only for
Facebook or Instagram or your business
account here you can set Market read and
here you have have the settings of your
notification and here you can
specify what notifications you want to
have and most notifications that will go
within your team your marketing team
will go through
email yeah so you can set notifications
for Facebook for um yeah for your page
for messages for comments for
announcements for
suggestions other communic ations like
tags like shares and here are you can
set your business email notifications
for business permissions roles ad
accounts pixels and more yeah so that
goes um quite
deep so let me dig a bit deeper in the
type of notifications you can get via
your email that could be activity alerts
yeah so they include alerts about activ
on your business Pages like new likes
comments or shares there can be page
insights so users may receive
notifications about insights and
analytics related to the performance of
the business page that could be alerts
on messenger
interactions yeah so if you use the
messenger for customer communication you
may receive notifications about new uh
customer messages could be um alerts or
notifications around ad campaign
updates so information about your ad
performance the budget charges or budget
changes or other AD campaign related
events there could be page management
alerts yeah important actions or changes
related to the management of your
business page there could be platform
announcements from
meta yeah they may use the notifications
to in uh communicate important platform
announcements updates or
changes there could be notifications
related to
security and finally notifications
around events and
reminders so very useful tool to use
important to make sure that you set the
right
preferences and make sure that you check
it regularly yeah what the notifications
are that you are getting in
besides the
notifications another important area is
your
inbox and within your inbox you have
your messages you have your comments and
your automated
responses so you can access that by
clicking on the inbox in your
menu yeah and metab business Suite they
offer several features related to this
communication and engagement within your
inbox they enable your your business to
effectively manage your communication
and your engagement on Facebook and on
Instagram so a centralized inbox is very
handy that you can have that because it
streamlines your responses and it makes
sure you and you sort of you respond
timely and
consistently with your
audience so if you look at the menu your
centralized Hub as it were this is where
you can manage your entire inbox you can
look at just the messages messenger
Instagram yeah on WhatsApp Facebook
comments Instagram
comments yep so here you see all the
messages whether it's unread if it needs
follow up you can label it here is the
filters that you can specify here you
see the people that communicate with you
then here you see the community or the
sort of the communication that is being
done so really useful if I go here to
myself yeah what you see for the users
as well that have enabled that you can
see their profile details as well and
you can set a label could be like a new
customer or a prospect you can add
labels
yeah so that can be like a mini sort of
CRM system to manage the communication
with your prospects for
instance yeah so that is the um the
inbox
so and that is sort of the um the the
dashboard that you have for your inbook
box so again we'll look at your
messenger yeah so that's all the private
messages that we received within your
Facebook and Instagram business account
the
comments yeah they focus on comments
that you get within your Facebook or
your Instagram business page so this is
where you can efficiently Monitor and
respond to comments so that can really
help you with developing your engagement
with your
audience so what I really like about the
inbox is that you can also set up
automations so you can set up automated
responses to messages messages that you
received within your um within your
inbox so they can be customized and
triggered based on specific keywords
based on Greetings or specific questions
that you get and they are very useful to
provide instant replies and managing
manage your customer inquiries
efficiently so they can be
configured yeah to acknowledge a receipt
of a message or provide basic
information or guide users to relevant
sources Sant relevant resources so let's
have a look if I click on the
automations yeah then here you see there
is basically a um a library of
automations that you can set
up and some here you can see the ones
that you have already set up and that
you have activated so for instance I
have already activated an instant reply
or I've activated identify unanswered
messages yeah my away message is not on
or I can create an Automation and then
here you see the library of kind of
templates that you can choose from you
can greet people yeah share information
organize messages send a confirmation or
follow
up yes
so you start with templates so it is not
a huge library of templates that you
have but at least it allows you to to
use to look at specific um sort of
common sort of scenarios that you can
can face and you can set sort of timate
ations for
those right let's go back and let's go
to the final demo in this video and that
is take a bit of a deeper look into
creating
stories so stories of a very Dynamic and
engaging format for content
sharing yeah because of their temporary
nature and their interactive features
and Prime placement don't forget that
yeah it makes them a very valuable tool
for businesses that want to enhance the
engagement on their social media
presence and connect with their
audiences and make the content more
authentic and
immediate stories also help increasing
the visibilities because they appear at
the top of a user's feed so that
provides Prime real estate for
visibility and it makes it more likely
that users will see your content and
engage with your
content yes so and there are lots of
Engagement opportunities as stories are
designed to be interactive with features
like polls questions quizzes swipe up um
links yeah and it connects with your
audience in a much more engaging
way
so let's have a look at the stories how
you create
them yeah so here we say create
story yeah what I like about stories is
that they provide the opportunity to
share kind of raw unfiltered content to
your users so you can give your your
followers a behindth scenes look at your
business or the personal life and makes
your posts a lot of a lot more
authentic yeah so you can build stronger
relations with your uh with your
audience there's also a thing like fomo
as we call it it's the fear of missing
out because of the temporary nature of
stories they typically last for 24 hours
it creates a scent of
urgencies yeah so you encourage users to
check your stories regularly because
they feel I don't want to miss anything
that you are um that you are posting in
your
stories it's kind of known that people
for instance on Instagram will spend
more time in the stories than in the
newsfeeds yep and businesses use that
their businesses know that stories yeah
their algorithm they often prioritize
stories making them more likely to
appear on the users uh feet so and
another big feature of stories by the
way is the highlights feature
particularly on Instagram so you can
create story highlights which are
collections of past stories that you can
feature on your profile permanently so
that is a fantastic way to Showcase
important information or key aspects of
your brand I always say it's like the
menu of your website yeah you can
actually have that in the highlights on
your
Instagram so and finally the power of
stories is also that they offer
advertising opportunities both in
Facebook and in Instagram so businesses
can use that to reach a broader audience
and promote products or
Services of course it's not as user
friendly as on the mobile but at least
you have some functionality on the the
um that you can have on the mobile as
well so add photo video we're going to
go in the same photo here
open yep so here you see the photo and
here you see how the story is being
uploaded
yep so you can then add your text as
well so you can click
edit yep so here you can see I can crop
I can text or I can add stickers so
let's add text so the text will be um
I'm going to put it here yeah
so uh winter
promotion yeah put that here
and then we have text is blue or text is
red let's make it
yellow here we go font I can
choose yep and then I can say let's
stick with that and here I can say I'm
going to add a sticker as well yes so
you have a whole library of stickers it
is again not as advanced as you have on
the m mile but at least you can do a bit
on the yeah so then I can click apply I
can add my multiple um media of
course I can schedule it I can share it
straight away or I can schedule it and I
can set my privacy settings as well so
really good functionality within the
meta business Suite so create the
stories here or create them on Facebook
or in stagram itself on the mobile but
at least you have some functionality on
that here as well to Leverage The Power
of the
stories there are two additional items
in the old tools that you need to be
aware of that can help you with your
content creation and your content
planning if I click here on all
tools then in the menu you will see here
sound
collection sound collection is a
fantastic tool to enhance your video and
audio content which with free music or
sound effects that you can use in your
posts and it's a hidden sort of Secret
In The Meta business Suite but it gives
you a great collection of hundreds of
sound files that you can add to your
videos or your um your photos or your
your stories and there you can sort by
genre by Mood by duration by vocals by
tempos you can add it to favor there is
as you can see here over 10,
13,28 to soundtracks in there that you
can can use and they're all free of
charge so there's tracks there's sound
effects and it is very handy little tool
that you have in the meta business
manager so the other one that I want you
to be aware of if I go back home and
back into the old tools is the
collaboration Center so here in the
manage you see your collaboration Center
and that is where you can sort of
structure your Partnerships with Brands
and with
influencers so you can sort of assign uh
Brands and partners that you want to
collaborate with on your posts and with
the whole growth in the influencer
marketing uh area this is a very useful
part that you can um can you can set up
to manage those relationships we're
going to talk about the meta business
weed Commerce the advertising and the
insights that you can get out of it
we're going to talk about what it is how

delving into the details let's talk
about the pivotal role of the meta
business Suite the suite serves as the
central control hub for businesses that

more than just a tool it manages your
entire digital presence on Facebook and
Instagram no more need to use other
tools yeah you can now do it all within
the Facebook and Instagram world it's
essential for efficiency it consolidates
all the elements of your in your

unified dashboard it simplifies the
account management of your ad accounts

your business so it's a collaborative
workspace where you can enable your
colleagues to work with you as well on
your Facebook and your Instagram and
thereby it ensures that everybody is
aligned contributing collectively to
achieving your business goals
so it's a suite of tool with lots of
valuable insights like audience
management audience engagement metrics
like ad performance yeah and it is a
One-Stop shop to manage everything you
need to do uh in managing your Facebook
and your Instagram now we've been
through various um areas of it like we
looked at the dashboard we looked at the
um posting
scheduling managing your content we
found a treasure of tools and
functionalities and in today's session
we're going to look at three specific
areas we're going to dive into the
Commerce manager and we're going to be
talking about some very important
changes that meta has announced in 2023
about managing your shop we're going to
look at Facebook and Instagram ads I'm
going to show you the process of of
creating an ad and how to manage your
your audiences and then we're going to
conclude the video with an demo about
the Facebook and meta insights that you
can
get right let's kick off demo one the
Commerce
manager now it's important to understand
that meta has made some very important
announcements in managing your Facebook
shop in resp respon to the current
economic downturn meta is investing
heavily in Ai and automation tool to
boost campaign performance through shop
advertising and The Meta Advantage Suite
of ads and we'll come back to that in a
little bit yeah what that uh that means
but it means that shops
are scaling down in
functionality but but promoting your
products through advertising is kind of
scaling up in uh in Facebook and
Instagram so the shop ads are going to
be Consolidated Under The Meta
advantage and they facilitate easier
shop setup with inapp
checkout yeah so particularly for the
markets where you already have checkout
functionality within the Facebook app
yeah this is a very important
announcement that although the shop is
going to sort of De be defocused the
advertising of your products is going to
get more center stage and thereby you
can promote more of your products to
your target
audiences Now new shop tools that are
coming out like ratings reviews they're
being tested and support for shops
without checkout and that's very
important to understand if you haven't
got a checkout functionality in your
shop yeah and that will be in most of
the countries except in the US and I
believe in India they support for the
shops will be
discontinued with a focus on helping the
US businesses
in adding the checkouts to their
existing shops basically what meta is
doing is to optimize the whole shopping
experience in the US market and then
rolling that out across other markets
which means that some of the shop
functionality and opening up a new shop
in Facebook in other markets like Europe
and like Asia is going to be limited so
this strategic change aims to optimize
the shopping experiences support
businesses and learn from the
experiences in the US before a global
roll out so remember as I said
discontinued support for shops without
checkouts in various markets like Europe
and Asia and um for those markets you
can start focusing and focus increase
your focus on personalized ads reels and
messaging and in the US the emphasis is
on aiding businesses in imp implementing
the checkout with support for shops
linking to a website until sort of first
quarter of 2024 so now this is clear
let's start with looking at the meta
Commerce manager yeah the Commerce
manager is the essential core of your
online store and it simplifies all your
store tasks with a userfriendly
interface so it enables you to manage
your products to process your orders and
deliver excellent customer service to
your customers who buy your products Now

products to your catalog and how you can
manage your catalog as well so another
way to upload your items is through a
data feed and that's a very important
one yeah so you can actually just enter
a Google Sheets yep and you can download
in a template of the format for the uh
the Google Sheets that you want to
upload with your product information but
you can also enter a URL from a server
or a hosting website and this URL is
very important when you want to work
with external e-commerce stores like for
instance
Shopify the process there is that you
would um download kind of a a Facebook
app within your Shopify account and that
sets the connection with uh between
Shopify and the Facebook uh Commerce the
Facebook shop or there may be other
e-commerce platforms where they will
actually give you a
URL and that's where you can add that
URL and that sets a link and the good
thing often about these Sol uh these
these Solutions is that there will be a
live link between your e-commerce
platform and your Facebook shop that
means when there is changes in your
product catalog in your e-commerce
platform it will automatically be
uploaded in your Facebook Commerce data
source or your Facebook Commerce catalog
right back to the overview so let's look
at how you can edit your shop now
remember the recent store changes yeah
so in most markets you can no longer
create a new shop but you can edit an
existing
shop and in some markers where there is
the inapp checkout functionality like in
the US you will still be able to create
new shops and manage your shops so let's
click here on shops and here you see the
shop that I have yep and it's um here I
can see the light
shop so here you see how the sh the shop
looks like y so um I can look at the
products and I can look at the
categories I can search within the shop
here you see a version
history yep or I can close this and I
can here I can edit my shop I can edit
the layout of the shop and I can edit
the settings of the shop
so here you see the homepage I can look
at collections I can optimize the layout
I can add banners for offers I can add a
carousel of um of products or
collections to the Carousel and here I
can have suggestions for you yeah or a
dynamic product and it serves the
product that is relevant for the
customer yep but remember this is going
to scale down in the future yeah you
will no longer be able to see a shop and
actually on most sort of Facebook pages
you already see that many Facebook pages
have already removed the shop because of
the limited functionalities that you
have these
days okay so that is the shop that you
can um edit in the layout
and here in the settings you can edit
the visibility the inventory the website
content the
categories yep and um again lots of
stuff that you can uh can manage
here the final thing we want to do in
the Facebook Commerce is to see how we
can do a promotion yep and if we go back
to the Commerce manager and and the um
the dashboard of the Commerce manager we
can click here on
promotions and here you see
offers and this is where we can create
offers and we can see an overview of our
active offers our scheduled offers and
offers that expired so let's have a look
at the create offer functionality click
on this and here you can see your offer
category so I can have an amount of I
can do a sale I can do a free shipping I
can do a buy product X and get product y
here's the name of your offer and here
you can see the different if you want to
use a promo code if you don't want to
use a promo code then you take this or
you can get a CO a code that people have
to enter and here you see the summary of
the offer so we're going to give the
name of the offer is uh spring promotion
yeah no other changes it's an automatic
yes so no other details up here to enter
here we do the type are we doing a
percentage of or a flat amount so let's
say we're doing a
20% discount uh here you can select your
products we can say apply to the entire
shop or select some specific products
I'm going to do it for the entire shop
and then I can do include products that
already have a sales price or I cannot
include them the offer applies only once
per item or I can say let's do it per
order here you see what the offer would
look like yep and here you can set the
start date and the end date of your
offer if I'm happy with all these
settings I can then click here create
offer and then the offer will be live on
my
shop okay here is the summer
uh sorry here's the um the summary so
the offer has being created it gives you
some some tips so you can feature the
offer in the shop there's the offer
details yeah the discount ID the
visibility the start date we haven't
specified an end date yeah for all the
customers we can look at the customers
the product and then we see it's for all
products and then if we're happy with
this we'll just click cancel yeah so
that concludes
the um the the promotion and you see how
simple it is to add a promotion so now
let's look at the last section I want to
cover in the Commerce manager and that
is the advertising that you can schedule
in the Commerce manager now let's talk
about Advantage Plus you may have heard
me talking about that earlier in this
video where it talks about the um uh the
changes that Facebook announced in 2023
in the Commerce manager so what are
Advantage Plus catalog ads they have
been launched on August the 15th in 2023
for e-commerce and real retail
advertisers really helping them enhance
the ad efficiency so the Advantage Plus
ads they use Ai and machine learning
where they automatically sort of create
up to 50 creative combinations of the
ads so it eliminates manual steps in the
ad creation allowing advertisers to
learn much more efficiently how which
ads work and which ads don't work and
how to maximize their budget efficiently
so the roll out of Advantage Plus
provides advertisers with new and
innovative ways to optimize campaigns
and thereby you can get fantastic new
insights that can help in developing
your advertising strategies small
businesses will also be able to use
Advantage Plus creative and Advantage
Plus audience to create ads through
their Facebook page so it's not just
through the Commerce manager but small
businesses can take advantage of it as
well so it's about creating a
personalized audience based on your page
detail and automatically adjust over
time to help you reach more and relevant
customers for your um for your ads so
here you can see the what you can do so
if you want to get started with
Advantage catalog ads so you can add
your product you can set up tracking
through a pixel and then you can create
your ad and if I click on create ad you
want to know which ad account you would
like to advertise with and then you
select the in this case the Riad for
Russia and then that takes you to your
advertising setup and this basically is
a um a subset of the uh the Facebook or
The Meta advertising platform that we
will go through in a minute once we've
concluded the Commerce manager section
yep so that's um what I want to say
about the ads and then finally let's
look at the insights so here in the
insights you can get dat details
knowledge information about your catalog
your performance your audiences your
tagged content you can get in details
about awareness and there is the
helicopter overview of your shop
performance as well well we had very
little activity in our shop because yeah
we have a very basically no real shop in
this Facebook account but here again you
will get all the details about your shop
if you have a full operating shop within
the Commerce
manager right that concludes the
Commerce manager so now let's look at
the advertising on Instagram and
Facebook that you can manage through the
meta business suite and we'll go there
by various ways you can go into the
advertising yeah so Facebook and or meta
is very keen to get you to advertise and
so you see in your feeds you see post
that you can boost um here on the um the
the basic menu you go into advertising
here if you click on the all tools you
can go to ads and these are all
subsections of what you can do in the
advertising if you really want to go to
the full advertising ing platform of
meta you click here on ads
manager this is the dashboard of your um
account in The Meta business Suite when
it comes to advertising you can see if
there are problems with your advertising
account there is the payment method that
you can set you can even create a
Facebook page from here you can verify
your email address and and um here you
have access to the ads manager menu as
well and this is where you can have an
overview of your campaigns there is your
ads reporting very important section is
the audiences that you can create within
your ads manager and Target various
audiences with your ads there is in uh
billing and payments and your ad account
setting and here is an overview to all
the tools in the ad manager
yeah business
settings the integration with the
Commerce Center and lots of other stuff
when it comes to your uh your ads in
Facebook and Instagram so let's go to
the
campaigns yeah what we want to do is to
show you the powerful features in this
demo of the ads manager when it comes to
creating an ad in Facebook and in
Instagram yeah in this video to take you
through the entire ads manager that
would be um too long we'll do a separate
video on that but here I just want to
give you a quick highlight on how easy
it is to create a new campaign so here
you see the current campaigns that I
have yep so now I'm not running any
campaigns they're all in draft mode but
here you see the typical structure for a
payperclick advertising campaign you
have campaigns under campaigns you have
ad sets and under ad sets you have ads
and the ads they inherit the settings of
the adsets and the adsets inherit the
settings of the campaign so in the
campaigns you would set your budget in
the adsets you would set your targeting
and here are the specific ads so it's
all related to each other but it's a
multi-dimensional approach in updating
and managing
your advertising campaigns in um in meta
so let's create a new campaign and then
you'll see how it develops so we want
first to look at the campaign objective
yeah so based on what the objective is
for your campaign meta will come back to
you with the ideal settings for that
particular objective so it could be lead
generation it could be engagement it
could be driving traffic like sending
people to a destination like your
website or an app or your Instagram
profile great for getting link clicks
landing page views Etc so let's click on
traffic and here I'm going to continue
so now it's going to ask me a number of
questions yes so and I just have to go
through those questions
when it comes for the campaign when it
comes to the ad set and when it comes to
the ad yeah so we have the campaign name
we have the special ad categories if you
want to do yeah so there are special
categories that Facebook or meta wants
to know about whether it's related to
credit employment social issues
elections yeah because there may be
different requirements this was sort of
set up after the um I think it were the
2018 elections in the US and the brexit
um El sort of um uh poll uh on how
advertising was kind of abused to reach
audiences with kind of false information
so now when you do advertise for social
issues and elections or politics then
there are very specific
requirements yeah but we say they're not
applicable here we go to the campaign
details
yeah I can edit this the buying type is
an auction so the highest bidder with
the best quality ad will'll get the best
position for the ad you can do you can
change this as well uh you can do by
auction or by reservation but that is
where you will have to pay more yep and
then here's the campaign objective that
we've set at the beginning of the
process which is objective of traffic
yeah you can then set do you want to do
testing for your
ad yep and you will let Facebook create
different versions of your ads and then
it will run the different versions and
it will look at what ad will give the
best performance and do you want to make
it in advanc campaign budget yes so it
will distribute your budget across
current currently delivering ad sets to
get more results yeah but I'm going to
leave that off and I'm going to click to
next so that's my campaign settings
we're then going to the ad set and in
the ad set you're going to look at your
conversion location would that be your
website or a landing page an app on
messenger or your Instagram profile so
let's send traffic to my
website yep and then here you see your
estimated daily results how many people
you will reach and how many link clicks
I'm going to set the performance go I
want to maximize the number of
clicks yeah what would I want to do yeah
to spend what do I want to spend
basically I can say I'm going to spend
let's say um
one dollar or one pound in this case per
result call I can have more options here
I can say different bit strategies that
I can have yeah I can say what is the
maximum spend or what is the cost per
result call what am I prepared to spend
per kind of um click as it were yeah I'm
going to leave at that and here you have
Dynamic
creative yeah I can also leave this
blank by the way because I have my
budget setting further down below so
Dynamic creative I would just provide
creative elements such as images and
headlines and then meta will Al
automatically generate the perfect ads
for you a very interesting um process um
I'm going to leave it off for now
because I want to show you how an ad may
look like and how you can develop that
so my daily budget I'm setting it at 20
pounds a day yeah here's the start date
and I can set an end date yeah so I'm
going to set the star date a bit further
yeah because I don't want it to start
and sender tar date don't need to send
an end date yep and here is the budget
scheduling you can now schedule budget
and greases on certain days I'm not
going to do that at the start of the
campaign because I want Facebook or meta
in this case decide what works best for
me yep so and then ad scheduling I can
specify but again I'm going to run all
the ads at the same time and then here
you have your audience controls so this
is set criteria for we where ADS can be
delivered so this is we have sort of
location we have age we can look at
existing custom audiences that we have
created over time I can look at audience
suggestions yep so um so that is part of
the Advantage Plus audience that I
created that I discussed with you
earlier yep and here you have your
placements and there is let meta decide
for you where your ad is going to be
shown or you can decide for manual
placement yep and then is the more
placement you select the better it is
yeah but let the Advance Plus yeah show
more options here there's brand safety
and suitability pro for instance prevent
your ads from appearing near content
that's not conducive to your brand for
instance if you are a holiday d
destination and you advertise on
Facebook you don't want to be shown um
next to an article or a post about um
about an airline disaster yes so we're
going to hide these options manual
placements I also want you to be aware
where you can select which platforms do
you want to advertise on Facebook
Facebook's Audience Network on Instagram
or on messenger shop is no longer a
available we talked about that yep and
here you go then in your ad so this is
the placement of the ads where do you
want to show your ads in the feeds in
the stories in stream ads the search
results in messages but again we'll let
Facebook or meta decide on all of this
okay so I'm going back to Advantage Plus
placement where you use Facebook's
artificial intelligence and machine
learning to give you the best placement
based on meta's understanding of your um
your audience so click next yep and then
is um we're going to go to the ad yeah
so Facebook suggest make a carousel ad
yeah so here we go into the um the ad
creation so the Facebook page that we're
going to base this on is let me have a
look look real for
usia yeah we're going to manually upload
creatives or we can get it from the
catalog yeah and here you see your
preview these are the products for my
catalog yeah so I'm just going to leave
it for this product for now yes so
you're going to look at the format I
wanted a
carousel now I have two products in my
Carousel so they should probably come up
now yeah so um so here is the second
product no yeah so but that's how it
would look like or you can do a
collection you can do multi- Advertiser
ads so and I can um have the catalog for
the ad creative as I said could be a
product set at multiple products I can
make Carousel cards as well yeah I can
turn it in a slideshow lots and lots of
opportunities and here you have your
headline and your description yeah so
the headline is carpet I can take that
out I can say um spring
promotion sort of Atlas
Mountains carpet
yeah so that should now be added here
under the um the ad and here you see
shop now button I can add a description
that will show up at the uh the top
describe your link which would be
fantastic handmade
carpets from the
barbers in the Atlas Mountains
let's
see yeah on bigger ads you see that that
would show up here at the um the front
so yep and then you are um basically
having your primary text let me have a
look I think that is actually the text
that I wanted up
here let me have a look at
that there there it is yeah so that is a
text that I wanted there and here the
call to action that would be shop now
but I have a whole range of call to
actions yeah so keep that as shop now
then where do I drive people to I drive
them to my shop and that is the website
do I want to build a URL par parameter
so I can track my campaign in the uh in
in
analytics yeah I'm not going to set it
up I can choose an app if I want to so
lots of stuff that I can do here I can
set up the tracking through the re pixel
I can select the pixel I'm not going to
go into those details and here is the
URL parameter that I want to build for
the tracking but here is the basic
version of my ad yep and now it's a
matter of pressing publish and then the
next thing that will happen that
Facebook will look at the ad they will
evaluate the ad and once they approve
prove the ad yeah then the campaign will
go live yep so here's the business
location and currency I'm just clicking
next that's the payment information they
still need my credit card details I
don't want to do that yeah so I'm not
going to give them the details so I want
to skip that so I'm not going to publish
this campaign for now but at least it
gives you an overview of how to create a
campaign in the flow of of campaign ad
set and ads there's a lot more to it
obviously but at least this gives you a
high level overview so if that is on the
campaign setting there are two more
important areas that is your audience
creation so you can create separate
audiences that you can then add as an
audience for your ad campaign yes so if
you click create you can create take
custom audiences a lookalike audience or
what we say a saved audience yeah if I
click on Saved audience what you're
going to do you can specify the audience
with the name yeah and by the location
but you can then do a detailed targeting
based on demographics interests or
behaviors so I can just click here let's
say somebody who is excited about travel
yeah so could be frequent
Travelers yeah and there's a whole range
of uh things that you can add here and
in your um your audience and you will
see that it will sort of impact your
audience size as well so you can do by
Behavior yeah or by uh by interest so um
and there's a whole sort of let's say I
want to do California
yeah so I can California place people
who are either interested there yeah so
I can Target by location as well if I
want so this is the really powerful um
aspect of paperclick campaigns on meta
and also on Google yeah on the targeting
so I'm going to cancel this I can also
create an audience L we say a custom
audience and this is uh these are
audiences based on people who have done
a specific behavior like visiting your
website and this is what we call the
retargeting so Facebook allows you to
Target people who have visited your
website a particular page which means
the next day they could get an advert of
your Facebook ad of the the product that
they saw on your website so is all to do
with the retargeting and the pixel
marketing now I'm not going to go into
that because that's beyond the scope of
this video but this is where you would
set it all
up okay and then of course within your
advertising you have your ads reporting
section as
well where you can look at the account
name you have for um yeah you can look
at reach Impressions frequency amount
spent and attribution setting now I
haven't got any campaigns running so I
don't see any details here yeah also
because the period is but let's say if
we can
select um let me have a look let's say
no I haven't run any Facebook campaigns
on this campaign so I can't show you any
data but this is where you can create
your advertising reports where you can
select all these breakdowns and bring
them into your
report good that's it on the Facebook
and Instagram
ads and what we're going to do now is
move to the next demo the final demo of
this series which is everything to do
with the meta insights to access the
insights in The Meta business Suite you
go to the main dashboard and you click
on all
tools and and you scroll down in
analyzing and Reporting so you have your
specific ads reporting you can create
tests like
experiments yeah that you can get

Facebook Impressions and usage of the
website or app and you can go into the
Insight section where you learn about um
about it your your Facebook page and
about Trends and activities and
engagement around your activities on
Instagram and on Facebook so here you
see the summary your last week in review
so you see the reach from last week on

this week your messaging activity how
you're uh progressing towards goals that
you've specified like increase reach for
instance and here you see your activity
the content that we placed and how uh
and if we did any
advertisement so that is sort of your
high level summary if you click here on
view all insights you're going to your
dashboard yeah so let's start and have a
look at this dashboard this is where you
get a very detailed breakdown into your
audiences yeah so you can understand
your audience's characteristics and
behaviors and you can develop your
content strategies for a more
personalized and engaging customer
experience so let's look at the most
important reports here on your dashboard
you get performance information on
content interaction on reach on
followers link clicks and minutes viewed
of um your page and you scroll down yeah
you can see advertising what you've done
or what others have done and your post
frequency this is where you can help you
what you should do to grow your uh your
reach and obviously Facebook will say
hey you need to start advertising and
post more so boost for reach takes you
straight into the advertising or create
post takes you to your uh your content
and your post and scheduling section
within uh The Meta business Suite so
very important here and that is the most
important
report in your uh Insight which is your
audience report which is your content
report and your performance report yeah
so let's have a look at these three
reports and see what we get if I look at
audience here again you can go straight
into to advertising or creating a post
but what you want to have here want to
look at is how did my followers
grow yeah and how did on both Facebook
and on
Instagram yeah what are the most
important cities where people are from
yeah that are um following our page what
are the top
countries yeah so lots of information
you get here and then the age and the
gender so that's your current audience
it gives you potential audience where
what you can get yeah the top
cities top countries top other pages
that you can learn
from yeah so great information that you
can get here on your audience that you
are interacting with if we then look at
your content yeah to me this is probably
the most important section
of your meta
insights here you see what content works
and what doesn't work yeah for your
Facebook post your stories and your
Instagram post and stories whether those
posts are photos or videos or text Post
Yeah so here you have your high level
overview of and you can select for
Facebook or Instagram you see the reach
and the engagement but the real spicy
details you can find under content here
you can see every post and story and
video that you did yeah and you can see
here what is the title what is the date
published and what else you can see here
is information about reach and
Impressions and further details that you
get yeah so and this makes it so
exciting because here you can see which
posts have the highest engagement levels
like reactions like comments and shares
and you can order these from high to low
so I can now see what post has been my
most engaging post when it comes to
reactions in the last 28 days I can say
make that in the last 90
days yeah I can now see what has been my
most popular post over the last 90 days
when it comes to reactions and comments
and share and the nice thing then is by
clicking on that post you see what the
post was about and then you can say hey
if that post worked then can we make the
other post similar to this post because
for this post we know that that post
Works yep so very useful information you
can get here about your content and use
that to your advantage yeah so we looked
at the audience we looked at the content
so now let's look at the performance of
the videos and the real again I can see
a summary I can also go down straight
into the
details yep and here you see total
minutes of Feud um compared to the
previous period you see what is organic
what is paid and again what were your
most import the most popular posts when
it comes to minutes
viewed yeah for the the period that you
selected so here in the send some final
details about your
audience yeah for your your videos and
the retentions now we haven't got any
earnings on videos so that kind of
summarizes everything there is to know
about the insights a fantastic pool of
data that you can use to kind of look at
Trends yeah so you can kind of predict
of what is going to happen and you can
stay ahead of the curve with what you
learn from your meta insights so very
useful and um take this uh information
and turn that into your advantage by
creating better posts targeting better
audiences and thereby getting better
results so let's start by understanding

subscribe to a newsletter is considered
as a lead this is because they have
interacted with your business website
and allowed you to reach out to them now
lead generation is the process of
attracting and collecting information
from potential customers who have shown
interest in your products or Services it
involves strategies and activities to
capture the attention of individuals who
may be interested in what your business
offers the goal is to turn these
interested individuals or leads to
customers by nuturing the relationship
and guiding through the sales funnel

them into the mail so if your audience
is on Twitter keep in mind that long
blogs might need to be linked or
shortened always prioritize providing
value ensuring each piece of content
serves a particular purpose all right
now the next one is lead generation

lot of people do like this another way
is through YouTube whether you're
building a website YouTube channel or
any other platform it's crucial to
acknowledge that you must reveal the use
of affiliate links the Federal Trade
Commission that is FTC mandates
transparency when earning income through
endorsements emphasizing the importance
of openly disclosing such affiliations

promote or like do affiliate marketing
in videos in your own videos because a
lot of traffic after Google comes to
YouTube and the traffic you can navigate

traffic to your affiliate link so as you
can see this guy has attached an
affiliate link and also get up to 40% on
this protein powder so you can click on
this and he can get a commission out of
it
and make sure that the product you are
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing is the right product and then
only you can build a relationship with
your audiences so as you can see this
guy has done that so you can do that and
this guy has like like 340,000 views and
let's say if he's getting 2,000 or 3,000
clicks on this protein by suggesting
them so you'll get the commission a lot
of commission from that so this is a
nice way of promoting or doing the
affiliate marketing and this is how this
is a great way in fact this is the best
way I would say to do the affiliate
marketing because it is quite easy so
he's basically navigating that views or
that traffic to the affiliate link so

and stronger connection with customers
so paying attention to these platforms
and building a strong presence there can
really help the business to grow all
right so once you have started building
a social media presence then you can
start with finding a niche when you're
starting in digital marketing it's good
idea to find a specific area that you're
really good at this would be things like
social media marketing making websites
or helping business to show up in higher
Google searches by focusing on one of
these things you can become an expert in
that area and stand out from other
digital marketers for example if you're
really good at making websites you can
focus on that and become known for it
when businesses need a new website
they'll come to you because they know
you are the best at it the same goes for
the other areas like social media
marketing or helping businesses with
their Google ads all right so this was
about finding a niche now next you can
do is create a website all right so
first you can start by creating a
website for your business this is like
having an online store or office where
people can come and learn about what you
do it's a bit of having a shop on the
internet next you can create a logo of
your business a logo is like a special
picture that represents your business
you can use a free tool called canva to
make a logo that looks nice and shows
what your business is about after that
you can use a free website builder
called vix to actually make your website
vix is like a tool that helps you put
together all the parts of your website
like pictures text and buttons without
needing to know how to code by doing
these things you can have a nice looking
website with a logo that represents your
business and you can do it all for free
this can help your business look more
professional and make it easier for
people to find you online so once you
are done with creating the website then
you can attract leads with Organic
advertising so attracting leads with
Organic advertising means promoting your
business without paying for ads instead
you use things like social media making
helpful content and improving your
website so that it shows up higher in
the Google searches for example on
social media you can post interesting
things about business that people will
want to share with their friends with
content marketing you can create useful
articles or videos that people will find
they search for things related to your
business and with SEO you can make sure
your website is set up in a way that
makes it more likely to show up when
people search for things you offer by
using these methods you can attract
people to your business without having
to spend money on ads all right so this
is how you can attract leads with
Organic advertising now next step would
be building networks so building
networks means going to events seminars
and workshops where you can meet people
who might want to use your service or
who work in the same industry as you by
doing this you can make friends with
other businesses and learn about the
newest trends in digital marketing this
can help you find new clients and also
get tips from others in the same line of
work so building network is a good way
to make connections and stay up to dat
with what's happening in the digital
marketing world all right so next step
is content marketing so content
marketing is like telling a good story
to people who might be interested in
what you are selling so instead of just
saying buy this you create helpful or
interesting things like articles videos
or pictures that help people want to see
this can make people trust you more and
see you as an expert in what you do it's
like building a strong wall around your
business to protect it and make it all
stand out when you do content marketing
you're not just trying to sell something
right away you're trying to make people
interested in what you do by giving them
something valuable
this can bring more people to your
business without you having to chase
after them it's like making a magnet
that pulls customers to you instead of
having to push hard to get their
attention so content marketing is a
smart way to show people that you know
your stuff and to bring more customers
to your business without being too pushy
all right now the next step is gather
feedback so Gathering feedback is an
important part of running a business it
means collecting comments reviews from
my customers to understand what they
like and what could be improved good
firms Yelp and Google my business are
all places where customers can leave
feedback about their experience with the
business good firms is a platform where
business can be reviewed and red by
their customers helping other people
decide if they want to use that business
too Yelp is a website where people can
find a review find and review local
businesses like restaurants or shops
Google my business is a tool that lets
business manage their online presence
including customer reviews by gathering
feedback on these platforms business can
learn what they are doing and where they
can make changes to better serve their
customers it's a way for business to
listen to their customers and improve

providing you with a complete toolkit to
boost your search engine rankings unlike
many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SEO power suit so for
that we will focus on four things that
is keywords on page SEO back L and
building and first we'll have to focus
on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understanding of keyword and overall
market dynamics so first of all we'll
have to create a project over here so
over here we'll have to type the URL of
this website and so I will just type
here
b.com it's an eCommerce site all right
so now we'll click on next then again
we'll connect on next and here you can
enter the keywords if you want and if
you don't want then you can proceed by
clicking on next
here you can add more search engines
Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean it's
your choice if you want to add it or not
I just don't want to add all these
Google and Yahoo are sufficient then
we'll click on
finish all right so our project is
getting ready all right so it is loaded
so first of all we'll start by
understanding the menu bar so the menu
bar is like the control center like of
rank track offering a set of drop down
menus that help you manage your projects
and preferences so let's understand
first so this is file so this menu
handles basic commands relating to your
project such as opening closing and
saving files it's your goto for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
tailoring rank tracker to suit your
needs then there is is window so window
this menu provides a list of supported
hot Keys like keyboard shortcuts and
allows you to quickly switch between
different modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation and action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the system
all right then here comes the project as
you can see project this menu is like a
project management Hub it displays a
drop- down list of all the projects
currently open in rank tracker allowing
you to easily switch between them so
only one project is there so it is
showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and then open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
projects with this command you can do
that then close this option allows you
to exit then as we can see check all so
check all rankings in all the open
projects simultaneously with this
command it steam lines the process of
gathering information across your
various projects then you can also login
like found in the SEO pow Cloud login
area this is where you log to access
Cloud related features all right so this
was about the menu bar now coming to the
sidebar so quickly let's understand this
one so first of all there is a dashboard
as you can see project dashboard this is
your project Central Hub it provides a
visual summary of key statistics related
to your organic traffic ranking progress
and how Val your competitors are doing
it serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this moduel you will
find a list of keywords you're targeting
it shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as you can see next is keyword
research so here it is so here you can
explore new keyword ideas using over 20
different tools like it is in there the
module allows you to analyze and
categorize new keywords into groups and
move them to Target keyword section all
right so as we can see these are that
20 different tools the tools that we are
talking about then there is Sur analysis
that is SCP analysis this is for
in-depth keyword analysis it provides
you detailed analytical report on
websites competing with you for the same
queries then competitors research this

domain strength it offers overall report
on your website's SEO strength showing
how it evolves over time then there is
report reports this module is for
generating and you know delivering
reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research we click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as we can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the so
store let's
say all right now I'll click on
search make sure the URL is correct
and it might take some time it is
fetching something it is collecting the
keywords and then it will compare the
keyword profiles all right so this is
what it is this is the result and as we
can see keywords and this is organic
traffic this is URL of the so
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and access their performance we
can you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely on rank tracker to
recommend the most relevant ones within
your specific Niche now after this you
can explore keywords with various
keyword research methods like keyword
Gap search console Keyword Planner
autocomplete tools related searches
keyword combination Etc so as you can
see all these are over here you can have
a look at these and explore these
meanwhile we can explore this keyword
sandbox as you can see keyword sandbox
with the help of this we can filter our
keywords which is the next step all
right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eluting those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website so
factors such as search volume as we can
see
and keyword difficulty and competition
can guide you in selecting Target
keywords effectively so as you can see
these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficulty is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like drag like
we can see so it's your choice you you
can filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
tracked now your keywords will appear
also in the tracked keyword so like I
have tracked this one and this one so
interact keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website auditor
so website auditor ensures your website
is optimized on the page and checks if
it functions well technically and in
terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type
the website that is
de.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as you can
see to get a good ranking on search
engines it's important to optimize your
site first of all in terms of both
technology and content we will be using
website auditor for this job but before
that let's have a look at what all
things are there so first of all we'll
explore similarly that we explored in
the previous one so this is the menu bar
and I think we have explored this and
this is the sidebar it is bit different
from that so let's explore the sidebar
so site structure we have as you can see
this section organizes all the elements
of a website including its pages and
resources it provides like a visual map
of the site along with an audit
dashboard that accesses various Su
factors so as you can see page audit
over here now the page audit will do the
page level analysis so this was the
function of page audit then domain
strength is there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with a little demo so first we have to
create a project that we already created
and wait till the tool crawls and
collects all the pages on your website
so that we have done already now we'll
go to site audit so as you can see here
under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit we'll address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there then we can easily do
that with the help of this tool
all right so next we can do is
visualization as you can see over here
under site audit we click on that now to
ensure visualization basically is used
to ensure your site is well structured
the tool transforms your website into a
visually intuitive app once generated
you can effortlessly Sport and address
like issues orphan Pages isolated
sections redirects broken links and more
so this is what it is used for on the
right side you can arrange the pages
based on the click depth as we can see
click depth internal page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if you switch to internal
page link as you can see we click on
that you can see how the internal link
are spreaded like it is bit different
sorting by Page views if would
see it lets you see which pages are
visited and viewed the most and least
but we not able to figure it out as of
now for that I think we'll be needing a
Google analytics account and we'll need
to log in with that all right so after
reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in rant
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say I want to
write
joggers
watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts
sliders
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket
hoodies
shs all but I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
and import from CSU or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have rote the keywords over
here now we'll click on create map now
the program will take few moments to
harvest all data for the keywords and
the tool automatically identifies the
pages most relevant to your keyword
group for specific keyword so this is
showing only one it should at least show
five because website auditor will
suggest the top five most fitting Pages
for each keyword of group
so we must add more keywords I
believe we can add manually or we can
just have a look at rank tracker also
like hellfire club shirt we can
see can add that
all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just hover
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it
is all right so we'll have to hover over
this and we'll click on map now with the
ready keyword map ensure your landing
page is optimized for Target keywords
now we'll go to content audit first so
here we can adjust the target settings
set the default search engine for
competitor page and assign a specific
one for the current page so as you can
see they are showing the errors and
warnings so that we can improve on it
and and as it is showing make your page
meta description approximately 22 word
long so it is showing how to fix also
basically and it will talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content
editor so this is content editor
basically what it does is to start
editing an existing page you will need
to choose between the editing modes
first of all as we can see so it might
take some time when you click on that
after doing that it might take like 5 to
10 minutes after it will show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily you know edit this
site also and properly write an SEO
optimized title so as you can see 33.2%
optimization rate is there it is showing
and other than that we can click on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description
tags and you can see how those fit into
the intersections the recommended number
of characters based on the best SEO
practices so as you can see 311 160 you
can easily edit that and make it SE
friendly also all your Target keywords
will show up in the mapped keywords as
you can see the mapped keyword H is
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as you can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
manually change the
recommendation so you can do that
then the recommend recommended keywords
this section will list the keywords that
have been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so now let's just go to back links
now for back links we'll have to go to
SEO spy glass it is a useful tool for
checking backlinks it helps you gather
and analyze your own backlinks as well
as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type
b.com all right now we'll click on
next Su power suit
and we can also change this as per our
choice let's
say We'll click on so these were the
number of backlinks so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while SE spy glass
collects backlinks statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of backlinks that this site
has 130,000
domains
9,622 and IP is
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the data so search engines
prioritize websites that have backlinks
from reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spammy sites
can negatively impact your domain's
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on any
efforts to build it further
so this involves examining and
evaluating all the back links already
directed to your site so we are going to
do that and SEO spy glass is one of the
best tool for that so step one find the
pages linking to your site for that
together all the back links directed to
your site you need to initiate a new
project in SEO spy class that we already
did and now we can navigate to back
links
profile we click on back links
all right so the tool will examine its
index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful matrics
essential for further
analysis so as we can see backlink page
domain in link rank linked page links
back so all the backlink pages are there
it is also showing
130k back links all right now coming to
the linking domains so in linking
domains module you can quickly switch
between all domains new or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one
like do
inor
g.net so like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor texts module will show the
summary wiget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of back links you can also see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over any cell in the back links
domains columns you'll see the icon of
expanding the list of urls to look
through so as you can see these are the
backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referal
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referral traffic module this is
the referral traffic module and back
rink profile this is backlink profile if
you want to analyze your website you can
come here in your S Class once you click
the update traffic Button as we can see
over here update traffic
stats or this also will work on this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics or the backlinks in the
project after the task finishes you'll
see the results in the workspace you can
and then switch between views linking
domains and backlink pages so the
linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to
summary So within this module examiner
sum you can like including key metrics
to identify both the strengths and
weaknesses of your site now we can Peak
at your competitors backlink profile
also now is the moment to access your
backlink profile in comparison to your
competitors achieving Superior SEO
performance is crucial for securing a
higher ranking than your competitors to
do that go to domain comparison first of
all as you can
see now this is our domain now here
we'll type the competitor domain let's
like the so the sold
store.com all right the spelling is
wrong the sold store it
is all right click then there is
smitch doco
doin all right
and one more is there let's
write
mantra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
you'll see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors's domains as we can
see bag.com the sold store snitch.com
now you can easily compare on the basis
of different matrics there are various
matrics over here and as you can see
there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
b.com and these are for snitch and these
are for soul store.com so you can easily
compare them on the basis of different
metrics all right now coming to the next
step which is spot the dangerous links
before progressing to actual link
building phase it's crucial to address
one final task identify and remove
potential and harmful back links so for
that we will go to backlink profile then
the penalty risk so backlink profile
this then we'll go to penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisable to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
post minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on the particular link
as you can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will tasked update
back L page data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SE spy glass now let's do the link
building with link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assist in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and backlink and Target
settings
all right so as we can see uh we can
like first of all we'll type
b.com right now so as we have provided
the web address select your desired
Target country so Target entry over here
and the language also you can select
from this and other than this the apps
search engine will be tailored
automatically according to your
preferences Additionally you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is the
app will analyze the backlink profiles
of potential prospects and eliminate
those containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on
create all right so this is the list out
now so first by default this will
include the list of top 100 backlinks or
the competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see six predetermined methods or
the configure customized search this one
configure a customize search using the
expert mode this is the expert mode
basically so these options enable you to
conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect your C if
you lack seed keywords you can utilize
the get keyword suggestion feature this
function automatically identifies your
top 20 ranking keywords that generate
the highest
traffic all right so now step two would
be let's say let's explore this one
guest posting top 100 blocks we'll click
on this all right so by employing this
search technique you can identify the
top 100 prospects ranked by organic
traffic using specific search operators
related to your seat keywords to
initiate the search input the seed
keywords here you will write down the
seed keyword so let's say I just want to
write winter
Weare all right
and you can also do the search engine
settings but I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on this
so these are the contact information
this is the page previews and this is
the prospect preview and additional
details are also there you can select or
unselect all the results to be moved to
the prospects like
this right so then we'll click on move
to projects on Hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects all right so these are the
prospect that you that we have moved now
that we have possess a recently compiled
list of potential links it is crucial to
access their quality and prioritize the
ones we intend to reach out to initially
we'll go to
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL
and update so here is the update and
select contact info so as you can see
contact info we'll click on okay now
that we have settled on the list of
factors you would like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated
like I'll click on uh contact
information and press okay like
that all right can do for this one also
all right so the next step is to reach
out to prospects utilize the app to
initiate Outreach directly taking the
convenience of having all the contact
details at your disposal by connecting
your email account to link assistant you
can centralize and organize your
campaign's correspondence efficiently
within the application begin reaching
out from the app since you already have
everyone's contact info simply link your
email to link assistant and all your
campaign messages will be saved in one
spot
so you can just click on this and then

operations. web.com it has taken the
information from contact info and once
you have linked your account or email
then you can it will update over here
then you can simply send it apply and

what that product is so you can use the
ebook in many ways so in this video
let's understand how to create ebook for
that let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat gbt so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the interest you have the
passion
and you're good at it for example let's
say somebody's good at the knowledge
regarding cars or regarding bikes or
regarding anything he must he or she
must have the value to provide to the
audiences that content he should write
the ebook on for example so let's take
an example like I'm writing an ebook on
how to make money online right so what
should I write so I'll start with
writing the prompt just a second there
we go
write
an ebook
for
titled how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated
images for each
chapter this
ebook will contain
eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there titled how
how to make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed charity to create
eight pages divided into six chapters
each chapter will be explained in
humanlike Manner and long paragraphs it
should be long paragraphs also use AI
generated images in between the chapter
for the better explanation so let's see
what the result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products online affiliate
marketing online tutoring and courses so
six chapters are there all right so chat
GPT has given us all the chapters that
we have asked chat GPT for now we want
it the images also like AI generated
images also so let's write a prompt for
it as we are not able to see the
images so I'm writing where are the a
generated images that I asked for
I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here chgb is
giving us I believe it gives us
chapterwise images all right so it is
giving us chapterwise images here is the
air generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
are a generated images that we asked for
and now we can use each of these images
in between the ebooks selling products
online affiliate products and online
tutoring and courses the images what I
think the images is pretty well that I
expected now you rebook how to make
online includes a agen images for each
chapter all right so what we asked for
chat gbt it gave us sometimes it happens
that what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now the thing is
we want all these images to be inside
this one in this doc not this doc but
this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include it in between can you include UD
these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use this also this one
only we
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write
compile let
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document
file all
right I think Chad gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another prom let's just stop it
and and just copy paste this one and
we'll be adding another prompt so that
we can tell Chad gbt that use this
format instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see chgb has
given
the answer I have compiled the document
with converted JP f is properly
integrated you can download the Ewok
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that chat
GPD has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own chair gyy helped us in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is how to make
money online so now we can also make the
changes in between the profit of writing
the document in Word is that only we can
always convert this document into PDF by
going to various sites but let's just
create first in the document file so
that you can also do editing and changes
and if you want to add something then
also you can easily do that so that's
why we have created into the document
format so as we can see freelancing then
there is the image as we can see we can
also resize it all right as you can see
we have resized it so this way you can
also edit it and whatever you like I
mean it's up to you it's it's very
subjective to people what they want to
do for their ebook so it's up to them if
they want to add something in more
detail or they can also Showcase with
the help of an example then they can
definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well and another thing is let's say uh I
want to change it a bit like let's say
online service and market research is
there then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what will I do is
we'll simply copy paste it or you can
use from chat GPT also we have copied it
and now we'll go to chat GPT all right
now I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand
it now I copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want chg to more explain explain
it in an elaborated way so here it is
blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your n setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that CH gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simp simply copy it let's say I've
copied it now I'll go back to the doc
this is the doc and I'm just showing the
example right I'll just paste it now
let's
see all right online
surveys and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added and
basically we got the format basically
all these things are done so we don't
need to worry about that even we want to
make any changes it is very easy to do
that as we have just saw now the next
thing that we want to focus on is the
mockup or the cover photo or the mockup
photos for that basically we want to
Market this digital product this ebook
we want to Market it so what we'll do is
we'll have to create a cover or mockup
so there are many ways to do that and
as we told you that we will be creating
this free of cost how to do all these
things in free so we'll go to canva all
right now we'll write a prompt uh what
prompt should we write we write create a
AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster image
for ebook that I can use as a cover for
it all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give me
the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over
here create few more
only create image and not the
background is creating some more images
let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the
last
photo so basically you have to
manipulate chat to give you the exact
thing that you are asking for so for
that you have to write multiple times
The Prompt sometime it happens so it's
pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert this
by mistake I wrote something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the
image sorry this is the image
and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpreter session expired I
believe we'll have to create another one
so let's say we want to download this
we'll have to make sure it is in the JP
EAS for
formit so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one and let's see save mockup
so this is how you can create a mockup
for your digital product your digital
ebook and then you can easily download
it so once you have downloaded it you
can put it into use now the next thing
is how you can Market it that is the
next challenge for that you have to go
to the free websites that can that lets
you to upload all the your ebooks and
sell it there are many websites some are
paid and some are free also but before
moving there let me tell you guys the
version of chat gbt that I'm using is
chat gbd4 you can also do the same thing
with chat gbt 3.5 also but it doesn't
give you the feature of downloading all
these images or whatsoever you want so
for that you don't have to worry all you
have to go is to go on
canva and we click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you'll do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as chat
gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy all these the
all the content that we uh previously
done and just paste it over here and you
can also add page or something like that
so it is very easy you can you know edit
this so it'll be easy for you and then
you can download it so you don't have to
worry if you don't have the paid version
of chat gbt you can easily do that in
with the help of canva so you don't have
to worry about that now coming to the
part where we were explaining how to
Market it how to sell it and where to
sell it basically so for that we'll go
to a site instam MO
so it allows you to you know create your
own digital product and sell it free of
cost so for that we'll log in it's
pretty simple and so once we have logged
in so we have to fill up the details so
basic detailed it is very easy you can
easily fill up the details as it is
showing payment collection is not
enabled on your account so I'm showing
you the demo of it so that's why I've
not done that but it is very easy and
it's free of cost so it is very easy for
for you guys as well so once you have
done the sign up and all as you can see
shortcuts add a product digital file
even ticket manage store categories
there are many things not only ebooks
you can Market over here there are many
things you can do right so for that what
we'll do is we'll go to add a product
digital file so our digital product is
our ebook for that we have created a
mockup that we have downloaded it from
KVA this one so now we have the this
option of adding a product so you can
see I'm a coffee like this you can do
you can set the price and you can put in
the account details so people who are
