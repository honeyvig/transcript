hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn this is harsh
bharadwaj and in today's session we will
learn about constructor and destructor
in c plus
so without further ado let's get started
in this session we will understand
what is a constructor in c plus its
declaration and how a constructor is
different from the function then we will
cover
types of constructors that is default
constructor parameterized constructor
and a copy constructor
and then we will discuss constructor
overloading and destructor in c plus
but before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
so first is what is a constructor in c
plus plus
in c plus constructors are special
functions that are different from normal
functions
they are used to initialize objects of a
class
whenever an object is created the
constructor is invoked or called
automatically even if we do not create a
constructor the compiler automatically
creates a default constructor
now let's move to the declaration of the
constructor
constructors are the member functions of
a class that has the same name as that
of the class and it doesn't have any
return type
a constructor can be defined inside the
class and outside the class as well
using the scope resolution operator
the syntax of a constructor is as
mentioned
inside the class cons we can see there
is a constructor which has the same name
as that of class
that is cons and we can initialize
variables inside it
this constructor will be invoked
automatically when the object is created
now let's understand how the constructor
is different from functions
there are some differences between
constructors and functions
so the first is constructor doesn't have
a return type unlike function which has
a return type
next is the name of the constructor must
be the same as that of the class and it
is not so in case of function
third is whenever an object is created
then a constructor is invoked
and the last one is
function can be a virtual function but
it is not so in case of constructors
so these are some differences between
constructor and a function
now coming to types of constructors
there are actually three types of
constructors in c plus that is default
constructor parameterized constructor
and a copy constructor
so let's start with the default
constructor
a default constructor is a constructor
that doesn't have any arguments inside
it it can either be declared explicitly
or can be generated automatically
which means even if we do not define the
constructor
then also it is generated by the
compiler
for example here cons is the default
constructor
in this case the name of the class would
have been cons that is why the name of
the constructor is cons
now coming to the parameterized
constructor
a parameterized constructor is similar
to that of the default constructor the
only difference is we can pass the
arguments to the parameterized
constructor
the constructor can be overload and also
be used to initialize elements
here is an example of the parameterized
constructor
cons is the name of the constructor and
n1 and 2 are the parameters of the
constructor
now
coming to the copy constructor a copy
constructor is a type of constructor
which initializes an object using
another object of the class
in this constructor properties of one
object is copied to another object
this copy constructor is invoked when an
object is passed as a parameter
if a class has pointers or there is some
dynamic memory allocation then it is
necessary to have a copy constructor
its syntax is as follows
here cons is the name of the constructor
and ampersand obj is the reference of
the object as we have understood all of
these three constructors so let's go
ahead to our next topic that is
constructor overloading
like functions constructor can also be
overloaded
and it is pretty much the same as
function overloading
the constructor must have the same names
and the difference in the number or the
type of arguments will decide
which constructor should be called
here in the example we can see two
constructors with the same names as that
of the class are being overloaded
here the difference in the number of
parameters will determine which
constructor will be called
now coming to the last topic that is
destructors in c plus
just like the constructor the destructor
is also a special function
which deletes or destructs the object as
soon as the object goes out of scope
it basically delocates the memory that
has been assigned to the variables the
name of the destructor is same as that
of the class name with a tilt sign the
destructor doesn't have a return type
and it also doesn't take any arguments
and here is the syntax of the destructor
so as we have covered the theoretical
aspect of this topic so let's go ahead
to our code editor and cover the
practical examples on this topic as well
so this is visual studio code and here
we will do some examples
of constructors and destructors in z
plus plus so let's start with default
constructor example first of all we'll
create a new file
and we'll name it
cons
one dot cpp
all right so now first of all we'll
write the header files
hash include iostream
now we'll write the using namespace
standard
now we'll start with the main function
and inside the main function
we will create an object
so now we will create an object of a
class let's say the name of the class is
book
and object is b
all right
let's write this
now
we have to create the class
so let's create the class
class book which is the name of the
class
and inside the class we'll declare a
variable
which is private
so let's start
pages
is the name of the variable
and
we'll make this variable as private
all right
after this
we'll write the public access specifier
and
now we will create a constructor and
inside the constructor we will
initialize this variable pages
so all right
and make sure to
make the constructor inside the public
access specifier
all right now
we'll assign
let's say 250 to
this variable pages that is the number
of pages is 250 let's say
now
we will display a message
like let's say
the name
of the book
is
the compound effect
it's a famous book
and
after that we will write endl
for the next line
now again
we will display a message
which will display number of pages so
we'll write
number of
pages
and now we will write the variable pages
all right
and after the class we will put
semicolon
and
let's try to understand it again
when we create this object b
this constructor will be called and this
variable that is pages will be
initialized
with the value 250
then this message will be displayed and
then
the value of this variable pages will be
displayed
as we can see we haven't passed any
arguments to this constructor it is a
default constructor
we have created an object of the class
book and
that's how the constructor is
getting called
and let's try to run this hope it works
firstly we have to save it by pressing
ctrl and s
now let's try to run it
as you can see the name of the book is
the compound effect
and number of pages is 250 is that we
have initialized it
250.
so this is the example of a default
constructor
now let's do another example
now we'll do an example of parameterized
constructor
so let's name this first
cons 2 dot
cpp
all right now
we'll include the header file
hash include iostream
using namespace standard
now
we'll start with the main function so
we'll write int main
and inside the main function
we will create an object
of a class let's say bar
the object of this class would be b
and we'll pass the arguments let's say
40
and 35
all right
by mistake we have
wrote this
all right now after that we'll write
return 0
now let's create this class bar
so we'll write
class
bar
and inside the class we will
here we will declare two variables which
will be private so
[Music]
let's say
private
and and the name of the variable is
drink
and
another variable would be people
all right
now we have to create the constructor
so we'll write the public access
specifier
and now we'll create the constructor
which is of the same name as that of
class that is bar
and now
the
parameters would be d
and
p
so we are passing these parameters that
is 40 and 35 to this constructor as this
is a parameterized constructor
so now we will assign
these parameters to the to the private
values
that is drink and people that is the two
variables so we'll write
drink
equal
d
that is we are assigning the value of d
to the variable drink
so and we will do the same for
p variable
we'll sign the value of p to the people
variable
once we are done with this
then we have to compute it or do
something about it so let's say we have
to multiply it so
it would be
total
cash like the number of drinks into
number of people that how many cash is
collected by selling those drinks so
we'll create this variable
int total cash
this is a function
inside this function
we will multiply the cost of a single
drink with the number of people
so let's say
as the
return type is int so
we have to return
we can't display over here
so
drink
into
people
drink into people
all right
now
semicolon in the end
and
we have to call this function as well
so let's do that
we'll write c out
and
then we will display a message let's say
total cash
collected
then
now we will call this
function
total cash
b total cash
b is the object and total cash is the
function
all right
after that we have already mentioned
return zero
so now save it by pressing control and s
and let's try to run this
as you can see total cash collected 1400
and we know 40 into 35
will get 1400 that is the right answer
so as we can see
here we have created this object b and
pass these arguments 40 and 35
and this is the parameterized
constructor bar
these values are then assigned to these
variables drink and people
and then
we have called this function b total
cash this function over here
and the value
by multiplying drink into people
is 1400 that is 14 to 35 equals to 1400
so this is the example of a
parameterized constructor
now
let's create a new file
and we'll do an example of constructor
overloading
so let's name it first
cons 3 dot cpp
so here we will do an example of
constructor overloading so first of all
we'll create
we'll write the header files
hash include iostream
then namespace standard
then again we will start with the main
function
and inside the main function we will
write the name of the class let's say
the name of the class would be overload
and
the name of the object is one
so here we will
create a parameterized constructor so
that is why we will send
two arguments let's say 20 and four
and we will create another object
overload
o2 because we want to do constructor
overloading so we have created o2 object
and here we will pass let's say three
arguments
so we'll pass let's say 50
comma 65
comma 30
in the first object
in the first constructor we are passing
two
arguments that is 20 and 4 in the second
constructor will pass three arguments 50
65 and 30
all right now let's write return 0
and now we can create the class
let's say
class overload
now inside this class
first of all we will
create this
variable result res
all right
inside
this after this we will declare
public access specifier
and we will create the constructors
the constructor would be a parameterized
constructor because we are passing the
arguments
so
overload is the name of the constructor
within capital o
and we are passing two arguments in the
first constructor
so
and x comma enty
now in this we will multiply
and will store it in this
res variable
so x into y
all right after this
the second constructor
and in this constructor we are passing
three arguments
and as you can see the name of both the
constructors are same as that of the
class but the only difference is the
number of arguments
in this constructor you're passing three
arguments
and
now we will store
the sum of all of these three variables
x plus y
plus
z
once it is done we will put a semicolon
in the end
and now
we have to somehow display the result
so we will create
a function
into the data type
result is the name of the function
and
we will simply
return
the variable res
and now we will
call this function
inside the main class
so before that
we will display a message let's say
result
of
multiple
is
right one
o1 dot res
one dot result sorry
because result is the name of the
function and we are calling the function
after that and line
then we'll write
result
of
condition
is
then we'll write o2
dot
result
and
semicolon
and we have already mentioned return 0
so
let's save it by pressing ctrl s
and let's try to run this
there is some error
okay this is scope error
we have to include this function inside
this class
so
let's say
now let's try to run this by
after saving this let's
run it
all right
by mistake we
write this wrong all right now let's
save it
and now let's try again
here it is result of multiplication is
80 and result of addition is 145
as you can see
and 20 into 4
is 80 and when we add 50 plus 30 80 80
plus 65 would be for 145
so our result is
right and we have successfully compiled
the program and run it
so in this example we have
we are doing the constructor overloading
as we are passing these two
arguments to this constructor with same
name as that of this constructor and we
are passing three arguments to this
constructor
and
we are not actually calling them we are
just creating the object and passing the
arguments
okay now let's do an example in which we
will use destructor as well
so let's create a new file and name this
as
cons4.cpp
all right now let's include the header
files
now name space standard
all right
now we'll write into main
inside int main we will
write the name of the function let's say
the name of the function is formula one
and f is the object
and now we will pass the parameters
let's say 370
and four
here we are passing the speed and the
pickup of a particular car and let's
make it
f instead of d
so f is the object and formula one is
the name of the class
after that for now let's say return zero
and now
we will create a class
class formula
one
will declare
two variables
which are private
int
speed
and end
pickup
now we will create a constructor
which is parameterized before that we
will
use
public access specifier
and
now we will create this constructor
formula one
and parameters are int as comma int
p
now inside it first of all we'll display
a message
saying that this is a constructor
all right after that we'll write endl
now we will assign
the parameters to these variables we
will assign the value of s to speed
and the value of p to pick up
all right
after that
we'll
make a function
display
and we can display inside this function
as the data type is void
and so we'll write
speed
is
then we'll
write the speed variable
and end l as well
then we'll write
pick up is
pickup variable
then handle
all right
now we can create a destructor
we'll use tilt sign then
formula one which is the name of the
constructor
then
here we will write a message
so that we get to know that we are
inside the
destructor so we'll write
formula one inside it will write this is
a
destructor
and the sign is
here it is
now
write semicolon
after the class and
so first of all as the object is created
the parameterized constructor is called
370 and
4 would be assigned to these variables
speed and pickup
and then using the function
here we will call this function display
so we'll write f which is the object dot
display
which is the name of the function
and that's it
then once the values are assigned then
these values
will be displayed
when this function is called
using the object f
and then this is a destructor is called
as
the destructor is called in the end of
the function when the scope ends
so when the scope of class object is
ended then this is a destructor is
displayed that is why we have
displayed this message
so
after
saving it
let's try to run this
you can see this is a constructor
first this is getting printed
then speed is 370 speed is 370. pickup
is 4
and this is a destructor as we can see
is getting printed in the last
and if we just
cut it over here and just paint it here
and we can just paste it over here
and save it and let's try to run this
again
ah there's a variable by mistake we have
all right now save it and run it again
as you can see this is a constructor
speed is 370 pickup is 4
this is a destructor it is again
getting printed in the last
so this shows that the destructor
deletes
the object as soon as the object goes
out of scope
that is in the last
so these were some examples of
constructors and destructors in c plus
you can try some more examples on it it
will help you in understanding this
topic in a better way
all right guys with that we have come to
