welcome to this new video by simply
learn can ban is a visual project
management and workflow management
methodology that originates from lean
and agile principles it is designed to
help teams to manage their work more
efficiently by visualizing the workflow
limiting work in progress and optimizing
the flow of task or work items from
start to finish like scrum can ban is
also one of the methodologies used in
agile a data from surveys by pragmatic
engineer says 69% of survey respondent
are using either scrum or can ban if you
are looking to become an agile expert
then here we bring you certified scrum
Master CSM certification training course
by simply learn some key features of
this course include two days of online
virtual classes two-year membership with
scrum Alliance 20 pdus and 16 seus
include CSM exam fees as well by the end
of this course you will be skilled with
scrum and agile methodologies importance
of agile scrum life cycle scrum
terminologies daily scrum and review
roles involved in scrum and distributed
scrum so hurry up and enroll Now find
the C Link in the description box so
without any further Ado let's begin by
understanding different steps in Canan
methodologies followed by difference
between scrum and Canan and an example
on how Canan methodology is implemented
but before we begin consider subscribing
to Simply learn and hit the Bell icon to
never miss any updates from us let let's
start by knowing different steps
involved in cban methodology the Canan
methodology follows a set of steps or
principles to help teams manage their
work effectively here is a simplified
overview of the typical steps in the
Canan methodology number one visualize
the workflow create a visual
representation of your work process
using Canan board this board consists of
columns that represent different stages
of your workflow for example too Ino
progress done each task of work item is
represented by a card that moves through
these
columns next is limit work in progress
set WIP or work in progress limits for
each column on the board WIP limit help
prevent overloading a team and ensure a
more controlled flow of work for example
if a column has a WIP limit of three the
team can only work on three tasks in the
stage simultaneously number three manage
flow focus on achieving a steady and
continuous flow of work through the
system analyze the flow regularly
identify bottlenecks and address them to
optimize process next is make process
policies explicit clearly Define and
make explicit policies rules and
procedures that govern the workflow this
ensures that everyone on the team
understand how work is done and what
standards are in place next we have is
Implement Fe feedback loops establish
regular feedback loops to monitor the
performance of the system conduct
regular meetings such as daily standups
to discuss progress identify issues and
make adjustments use a pull system adopt
a pull system where work is pulled into
each stage of process based on capacity
rather than being pushed onto the team
this helps to maintain a balance between
the demand and capacity continuous
Improvement Embrace a culture of
continuous Improvement regular review
the canand board and the team's process
encourage feedback and collaboration to
identify areas for improvement and
Implement changes and the last one is
evolve gradually Implement changes to
the process gradually avoid making large
disruptive changes at all once instead
evolve the process Based on data
feedback and the team's capacity to
adapt these steps are iterative and are
meant to be continuously refined over
the time C ban is designed to be
flexible allowing teams to adapt to the
changing priorities and improve their
processes incrementally the methodology
encourages transparency collaboration
and a focus on delivering the value
continuously now let's try to understand
the difference between scrum and can ban
scrum and can ban to widely use agile
methodologies differ in their principles
and practices here is a comparative
overview in scrum work is organized into
fix length iteration known as Sprints
typically lasting for 2 to 4 weeks a
detailed planning occurs at the start of
each Sprint with a fixed scope of
duration a prioritized product backlog
is maintained and items are chosen for
each Sprint based on priority and
capacity specific ceremonies like Sprint
planning daily standup Sprint review and
Sprint retrospectives are integral scrum
emphasizes on cross functional teams
where members can can assume different
roles moving to can ban work is
visualized on a can ban board
progressing continuously without fixed
iteration no fixed time frames for
planning work is pulled as capacity
allows there are no fixed backlogs work
items are pulled from a pool as capacity
permits no prescribed ceremonies
meetings are held based on team's needs
roles are more flexible allowing team to
specialize in specific areas so to bring
the key differences all together scrum
uses fixed length iteration whereas
Canan ban is more continuous scrum
involves detailed planning at the start
of each Sprint whereas Canan allows for
dynamic and continuous planning scrum
defines specific roles Canan offers
flexibility in team structure scrum has
specific ceremonies whereas scan ban
lets team decide on meetings based on
their needs scrum use prioritize product
backlog whereas scan ban pulls work
items from a pool as capacity allow
now you must be confused when to use
scrum methodology and when to use scan
band here are some key points to
remember while choosing methodologies
use scrum if stable team structure is
preferred fixed length iteration suits
your Project Specific roles and
ceremonies are valued however use SC ban
if work is more continuous flexibility
in role and processes is crucial and
visualization and managing flow without
fixed iteration is preferred teams often
used based on Project Dynamics Team
preferences and organizational needs
with some even opting for hybrid
approach known as scrumban so now let's
understand can ban methodology using an
example imagine you are managing a
software development project using can
ban methodology so here is a simplified
example to illustrate how canand Works
visualizing the workflow create a can
band board with columns representing
different stages of your development
process for Simplicity let's say you
have three columns to do in progress and
done adding task you start with several
task in to-do column so initially you
have task a b and c in to-do column next
is moving task as team begins working on
the task move it from to-do to in
progress now you have three tasks
actively being worked on limiting work
in progress set a WI limit for the in
progress column let's say three tasks at
a time this means that your team can
only work on three tasks simultaneously
see here team starts working on the task
a b and c simultaneously completion and
feedback as task are completed move them
to the done column over here task a is
completed first move it to done and then
team is ready to pull a new task say
task D from the Todo column however task
B and C are still in progress and task C
is completing next and moving to done
the team continues this process always
maintaining the WIP limit and until all
the tasks are completed continuous
Improvement regularly review your canand
board in team meetings identify the
bottlenecks or areas where tasks are
piling up adjust WIP limits or workflow
as needed to optimize the process so
