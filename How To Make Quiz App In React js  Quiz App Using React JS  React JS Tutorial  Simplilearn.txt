and roll now and shape your future
success all right so now we'll have to
navigate to the vs Studio to create this
app for that we will be creating a
folder first of
all let's create a
folder let's name it
chat react
quiz
react quiz all
right now let's go to visual studio code
so this is our Visual Studio code and as
we can
see this is the Explorer we'll go to
Open folder
and we
will as you can see we will select this
one react quiz in the desktop that the
folder that we have just created select
folder and in this folder we will be
creating this app all
right
so yeah let's first go to the
terminal now
npx
create re
app npx create react
app my
app so this is the command that you can
put and this is the command that is
being used to create an react app so you
can start with this you can also copy
paste it from the visual website so now
the app is being created we'll have to
wait for some time time all right so it
is done as you can see now we can
navigate
to it's fine like we know we'll go to
the folder CD so we named it my app so
we'll have to go inside my app now we'll
do npm
start all right npm start the server
will be online now as you can see it
will open a server
Local Host 3000 so here our app will be
displayed all right
perfect so now let's start with creating
the app first of all we'll have to check
on my app inside my app we have this SRC
folder app. CSS
app.js index all of these things are
important some of them are not important
but we will not focus on that all right
so first of all we will be creating this
quiz app so for that we'll have to
create a component let's name that
component as
questions right so for that
questions.
jsx all right so we have created this
questions. jsx so this will be the main
component basically where all the
functionality will take place mostly
so let's start by importing the library
import react from
react all right now this is the
component so we will be naming it as
questions which is the name of the
component in the return we will write
first of all we'll write the div and
create a container basically so let's
add div so here basically div we will
start with the div element that reps all
the content of our quiz application so
we have written div and we'll also
mention the name of this div after some
time now inside this div uh basically we
have to create a paragraph that is p
element that serves as the heading for
our quiz application it displays it will
display the basic heading like quiz app
or something like that so let's start
and create that all right so we'll start
with it sorry it is p class name just
close the P
first yeah let's name the class as
container write now inside this what we
can do as of now let's not do anything
we'll simply write
quiz
application yes that would be fine or
all right now uh after this we will be
creating a container div that is another
div element with the class name
container this div holds the main
content of our quiz application
basically so let's proceed with that all
right so another div okay so this will
contain the
entire thing or the functionality so
let's name this one as container and
change the name of the paragraph above
all
right let's name it heading txt or
something like
that all right so yeah in this we will
write the complete functionality of this
code most like 90% of the functionality
here we will write so now the next the
first thing that we'll be creating is we
will use a turn operator to show the
result uh to conditionally render
different content based on the value of
the show result State variable aable
that we will create the show result
State variable we can create now also
and we can create afterwards also but as
of now let's keep in mind we are
basically conditionally rendering
different content based on the value of
that show result State variable so let's
first create it so that there will there
is no
confusion all right
so show
result we just creating US state hook
and then set show
result and think we should keep it as
Boolean
false all right so now let's start
writing now here we will use a component
basically so that component is let's say
question result we will create after
this but as of now let's pass some value
into it we will be creating that
component after some time question
result
okay yeah question result now let's pass
some things like we'll have to pass some
scores and all so basically what we are
doing is like if the show result
basically is true we will render the
quiz result component passing in probes
such as score total score and try again
function if show result is false we
render the quiz question along with
options for the user to select quiz
question so let's start we'll be passing
these so first of all we'll pass score
so GSX brackets all right now total
score will be
needing total score will
be depend on the DAT data let's name It
Quiz data quiz data do
length so here we'll write another
function that let's name that function
as reset all so we will be writing all
these functions after this so you don't
have to worry about it like reset all
function will be writing let's write it
this way all right so here we are I just
first want to create a basic
structure right
now last
[Music]
name
question all right so so inside the div
with class container if show result is
false we render the quiz question we
have another
with class question to display the
question number and the actual question
text the question number is displayed
using a span element with the ID
question number and the question text is
displayed using another span element
with the ID question. txt not question.
txt but question txt let's say we access
the question text from quiz data array
that we will show you after some time
using the current question State
variable so that quiz data array is
basically the data that we have created
it is basically an array with the number
of questions you can add questions as
far you want but we have already created
this that we will be uh showing to you
all right so let's start
[Music]
span fan ID is question
number all
right
all right now another
span this one's ID would
be let's say question. txt yeah as we
discussed SL
txt all
right
all right so as you can see here the
thing is uh you might be confusing
current question plus one why we have
done it because we want to increment the
question by one so that's why we have
done it as we can see question number
this pan ID is for the question number
and this for the question text and this
is basically our array that we will be
be showing to you we will create this we
already have the data of this quiz data
array so basically what we are doing is
we are accessing the question text from
quiz data array using the current
question State variable and you now
you'll ask where is the current question
State variable that we'll have to create
like we did this similarly we will be
creating that all right here we can see
uh without wasting time current question
here is the current question and this is
basically the updator so it will update
this current question and the
initialized value is zero all right so
up to this you understood the code now
let's move on to the next part now here
what we'll do is below this question
basically div we have another div with
class option container that we'll create
to hold the options for the current
questions so what all the options that a
current question has it will hold those
questions all right so basically in this
one we will map through the options
array for the current question questions
from quiz data that quiz data array and
render a button element for each option
so yeah let's start and I'll explain to
you all right so now let's start all
right let's create a
Dev all right
jsx what we'll write
is quiz
data current question
state
DOT
option
container not option container no not
option container but option
do map we mapping basically so we have
option
dot options it will
be change.
map here we are using the map function
to map each element of the quiz data all
right
turn
all right now inside this button there
will
be nothing actually CL name
let's do
something yeah now before writing let me
explain the button text that we'll be
creating is set to current option text
and its class is dynamically set based
on whether the option is clicked or not
when a user clicks on an option it
triggers the set click clicked option
function to update the clicked option
State all right so clicked option state
that also will be creating the use state
so you don't have to worry we'll create
that so the button text is set to
current option text and its class is
dynamically set based on whether it is
clicked or not so we'll be writing a
condition for that all right so let's do
that so this is our condition so let me
just complete the code and then I'll
explain to you
right
I
cck all right
so yeah after this what we can do is so
by
mistake it got closed over here but it
should all of this came under the this
button
right now in between this button and the
button there must be jsx
option all right so now let me explain
what is this like you must be confusing
this code so uh here this code
represents a button used in a quiz it
has a special class named option Button
as we can see here it is option button
so uh for styling purpose it is now
depending on whether the the button is
selected it dynamically adds a checked
class to change its appearance the key
attribute helps react keep track of each
button when clicked it triggers a
function set clicked option as we can
see to update the chosen option the
expression I +1 ensures each button has
a unique identifier overall this button
visually highlights the selected option
and updates the quiz State when clicked
making it Interactive and user friendly
for quiz participants all right so this
was about this so let's move on to the
further code now we will have to create
the US state hooks also so let's first
complete the code all right it was like
this only all right so after this D we
will be getting an
input
type
button value would be let's say next
next
ID
next
button all right yeah on
click all right so this is what it is
now let me explain now this is the
basically the next button after
displaying the options uh we render a
input button with the value next and the
ID next button as we have given when the
user clicks on this button it triggers
the change question function to move to
the next question or display the
question result if all the question have
been answered so this is basically the
next question button and if all the
questions have been answered then it
will simply display the result all right
so this is what it is it will trigger
this change question function now let's
create the uh what we call U States
above but before that as we are
including use State then we have to
include this use State all right now
after that we'll have to import some
other things as well like
import quiz
data
from
SL data we will also import the
component that is question result but
for that we'll have to create it first
we will be creating that let's create
the use State hooks for score as you can
say this score one all
right now use
state zero we will initialize it with
zero all right now another one is
con click
function click option actually yeah and
set CLI
[Music]
option new
state all right so one of this is false
all of these are zero we have
initialized it with all right
now now the quiz data array so let me
just show you here we have this quiz
data array we have already created this
so we're just going to copy paste it and
go to SRC and new file name It Quiz
data.
jsx right now we'll just copy paste it
and here we can import it so we already
imported it so no worry
yeah these are the question that will be
asked all right now we'll have to add
the functionality for changing the
question we have wrote the code but we
haven't wrote the functionality so we'll
write
cons change question let me just first
write it and then explain it to
you all right so now update score this
is another
function so first of all it will provoke
this function now I will put a condition
if current question is less than quiz
data do
length minus
one then Set current question current
question this
one
set all right right so here what we are
doing is so basically the change
question function this is basically the
change question function this is
responsible for updating the current
question handling the transition between
questions updating the user score and
determining whether to display the quiz
result once all question have been
answered so here this is update score
this update score we will understand
afterwards we will be creating this
function so let's just understand the
conditional statements after updating
the score in the conditional statements
the function checks if the current
question index that is current question
is less than the total number of
questions in the quiz data array minus
one that is quiz data. length minus one
if the condition is true it means there
are more questions remaining in the quiz
all right so so after that moving to the
next question for that Set current
question current question plus one now
if there are more questions remaining
the function updates the current
question state by incrementing it by one
using set current question current
question plus one this moves the quiz to
the next question additionally it resets
the clicked option state to zero using
set clicked option zero that we will
have written so this ensures that when
the user moves to the next question no
option is pre-selected that means end of
quiz if there are no more questions
remaining that is if the current
question is equal to the total number of
questions minus one the function sets
the show result state true using set
show results true that here we can see
here so this indicates that the quiz has
ended and the result should be displayed
to the user this is how it is now let's
create this update score function so
let's
start
const
score so in if condition we'll write
click
option
triple equals to yeah
click option triple equals
to quiz
data quiz data that is the data array
just a second by mistake this happened
yeah quiz data now under this current
question okay dot
answer so in this we will set the score
like set score the use State hook this
is basically the updat score + one we
basically updating the score use State
all right so this is it this is const
update we are updating it so let me tell
you this is the update score function
the first action within the change
question function is so this is the
change question function when this is
initiated this is the first that is
being taken so uh the updates this
function is responsible for updating the
user score based on their selection for
the current question it checks if the
option selected by the user matches the
correct answer for the current question
and update the score accordingly so that
is why only we have this triple equal to
if it is matching then only the score
will be added otherwise not so this was
it now after that there's another
function known as re reset all function
so let's create that function con reset
all set show result
false
Set
current equation
set let me just first write these and
then I'll explain to you
zero then set
score Z this is basic as the name is
suggesting this is basically for
resetting basically the reset all
function is essential for providing
users with the option to restart the
quiz from the Beginning by resetting All
State variable associated with the quiz
progress so set show result Falls as we
can see first of all this line sets the
show result State variable to false
indicating that the quiz result should
no longer be displayed so the Set
current question zero that is being
written so this line sets the current
question state with variable to zero
indicating that the quiz should start
again from the first question then as we
can see set clicked option is there this
line sets the clicked option State
variable to zero ensuring that no option
is pre-selected when the quiz restarts
then set score this line sets the score
State variable to zero resetting the
user score to zero so when the reset all
function is called it essentially revers
the quiz back to its initial states
allowing the users to start the quiz
question or quiz a fresh now the only
thing left is to create this component
question result all right so let's just
create
this question
result do jsx all right so now I'll
explain the code to you guys let me just
write it so as you can see this is the
code question
result and now I'm going to explain to
you rather than writing so the thing is
question result is a simple component
used to display the quiz result and
provide an option to try the quiz again
it receives props from its parent
component that is uh what we call this
question. jsx or app.jsx the parent
component is basically app.js making it
reusable and adaptable to different quiz
scenarios so this is a react functional
component named question result it
receives props that is score total score
and Try Again from its parent component
uh the component returns GSX elements
enclosed in a fragment inside the
fragment there's a div with cloud
show score as we can see so uh this show
score displaying the user score and
total score below that there's a button
element label try again which triggers
the try again function when clicked then
there are props props score basically
props do score represent the users score
passed from the parent component props
do total score represent the total
possible score of the quiz passed from
the parent component then props do try
again represent the function passed from
the parent component which is called the
try again button is clicked so then the
question result component is exported as
the default export using export default
quiz result so the thing is in the
parent component you would import
question result component and use it
where wherever necessary for example if
you have a quiz component in the parent
component you might render question
result below the quiz to display the
result you would pass down the propes
like score total score function for
trying again the question result
component from app.js all right so
basically here in this component you'll
have to just know that basically
displaying the result and provide an
option to try the quiz again like it
basically receives props from parent
components making it reusable adaptable
to different quiz scenarios basically
this is what we are doing now the final
thing that we're going to do is just
include our questions component over
here all
right so as you can see one error one
warning is there questions is we'll have
to export and import it
also so there are few syntax error as we
can see but we'll figure it out first
let's just
export
questions yeah export default questions
app.js here we will be importing
it
import
questions from
do
slash
questions all
right there are few errors not in this
but over
here it's mostly syntax error let's try
to figure these out there are few errors
two errors it is showing
now res set all okay one error is this
all right quiz data have done by mistake
it should be question
result all right now here is some error
that I need to figure
out yeah there it
is all right now let's
see okay so we need to import this quiz
data also that's why it is like this
let's just quickly import it all right
so we have used this GSX brackets that's
why it is saying because we haven't done
the named import when we are doing the
named import then only we use it as
we're exporting by default so we don't
have to do that all right so let's see
so it is like this now let's do some CSS
styling of it all right so we have
included the CSS we will be attaching
the CSS in the description you don't
have to worry about it now let's see how
our app is looking so it completely
changed how it is looking you can also
add Transitions and something make it
more styly something like that so which
of the following is used to manage
component State and react this is the
first
question so use State this is the
correct answer I'll also select some
wrong answers
also so that we can show you the score
in the end what does CSS stand for
getting sty
sheets all right next which of which is
not a JavaScript data type let's
say object just let's
say what was the year was JavaScript was
La 1996 let's say now let's see there
were four questions right so let's click
on
next so as you can see we scored two out
of four okay let's try another one use
State style
sheets all right integer let's say 1995
4 out of four yes we passed the exam or
the app so this is how you can create
this app if you click on try again it
will again load uh the code will be
provided in the description box all
