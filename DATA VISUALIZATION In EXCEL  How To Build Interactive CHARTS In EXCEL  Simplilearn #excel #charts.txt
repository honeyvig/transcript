without further Ado let's get started so
you might have wondered that Microsoft
Excel is just another data storage tool
which saves your data in terms of rows
and columns but what if I tell you it's
a lot more than that it cannot just only
save your data but also perform some
exploratory data analysis on your data
set and create some impressive charts
graphs and interactive dashb exactly we
going to discuss that data visualization
part in Excel so without further Ado
let's get started with the data on Excel
and perform our data visualization with
Excel so right now we are on the
Microsoft Excel so if we go to the
insert option in the panel here you can
see we have a wide range of charts
available right so here you have all the
charts so all these individual charts
are based on data visualization you just
have to give the data set that you want
to work on and here you can see the
recommended charts option here what
Excel does is it will read your data set
and it will understand which of the
following charts that are available here
will be the most recommended ones or
which are the ones which can help you
with the best data visualization right
it can automatically read your data set
and it will give you the recommended
charts and you can choose one of them
for example here we have a list of
charts right so we have column line pie
chart bar chart area right all these
charts so today we will be working on
the most important ones or most of these
available charts here so I've got a list
of uh charts lined up here so I've got a
small data set for each and every one of
these so that we have a brief
understanding of how exact exactly these
charts work right now we'll get started
with the waterfall chart over here right
let's quickly close this and let me
select the entire data set what's
present on the data sheet here so if you
kind of zoom in a little you can see
this is just uh another business data
which is dealing with Revenue investment
gross margin admin expenses net income
right so um if I select the data and go
back to charts over here you can
automatically see it is recommending me
different types of charts here right
it's giving me a cluster chart it's
giving me a pie chart it's giving me
some other type of chart which is here
clustered bar right it's also giving me
a funnel type of chart right so right
now we want to create um waterfall chart
so if I click on this particular one it
will give me the waterfall chart which
looks something like this if I click on
okay there you go you have your waterful
chart so here you can see the increase
and decrease so if there is an increase
it'll be represented in terms of blue
color and if it's decrease or decline in
terms of you know profit or loss it will
highlight in terms of orange color so
it's called The Legend which gives you
the total briefing of what exactly is
going on with your chart so uh this is
the first first type of chart that we
worked on you can ignore the chart title
and in case if you want to modify this
you can go to this particular option
which gives you all the edit access to
your charts you can you know do some uh
background edits and you can also change
some fonts Etc and if you want to do
some more of that you can see you can
eliminate access lines you can add some
Legends grid lines Etc right so you can
also do that so with that we have done
with the first type of sh but just the
Bold chart let's go back to The Spar
lines so you might wonder what do you
mean by Spar lines right now we have a
list of uh business data with the
regions we have North Region South
region East West Central now let's say
your manager wants a brief uh you know
uh result or report which will uh tell
about the performance of the individual
zones right and uh if you give him
numbers he might not understand what
exactly is going on with your business
but what if there was a way which could
visually represent the performance right
and U you might wonder uh how can I
create um you know you you might have to
create five different charts for all
these and you have to add them onto you
know five different pages and this might
be complicated no that's not the way you
just you know create one single bar
graph or a line graph right over the
sales of your no zone right right in
front of your n Zone from q1 Q2 Q3 and
Q4 and you can give them the performance
report right next to the numbers over
here so that's what I'm talking about
the spark line charts so if you click
you know if you select all the data over
here and go to insert option and the
recommended charts then you can find
smar lines over here you can just go to
the line type of spark line or you can
also go through the column right you can
select any one of those I'll try to
select the column one so it's asking me
for the data range give the data range
right over here and press okay now you
can also drag this across all the cells
it will take the you know cell data from
this particular cells Accord you know
based on it will reference the cells
right over here and it'll give you a
report and in case if you don't want uh
the bar type of graph you can change it
directly to a line graph which will be a
little more easier to understand if
there is a growth or dip or drop right
so here you can see the East sales are
going down and every other sale except
for the central every other sale has
seen a depth and now it's slowly growing
right so that's how you can you can
create a spark line chart and the next
type of visualization that we will be
dealing in Excel is about the uh heat
map so heat maps are another good way of
representing the performance of your
data whichever let's say uh you wanted
to calculate the revenue or if you
wanted to visually represent the growth
of Revenue or the drop of Revenue of
your sales U through a visual
representation then heat maps are the
best you can find out which is the high
EST performing month or which is the
highest performing year and uh you can
also identify which was the lowest
performing year just by looking at the
colors right now we can either select
the entire data set right so we have the
2013 over here so you can either select
the entire data set and perform the heat
map analysis or you can just
individually select a row I mean a
column or you can select an individual
row and find out which particular month
or which particular year perform best so
now we will be trying to calculate or
we'll be trying to generate a heat map
for individual years so let's get
started with 2013 and you can just go to
data or you can just go to home to
conditional formatting and here you have
uh databas right you can go yeah we have
the color scales so here we have the
heat Maps right so you can go with the
first one which will say green is the
best performing and red is the worst
performing so click on that and you can
see in 2013 we have July as the best
performing month right and the worst
performing must be the June right so
similarly let's try to create a heat map
for 2014 it's same color skilles heat
map let's take a little
while
so here you can see we have created a
heat map for individual years to find
out the best performing month and the
worst performing month right so apart
from generating colors as HTE map what
you can do is you can go through the
conditional formatting once again and
here you can see we have color scales
but apart from that if you want to uh
you know uh change these into a datab
bar you can find out so that you can
find out the best performing uh you know
sale you can also do that you have
databas over here and if you're not
happy with the databas or colors you can
also go through some icons so here if
you see we have directional icons which
will directly tell you you know which
will indicate the best performing month
in terms of an arrow Mark so the one uh
the one which is pointing towards
upwards in green color will show that
it's the highest and best performing
month and the yellow color which is uh
you know pointing towards right it will
indicate that was it was a medium
performance month and the one with the
lower side and red indicates the worst
performing month right so you can also
do that to enhance your visibility right
right so here you can see we have the
best performing months in terms of green
colors and arrow Mark is pointing
towards up and the ones with the wor
performance are you know indicated with
lower arrow keys and red color you can
also do that right and uh with that we
will go to the next type of uh chart
which is a funel chart if you highlight
the data set a little you can see this
is again the business data which will
tell you about the expenses that you
spent on your company which are part
operational expenses technology expenses
employee training development expenses
you know so if you want to represent
this in form of uh funnel let's say then
you can also do that by going through
the insert option data visualization
charts and here you have one of the
recommendations as funnel you can just
select that and there you go now you
have a detailed funnel type chart which
will explain the operational expenses
technology expenses basically all the
expenses that you spent on your company
and uh the numbers that you spent right
you can expand this so that you have the
complete you can also edit this if you
go to the edit option you can uh you
know what you can do is you can
indentation you can you can keep the
indentation towards the left and or if
you want you can keep the ination in the
in terms of midal that can be done right
so now we moving forward we will look at
tree chart so uh tree chart is similar
to a heat map which will basically uh
instead of representing them in terms of
colors it will represent them in terms
of shapes right the highest spent or the
highest pricing will be uh represented
in the terms of the biggest box and the
lowest ones will be represented in terms
of the smaller boxes so here we have
another um business data what we have
here so we might have a small store
which works on electronic items and uh
it might be a pill kind of data which
you have over here which will represent
what type of device uh you are selling
spares and what type of spare that you
have sold what's the rate of each and
every spare item and how many number of
units you have sold and what's the price
that you made as Revenue right so if you
select all this data and go to insert
option and go to charts so you have a
lot of charts over here and the and you
can see treat chart is one of the
recommended chart you can also go with
sunburst type of chart you can go
through bar graph column uh graphs
everything so here we are focusing on
three type of charts so select that and
okay there you go so you have three
categories which is PC Mobile and a
computer you you can consider them as
laptop so um if you minimize a little so
here we can see we have the highest
number of revenue generated from laptop
so laptop LCDs have given you highest
revenue next one is the hinges and then
you have laptop key pads mobile test
place at the fifth position right so
that's how you can create a three type
of data visualization chart using Excel
next one is area chart so uh area chart
and line charts are similar to each
other the only difference is if you are
going with the area chart okay let's go
with the line chart first so that you
have a brief or better understanding so
we'll deal with the same data set here
let me expand this a little so again
this is a sales state of Northwest East
South and Central so based on ears so
select all the data go to uh insert and
uh the number of charts over here so if
you see both line graph and area graphs
are one of the recommendations over here
so the area graph looks something like
this and line graph looks something like
this so the only difference is in a line
graph the lines will be used to
represent your profits and gains and in
area graph the lines were used to
represent that particular profit or drop
will be covered with some color a
dedicated color and it will represent
that in terms of an area right that's
the only difference so if you click on
this line chart it will give you a line
chart and here if you click lines you
will have the color filled so individual
colors will be filled for individual
types of um data set that you have so
you have five different data sets so
five different colors will be
representing five different zones and
you will have an area for for that so
that's how line chart and area chart
works the next one is a bar graph right
bar and column graph so um the
difference is here we have the same
south east west in know it's a summation
of the total sales that happen in terms
of these zones and if you want uh to
identify which of the zones performed
best then the best way to do that is
using a bar graph or a column graph so
if you go through this here you have you
already have the best recommendation
right over here which is the column
chart and if you want that in terms of
bar you can also do that there you go
you have the bar charts and column chart
is no different it's also completely
similar to that instead of a bar graph
you will be selecting a column graph
which will show the data in terms of
verticals that's the column graph and
apart from that you might have got got
clustered and combination charts Etc now
the next one is boxes and whiskers so
boxes and whiskers will show you the
individual performance variations of a
student right we have uh okay here we
dealing with uh student data set so we
have five different students and three
different subjects physics chemistry and
maths so uh we will find the variation
between the marks of every student which
is the lowest marks obtained by a
student in a particular subject and the
highest mark obtained by the same
student in that particular subject let's
say we have student one in physics he
has scored 80 75
92 78 and 88 so we will have a bar boxes
and viscus chart which will explain the
highest Mark as 92 and the lowest will
be as 75 so uh we have five different
students and we will understand the
variations of each and every student and
each and every subject select all the
data set and uh go to insert option
which here and uh drop down and go to
all charts and here we have boxes and
whiskers so this is what I was talking
about the highest number of marks scored
by a student in individual subject and
the lowest number of marks scored by a
student in individual subjects so each
and every color will represent one of
the students blue for student one orange
for two and uh the hash color for
student three so on right just click on
okay and you have the box and biscus
charts right over here so the next type
of chart is the maps chart where you can
physically create a map which shows you
a physical map how exactly is going on
with the right so here we have the
countries as or you know the state as
the First Column and the population as
the second column so we can basically
select the entire data and create a
physical map which will show the density
of population in that particular state
so the highest or darkest color will
represent the highest population and the
lowest or the lightest color will uh
represent the lowest density of
population so how you can create is that
simply select the entire data go to
insert option and here you can see the
maps option just select that particular
map and here we have the first
recommendation as fi map so we'll go
with that and we have a map which will
show the population of that particular
state so here we have California as the
highest densely populated uh State and
here we have Montana as one of the
lowest or less densely populated states
so here we have the legend which will
describe the highest populated area and
the lowest populated area there you go
so with that you can create the uh maps
and next going ahead we have Scatter
Plots so you must be well aware of the
scatter plot which will show you the you
know uh graph in terms of uh scattered
uh nature and you have the highest uh
you know rainfall fall and so here we're
dealing with the uh rainfall data so the
highly the the serial numbers which will
describe the location you know so the
location which has the highest rainfall
and particul so you can basically create
that using a scatter plot just select
the entire data go to the insert option
and here you have the Scatter Plots just
click on that you can try to select the
type of plot you want so I'm go with the
first option there you go we have these
catap plots which will show you at the
rainfall and vertical a and now the next
type of chart we have is compo which
will be the last for this particular
tutorial and if you want us to create a
few more data visualization you know you
have a lot of charts over here so we
have line graphs P graphs and uh if you
expand the selection of the entire data
and if you expand the selection you have
a lot of charts over here we have
Sunburst we have histogram we have combo
right so we will be going with the combo
chart over here right so if you click on
this you can either go with the first
one clustered com column and line or you
know you can do any one of those so I'll
select
both press okay there you go so we have
the combo chart and uh that was the last
chart for the tutorial on data
visualization with Excel and if you want
