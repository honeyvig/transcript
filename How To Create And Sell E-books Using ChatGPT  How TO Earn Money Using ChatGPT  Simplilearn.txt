of creating an ebook and selling it
online it is primarily used for money
making also to get aware for I repeat
also it is used for the awareness of if
you're launching a product people use
ebooks to firstly show the demo of what
that product is so you can use the ebook
in many ways so in this video Let's
understand how to create ebook for that
let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat GPT so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the interest you have the
passion and you good at it for example
let's say somebody's good at the
knowledge regarding cars or regarding
bikes or regarding anything he must he
or she must have the value to provide to
the audiences that content he should
write the ebook on for example so let's
take an example like I'm writing an
ebook on how to make money online right
so what should I write so I'll start
with writing the prompt just a second
there we
go write
and ebook
for
titled how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated images for each chapter
this
ebook will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there titled how to
make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed chity to create eight
pages divided into six chapters each
chapter will be explained in humanlike
Manner and long paragraphs it should be
long paragraphs also use AI generated
images in between the chapter for the
the better explanation so let's see what
the result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products online affiliate
marketing online tutoring and courses so
six chapters are there all right so Chad
gbt has given us all the chapters that
we have asked chat GPT for now we want
it the images also like AI generated
images also so let's write a prompt for
it as we not able to see the
images so I'm writing where are the
generated images that I asked
for I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us
chapterwise images all right so it is
giving us chapter wise images here is
the air generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with Genera
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and and online service and market
research okay though these people are
doing online research and market
research online service and this is
blogging and content creation as we can
see these all our air generated images
that we asked for and now we can use
each of these images in between the
ebooks selling products online affiliate
products and online tutoring and courses
the images what I think the images is
pretty well that I expected now you
rebook how to make online includes a
images for each chapter all right so
what we asked for CH gbt it gave us
sometimes it happens that what you ask
it doesn't give at the first time then
you then you'll have to write the
another prompt for it as we did right
now all right now the thing is we want
all these images to be inside this one
in this doc not this dog but this what
we call ebook that we have written so
let's ask Chad gbt if it can include it
in between can you include these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask jgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use this also this only
we'll
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just write
compile the
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document
file all
right I think chat gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another prompt let's just stop
it and just copy paste this one and
we'll be adding another promp so that we
can tell chat gbt that use this format
instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's see
all right so as we can see chj has given
the answer I have compiled the document
with converted JP Fage properly
integrated you can download the ebook
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as you can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay okay so this is the ebook that
chat gbd has created you guys must know
that anything that we have written
inside it is not on our own CH G helped
us in writing all of this content and we
can see how properly it is written the
color scheme and all and this is how to
make money online so now we can also
make the changes in between the profit
of writing the document in Word is that
only we can always convert this document
into PDF by going to various sites
but let's just create first in the
document file so that you can also do
editing and changes and if you want to
add something then also you can easily
do that so that's why we have created
into the document format so as we can
see freelancing then there is the image
as we can see we can also resize it all
right as you can see we have resized it
so this way you can also edit it and
whatever you like I mean it's up to you
it's it's very subjective to people what
they want to do for their ebook so it's
up to them if they want to add something
in more detail or they can also Showcase
with the help of an example then they
can definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well and another thing is let's say uh I
want to change it a bit like let's say
online service and market research is
there then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explain I want it to
elaborate more then what will I do is we
simply copy paste it or you can use from
chat GPT also we have copied it and now
we'll go to chat GPT all right now I'll
write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand and
it now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to more I want chgb
to more explain explain it in an
elaborated way so here it is blogging
apart to sharing earning choosing your
Niche setting up your blog creating high
quality content monetize your blog and
advertising sponsored post everything
everything there are various points
there are five points that that J gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simply copy it let's say I've copied it
now I'll go back to the doc this is the
doc and I'm just showing the example
right I'll just paste it now let's
see all right online
surveys and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this this is the link that it has added
and basically we got the format
basically all these things are done so
we don't need to worry about that even
we want to make any changes it is very
easy to do that as we have just saw now
the next thing that we want to focus on
is the mockup or the cover photo or the
mockup photos for that basically we want
to Market this digital product this
ebook we want to Market it so what we'll
do is we'll have to create a cover or
mockup so there are many ways to do that
and as we told you that we will be
creating this free of cost how to do all
these thing in free so we'll go to canva
all right now we'll write a prompt uh
what prompt should we write we write
create a AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster image
for ebook that I can use as a cover for
it all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so don't
give
me the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over here
create few
more only create image and not the
background just creating some more
images let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the
last
photo so basically you have to
manipulate chat G to to give you the
exact thing that you are asking for so
for that you have to write multiple
times The Prompt sometime it happens so
it's pretty normal so don't just get
frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert this
by mistake I wrot something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this now we have
to select the mockup we want to create
so let's have a look at it so there are
pro also there are normal one also it's
up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the image
sorry this is the
image and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpreter session expired I
believe we'll have to create another
one so let's say we want to download
this
we have to make sure it is in the JP
format so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one and let's see save mockup
so this is how you can create a mockup
for your digital product your digital
ebook and then you can easily download
it so once you have downloaded it you
can put it into use now the next thing
is how you can Market it that is the
next challenge for that you have to go
to the free websites that can that lets
you to upload all the your ebooks and
sell it there are many websites some are
paid and some are free also but before
moving there let me tell you guys the
version of chat GPT that I'm using is
Chad gbt 4 you can also do the same
thing with Chad gbt 3.5 also but it
doesn't give you the feature of
downloading all these images or
whatsoever you want so for that you
don't have to worry all you have to go
is to go on
canva and we click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you'll do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatsoever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as J
jbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy Cy all these the
all the content that we uh previously
done and just paste it over here and you
can also add page or something like that
so it is very easy you can you know edit
this so it'll be easy for you and then
you can download it so you don't have to
worry if you don't have the paid version
of chat gbt you can easily do that in
with the help of canva so you don't have
to worry about that now coming to the
part where we were explaining how to
Market it how to sell it and where to
sell it basically so for that we'll go
to a site instam Mojo So it allows you
to you know create your own digital
product and sell it free of cost so for
that we'll log in it's pretty
simple and so once we have logged in so
we have to fill up the details so basic
detail it is very easy you can easily
fill up the details as it is showing
payment collection is not enabled on
your account so I'm showing you the demo
of it so that's why I've not done that
but it is very very easy and it's free
of course so it is very easy for you
guys as well so once you have done the
sign up and all as you can see shortcuts
add a product digital file event ticket
manage store categories there are many
things not only ebooks you can Market
over here there are many things you can
do right so for that what we'll do is
we'll go to add a product digital file
so our digital product is our ebook for
that we have created a mockup that we
have downloaded it from canva this one
so now we have the this option of adding
a product so you can see I'm a coffee
like this you can do you can set the
price and you can put in the account
details so people who are interested in
can easily buy the product from you so
it is very easy and it is also showing
physical product digital file even
tickets others so as we know in digital
file it is showing ebooks digital art
software or any file that can be
downloadable we click on this and then
you can easily upload the file so once
we have uploaded then we can here add
the image product image that is the our
mockup that we have
created all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional
and limit the number of downloads per
buyer so you can easily do all these
things it is very easy you don't have to
worry about that and all these features
are there then in the end you can just
Market it so using chat gbt you can
easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of chat gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
gbt also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can't download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
download it from there and I have also
shown you how to create mockups and all
so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
and do what you want to do all right
