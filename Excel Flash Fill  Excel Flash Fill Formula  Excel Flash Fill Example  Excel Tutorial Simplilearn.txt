hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about flash film in excel
excel flash fill is a feature of
microsoft excel where excel can sense a
pattern in a cell and apply the same
logic to extract the similar resultant
pattern out of the remaining cells in a
table
might be a little confusing right so let
us simplify it so let us imagine that
you have a text in one of the cells in
the excel sheet
and you wanted to trim a part of that
text for example let us imagine that
there is an assembly an assembly where
the car parts are assembled together to
finish a car so each and every part has
a code the serial number the product
code and the assembly code etc right and
you wanted to separate all those three
if you wanted to do that you might want
to use the trim function which might be
a little tedious to apply to all the
cells but what if i say there is a
simple key format using which you can
fill all the columns in the excel sheet
within a fraction of a second sounds
interesting right so that's exactly the
flash fill function in excel does
now before we get started let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies if you're a tech
geek in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
sinclair now without further ado let's
get started with the flash fill in excel
for that we might want to start the
excel to get in the practical mode
now we are on the microsoft excel
and remember the example we discussed so
this is a similar example
now the first column in the sheet is the
product detail so this product detail
consists of the product code that is one
one two next we have the product serial
number that is one zero zero two five
six three seven and lastly the assembly
code that is a s and x now we want to
separate this product detail into three
columns where we have the first column
to be storing the product code second
one to be storing the product serial
number and the last one to be storing
the assembly code so now if you want to
do that using trim function you might
want to apply the trim function here and
trim out the left part and again for the
product serial number you might want to
use the trend function again which might
go into a little complicated pattern so
to avoid the complications and and
decrease the time spent we might want to
use the flash fill in excel now let us
help excel
about the pattern that we might want to
generate so the pattern is one one two
and the next one is
three two two so now you can see that
the text was highlighted that was the
information from the excel that it
understood the pattern now going into
the next cell and holding the ctrl key
and pressing the e button will help us
to
fill the remaining cells in the column b
so that's how it is done and similarly
let's try out for the serial number
for that
the serial number is one zero zero two
five six three seven
now in the next cell we have one zero
zero three
six five two
now we can go to the third cell and
press ctrl e for windows and if you're
using a mac operating system then you
have to press command e
and all the serial numbers will be
filled so this will reduce the time in
separating the pattern and filling the
columns
now let's try the last column that is a
s x which happens to the assembly code
next we have f g and v
now the
shortcut method that is ctrl e and there
you go
now you might be wondering will it work
only for numbers etc etc or the text
which is properly aligned or separated
using a hyphen
no it can also be used for some random
text which is like this so let us
imagine that we have a text which is of
length like 20 or 30 and you wanted to
print only a part of it so here i'm
going to print the alphabets from
position fourth to position eight so
i've already tried the first one that is
taking out the
alphabets from fourth location to the
eighth location or the pattern of the
text that is i f er from jennifer lopez
and in the next cell we have the numbers
starting from the location four to eight
so that is seven seven six seven and
similarly we have the other cells
consisting of the names of few cars that
is alpha romeo bugatti veyron and next
we have superman returns text so now
let's press the shortcut key that is
ctrl e and make sure that all the
remaining cells are filled
so that's how the flash fill works
so the flash fill in excel will reduce
the time consumed to fill all the
columns by separating the text in your
main cell that is the column a which we
have here in this example and it also
reduces the complexity of using a trim
function in excel now with that we have
come to an end of flash fill in excel if
you have any doubts or queries regarding
any of the topics covered in this
session or if you feel that we have
missed out on anything important then
