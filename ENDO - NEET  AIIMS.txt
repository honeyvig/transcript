yes hi everyone I know that we are
running out of time so here we are to
discuss few diagram based questions that
we can expect in the examination hall of
Em's so going in detail this radiograph
gives an idea about pulp stones okay
they can ask you the methods how you can
manage these five stones okay
by using EDTA the regular questions on
EDTA the pH of EDTA is 7.3 the
percentage of EDTA used that is 17% is
works on chelation principle and the
bars that are used for the calcified
canals are molar bars so these are the
they can ask questions related to this
so next one this is you can't really
appreciate this is a talents cusp so
this is a the hint given is it is a
vital teeth so these can be very apical
semental dysplasia a single wavelength
laser that is argon laser which is used
to cure the composites see the apical
part this structure is called as an
apical Delta so this is an endodontic
child which includes axis opening
biomechanical preparation and operation
out of which the most important step in
the endodontic triad or in the render on
texas biomechanical preparation where we
are going to remove the etiology that is
bacteria and the most common cause for
the failure of the root canal treatment
is due to improper operation this is a
psychic triad which includes
ego and superego this is a periodic
triad which includes children dentist
and family and the fourth factor that is
added to is here that is society the
next course is the caries triad which
includes these factors and the fourth
factor that is added to the caries triad
which makes it as carry straight rod is
time that is new bond has given the
tetrad whereas triad was given by keys
this is the epidermal illogical triad
make a note known things so they can ask
you the treatment plan for this
particular case which is already a ames
repeat okay so the treatment plan is
very simple you need to go with a
regular root canal treatment okay
followed by you need to go for a
periapical surgery which with which you
can remove this
operated fire I hope these diagrams are
already discussed in the group just make
a note okay for the forceps this is a
right-angled forceps identify this
instrument this is called as band which
is called in a single teeth anesthesia
sta
which is a computer controlled device of
local anesthesia this is an interosseous
local anesthesia okay where you can
clearly see that there they kept a hole
and they are trying to deposit the local
anaesthetic solution in that hole in the
R&R bond
this is an intra pal pal where wait you
need to band the needle and you need to
deposit the solution into the palate
these are a type of retreatment files
regularly you know that the rotary files
or regular rotary files and apart from
this there is something called a
retreatment rotary files so if they have
some black states like this these are
called as DS here is pro taper rotary
files so these are few things that the
have given so make a note about the
regular speed regular speed of any
rotary files will ranges from 200 to 400
rpm where as you can see this statement
the recommended speed of the ProTaper
Universal ray treatment instruments is
500 to 700 rpm to remove that aperture
bare-ass cut a patch and carry the base
obturator and 300 is used to remove the
tastefulness
okay to remove GP you need to use a
higher speed so that is the main
important thing they can ask you or you
can you can learn it so if you want you
can read the slide d1 d2 and d3 these
are three files that are d series files
which are used for the retreatment
prototype reference i hope you guys are
very good at this please try to focus on
four is non-vital teeth 5 is avulsion 6
these with or without loss of crown with
the fracture of root 7 displacement of
crown without the fracture of crown or
root 8 is a displacement of fracture of
crown and mass and mind is the fracture
involving the deciduous take a known
thing regular thing the the diagnosis is
a list class 3 because there is a purple
exposure
trauma leading to discoloration
non-vital TL is class for this is a root
fracture without the displacement of
crown L is classics make a note about WH
for classification along with a list
classification nowadays they're more
focused on EE
as well as a lease please try to finish
against the fast as possible done for
now we'll be coming up with one more
video probably we should do best in the
aims exam so that's the reason why you
are coming with overloaded stuff
preferably many diagrams in this one one
and off day for you guys all the best
have a great day signing off
