start by knowing top front-end
development questions to Ace in your
interview
what is HTML HTML stands for hypertext
markup language and it is the language
of the internet it is a standard text
formatting language used for creating
and displaying pages on internet HTML
documents are made up of the elements
and tags that formatted properly and
display it on pages
so we have our next question now what
are HTML tags so the answer for this
question is HTML tags are used for
placing the elements in a proper and
appropriate format tax use the symbols
greater than and less than to set them
apart from the HTML content the HTML
tags need not to be closed always for
example in case of images the closing
tags are not required for an image tag
now followed by the second question we
have our third question what are HTML
attributes the attributes are the
properties that can be added to an HTML
tag that change the way the tag behaves
are displayed for example an image tag
an image stack has SRC attribute with
which you can use the source from which
you have to display the image from
now the attributes are added right after
the name of the HTML tag inside the
brackets the attributes can only be
added to opening or self-closing tags
but never in closing tax
now followed by third question we have
our next question what is Mark you in
HTML Mark U is used for scrolling text
on a web page it Scrolls the image or
text up down left or right automatically
to apply for a mark you you have to use
my Q tax now we have our first question
how do you separate a section of text in
HTML we separate a section of text in
HTML using the below tags which are the
Break Tag paragraph tag and block code
The Break Tag is used to separate a line
of text it breaks the current line and
shifts the flow of the text line to a
new line followed by that we have the
paragraph line the paragraph line is
used to write a paragraph of text and
third one the block code the block code
tag is used to define large quoted
sections now we have our sixth question
Define the types of lists in HTML so we
have the three types of listen HTML
which are the ordered list unordered
list and definition list so first we'll
discuss the audit list the ordered list
uses ol tag and displays elements in a
numbered format next we have the
unordered list the unordered list uses
UL tag and displays elements in a
bulleted format thirdly we have the
definition list the definition list uses
DL DT and DD tags and displays m in the
form of definition like a dictionary
next we have our seventh question how do
you align list of elements in an HTML
file we can align the list elements in
an HTML file by using indents if you
indent each nested list and further than
the parent list then you can easily
align and determine the various lists
and the elements that it contains now we
have our eighth question differentiate
between ordered list and unordered list
so the answer for this question is an
unordered list uses UL tags and each
element of the list as written between
Li tags the items are displayed as
bullets rather than numbers now coming
into ordered list so for creating an
ordered list you'll be using ol tax and
each element inside the list as written
using l i tags the list items are
displayed using numbers rather than
bullet points now we have a sample on
the screen right now so the first three
elements are a set of unordered lists
which are represented using bullet tax
and the second set which is the coffee
tea and milk is an ordered list which is
represented using numbers
now moving ahead we have the ninth
question how do you display a table in
HTML web page so the table in HTML can
be created or displayed using the table
tag
so it also uses to manage the layout of
the page for example header section
navigation bar body content photo
section etc etc so given below our list
of HTML tags used for displaying table
in an HTML web page so we have table TR
th etc etc table is used to define a
table TR is used to define a row in a
table t h for header TD for a cell
caption is used to define a caption and
we have the call group which is used to
specify a group of one or more columns
in a table for formatting next we have
call which is used with call group
element to specify column properties for
each column next we have the body which
is used to group The Body content in a
table next we have t head T footer which
are used for header content and footer
content respectively moving forward we
have our 10th question how do you
display the given table in an HTML web
page so the answer for this question is
written on the right side part of my
screen this is the sample code which you
can use to represent or display a table
which is given in this particular format
over here now followed by this we have
our 11th question how do we insert a
comment in HTML so the answer for this
question is we can insert a comment in
HTML by beginning with lesser than sign
and ending with a greater than sign for
example as shown in the right side part
of my screen which is hello world now
moving ahead we have our 12th question
how do you insert a copyright symbol in
HTML so you can insert a copyright
symbol by using Ampersand copy semicolon
or Ampersand hashtag 169 semicolon in an
HTML file now moving ahead we have our
13th question so what is a white space
in HTML so the answer for this question
is an empty sequence of space characters
is called as white space in HTML this
white space is considered as a single
space character in HTML white space
helps the browser to merge multiple
spaces into one single space and so
taking care of indentation becomes
easier
white space helps in better organizing
the content and tax making them readable
and easy to understand with this let's
move into the 14th question
how do you create links in different
sections within the same HTML web page
so the answer is Anchor text we can use
anchor tag along with referencing
through the use of hashtag symbol to
create several links to different
sections within the same web page moving
ahead we have the 15th question how do
you create a hyperlink in HTML so the
answer is we can use anchor tag again
here the same thing we can use anchor
tag to create a hyperlink within the
HTML that links to another web page the
hyperlink can be added to images too now
moving ahead into our 16th question if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
an image map so the answer for this
Quest
kinds of web pages using this single
image it can be used for defining spaces
in the images that are made part of the
image mapping process
moving ahead we have our 17th question
why do we use stylesheet in HTML a style
sheet helps in creating a well-defined
template for HTML web page that is both
consistent as well as portable a single
style sheet template can be linked to
various web pages which makes it easier
to maintain and change the look of the
website now the 18th question what is
semantic in HTML
so the answer for this question is
semantic HTML is a coding style it is
the use of HTML markup to reinforce the
semantics or the meaning of the content
for example the semantic HTML B tag is
not used for both statement as well as
itac which is not used for italic
instead we use strong and EM text now
followed by the 18th question we have
our 19th question what is SVG in HTML so
the HTML SVG is used to describe the
vector or raster Graphics SVG images and
their behaviors are defined in XML text
sheets it is mostly used for Vector type
diagrams like pie charts two-dimensional
graphs in an x y coordinate system now
moving ahead we have our 20th question
what would happen if there is no text
between the HTML tags so the answer for
this question is really simple there
would be nothing to format if there is
no text present in between the tags
therefore nothing will appear on the
screen some tags such as the tax without
closing tag like image tag do not
require any text between them now
followed by the 28th question we have
our next question how do you create
nested web pages in an HTML so nested
web pages basically mean a web page
within a web page we can create nested
web pages in HTML using the built-in
iframe tag the HTML live frame tag
defines an inline frame for example
which is displayed on the right side
part of my screen you can see the iframe
source which redirects the user to
Simply learns official webpage
now followed by that we have our 20
second question how do you add buttons
in HTML so we can use the built-in
button tag in HTML to add buttons to the
HTML web page so on the right hand part
of my screen you can see the
implementation of button to an HTML web
page now followed by 20 second question
we have our 23rd question what are the
different types of headings in HTML so
the answer for this question is there
are basically six types of heading tags
in HTML which are defined with H1 to H6
tags
each type of the heading tag displays
different text size from another where
H1 is being the largest and H6 is being
the smallest so on the right hand part
of my screen you can see the
implementation of heading tags from H1
to H6 now the
output for this particular code segment
is the H1 H2 s3h4 H5 H6 so you can see
that H1 is being the biggest one and H6
is being the smallest one now moving
ahead into our 24th question how do you
insert an image in the HTML web page so
the answer for this question is you can
insert an image in the HTML web page by
using the following code which is
displayed on the right side part of my
screen you can see we have a image
source is equals to tulip.jpeg which is
used for inserting an image into your
HTML web page
now our 25th question what is the alt
attribute in HTML now the answer for
this question is the alt attribute is
used for displaying the text and place
of an image whenever the image cannot be
loaded you to any technical issue so
basically when you have poor internet
connection and you are trying to load
elements you can see some sort of text
in place of an image so that particular
text is nothing but the alt attribute
now moving ahead we have our 26th
question how are hyperlinks inserted in
the HTML web page you can insert a
hyperlink in the HTML web page by using
the following code which is present on
the right side part of my screen you can
use the ank attack along with h
reference and inside that particular tag
you can use the URL to which you want
your users to redirect to now followed
by this we have our 27th question how do
you add color to the text in HTML so the
answer for this question is you can add
color to the text by using the following
code which is present on the right side
part of my screen where you can add a
red color and blue color green color to
this particular paragraph and headings
now followed by 27th question we have
our 28th question how do you add CSS
styling in HTML so there are three
particular ways to add CSS to your HTML
there are inline CSS external style
sheet and internal style sheet we'll
discuss each of these methods in a bit
more detail first we have the inline CSS
so it is used when less amount of
styling is needed or in cases where only
a single element has to be styled to use
inline Styles add the style attribute in
the relevant tag now moving ahead we
have the external style sheet this is
used when the style is applied to many
elements or HTML pages each page must
link to the style sheet using the link
tag
now we have the last one which is the
internal style sheet it is used when a
single HTML document has a unique style
and several elements need to be styled
to follow the format internal stylesheet
is added in the head section of the HTML
Page by style tag now followed by this
we have our 29th question what hierarchy
do the style sheets follow
the answer for this question is if a
single selector includes three different
style definitions the definition that is
closest to the actual tag takes
precedence inline style takes priority
over embedded style sheets which takes
priority over external style sheets now
our last question for the session today
how do you add JavaScript to an HTML web
page so the answer for this question is
we basically have three methods to add a
JavaScript to our HTML webpage they are
inline script block and external
Javascript file first we'll discuss the
inline you can add JavaScript to your
HTML elements directly whenever a
certain event occurs JavaScript code can
be added using attributes of the HTML
tags that supported now the next one
that is the script log you can define a
script block anywhere inside the HTML
code which will get executed as soon as
the browser reaches to that part of the
document this is why script locks are
usually added at the end part of the
HTML documents now the last one that is
the external Javascript file you can
also add or import the JavaScript code
from a separate file and keep your HTML
code clutter free this is especially
useful if there is a large amount of
scripting added to the HTML web page
here we'll talk about basic CSS
interview questions
now name some CSS Frameworks as we know
it very well today in CSS environment
there are so many Frameworks are
available okay like we talk about CSS
these are basically necessary libraries
which offers you some very popular
ready-made components which you can
utilize into your existing project and
without writing much code you can really
create some awesome effects so
some of the very very popular libraries
are like in Foundation
bootstrap Gumby ukit semantic UI and
many more which are available here
okay now what do you understand by the
universal selector see Universal
selector as you know it very well in CSS
normally we talk about specific
selectors like in talk about class
selectors ID selectors this select a
specific set of elements or specific
element
when we talk about Universal selectors
Universe selector is matches any element
types like instead of selecting elements
of a particular type so you talk about
like an asterisk where the all elements
irrespective of what name and what
category they have it all will be
selected
next tell us about
rule set see typically rule set is for
the identification for selector which
can be attached with other selectors so
there are normally two rule sets are
available
when we talk about declaration block and
we talk about selector so declaration
block contains one or more semicolons
separated by declarations set of styles
which we say and the selector is means
or which particular
element this CSS style will be intended
for
next what are the elements of CSS Box
model
okay so we know it very well the C6 Box
model is all about offering you the
layout which is a part of the design
element so in CSS we can see this
elements are like in images you talk
about text okay you talk about padding
which is so called area around the
content you talk about border talk about
margin okay so you talk about this CSS
Box model
next difference between css3 and css2 We
Know It variable CSS has changed a lot
and css3 has brought so many new
features
so we talk about a difference so in css2
so CC splits up the different sections
of code into the modules so in css3 both
CSS and HTML were put into the single
file
in css3 there were no new way of writing
the CSS rules there are new view rules
are available
in writing a CSS rules
normally in css3 it is a backward
compatibility maintained by the css3
but in css2 we do not have any backward
comparability maintained by the css2
here
now how can CSS be integrated into the
HTML page like in order to utilize this
we always use the style sheet we use
style tag okay so multiple options are
available when we talk about using the
style tag in a head section else we talk
about inline styling with an element
itself or third we talk about external
style sheet which you can link it with
your current HTML page which anyways
enforce reusability
coming back what is the RGB strain so
RGB stands for red green and blue so it
represents a color in CSS so they are
basically uh starting with the color
number zero goes till 256.
next
what is the purpose of developing a CSS
okay the main purpose of developing a
CSS to basically offer the visual
appearance to give the better look and
feel to your code so that your HTML will
offer only the skeleton part but when it
comes to the beautification
we talk about organization and
everything you talk about the CSS okay
so CSS offers the styling part of your
web page if it looks more attractive
so what is the difference between class
and IDC these are two different type of
selectors are available in CSS class
selectors and ID selectors so class is
the way of using this HTML elements
so they are not unique and have multiple
elements where the ID is unique and it
can be assigned to a single element
so with CSS different documents can be
controlled using the single style so
style can be grouped in a complex
situation
to offer the consistent look for the
multiple HTML pages so that is what the
advantages you have it
so you can group multiple Styles
together and that you can reuse over the
different pages to offer the consistent
styling
okay now we talk about some intermediate
CSS interview questions
so here in the intermediate level you
will see like the first question is like
what Define a z index see Z index is
specify the stack order of the elements
that overlap each other
okay so its default value is 0 and can
take both negative and positive values
okay the higher the Z index value is
stacked above the lower index element so
it normally takes the following value
talk about like an auto number initial
and inherit
next
you talk about what are the benefits of
CSS Sprite see the main benefit of CSS
Sprite is like loading a multiple image
is not an issue okay uh blinking is not
seen there are some advantages are
available like when you talk about like
at one single or small small images it
really takes a lot of time to download
it individually so CSS is price loading
multiple image is not an issue
blinking is not seen because normally
what happens blinking happens when the
image is getting loaded so Advanced
downloading of asset doesn't make a
place of
until needed that's the benefit of
having this thesis and Sprites
next how can you target the H3 and H2
with the same styling so you can do the
comma separated so you can see multiple
elements can be targeted with using
comma separated so you use comma
separated values to give the consistent
style to both the elements
so named media types Allowed by CSS so
media types are basically a part of your
responsiveness
different media types are allowed like
in speech audio visual tactile media
continuous or paged media grip Media or
bitmap or interactive media these are
all type of Medias
are allowed in CSS
so how can you use CSS to control image
reputation so we talk about no repeat so
background repeat properties which is
available so you can see background
repeat none so that it would not be
repeated again and again within your
background
okay so we're talking about the next
questions like
about the image scrolling control how
you can control the image scrolling so
that you want the image to be remained
fixed and rest of the part gets scrolled
so here it is a part of your background
attachment property so here you say the
background repeat no repeat and you see
background attachment fixed so that when
you scroll down your image is not going
to be scrolled so that is the benefit of
this image control scrolling
now name some font related CSS
attributes
so we have some options available like
you talk about font style weight
variance size family these are the
font related CSS attributes
Define contextual selector
so normally in CS is the contact
contextual selectors allows developer to
specify style of a different part of the
document okay so style which you utilize
it can be aligned directly to the static
HTML pages
to create independent classes
okay that's called contextual selector
so responsive web design responsive web
design is a web design which you want to
remain consistent across multiple device
screens or the different type of screen
sizes and you want to offer the better
layout which doesn't looks bloated over
the different websites so that's the
benefit which you see when you talk
about like responsive web design
thesis
nomenclature ceases nomenclature means
The Styling commands are written in a
value on a property fashion okay so
normally CSS includes a system
Terminator semicolon the entire style is
wrapped in a curly braces and attached
to the dedicated selector
okay so this actually creates a style
sheet that can be applied to an HTML
page so this is the standard
nomenclature okay now coming back to the
next point
Advance CSS interviews
I will tell you about few questions
which are normally asked as a part of
advanced CSS
okay now when do you use translate
instead of absolute positioning okay so
the translate in a CSS okay transform
value on changing
you can talk about opacity or transform
okay so the browser Reflow or repaint is
not triggered when you talk about this
Translate Okay so the transform requires
a browser to create a GPU layer for
elements okay but using the CPU changes
absolute positioning property so
translate is more efficient and result
in shorter paint times
next name different ways to position
same aspects in CSS
okay so you talk about positioning
properties okay so the five different
positions values are number one you talk
about fixed we talk about static you
have absolute you have a chord relative
and you've got sticky so five different
positioning elements are available in
CSS
what are mixins
Mixels is a similar to the function
block of code returning a single value
it is a kind of function which we say
okay
so traditionally it is used in a SAS or
okay which is typically called
systatically awesome style sheet so that
code that directly compiles it to the
CSS styles
so how can you optimize the web page for
the prints so you actually identify a
control
okay so called contents areas of a
website a general website has a footer
header sidebar or nav bar or content
area
so normally we say conquer the print PDF
without changing the website's Integrity
by using the page breaks so creating
styles for print
size your page for print and avoid
unnecessary HTML table so using this you
can optimize the print of your web pages
so what are the meant by CSS working
under the hood so when you browser
display a document it actually combines
the style
okay which presents information and
document content so the document is
actually processed in two stages number
one conversation
okay or conversion of HTML and CSS into
the document object model so called Dom
and Dom display contents of browser
difference between the use of ID
selector and class selector we have
already seen that the but this is a
simple demo of how the ID selected in
class selectors are used the difference
is all about using so here you have a
call ID which use
dot sorry this hash and there you use
Dot
so tell us about CSS float property so
normally CSS float properties
of positioning an image to the right or
left as needed so it typically including
text wrapping around it so all
properties of elements used before it
remain unchanged that is known as called
float
so what do you understand with the
pseudo element so pseudo elements are
special effects to your selectors so
normally CSS finds okay using applying
Styles in a HTML markup so if additional
markup or style is not visible for a
document then pseudo elements help by
allowing extra markup without
interfering with the original document
difference between logical and physical
tag so normally logical tags focus on
the content
okay and are older as compared to the
physical ones logical ones do not find
much usage in presentation in terms of
utilization at the same time physical
ones find application in presentations
so how media type Works in CSS type so
we have discussed already about a media
type so we normally say four different
type of media properties that are
available like in print speech and
screens
okay like you talk about print media
screen so we use always at the rate
media print you talk about H2 so this
changes according to what option you're
offering it
so guys here we have multiple CSS
question and frequently our CSS
interview questions are offered like
tell something about css3
okay so we say CSS is divided into the
modules and is supported by almost every
single browser okay it is the advanced
version of css2 and offering you lot
many other advancedable features which
typically in cc2 we do not have that
okay now we talk about how CSS selectors
used so with the CSS selectors we can
choose you know any element of your HTML
Okay so
you talk about element attribute you
talk about any child selector you can
basically select it
so what are CSS image scripts so the
group of image placed into the one
single image is in a CSS image script it
can reduce the load time because
individual images certainly take more
time so this takes more time
comparatively
so we have got explained CSS specificity
so the CSS specificity is a rank or
score that decides style declarations to
be used to an element ID selectors have
a high specificity while Universal
selector has low specificity that's how
the specificity is all about so the
force uses categories that authorize the
selectors specificity
levels are IDs inline element pseudo and
class and style attributes so these are
a different type of conditions based on
that the specificity is considered
Define gradients in CSS we know the
gradient are again a css3 properties
that allows displaying a smooth
transformation
from one type of color to the another
color
okay so that's really awesome technique
through which you can talk about linear
gradient or else you talk about radiant
gradients two different type of
gradients are used and supported
so what are the properties of flexbox so
we know it flexbox are basically
designed for the alignment purpose so
typical the flex boxes are Flex
Direction you talk about wrap flow
content align items and the contents
like that it is once again the property
of alignment
so tell us about the usage of CSS Box
model so normally blocks Box model is a
box binding in HTML elements that
includes padding border margin and the
actual content for the more better
alignment
so normally if the Box model you get an
authority to add a border all around the
elements and define space between the
elements
so what are the position states in CSS
so we'd normally talk about four
positions in CSS so-called relative
Statics absolute and fixed
the default position is status always
static
so different between absolute and
relative and CSS so normally relative is
useful for some tags in CSS if we write
like 20 pixels then padding shift 20
pixels in a right but when we talk about
absolute
so it is absolutely relevant relative to
the non-static parent that means if I'm
talking about if you say write 20 pixels
the result will be 20 pixels far from
the right edge of the parent element
that's how the relative and absolute
position is
so what is the common between class and
ID see both cluster ID used in HTML
okay for the CSS purpose the ID is used
as an element where the class is used
so let's get started with a beginner
JavaScript questions we have a multiple
levels available here we start with the
beginner level first so the first
question is always like what do you
understand about a JavaScript so we know
it very well the JavaScript is a very
very popular scripting language it is
basically designed for client-side
scripting and server side scripting
development
why server side because nowadays
JavaScript is also used in a backend
using node.js so that's why it is also
called for server side development so
the question is like
JavaScript is
actually also helps the developers to
develop some more responsive HTML pages
okay which can be well understood and
executed by the web browser okay which
having the support capabilities for
object oriented programming skills
now the next question is like what is
the difference between a JavaScript and
Java see the reason is because the
JavaScript initials are Java so
everybody think like okay there is some
relationship with the Java so actually
the thing is like there is no
relationship with Java I would say
JavaScript is object based language
whether Java is object oriented language
lot of syntax
and some standards are matching with
Java that's why exactly it is saying it
is Javascript
otherwise there is nothing like that
but another difference if I talk about
JavaScript is mainly designed to run
with the browsers with a Java is
designed specially for the virtual
machine and operating system
another other thing is like JavaScript
does not need a compilation because it
is directly used interpreter but when
you talk about called Java it requires a
compiler as well as The Interpreter both
now what type of various data types are
supported so all standard data type
second byte short ink long flow double
character Boolean these are different
type of data types are supported in
JavaScript also just like in traditional
programming languages
okay
now
what are the features of JavaScript so
the first feature which you always
remember it's it is a lightweight
programming language it is been
interpreted by the browsers rather than
compiled
it is a cross platform that means it can
work across multiple browsers so it is
not specific to the browsers so that we
need to understand next it is an open
source hence you do not need to pay for
any licensing fees it comes free with
all different type of browsers it is an
object oriented but I would not say it
as a pure object oriented I would rather
say it is an object based language
next it can gel well with multiple front
end as well as the backend Technologies
because most of the languages which are
coming up in a market they have a
support available to get integrated with
the JavaScript and due to that
JavaScript is very very popular
so it is also used especially for the
development like a network based
application so in case if you want to
have some kind of network Centric
application here the JavaScript release
suits very very well
okay next question what are the
advantages of JavaScript so the first
Advantage which we are talking about
like JavaScript basically have a very
very nice interactive language it is a
event based okay functional programming
language I would say so it is a quick
feedback because it loads very very fast
in your existing web pages it is giving
you the support of developing a very
very rich user interface because of that
your application look consistent across
multiple type of browsers
another is like we have a call variety
of JavaScript based Frameworks are
available like you can talk about
angular you talk about react you talk
about Vue they're all basically
different type of JavaScript based
Frameworks that helps a developer to
enhance their skills with writing less
amount of codes
so how you create a script or how you
create an object in JavaScript it is
very simple the curly braces curly
braces is basically designed to give you
the fee of this is a typical object
there are a variety of ways are there to
create an object in JavaScript which
we're gonna see in our next video
okay now here we see about the next set
of questions which are there with us
like how to create a array in JavaScript
so creating an arrays in JavaScript is
very very easy now you can see the
square brackets okay there are the way
to basically create a array in a
JavaScript so just a square brackets are
a very very simpler way so called allele
literals to create
the array objects in JavaScript actually
you should know that array is also
object which is a predefined object
comes with your JavaScript
so called implicit options
now what are the built-in methods
available in JavaScript so you remember
about these methods comes from those
built-in objects comes with your
JavaScript as we have mentioned in our
last slides like math Boolean string
okay date they're all basically
predefined objects are available under
those objects these methods are actually
available like date if you can see it
will display the current date and time
concat to concat two different type of
string push some
adding some new recording to your array
pop to remove round to the round length
to calculate the length of the string so
these are all some well-known methods or
frequently used methods available in
JavaScript
now what different type of Scopes
available in JavaScript for the
variables now so Scopes are basically
designed to give you the visibility
within your program
okay so different type of Scopes are
available when it's called a global
scope so Global scope is having the
availability within a file anywhere else
you can access this particular code or
particular variable
this is called Global scope and local
Scopes are those Scopes which are
accessible within a function and hence
cannot be accessed by any other function
or outside of this function so two
standard type of Scopes which are
available here
now what is this keyword in JavaScript
this means to refer the current object
okay so whenever you see that this
keyword it is designed to refer the
current object in JavaScript so we
typically Define that this keyword to
assign the value to my current object
properties usually this is a place where
that this keyword is mostly used
now what are the conventions of
giving the names to the variables okay
so some standard naming convention which
we should always follow
but few things as you remember there are
certain Reserve keywords are there in
JavaScript which you cannot offer
while giving the names to your variables
or to your functions like if I can say
or let cons and many more which are
there available which you cannot assign
to your any existing variable provided
or functions under your JavaScript
now
here they are trying to say variable
names cannot begin with any numeric
value like you cannot give VAR with ABC
so not a b c I would say rather One Two
Three or something like that so they
must be a combination of I would say
integer as well as a character okay so
they must only begin with letter or
underscore characters it is the same
like as we have it in Java also
now naming conventions are very very
important JavaScript is a case sensitive
hence
the small a in capital E have two
different meanings for the JavaScript so
that part needs to be well taken care of
now what is the Callback in JavaScript
so you need to understand the Callback
in JavaScript is a kind of function
which you are passing as in parameter to
the another function to execute
okay so callbacks are mainly designed to
tell your application that they need to
wait rather than continue to execute
so callbacks will help you to behave
asynchronously and that's what exactly
this is most valuable feature of
JavaScript
so as I discussed already so it is where
the function needs to be passed to get
executed
so how do you debug a JavaScript code so
to debug your JavaScript code in any
browser you can just press the F12 no
matter which browser you have it either
Chrome or Firefox or anyone you can just
press the actual key and there you can
get this option called debugger where
you can just go and perform all the
necessary debugging related stuff right
over there or
so many other editors like in Sublime
Text Visual Studio code atom they're all
offering you the built-in support to
debug your JavaScript code
now what is the difference between a
function declaration and function
expression so this is a very very simple
difference so when you say function ABC
here
okay so you declare as a separate
statement within the same JavaScript
code
okay in another example what you do you
define a function within a variable name
called a which you can create to
construct some another object for this
that's the only difference between these
two
so this function can be called before
the function is defined and this is will
be created when the function is pointing
and reaching it
okay so it can be used only after that
so that's what we have discussed now
going forward
this offers a better code readability
and better code organization and that
the other part is basically used to
create a conditional or a declaration
functions
so what are the ways of adding the
JavaScript code in an HTML file so they
are
I would say two ways are available one
either you can declare it in a separate
file you can add it for a second you can
write a embedded JavaScript code where
you can just write a JavaScript code
either in your head tag or body tag but
there'll be one difference like if
you're writing it as an embedded
JavaScript you cannot use it for the
different HTML file with the internal
JavaScript file will be limited to that
HTML however external Javascript would
be more useful when you want to reuse it
again and again
so these were some standard basic
JavaScript questions for us so let's go
ahead and talk about something which is
related to your intermediate questions
in JavaScript
now so what do you understand about the
cookies see the cookies are basically a
kind of a small text file okay which is
kept in your browser and contains
information about your client activities
okay so whenever the client is accessing
your websites these websites can track
your activities through this particular
cookies okay so they just basically
record your general behaviors like what
you're doing with your website so that
accordingly they can give you the better
recommendations
now how you gonna create a cookie in
your JavaScript so creating a cookie
cookie is one of the property available
under your document object so that you
can create it using document.cookie and
give a key so your all Cookie are stands
with your key and value pair so you have
a key you have value pair so how are you
going to read the cookie
so cookie you can read by the help of
the same property called documented
cookie and here you can just use this
statement
like what key and value pair so whatever
the keys you have defined cellular queue
will be reading it to give the value of
whatever option you want to read it
now how are you going to delete the
cookie so cookie can be deleted it very
easily by calling this delete cookie
function
where you can just tell about the time
and duration when you want the cookie to
be deleted so when you set the expiry
time so cookies are deleted after
specific period of time that will be
treated as a good programming practice
so what is the difference between a let
and War keyword C there's a new feature
which is there added call Net keyword
which is known it's called Block Level
scope the block of a scope means your
variable whichever you're defining under
any Block Level statement will be
limited to that particular block like if
you're defining it any opening block and
closing block
so beyond that you cannot see that
suppose you are defining it under this
block or any block so these type of
variables are no longer accessible
outside where the VAR keyword will be
typically treated as a global variable
and hence it can be accessed anywhere
so what is the closure in JavaScript so
closure is basically gonna give you a
better way of providing the consistent
way of developing a JavaScript code for
the developer so closets are basically
created whenever a variable that is
defined outside of this current scope
can be accessed within the current scope
okay that means which is a variable
which is defined outside of the scope
even using the scope of this particular
closure it can be accessed inside too
now what are the arrow functions in
JavaScript
print Arrow function in JavaScript is
very very popular now they're just gonna
give you a kind of alternative way of
defining the function keyword there are
just a shortcut way of defining the
function in
JavaScript these are simple handy
functions I would say
so what are the different ways of HTML
can be accessed in JavaScript course so
there are multiple ways are there so you
can access using document.getelement by
class name you can access getting win by
ID you can get access document get
element by tag name and you can say
document.query selected so these are the
multiple options are aware through which
you can access the element
within your HTML tags
what are the ways of defining a variable
so War keyword as we discussed you can
define a variable you can also Define
the variable using const so if you
define any variable using const so these
variables will get constantly declared
and it cannot be changed once you define
the value so any value or any variable
which is defined using const it cannot
be changed in later switches
what are Imports and export in
JavaScript so to make your JavaScript
modular so there's an option available
of importing in and exporting it
so what exactly the difference
difference is very simple like you are
writing the setup JavaScript code and if
you want to get it exist
outside in another Javascript file so
how the two JavaScript files can
communicate with each other that is
where exactly the important export code
comes to make your JavaScript highly
reused and more modular
now these are the quick example as you
can see now two different files are
there so if you want to make your
particular variable
or function accessed outside you always
use export keyword with them and if you
want to access them out we can just use
an import keyword as you can see it is
defined there
so
another file can easily access your
the content of the previous files to
make your code even more modular and
useful
so what is the difference between a
document and window in JavaScript see
document is the one which is the part of
your document part which user can
actually see that
okay so the document object is the
object which falls under the category of
window window is a top level object so
in JavaScript VMware option available
name call bom that is called browser
object model in which the top level
object which is there that is called
window and under this we have a called
document so whatever you see under your
browser it is the part of your document
so what are the sum JavaScript
Frameworks and their uses the JavaScript
Frameworks are mainly useful to make
your application more organized with
less code and without getting into into
the detail okay so having this
particular framework will give you the
opportunity so that developer can use
the JavaScript in much more better way
to write a complex code in more
simplified manner this is where exactly
your Frameworks are designed for so
there are some very prominent and useful
Frameworks I can react angular viewages
and lot many other names are there in
Market which will be used in the
JavaScript as a core and take the entire
JavaScript development to the next level
so the next question is what is the
difference between
a undefined and undeclaring JavaScript
see it is very simple undefined means
the variable which is undefined you're
declaring a variable
okay and which you haven't defined okay
that means the variable has been
declared but the value has not yet
assigned that is called undefined
Undeclared means the variable which
you're trying to access that itself is
not available it doesn't even exist
so what is the difference between
undefined and null in JavaScript see
undefined as I already told you it means
the variable has been declared but it is
not assigned with any value null is
actually the assignment value that we
can assign to any variable which contain
no values as an alternative I could say
so what is the difference between
session storage and local storage see it
is very simple HTML5 has offered these
features to you so the session storage
and local storage both offers you the
data which can be stored in a browser
but session storage is short-lived the
moment your page is deleted or closed
the session data is immediately get
deleted whether local storage data is
remained for the longer period of time
and the data doesn't get deleted after
the browser history is over
okay so I would say the local storage
time span is far bigger compared to the
session storage okay everyone so we'll
have some Advanced JavaScript questions
now we've already seen the beginner
level as well as the intermediate level
questions now it's time to discuss about
some Advanced double questions too like
the first questions like comes like how
do you empty and arrange JavaScript so
it is very simple
if you want to assign
so there are a few ways are there number
one by signing the array length toward
to the zero so automatically turns to
empty second is what by assigning the
completely empty array
Okay the third will be by popping up all
the elements of the array
so multiple options are there and the
last which you talk about by using the
splice function so these are the four
important aspects are there which you
can treat how to empty your JavaScript
array in a very very simplified manner
now what is the difference between event
capturing and even bubbling see this is
one of the very very common question we
talk about even capturing even capturing
is actually the kind of process where
you just try to
capture the event of most outermost
element and then propagating it to the
innermost element
so even capturing is what like you're
talking about picking up the element or
picking up the event from the outermost
like you talk about called nested div
tags so you pick up the particular you
know even from the most outermost div
tag and you're just passing it to the
innermost then it's called capturing the
bubbling is the process okay which
starts with the innermost and goes to
the outermost elements it's just an
opposite direction that is called event
bubbling
so the case question is one of the very
very popular like what are the strict
mode in JavaScript see the strict mode
of JavaScript is introduced to give the
more better error handling capacity of
the JavaScript so whenever we talk about
call strict mode so all variables have
to be declared explicitly so you cannot
leave it like that and it cannot be
assigned to the read-only properties
so we can enable the strict mode only by
adding the use of stick mode on the top
of the Javascript file
now what about
and how we would be able to get the
following output of the below JavaScript
code so we have a call y equal to 10 and
we have written one function in the if
block and after that we just capturing
the value of a and then you are printing
the value in a console.log so what would
be the output output for that see it
will be a call then undefined
once again it will be kind of what it'll
be
undefined how commit would be look it is
very simple first thing
okay in your application
you are basically saying the if
condition statement in the code will
evaluate the eval function
as you know it very well what exactly
the evaluation is later on the eval
function
okay we'll take the function and return
the function ABC whatever the function
it is available and then inside the if
statement it execute the ABC and returns
undefined because as you know it
variable the if statement code executed
runtime was the statement inside this if
condition is being evaluated so that's
where exactly it is next can you write a
JavaScript code for adding the new
element in a dynamic manner is exactly
you can write it down so you have this
very common function available name for
document.createelement like people say
like I want to add the new text boxes
when I click on the button
so
I can write it very well so either it
will be a text box or it will be the new
element you want to add it so
document.createelement is one very very
common I would say the function and
later on you can use the typical Dom
functions like I can talk about or
create next node or append child so
using this combination you can easily do
so
next what is the difference between call
and apply very common question so the
call method whatever the method you have
it in a call these method arguments are
provided individually okay along with
the this value but in apply what happens
arguments are provided in the form of
array along with this value that is the
only difference between column apply
so what would be the output of the below
JavaScript code as you can see right now
we've written one object name called
student provided one property called
college with ABC after reducing object
dot create passing this is to print as
an object itself and after that you're
saying delete
student1.collision console.log
student.com so what would be the value
for this
so it is very simple it is very simple
example of object orientation so the
output will be what ABC as we are
accessing the property of student object
so certainly the value will be what ABC
for sure now what would be the output
for below JavaScript code as you can see
now we have written a one
function 4 and it is written 11 so using
type of Foo so this will certainly refer
to what to the error
reason is why because of function
definition can have only single
reference variable as its name that's
why exactly it will be throwing what an
error to you how do you remove the
duplicate
value from the JavaScript array it is
very simple we have called filter
function so the filter method I can
basically call it and three arguments it
may be expecting it the name of the
array the current element and the index
of the current element so that it can
remove all the duplicate elements from
there so how do you remove the duplicate
elements from JavaScript array so it is
same way I told you like
first it takes three parameters so using
the filter method and by using the for
Loop so the anti-array is used for
sorting all the repeating elements so
like that you can simply make it more
easy
so how can you draw a simple JavaScript
Dom so you can say it is a very simple
JavaScript Dom Elements which are there
where you can have the document and then
the HTML and followed by all child
elements like an head tag body tag body
may contain further child elements like
an anchor tag
so these are all basically known is
called a presentational elements through
which this complete HTML hierarchy will
contain inside this reactor yes let's
start with going through and exploring
the general set of react.js interview
questions that would be commonly asked
in an interview the first question would
be what are the features of react.js now
right through this session we would
follow a common methodology where we
would explore the question and then look
at the best way in which you could have
answered that question if posed to you
during a react.js interview so starting
with the first question what are the
features of react so react has many
extensions for complete application
architecture support jsx is used with
react to describe what the user
interface should typically look like
react is broken into small components so
you look at the complete application you
want to build break it down into
individual components and a component is
typically a piece of user interface like
a function that would return a stream of
HTML characters Speedy performance is
one of the core features of react as
only the updated components need to be
re-rendered on the screen and not the
entire page the one-way data binding
feature on the other hand keeps
everything modular and fast the virtual
Dom is also a lightweight representation
of the real Dom which is again a feature
with helps Speed Up Performance and
avoids a full page refresh and a full
Dom tree Shake which really speeds up
the formats so what is jsx how do you
answer this so jsx is typically the
extension used for react and it's
nothing but an extension to the
JavaScript programming language because
all that you can use inside your browser
for execution typically has to be
JavaScript because in HTML5 you cannot
have any third-party plugins installed
in the browser and that's the reason the
browser would only Ship by default with
a JavaScript image so by using jsx you
can write HTML structures in the same
file that would contain your JavaScript
code as well making the updates to the
code very simple so it's simple to
update and make modifications to your
code because the code and the data and
the business logic is all composed in a
single file so because the code and the
business logic is in a single file it
makes updating and incorporating change
request to the code very simple and easy
so it's basically used with react to
describe what your user interface should
look like and it's what you typically
would term as the HTML template or the
view coming to the next question can GSX
be directly read by the web browser so
web browsers cannot read jsx directly
now why is that well the reason is
simple it's because they are only Built
to read regular JavaScript objects and
jsx is not a regular JavaScript objects
it's a react comp component so for a web
browser to read a jsx file the file
needs to be transformed into a regular
JavaScript object and for this there is
a JavaScript API called people which is
internally used by react so what do you
understand by the virtual Dom that we've
been speaking about in react so react
keeps are very lightweight
representation of the real Dom the
actual Dom structure of the page so Tom
is document object model it is an API
created by w3c and it creates an
in-memory representation of the HTML
elements as a inverted tree structure a
balanced restructure which is the
fastest search algorithm when you want
to search for HTML elements and do a
dynamic update on them but again
updating the basic Tom tree structure of
the page causes a full page refresh and
if you only want to update a specific
component you wouldn't need the entire
page to be refreshed and that is where
react comes in it uses a virtual term
which is a layer on top of the actual
term which ensures that only a certain
part of the page is refreshed and that
speeds up performance so when the state
of an object changes virtual Dom changes
only that object in the real term
instead of updating all the objects and
this is what makes things really fast so
why use react instead of other
Frameworks like angular first of all
it's very easy to create Dynamic web
pages thtml where you can update the
view of the template at runtime the
components are reusable so you reuse
rather than reinvent the performance is
great since you're working with the
virtual Dom you don't need a full page
refresh the unidirectional data flow
makes data move one way there is no
two-way data binding by default and
that's the reason the page does not have
to do a lot of heavy lifting of
remembering whether the view is changing
whether the base JavaScript entity class
is changing and that saves a lot of
processing time again to debug react is
much more simpler and that's what makes
it more popular in terms of its
Simplicity and speed as compared to
other Frameworks like angular what is
the difference between es5 and es6
standard so these are scripting
standards okay that are defined by the
European computer manufacturers
Association of regma and all of the
scripting languages are a subset of the
standard and are derived from these
standards to ensure that the code will
execute on all browsers and the code
that we are writing is standards based
so these are a few instances where es6
syntax has changed from es5 if you look
at the es5 syntax at the top we're
creating a simple react class component
add the render function just Returns the
stream of HTML content in ex6 there's a
new keyword that comes in which is
extends so you are extending from the
base react component and creating a
custom component and then returning a
stream of characters also the function
keyword no longer needs to be used so
the exports versus export also changes
so you use exports to export out class
from a module so that it can be accessed
from another module in es6 you simply
say export and the component require
versus import so you would require a
third party component or an API into
your Javascript file to use it in es6
it's replaced with the import statement
very similar to the syntax that we use
in core Java so how do you go and create
a reactor first you install node.js as a
base platform which you can download
from the node.js website next any text
editor of your choice could be atom
Visual Studio code or Sublime Text third
you create a react app using a command
prompt terminal depending on the OS you
are using the command to give is create
hyphen react space my first app okay so
the command that you would give to
create a new react app is create hyphen
react hyphen app space and the name of
the application you would want to create
in this case it is my hyphen first
hyphen app and that could be a custom
name of your choice so what is an event
in react well on the web when you talk
about Dynamic HTML it's all about Intel
are acting with the user so the user
performs some interaction event with the
web page which could be a click of a
button a mouse move and these events in
action can be triggered by a user or any
system or could be pressing a key or a
mouse click Etc and in response to that
event you would execute a block of code
which is called an event handler so here
we have class simple which is a custom
class that extends the base react
component the name of the function work
which triggers a simple alert message
box and a render function which returns
HTML when you click on the button we
would want to bind that to the event
handler this dot work and that's how you
connect a click event to an event
handler function what are synthetic
events in react well a synthetic event
is an object which acts as a cross
browser wrapper around the browser's
native event it combines the behavior of
different browsers native events into
one API which makes sure that the events
are consist across different browsers
and this brings in the standard space
development to ensure in this digital
age the code that we are creating for
different browsers have consistency in
terms of its execution so here we see a
function Action Link we see a function
handle click which takes e as an event
parameter e dot prevent default ensures
that there is no error that the browser
is Raising in case the event function
call is not directly compatible with
that specific browser so prevent default
is used to suppress any browser-specific
errors or crashes and a simple
console.log which will lock into the
developer tools window which says you
just clicked a link and then we've got
the return where we are returning the
view to or the HTML template where on
click we connect to this event handler
called handle click so handle click is
basically a wrapper and the entire
Action Link is a wrapper object which is
a synthetic event we don't directly go
and bind to the on click and then
associate a function with it we actually
associate a synthetic object with it
which binds the base default event that
could be specific to a browser so some
browsers would probably understand a
non-click sun another browser would
understand a click and to ensure there
is consistency of syntax and from a
development perspective the code that we
write will run on all browsers we need
to take care of using the synthetic
events which isolate the developer out
from the complexity of writing code
specific to different browsers so you
just write generic code which will work
on different browsers so how do lists
work in react so the list display data
in an ordered format the traversal of
list is done using the map function so
here we see there is a function called
list of names which takes a variable
props as a parameter props dot names
will allow us to get a reference to all
of the array of names that are passed
constant List names is another variable
created equal to names dot map and we
are using the arrow operator which is
now an ecmascript standard and again we
are using the opening tag of the LI HTML
element the key is equal to the name
attribute so the base bracket will bind
that to the name attribute then we just
print the name itself and we close the
LI tag so that's the names dot map
function and finally we return in an
unordered list the list names themselves
so the map function will run through an
iterate over the list of names list them
in the Ally tag the LI tag will get
injected into the unordered list and
will finally get returned out as a
stream of HTML elements in the next code
snippet below we create a constant
variable names we are associating it
with a set of five names and we simply
say render list of names names equal to
names the moment we do that we are using
list of names as a custom HTML element
which is not system defined it starts
looking for the function list of names
passes the names array to it I trades
over it using the map function which is
an inbuilt react function brings out all
of the lists it's very similar to a
forward Loop that you would write for
iteration in other programming languages
and then finally what you get returned
in the get element by ID app is nothing
but a list of simple names wrapped in a
li element that are printed on The View
so why is there a need of using keys in
lists so keys are very important in the
code snippet that we saw due to the
following reasons the first reason the
key is a unique identifier if you would
want to search for a name in the list it
is used to identify which items have
changed updated or deleted from the list
so if you want to perform Cloud
operations on the data you would want to
search for which element do you want to
update or delete or change it also helps
to determine which components need to be
re-rendered instead of re-rendering all
the components every time and it
increases performance as only the
changed components have to be added and
not all the components on the page what
are forms in react so using forms users
can interact with the application and
enter required information whenever
needed so forms can contain certain
elements such as text Fields buttons
checkboxes radio buttons Etc and forms
are also used for many different tasks
such as user authentication searching
filtering Etc how do you create a form
pretty simple again create a custom
component called name from that will
extend react.component we create a state
variable this dot state is equal to
Value we handle the change by writing a
handle change event and we handle the
submit by writing a handle submit event
in the change event we just change the
state by saying set state of the value
to
event.target.value event being a system
defined keyword past is a parameter and
in the submit we simply alert that a
certain name was entered and we trap the
value that was entered into the form
prevent default to suppress the browser
from Raising any errors on the render
function we return a form on the sub
submit we connect to the handle submit
event and we bind the data submitted
from the form to the handle submit event
and we pass the this pointer which is a
reference to the current context of the
view itself we open a label specify the
name we then specified input boxes text
the value is set to this dot state DOT
value and on change we simply connect to
the handle change event and bind to it
and pass the context of the text box
itself so the moment we change the value
in the text box as we are typing the
handle change event will receive the
updated value and set the state and when
we click on the submit button the handle
submit event handler executes and we
alert out the current value printed in
the text box and that's it so how do you
write commence in react when you're a
developer if you want to comment out
some code or if you want to set commands
to enhance the maintainability of the
code a single line comment is as simple
as given in most other programming
languages backslash astric to open
asterisk slash to close multi-line
comments follow the same syntax and can
span multiple lines to add commands to
functions in terms of what the function
can do and what are the types that it
can return what is the arrow function
and how is it used so an arrow function
is a shorter way of writing a function
in react if you look at the snippet on
the top my input on change equal to we
are connecting to this dot handle change
dot bind and that's the longer version
of how you can connect it to an event
handler the shorter version is on change
equal to e Arrow operator this dot
handle on change so you don't need to
call the bind explicitly you can replace
that with the arrow operate and reduce
the amount of code that you typically
write how is react different from react
native so react and react native are
completely different react was released
in 2013 it's a web-based platform it is
HTML compliant it generates HTML views
it uses CSS for styling and it's based
on JavaScript HTML and CSS react native
on the other hand is targeted to
Mobility devices it's meant to create
installable apps on Android and iOS
released in 2015 not based on HTML and
CSS and it basically requires the
react.js API to create these installable
apps for these Mobility ecosystems how
is react different from angular and
other popular framework by Google so
angular created by Google completely
based on the model view controller
pattern works on the real Dom layer and
requires a full tree shake at the Tom
layer to update views and components
supports bi-directional data binding the
rendering is purely done on the client
side the performance comparatively slow
react.js on the other hand created by
Facebook it's the view layer of the
model view controller pattern it works
with the virtual Dom layer and it sends
faster it's unidirectional data binding
and not two-way and the rendering is
typically what is done at the server
side and what you get is a response on
the client is a stream of HTML
characters as an output let's talk about
and discuss some questions around react
components so what are components in
react so these are the building blocks
you can think of them as Lego blocks so
you break your problem down into small
parts each part identifying a certain
solution of the problem which is what we
Define as a component so they are
building blocks of a react application
in a single app usually consists of
multiple components so it splits the UI
into independent reusable pieces that
can be processed separately a component
is essentially a piece of the user
interface or the HTML view what is the
use of render method in react so it is
compulsory for each component to have a
render method if not there wouldn't be
any HTML for the component to render on
your view so the render function Returns
the HTML which is to be displayed within
a component like you see on the screen
there is a class app that extends the
react component and it returns a simple
H1 element called hello simply learn and
of course to do remember to export the
app out so that it can be accessed from
other components as well if you need to
render more than one element all the
elements must be inside a single parent
tag like a div or a form what is state
State and react the state of a component
is an object that holds some data within
it the data would influence the output
of the component now how do you
implement state in react so State holds
the data that a component renders on the
web application for example here we've
created in the Constructor this dot
State equal to and this temporary
Anonymous object has two attributes car
and Pi when we return We simply return
this dot state DOT car and this dot
state DOT by now this is how you would
create stateful components and access
the State Properties within the view how
do you update the state of a component
by using the built-in set State method
you can go ahead and update the state of
the component so here we have a simple
render function that Returns the state
itself state DOT message and on the on
click connects to a button press
function the moment you click on the
button the button press function sets
the state to another message so the
initial message in the Constructor is
welcome to Simply learn the moment you
click on the button the set State
triggers and changes it to best place to
learn so the data on The View would be
updated what are props in react well
props is just a short form for
properties and that is what allows us to
pass arguments or data to a component
drops a pass to components in the way
similar to that of attributes that are
passed to an HTML element so how do you
pass props between two components so
let's say we have an app.js component on
the top and a main.js component at the
bottom at the top we are trying to
return this dot props dot car and the
pipe so two Car and Bike attributes
associated with this props of the app
component in the main component when you
look at the render function we are
associating car prop equal to a value of
1600 CC and bike prop equal to value of
one five zero CC and to access it if you
look at the import statement we are
importing app from app.jsx and this is
how you can cross access properties from
one component within the other so what
is the difference between State and
props well State holds information about
the components they are mutable they can
be changed they cannot be accessed by
child components and they cannot have
state props allow to pass data from one
component to the other as an argument
they are immutable they are read only
and props can be accessed by the child
component and they can have props as
well what is a higher order component in
react so these act as a container for
other components which helps in keeping
components simple and induces the
reusability factor they are generally
used when a common logic has to be used
by multiple components that's when you
group together a set of components
within a higher order component in react
how can you embed two or more components
into one this code snippet demonstrates
the app component which returns a hello
text and it has a custom tag called
Simple the simple tag is defined in the
com component below and it returns text
called simply learn and in the render of
the react Dom we simply go and render
the app component so hello simply learn
would be the final output and that's how
you can embed one component into the
other using this methodology what are
the differences between class and
functional components so stateful
components would extend react component
in this case and if you could look at
the render it simply renders this dot
props.title the constant stateless
component would be equal to props the
div tag returns this dot props dot title
so you can look at the style very
different in terms of class and
functional components one using the
arrow operator one using the traditional
class and render method so the class
component can hold or manage State
complex as compared to stateless
components can work all of the life
cycle methods of the component and it
can be reused the functional component
cannot hold a managed State they are
simple and easy to understand it does
not work with any live site method and
it cannot be reused let's explain the
life cycle methods of components we've
got Ganesh initial state which is
executed before the creation of the
component component did Mount which is
executed when the component gets
rendered and placed on the Dom should
component update which is invoked when a
component decides any changes to the
term and returns true or false value
based on certain conditions component
did update it is invoked immediately
after the rendering takes place
component will unmount which is invoked
immediately before a component is
destroyed and unmounted permanently
let's move to the react Redux set of
questions so what is Redux it's an open
source JavaScript library used to manage
application State and react uses Redux
for building the user interface what are
components of Redux the first is the
store which holds the state of the
application store contains state which
defines the user interface which
triggers a set of actions which are then
sent to the reduce so store holds the
state action is the source information
for the store and reducer specifies how
the application State changes in
response to actions sent to the store
what is flux well flux is the
application architecture that Facebook
uses for building web applications and
it works in this way the action is
triggered which is sent to the
dispatcher the dispatcher sends it to
the store the store sends it to the view
and the view sends it back to the action
and that's exactly how the steps would
continue in sequence so when we trigger
an action the dispatcher will get
notified once the dispatcher has dealt
with an action the stores listening to
it will get triggered the view gets
updated when the state of the store
changes user action at the view is sent
to the dispatcher to then be processed
how is Redux different from flux Redux
is an open source JavaScript library
used to manage applications State the
store state is immutable it can only
have a single store and it uses the
concept of reducer flux on the other
hand is an architecture and not a
framework a library the store state is
mutable it can have multiple stores and
it uses the concept of dispatcher let's
look at some react router questions what
is a react router a react router is a
package which is used to create routing
in a react application react router is
used for developing single page web
applications it allows multiple views in
a single application by defining
multiple routes in that react
application how is react routing
different from conventional routing
react routing has a single HTML page it
uses all the end user rather would
navigate multiple views within the same
file called a single page app the page
does not refresh since it's a single
page file and there is improved
performance since you're not navigating
across multiple Pages conventional
routing each view is a separate HTML
file a user would navigate multiple
files for each view the page would
refresh every time the user navigates
which would hence result in slower
performance how do you implement react
routing you can Implement react routing
using a very simple method considering
the above components let's say you've
got a component called app about and
contact so here you can specify the
route path if the route path is just
slash the root defaults route it takes
you to the app component if the route is
slash about in the URL given by the end
user you automatically navigate and
activate and load the about component
and if the URL is slash contact fact it
would take you to the contact component
let's talk about react styling questions
style react components do you use inline
styling by using simple CSS by simply
saying color blue and that's going to be
the output of the H1 element or I could
use a JavaScript object by specifying a
constant simple style object and
specifying a keypad value of color
background color margin font family and
apply that object as the style parameter
which would result in this styled output
how to use style react components using
a CSS style sheet so here's an external
style sheet so we've written all the
styling rules in a separate CSS file
app.css we've imported that at the top
of the app.js react class and lo and
behold you have the output simplified as
generated on your page let's explain the
use of CSS modules in react so a CSS
module file is created dot module dot
CSS is the extension the CSS inside a
module file is available only for the
component that is importing it so there
are no naming conflicts so dot button is
the CSS styling inside
button.module.css and that is what we've
imported from in the app.js file so when
you view the button Styles dot button is
the styling picked up from the button
dot module.css I've classified the
questions into two sections one is the
beginner level questions and one is the
advanced level questions
so now let's begin with beginner level
questions
starting with the most basic what
exactly is angular
now angular is an open source JavaScript
front-end framework which is completely
written in typescript this framework
brings a structure and consistency to
web applications and provides excellent
scalability and maintainability
now it's primarily aimed to develop
single page applications and is
maintained by Google
it uses HTML syntax to express your
application's components clearly it is
designed for web desktop and mobile
platforms
next up is what exactly is typescript
now typescript is a superset of
JavaScript that offers excellent
consistency it is highly recommended as
it provides some syntactic sugar and
makes the code base more comfortable to
understand and maintain ultimately
typescript code compiles down to
JavaScript that can run efficiently in
any environment
now typically typescript is installed as
an npm package and thus can be installed
with the following command that is npm
install hyphen G typescript
moving on to our third question what
exactly is data binding and which type
of data binding does angular deploy
now data binding is a phenomenon that
allows any internet user to manipulate
web page elements
now it generally uses Dynamic HTML and
does not require any complex scripting
or programming
we use data binding in pages that
contain interactive components such as
forms calculators
tutorials and games data binding makes
incremental display of a web page more
convenient
when it comes to angular it uses the
two-way data binding any changes made to
the user interface are reflected in the
corresponding model state
conversely any changes in the model
state are reflected in the UI state
this allows the framework to connect the
Dom to the model data via the controller
next question what are single page
applications
now single page applications are web
applications that load just once with
new features just being mere additions
to the user interface
it does not load new HTML pages to
display the content instead its
generated dynamically
this is made possible through
javascript's ability to manipulate the
Dom elements on the existing page itself
an Spa approach is faster thus providing
a seamless user experience
differentiate between angular and
angularjs
now here's a simple table for you so
here are the features that we're going
to differentiate the two on the basis of
first is language angularjs uses
JavaScript while angular uses typescript
when it comes to architecture angularjs
supports the model view controller
design while angular uses components and
directors
angularjs is not supported by mobile
browsers
while angular supports all mobile
browsers
angularjs does not support dependency
injection while angular does
when it comes to routing at Route
provider is used to provide routing
information in the case of angularjs and
in case of angular at Route
configuration is used to define routing
information
when it comes to management angularjs is
difficult to manage with an increase in
source code size while angular is better
structured easy to create and can manage
bigger applications
next up what are decorators in angular
decorators are a design pattern or
functions that Define how angular
features work
now they are used to make prior
modifications to a class service or
filter
angular supports four types of
decorators namely class decorators
property decorators method decorators
and parameter decorators
next question mention some advantages of
angular first up is custom components
now angular enables users to build their
own components that can pack
functionality along with rendering logic
into reusable pieces
this is achieved with the help of these
components
data binding as discussed earlier
angular enables users to effortlessly
move data from JavaScript code to the
view and react to users events without
having to write any code manually
angular supports dependency injection
which enables users to write modular
services and inject them wherever they
need it
when it comes to testing tests are first
class tools and angular has been built
from ground up with testability in mind
you will have the ability to test every
part of your application and that is
highly recommended
next up is comprehensive angular is a
full-fledged framework and provides
out-of-the-box solutions for Server
communication routing with your
application and more
lastly angular is cross-platform and
compatible with multiple browsers an
angular application can typically run on
all browsers be it Chrome Firefox Safari
and operating systems like Windows Mac
OS and Linux
what's new with angular 10 first up is
that older versions of typescript are
not supported previous versions of
angular supported typescript 3.6 3.7 and
even 3.8 but with angular 10 typescript
bumped to typescript 3.9
warnings about common JS Imports now
logging of unknown property bindings or
element names in templates is increased
to the error level which was previously
a warning
angular now supports an optional strict
setting which offers a stricter project
setup when you create a new workspace
there's an addition of ngcc features
with a program based entry point finder
there are common compiler updates and
updated URL routing
angular 10 has several deprecated apis
that were previously redundant
with angular 10 version there have been
a number of bug fixes important ones
being the compiler avoiding undefined
expressions and the core avoiding a
migration error
new default browser configuration
browser configuration for new projects
has been upgraded to outdo older and
less used browsers next up is core all
the warnings will be now logged in as
errors
next update is converting free IV code
now all the pre-iv dependencies from npm
should be transformed to IV dependencies
which is supposed to take place as a
precursor to running ngtsc at the
application
and lastly we have service workers for
the service worker a fix has been put in
for a situation in which there was a
chance that the service worker would not
register when there is a long running
task or a recurring timeout
next up is what are templates in angular
now angular templates are written with
HTML that contains angular specific
elements and attributes
now in combination with model and
controller's information these templates
can be rendered to provide a dynamic
view to the user now templates are a
very predominant feature of angular that
describe how information can be
displayed in The View
next question is what are annotations in
angular
now these annotations are used to create
an annotation array
they are basically the metadata set on
the class that is used to reflect the
metadata Library
what are directives in angular
directives are attributes that allow the
user to write new HTML syntax specific
to their applications
now these execute whenever the angular
compiler finds them in the Dom
now again angular supports three
different types of directives there are
component directives attribute
directives and structural directors
next up what is aot compilation and what
are some of its advantages
now aots that stands for ahead of time
compiler basically converts the angular
HTML and typescript into JavaScript code
during the build phase that is before
the browser downloads and runs the code
so basically all the HTML and typescript
code is converted to JavaScript during
the build phase which means no
additional time is spent on converting
it into JavaScript later during the Run
phase right so when it comes to
advantages of course there's faster
rendering there are fewer asynchronous
requests it has smaller angular
framework download size this quick
detection of errors and this also offers
better security
moving on to the next question what are
components
now components are the most basic
building blocks of the UI in an angular
application
now every component is associated with a
template and is a subset of directives
only one component can be instantiated
per element in a template
now an angular application typically
consists of a root component which is
basically the app component and then it
branches out into other components
creating a hierarchy now every component
is decorated with the help of add
component decorator which provides
additional information
and component must belong to the NG
module
lastly components Implement something
called the life cycle hooks you will
learn about them a little later in the
video
next up what are pipes in angular
now pipes are simple functions that are
designed to accept a particular input
value process this value and deter an
output which is a transformed value
now angular supports several built-in
pipes however you can also create custom
pipes that cater to your needs
but to speak about a few saline features
pipes are defined using the pipe symbol
pipes can be chained with other pipes
and pipes can be provided with arguments
by using the colon sign next up what are
pure pipes now these pipes are pipes
that use pure functions
as a result of this a pure pipe doesn't
use any internal State and the output
Remains the Same as long as the
parameters past stay the same angular
calls a pure pipe only when it detects a
change in the parameters being passed
now a single instance of a pure pipe is
used throughout all components
next up what are impure pipes
now for average change detection cycle
in angular
these impure pipes are called regardless
of the change in the input fields as
long as there's a change detected these
pipes are called
as a result multiple pipe instances are
created for these pipes
now inputs passed to these pipes can
also be mutable
by default all pipes are pure however
you can also mention impure pipes using
the pure property
now here's a code for specifying impure
pipes you can use the pure property and
either mention true or false true
meaning it's a pure pipe and false
indicates that it's an impure pipe
next up what is the pipe transform
interface
now as the name suggests the interface
receives an input value
and transforms it into the desired
format with a transform method
it is typically used to implement custom
pipes now here's again a small piece of
code
now you can see that the pipe transform
interface is being used which in turn
executes the transform method now this
transform method is the one that is
responsible to change your input and
give a transformed output
moving on what is NG module
now NG modules are basically containers
that reserve a block of code to an
application domain or a workflow now the
at NG module takes a metadata object
that describes how to compile a
components template
and generate an injector at runtime in
addition to this NG module also
identifies the module's components
directives Services pipes and also
ensures that it makes them public so
that external components can use them
all of this is taken care of by the NG
module
next up what are filters in angular
now filters are used to format an
expression and present it to the user
they can be used in view templates
controllers or services
now to name a few there's
date filter which formats a date to a
specified format
there's filter filter that selects a
subset of items from an array
there's the Json filter which formats an
object to a Json string there's limit 2
which limits an array or a string into a
specified number of elements or
characters
then there's lowercase which formats a
string to lowercase and so on
moving on to the next question what is
view encapsulation in angular
now view encapsulation basically defines
whether the template and styles defined
within the component can affect the
application or vice versa
angular provides three encapsulation
strategies
there is emulated encapsulation which
means that the styles from the main HTML
propagate to the component then there is
native which indicates that the styles
from the main HTML do not propagate to
the component meaning it does not affect
the component and lastly there's none
which means that styles from the
component propagate back to the main
HTML and therefore are visible to all
the components on the page now this
indicates any different types of changes
and how it is affecting the entire
application
moving on what are controllers now as
the name suggests controllers control
the data of angular applications they
are regular JavaScript objects and the
NG controller directive defines the
application controller
next question what do you understand by
scope and angular
now the scope and angular binds the HTML
that is basically the view and the
JavaScript that is the controller it is
also an object with the available
properties and methods required for your
application
now when you make a controller in
angular you pass the dollar scope object
as an argument
moving on to the most commonly asked
question explain the life cycle hooks in
angular
as discussed earlier every component in
angular has a life cycle
angular creates and renders these
components and also destroys them before
removing them from the document object
model it is achieved with the help of
these life cycle hooks now let's have a
look at them first up is NG on changes
now this responds when angular sets or
resets data bound input properties
NG on it
is a hook that initializes the directive
or a component after angular first
displays the data bound properties and
sets the component's input properties
NG do check detects and acts upon the
changes that angular can't or won't
detect on its own
NG after content in it responds after NG
projects external content into the
components View
NG after content checked response after
angular checks the content projected
into the component
NG after viewing it responds after
angular initializes the component's
views and child views
NG after view checked response after
angular checks the component's views and
the child views
lastly there's NG on Destroy which
cleans up just before angular destroys
the directive or the component
moving on to the next question what is
string interpolation in angular
now string interpolation is a one-way
data binding technique that is used by
angular now it outputs the data from
typescript code to HTML View
it is typically denoted with the help of
curly braces and it helps display data
from the component to the view to help
you understand it's working I've created
a variable called name here in my
app.component.ts file and initialize it
to Simply on and back in my HTML file
I've created
a heading tag a header tag which
displays the name of the company is and
I have interpolated here with the help
of double curly braces so when I run the
file the output looks something like
this the name of the company is simply
learn so this is how string
interpolation is achieved in angular
moving on to next question what are
template statements
template statements are properties or
methods used in HTML
for responding to user events now with
these template statements the
application that you create or you're
working on can have the capability to
engage users through actions such as
submitting forms or displaying Dynamic
content most common example is the
button tag the template here is delete
hero this method is called when the user
clicks on the button
so this brings interactivity to your
application
with that we come to the end of the
first section which included the
beginner level questions moving on let's
look at some advanced level questions
what is the difference between ahead of
time and just in time compilation
now ahead of time compilation converts
your code during the build time before
the browser downloads and runs the code
in case of just in time compilation this
process is a way of compiling computer
code to machine code during the
execution phase
aot ensures faster rendering to the
browser while just in time is basically
a dynamic compilation
in case of ahead of time compiling the
user should include The Hyphen hyphen
aot option with the NG build or NG sub
command
and jit compilation is a default
compilation when you run the NG build or
NG serve CLI commands
next up explain the add component
decorator
now here's a simple screenshot of what
that component decorator encompasses
this is it is basically a typescript
class that is used to create
components
this genre of class is then decorated
with the at component decorator
the decorator's purpose is to accept a
metadata object that provides relevant
information about the component
now the image above shows an app
component which is a pure typescript
class decorated with that component
decorator
the object that gets accepted by The
Decorator provides properties like
template URL selector style urls
and many more now here the template URL
property points to an HTML file defining
what you see on the application
moving ahead what are services in
angular angular services
perform tasks that are used by multiple
components
now these tasks could be data fetching
network connections or database
management among others
they perform all the operational tasks
for the components and avoid rewriting
of code
a service can be written once and then
injected into all the components that
use it
generally components are used to only
display information on the UI they do
not perform any other back-end tasks
to perform tasks like validating
information or network connections Etc
you can make use of a service one
advantage is that this service can be
injected into multiple components that
make use of the same piece of code with
this you can avoid redundancy
moving on what are promises and
observables now while both the
components deal with asynchronous events
in angular
promises handle one such event at a time
while Observer bills handle a sequence
of events over some time
so to give you a brief explanation
promises emit a single value at a time
while observables are only executed when
subscribed to them using the Subscribe
method
now promises also execute immediately
after they are created and they're not
cancelable
while observables help perform
operations like for each filter retry
Etc promises push errors to the child
promises and observables can be
unsubscribed to so that the listener
stops receiving further values
next up what is NG on in it and how is
it defined
now again here's a small snippet of code
NG on init is a lifecycle hook as we
discussed earlier and there is a
callback method that is run by angular
to indicate that a component has been
created
it takes no parameters and returns a
void type
so I'm sure you can see here in the code
it takes no parameters and returns a
void
next up explain the use of ng4 in a tag
or explain the ng4 directive
now the ng4 director is basically like a
for Loop it is used to build lists and
tables in HTML templates
so in simple terms this directive is
used to iterate over an array or an
object and create template for each such
element
now in the snippet you can see there is
let items and item list and then I have
string interpolated the variable item so
let item here creates a local variable
that will be available inside the
template
of items indicates that we are iterating
over the items iterable
and the asterisk before ng4 creates a
parent template
next up what are template and reactive
forms so there are two different methods
to create forms we have the template
driven approach and we have the reactive
form approach so let's have a look at
them
in case of template driven approach the
conventional form tag is used to create
forms angular automatically interprets
and creates a form object representation
for this tag controls can be added to
the form using the NG model tag
multiple controls can be grouped using
the NG control group module
now a form value can be generated using
the form dot value object and form data
as exported as Json values
basic HTML validations can be used to
validate the form fields in the case of
custom validations directives can be
used
when it comes to reactive forms this
approach basically revolves around data
flows and propagation of change
now with reactor forms the component
directly manages the data flows between
the form controls and the data models
reactive forms are code driven unlike
template driven approach
reactive forms break the traditional
declarative approach and eliminate the
anti-pattern of updating data via the
two-way data binding method
typically reactive form control creation
is synchronous and can be unit tested
with synchronous programming techniques
moving on what is bootstrap how is it
added to angular
now bootstrap is a powerful toolkit it
is a collection of basic HTML CSS and
JavaScript tools for creating and
building responsive web applications
there are two ways to embed bootstrap
libraries
first up is using the bootstrap CDN
which is the content delivery Network
now this enables users to load the CSS
and JavaScript files remotely from its
servers
the other way is to use angular
bootstrap via npm
now this is used to add bootstrap to
your angular project by installing it
into your project folder now you can use
commands like npm install bootstrap and
npm install jQuery to install them for
your project if you wish to learn
bootstrap in detail I highly suggest you
check out our video on angular bootstrap
the tutorial explains how to embed
bootstrap and use it to create and good
looking angular applications
what is eager and lazy loading
eager loading is a default module
loading strategy now all the feature
modules under Eagle loading are loaded
before your application even starts this
is typically used for small size
applications since lesser modules are
used all of these modules are loaded
initially which makes running of these
kind of applications extremely fast
when it comes to Lazy loading all the
loading happens dynamically all feature
modules are loaded on demand
it is used for bigger applications where
the modules are not required at the
startup applications
this makes the application faster since
no time is spent on loading unnecessary
modules
next up what type of Dom does angular
implement
Dom or document object model treats an
XML or HTML document as a tree structure
in which each node is an object
representing a part of the document
now angular uses the regular Dom
this updates the entire tree structure
of HTML tags until it reaches the data
that has to be updated
now to ensure that this Speed and
Performance are not affected angular
implements something called as a change
detection
next up how is dependency injection
achieved in angular
now dependencies are objects or services
that a component needs to perform
functions correct now with the help of
dependency injection these classes can
request dependencies from external
sources rather than creating them on
their own here I've created a service
called demo service using the command
ngg service demo service
and I've also added the small snippet of
code when you create that service
now these Services can be injected to
your main component and perform various
functions
next up how does angular routing work
now I'm sure you must have observed that
the URL changes every time you click on
your user interface on an application
correct every time you navigate through
the application or move from one page to
another the URL changes now this means
that the application is being routed or
you're navigating through the
application so basically routing helps
navigate through a web application
especially in case of single page
applications now as discussed earlier
single page applications are loaded just
once so any new content that is being
displayed is just a mere addition it's
not being loaded again so routing plays
a vital role in case of single page
applications
typically it is specified with the help
of the forward slash and followed by a
path that defines a new content
now I'm just taking the same example
that I took before uh this was the
example for string interpolation however
you can see that we have a navigation
bar here with four different options for
that is home about services and login
and for home and login I've created a
path and added routing to it so when I
click on the home icon
you can see that some content is being
displayed onto the screen and if You
observe you can see that there is a
forward slash with the path name home
here which indicates that routing has
occurred same with login when I click on
it the path changes and the login page
appears if you wish to learn the concept
of routing I suggest you check out a
video the tutorial explains routing in
detail
moving on what are form control and form
groups
now a form control is basically a class
that enables validation
for each input field an instance of this
class is created
and these instances help check the
values of the field and see if they are
touched untouched dirty pristine valid
invalid and so on so for every field in
the form
the data that is being provided is
validated with the help of these
controls if it is dirty it means that
the value has been changed if the data
provided holds good for a particular
condition then the control is set to be
valid and so on with the help of these
controls you can determine if the value
provided is legitimate or not this can
be achieved with the help of form
control
when it comes to form group
and the form group class represents a
group of controls now from can have
multiple control groups the form group
class returns true if all the controls
are valid and also provides validation
errors if any next up is how is testing
achieved in angular
now Anglia uses Jasmine to run various
tests
the Jasmine framework allows various
functionalities to write different kinds
of test cases
the task runner for these tests is
typically Karma
and Karma uses a configuration file to
set the startup reporters and the
testing framework
next question is what is package.json
now npm installs package.json when a new
workspace is created
now this file includes a starter set of
packages some of which are required by
angular
now typically it's organized into two
groups one is dependencies these are
essential to run your applications
and we have Dev dependencies these are
essential to develop applications with
this we wrap up top front-end interview
