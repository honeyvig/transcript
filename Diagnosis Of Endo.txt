hi vanessa this is dr srikanth
from team mds conquer uh now we are
going to start
endodontics uh this first content
i'll be discussing very important
aspects about
the topic diagnosis okay and this topic
diagnosis will cover
diagnosis from all the aspects like
diagnosis of
almost all the subjects directly
or indirectly so the first important
aspect
in the diagnosis is you need to make a
note about
the symptoms okay so coming to the
symptoms so we have two symptoms one is
subjective and second one is
okay so one is subjective and
second one is objective most of the
subjective symptoms
are they'll be uh given by the patient
okay so in the form of an information so
they will be given by the
patient and coming to the objective
symptoms
the objective symptoms are will be known
by the dentist
by using some uh like tests
or with some basic information okay so
that is
the subjective subjective are basically
they are given by the patient
whereas coming to the objective part
objective part will be
taken by the dentist by various
tests or exams
so that is about the symptoms and coming
to the subject
the most important subjective
symptom that is given by the uh patient
in the dentistry is
pain okay hope you know okay so pain and
pain is basically due to nose
and you know that enamel
an animal is the one that doesn't have
any nose any nose in it okay so most of
your
nerve related pain is due to basically
due to the
and i have clearly uh given you the
clear-cut idea like
how uh i mean what are the nerves that
are present in the body and what are the
nerves that are present in the dental
pulse in my video which is
in the medicine physiology part that is
the classification of
now so i don't want to talk anything
related pains of
dental origin okay pains of dental
origin will be on the same side
that is the ipsilateral side and will
never
never cross the
midline okay so that's that's very
important thing
so for your information sake i have
uh i have added this particular slide
which contains the information of the
nerves that are present in the pulp
so as already discussed the predominant
nouns are present in the pulp are
a delta and the c fibers okay
so all these points of a delta and c
fibers are very
very very important in examination point
of view okay so
you can pause the video and just check
all the all the points that is the
diameter
conduction velocity where they are
present okay
what is the mode of pain they carry and
all these are very very important
points to be added okay so next comes
is as already as already discussed the
symptoms are of subjective
and objective and subjective comes uh i
mean like most of your subjective signs
are related to the pain
and coming to the next part that is the
object or objective you know need
you you need to go with the few
examinations or few tests okay
in that the first test we're going to
talk about the percussion okay
so this is a percussion test
so percussion uh is a one that is going
to
like how well uh we are responding to
the percussion test gives an idea about
the degree of the
inflammation that is associated so one
percussion test that is most commonly
used i hope most of you are very very
uh familiar with this with this that is
called as
tooth
sloth okay ah it is also called as
rubber wheel test okay so they use
they use rubber wheel here similar to
this is a tooth slot
okay or it can be called as bite test
you'll ask the patient to bite on this
cloth whenever the patient responds
positive okay so whenever patient
responds pain upon biting
then you can diagnosis it as epical
periodontitis
means inflammation at the apex and
whenever the patient
is negative means not negative exactly
it is
whenever the patient has a relieve of
pain okay when the patient has a relief
of pain
then you can diagnose it as crack to
syndrome
okay so that's very important uh things
to be added related to this particular
test okay this test is also called this
tooth slot test or rubber wheel test or
a bite test
whenever you have pain on bite that is
called as epical periodontitis whenever
you have relief of pain on the bite then
that is called as
crack tooth syndrome the next comes
i hope you know this this is called as
palpation okay palpation can be done at
different areas okay
most of you are familiar with different
types of palpations external palpation
you will have
your lymph nodes will be palpated
internally or periapical area the
vestibular
areas are palpated whenever you have a
or tenderness you can diagnose it as an
uh acute inflammation case like you can
diagnose it as an
abscess or something so you need to pulp
it
so what are the futures of palpation so
whenever you have an acute
infections okay whenever you have an
acute infections uh the palpation signs
will be
tender the patient will have pain and
sometimes
it may be mobile okay and they are
enlarged okay so these are the acute
signs and when coming to the
chronic signs what happens in the
chronic situation
in the chronic situation they may not be
tender it is non-tender
okay it can be mobile and it can be
enlarged
so when when you take tb into
consideration like tuberculosis
lymphoids okay
ah i hope you remember when we were
talking about this we are going to talk
or we were done with the talk about this
related to the tb lymph nodes they are
matted lymph nodes means a pack of group
of lymph nodes
so they can be called as matter lymph
nodes they are not tender you don't have
any pain
okay so such category of lymph nodes
that comes under the
tv lymph nodes or like
they can ask you the the the node that
is going to infected when a particular
teeth is associated with the
okay we we're going to learn about this
in space infections in the
in the oral surgery but just like for
example if it is a lower
anterior teeth your submental lymph
nodes are going to be palpated
or inflamed okay if it is like a
posterior teeth
okay if it is like posterior maxillary
teeth posterior upper teeth your sub
maxillary
lymph nodes are are infected or or
palpated okay
so basing upon this you're going to
change which type of lymph nodes and
everything so this is
how the external palpation is done
internally that is vestibular and
vegetable attendance we call it as
external this is how the lymph nodes are
palpated and different different lymph
nodes palpation will give an idea that
this teeth may get
infected okay right so clear right
the next comes is some radiographic
information is again required mostly uh
as per the uh i mean like as per the
suggestions you need to take a minimum
uh
two views of the same date
same date okay so that you can you can
you can change the angulation by which
you'll get to know like
what are the things that are associated
with the particular abnormal you can see
here
the difference in the normal pdl okay
this is a normal pdl
okay whereas here you can see the
laminar juror whereas whenever you have
a periapical infection okay so you can
see that
there is widening the pdl space is being
widening you can see the widening medial
space here
whereas here you have a normal pdl space
and you can see the loss of laminate
whereas an opaque layer is clearly
visible here here you don't have any
opaque layer okay you can see the loss
of laminate
so loss of laminar juror is one of the
most common sign that is seen
uh whenever whenever the infection is
infection is going to start like the
first sign that seen on the radiograph
and what you can appreciate is loss of
laminar juror the epical reason
okay so i mean this is again a radiology
related stuff this is called as
inverted y shape hope you remember
inverted
inverted that is called as inverted
by line of
ins inverted by line of ins that is
called as
that is nothing but an overlapping
border of the nasal flossa and the
maxillary sinus
okay so there is an overlapping of this
is a maxillary sinus this is in a
nasal fossa both are overlapped to form
a y line inverted violin okay this is
preferably seen at the
maxillary canine area okay so a
radiology related stuff just for the
information sake i
added here okay the next comes is i mean
regular things i don't want to discuss
much okay a bitewing
bite wing
bite wing radiographies of less use
in end why because you need a
periapicalarian bite wing you don't get
the periapical area most of your
infections will be associated with the
periapical region right so bitewing of
less use in indo
iopa is useful more okay
so techniques like this technique is
the slob technique same side same side
lingual opposite side buckle okay that
is that's what the slob rule says
and you're very familiar we have we are
going to discuss this much detail
when we are talking about oral radiology
uh and and the slobber is also called as
cone shift rule because by shifting the
cone
if the object is moving on to the same
side then that the object will be
present on the lingual side
and if the object is moving towards the
opposite side
in the direction of the cone shift then
it will be present on the buccal side
that's what the
buck cone shift technique says that
other name is cone shift technique or it
can be called as tube shift technique
tube is nothing but cone right you have
a tube in x-ray film
so that is going to you're going to
change the direction of the tube that is
called as tube shift technique
it's also called as clark's technique it
also called as
buccal object rule technique okay so
these are the other names of the
slob technique okay so that's important
thing to be added and
there is one more variation which is
exclusively used in endo
uh that's a slob variation this is a
very simple technique
where you are going to change the
angulation of the
cone by 20 to 30 degrees
okay so in this voltron's technique what
you're going to take you're going to
expose it
then you're going to expose your cone at
a particular angulation
then you change the angulation then you
change the angulation
by 20 degrees okay to this angulation
so by changing the angulation by 20 to
30 you're going to expose again
so you'll have a two x-rays at a
different angulation so the change of
x-rays this technique is called as
wall trans technique you can see in this
radiograph if you see in this pic you
have how many
uh you you have inserted four four four
files that is different
scenario but on the radiograph what
happens is they are overlapped
they are overlapped right so you can see
two canals only
officially okay but when you change the
angulation by 20 degrees to 30 degrees
okay you will not see any overlapping
you can see all the four channels this
change in the angulation and this
technique is called as
a wall turns technique nothing but a
similar pattern of
slobs technique but it's more often
called as
the altrans the technique okay so
uh you can apply the slop technique or
there is something called as
uh the other technique called as
mbd rule okay so the nvidia rule
ambitious is very very
simple that is ingalls mbd rule any of
these techniques
the the the main mode of the outcome is
the same
means you're trying to change the
angulation uh
by which you are overcoming this
overlapping of the canals or the
overlapping of the roots by which you
will get
more information about the anatomy so
next comes
again this is the most commonly asked
question so whenever you observe a
radiograph
okay or you observe a canal whenever
there is a
sharp change in the
radiolucency within the canal then you
can call it
as a fast break okay so what fast break
gives an idea
the fast break gives an idea that single
canal
has changed into i mean is branched
okay so you can predict one more channel
okay you can
whenever you for example you can see
here there is a good
uh radio lucency but suddenly the radial
lucency has dropped here suddenly there
is sudden drop in the relationship
and similarly here also you can see
radiation is
good here but if you see the radiation
has dropped here
so sudden change in the radial lucency
within the canal
or sudden change in the density within
the canal
will definitely give us an idea or
prediction that there may be some
additional canal extra cannot
extract canal okay so that is called as
fast break one more important aspect
that you have to make you not when we
are talking about the
radiology related stuff okay so this is
a
most of your familiar most commonly you
will encounter this in your
period that is called as classification
of fercation
okay classification of for occasions
so this is called as a glickman's
classification so glickman has divided
into class one class two class three and
class four most of you are very familiar
with this
okay so uh i mean like
uh the the forcation probe cannot enter
the furcation area
okay so basically when you when you try
to probe it the furcation probe will
will not enter the forcation area that
is about your class one
ah and then in the class two the probe
is able
to partially enter the furcation
and it extends approximately one third
of the width of the tooth
but it is not able to pass completely
through the vacation that that is called
as
cluster first it it doesn't enter
second it enters partially the next
comes is the third one
ah third one is the function
uh the furcation i mean here it's not
entering partially it's going to enter
it's going to enter and that's what the
difference and it's
if you see the mandibular molars and the
maxillary molars
uh the probe that passes between the
mesobuccal and the disturbance root and
touches the parallel root that's in the
maxillary
and in the mandible the probe passes
completely through the furcation between
the mesial and the digital roots in the
case of mandibular molars
and coming to the fourth one the fourth
one is same as the third one
except the entrance of the forcation is
visible clinically
with a gingival region here it is not
visible clinically but it moves from
here
to there here it is visible clinically
and it moves from
here to there so that is the difference
between the four classes of furcations
here
it will not go here it will go partially
here it goes completely here
it glows completely which is visible to
you clinically okay so these are the
four classes of furcations that you have
to make a note
the next comes is the the testing the
pulp vitality
like more familiarly they are called as
pulp sensibility tests okay what are
these called as
pulp sensibility test they are called as
pulp sensibility
test okay that is cold test these are
called as thermal test
cold and heat an electrical test that is
called as
ept so coming to the
okay so in the thermal test you have
cold test and the second one you have
the heat test
okay so coldest heat test and i hope you
are very familiar with the coldest and
heat test whenever you are doing a cold
test on a heat test make sure you take a
control teeth
okay so your control teeth is going to
be the adjacent and the contralateral
tape
okay so that's the question again the
control teeth is the adjacent and the
contralateral teeth
and whenever you talk about this cold
test or a heat test
the most commonly asked questions for
you is the temperatures okay these are
the different temperatures which i have
collected personally
okay so the heat test the most commonly
asked question is the temperature that
is used in the heat test is 65.5 degree
centigrade
and most commonly asked question is
carbon dioxide snow or dry ice the
temperature is minus 78 degrees
centigrade
eyes well known that zero degree
centigrade indo-eyes
is minus 30 degree centigrade so most uh
most of your clinical scenarios
they they give invoice okay the wording
they give is
they give they talk about the indoors
okay and carbon dioxide's noise is is a
is a thing that is regularly used in
case of your
crowns full crowns you'll have full
crown so
heavy restorations where you can use
carbon dioxide snow that is minus 78
degree centigrade
so they can ask you blood is stored at
the temperature of other fecular
question when
when you're talking about physiology
that is four degrees centigrade they can
ask you the platelets are stored at a
temperature of platelets at regularly
stored
temperature of room temperature that
stored at room temperature so the room
temperature is 20 to 25 degrees
centigrade
so they're gonna ask you oral polio
vaccine is stored at a temperature of
minus 20 degree centigrade
freezi dent okay is again is an eigen
type of uh
i mean the cold test that is the
temperature is minus 20 degree
centigrade okay so please do make a note
about these values
uh regularly as you can see questions
regularly on this
numerical system the next comes i was
talking about the
ept that is electrical pulp test okay
there are different types of uh
electrical pulp tests uh that are
that are regularly used okay so
i mean like the important points that we
have to make a note when you're talking
about the electrical pulp test is
uh it is basically uh the basic
mechanism
is you're going to give some electrical
excitation
for the neural elements that are present
in the pulp a positive response
indicates the presence of
nerves okay and a negative response
indicates the vitality so whenever you
have positive response
you can you can you can you can you can
predict it as a vital pulp
a kind of vital valve a negative
response or no response is
a non vital
a non-vital part okay so that
that is the utmost important point that
you have to make a note
when we are talking about this
particular thing
okay so what happens in the next level
uh the next level is so most of your
questions will move around like uh
the electrolyte because whenever you go
over epd you need to apply electrolyte i
hope most of you have done this
uh in your colleges okay so uh the
electrolyte
you have to use a
i mean like toothpaste okay so the
toothpaste is called as
grossman's toothpaste
and you regularly used a
colloidal
graphite colloidal graphite
is regularly used as an electrolyte in
this situation and make sure whenever
you do this particular type of ept make
sure
make sure that you don't don't
wear glove okay
because glove is going to act as a
non-conductor it doesn't conduct okay so
circuit will not be formed so make sure
whenever you do this particular test on
the patient don't
wear a glove because through your body
the circuit is going to form
and make sure ept is contraindicated in
the patients with
cardiac trace macros so it's not it's
contraindicated
with the patients having cardiac
pacemakers even
your cardiac
pacemakers it is contraindicated even
your
epics locators even your epics locators
because apex locators are also therefore
they work with the formation of a
circuit so even your apex locators are
contraindicated
whenever you have whenever the patient
is having the cardiac pacemaker so
it's very very important your apex
locators as well as your
electrical pelvis are contra indicated
in the patients who has
cardiac pacemak pacemaker synthetic okay
that's
that's an important aspect to be noted
so how this ept is going to respond to
the different situations i mean
basically you have a reversible pulpitis
you have irreversible pulpitis or you
have
a hyperplastic pulpit right so how they
respond to
these three categories is an important
aspect so in the reversible pulpit is
the tooth responds to less amount of
current than
normal okay so it responds to the less
current
less current than the normal whereas in
coming to the irreversible pulpit is it
requires more current
it requires more current to respond and
when you take this hyperplastic pelvis
when we are talking about the diseases
of pulp i will be discussing
in detail about the hyperplastic pulpit
is what happens in hyperplastic pulpits
is
the number of nerves decreases in
hyperplastic pulpits
whereas the vascular supply will
increase so that's the reason why as the
number of nerves decreases
there is less pain in hyperplastic
pelvis and there is more bleeding
so immediately whenever you touch it
bleeds fast so there is more bleeding
so whenever you have less number of pulp
whenever you have less number of
nerves in the pulp what happens uh the
the the pulp polyp that is hyperplastic
pulpit is will
will contain less number of nerve supply
than the normal pulp and also
so because they contain less number of
now they require more current
more current to give a pain okay that's
the sign that you have to make a note
when you're talking about hyper plastic
compartments reversible pulpit is
less current irreversible pulpit is
because those are damaged more current
is required
hyperplastic pulpit is they have less
number of nose so more current is
required to
elicit the pain so uh okay
next one is the location where you have
to keep this tip is is an important
aspect okay so
you have to keep uh you have to keep
this particular tape
in the anatomical location where there
is high density of nose
so it will be different for anterior
teeth and it will be differing for the
posterior teeth for example if it is an
anterior tip
the anterior teeth which part of
anterior teeth will have
more nerves of place in sizzle one third
so it's incisional
whereas coming to the posteriority it's
going to be the middle one third
the middle one third is going to have
the the more density of the nose okay so
it is
uh upper one third the posterior is
the middle panther so other important
aspect that you have to make a note is
about the
uh the defects in this test okay so in
few cases you will get false positive
false positive in few other cases you
will get false negative
so these are the problems with this so
at which conditions you will have false
positive
and which conditions you will have false
negative is again a
most commonly asked question so what
happens
uh the false positive can be seen in the
cases
when you have a moist necrotic pulp so
pulp is dead
but it ha it is moist so moist
is going to allow the current okay so
the pulp is dead but you will have a
positive result in this case
or whenever you have a partial necrosis
for example if it is a multi-rooted
teeth
you have you have a necrosis in two
roots and
the two roots the pulp is vital so this
is going to give a false result so
whenever you have a partial necrosis
in a multi-rooted teeth it's going to
give the result
so whenever the electrode is going to
contact the gingival tissue or whenever
it's going to contact the wet surfaces
it's going to give a positive result
whenever uh the tooth is
having an acute alveolar abscess
it's going to give a positive positive
result or whenever
the patient is too anxious high
potential or hyper
hyper react to patients okay with the
without touching the they
give pain and telling that it's vital so
such conditions comes under the false
positive
so what happens in the false negative if
it is a calcified channel
it's going to give false negative out of
the patient is having high thrust hold
level of pain
it's give a positive result now the
patient is having a painkiller before
testing
it gives a false result or recently
erupted teeth with
immature effects because the nervous
system is not well developed
it's going to give a false result okay
or or ah or if if the if it is not
working at
all if it is not working at all it gives
a false
or recently traumatic death it's going
to give a false word so they can ask you
in which of the following conditions you
have a positive false positive
and so the following conditions you have
a false negative is the most commonly
asked question for you so just make a
note of it
so you can they can ask you this type of
question
type of pulp testing used in this case
you can see this case is a
full ground restoration so full crown
registrations ah
what is the pulp test that you have to
use is carbon dioxide snow that is minus
78 degrees
carbon dioxides know that you have to
use
when you are going for this particular
type of test
okay so before going into this i just
want to add a note about
your anaesthetic test so an aesthetic
test
is uh basically done by an
intra-ligamentary and very few cases
they can go for the mode of injection as
an infiltration
so basically the anesthetic test is
useful uh first of all useful to
identify the maxillarity and the
mandibular teeth
who charge it belongs and you have to do
this test from the posterior tube to
anterior teeth by which
you're going to i you're going to like
you're going to anaesthetize each and
every teeth by
by which you are going to rule out that
particular teeth and you are going to
come out with the
ultimate teeth which has the issue that
is the anesthetic lesson coming to the
test cavity
test cavity is going to you are going to
prepare a cavity basing upon which you
will tell the vitality of the tip so
that is going to be the last option
means you are destroying means it is and
you're causing some trauma to the teeth
so basically anesthetic
cavity what you have to do is you have
to drill the cavity in an
un anesthetized teeth okay so test
cavity is a cavity
that is done okay drilling a teeth
without a water coolant make a note
the points to be added is without
without water coolant
because the heat has to cause the pain
without a water coolant and without
giving a layer you have to without
giving a lay
so this has to be done these two has to
be done then the patient complaints of
pain by which you can tell that the
you have some sensitivity you have some
sensitivity towards the
particular thing okay the next comes
is uh the zero radiography okay so what
what happens like few important things
of course these are very very
i mean like essential things that you
have to make you note when we are
talking about your oral radiology
but my concern is i want to cover uh
these aspects
uh in endo point of view okay so in
endodontics point of view
i feel like i need to cover the reliable
stuff
of this so what happens in zero
radiography zero radiography is
something called as
an electrostatic imaging system
that uses a uniform charged x-ray
sensitive
selenium alloy photoreceptor
okay so this is an electrostatic so
points to be added
is this is an electro
static
imaging system
this is an electrostatic imaging system
in which the regularly used selenium
coated
photo receptor plate so what is the
material
selenium mostly selenium
but in very few cases they can use
aluminum also but mega knot selenium is
an important point
electrostatic imaging system is an
important point and this procedure is
very rapid
it is a very rapid procedure uh which is
done in 20 to 25 seconds
time duration is very important 20 to 25
seconds and the most important point
about this in examination point of view
is ah
it has a peculiar feature that is called
as
edge enhancement property
so it has h
enhancement
property and it has it it also has
a sharper contrast so these are the
advantages that are associated and when
you're talking about the exposure
the uh the radiation levels or radiation
exposure is also
less clear
so so the three important points that
you have to make a note about this
is is very rapid that is it it
takes place in a duration of 20 to 25
seconds the second one is edge
enhancement property
it has a sharper contrast and the
radiation exposure is
very very less so coming to the
desert one disadvantages that is
associated with this
uh is okay uh the disadvantages that are
basically associated with this is
it has a greater degree of artifacts
so whenever you compare the whenever you
compare to the
you compare to the conventional
radiographs you have
more degree
of artifacts
here and whenever you have a larger
areas of
bone okay means more than two
centimeters
are shown better with conventional
radiographs
okay than than the zero radicals
whenever you have a larger defects
larger defects okay
so this is this cannot be a good option
for this okay so what are the advantages
so
the advantages are rapid procedure 20 to
25 seconds edge enhancement property
sharp contrast decreasing the radiation
exposure
the disadvantages are high degree of
artifacts and larger defects of bones
cannot be
clearly appreciated when you compare
with a normal conventional radiograph so
that is about the zero radiography that
you have to make a note
second one is rvg hope you are very
familiar because most of your colleges
now started using this
okay so that is called as rpg that is
nothing but radio
visual graphics so i don't want to talk
much about this
okay so the main advantage is decreasing
in the exposure
so because we talked more about this in
your overall radiology
decreasing exposure and the main
disadvantage of
like when you compare the resolution
okay so
coming to the disadvantages the
resolution is less
so i mean the clarity of the image is
less when you compare with the
conventional radiograph
and the second one is expensive
and the third one is soft tissue images
are not clear
when compared with the conventional soft
tissues are
not clear when you compare with the
conventional that is about
rhythm the next comes is a digital
subtraction
subtraction radiography okay so this is
subtraction radiography is going to be
like
the word clearly says subtraction means
you're going to take two radiographs
radiograph one radiograph two
radiograph one radiograph two
after a duration of time for example the
the duration between these two
radiographs and these two radiographs is
some three months so and three months
and you are going to compare the
two radiographs by subtracting one from
other by which
you are going to know the prognosis of
the teeth
okay i hope you're very clear right so a
a area of focus will be taken and the
subtraction will be done
and you will get to know what is
better property like which like what are
the changes so easily you can use this
particular thing for the
follow-up of a particular case so that
is all about the
digital subtraction radiography so
what this basically i mean like the use
of this
is basically in most of the follow-up
cases okay
so the first the first image what you're
going to take is going to be considered
as a
it's going to be considered as a
baseline and followed by a duration of
type you're going to take a follow-up
radiograph this is called as in a
follow-up follow-up radiograph
and you're going to register register
them and compare the differences between
the
two images that is you're going to
you're going to see the difference
between the radiographic density of the
two images
for example if the outcome in the
outcome if you have a bright area
bright you have a bright area
ah then uh then that is called as the
then that is called as the gain
there is some deposition that has
occurred if you have a dark area
then there is then there is a loss
loss of the density okay so so and make
sure the
the most important thing that you have
to do is the projection geometry should
be same because
the same way the x-ray should be the
landmarks and everything
which were kept as a reference for the
baseline
radiograph and for the follow-up
radiograph should be same so that
the subtraction process can be so the
main disadvantage of this
technique is projection geometries are
very difficult to follow
and that can lead to some sort of error
so that's all about the digital
subtraction radiography so
at this particular point we need to make
a note about
p a i scores or p a i index
that is nothing but called as peri
apical
index so what happens in periapical
index so in peripheral index you have
one
two three four five scorings i think in
2017 or 18 they have given what is
periapical index three description so
one is normal peripheral structures
okay so this is normal a periapical
structure and whereas two there is small
change in the bony structure
okay you have a small change in the
surrounding bone whereas coming to the
three there is change in the bony
structure with mineral loss
you can appreciate a very huge mineral
loss okay
and the fourth one is periodontitis
with well defined radiations you will
have periodontitis also
with well defined regulations and the
fifth one is severe periodontitis
with i mean like more intensified
futures
so make a note about this pa index that
is called as periapical
index ah the next comes is the vitality
test until now we learned about the
sensibility tests okay sensible data
sensible water sensibility test
which helps in determining the nerve
sensitivity
vitality vitality means
vitality is related to blood supply
whereas sensibility is related to the
nerve supply
all your thermal tests that is
heat test cold test
or your epds or your test cavity
or your anaesthetic test so all that is
what you have learned until now the
talks about the nerve supply to the pulp
so now we are going to talk about the
blood supply to the pulp that is called
as
vitality test the first one that you
have to make a note about is laser
dipolar flow matrix
it's a non-invasive test because you are
not going to cause
any damage to the tooth structure which
helps in
measuring the blood flow okay it's going
to helps in
measuring the blood flow how when
you are going to hit a light okay you're
going to hit a light
and this light a part of the intensity
of this slide will be observed by the
red blood cells that are present in the
body
which are moving and some sort of
reflection will goes off
and which is detected by the photo
detector okay
so the drift in the change the change in
the
light density or the wavelength which
helps in determining the
determining the blood flow so that is
called as laser doppler flow material
which is based upon duplet's principle
okay what which we have learned in the
11th and 12th standard so
for the echo echo so something like
something is going to come hit the red
blade red blood cells there will be some
deviation and it's go the echo is going
to
go back so that is called is based upon
the duplet's principle laser
diplomatically
the word clearly says that it determines
the flow of the
red blood cell the second important is
pulse oximetry okay so pulse oximetry
so they can ask you questions on pulse
in now because most of you
are using it came a regularly used thing
right now so
similarly your pulse oximetry is useful
for also knowing the
pulp vitality so pulse oximetry is also
a non-invasive processor is also a
non-invasive procedure
which helps in knowing the oxygen metric
with he previously it is flowmetric
flow we are knowing the flow now it is
going to helps in knowing the oxygen
oxygen saturation levels of the blood
which are present in the
pulp so which oxygen means basing upon
the concentration of hemoglobin
its its going to help so here you can
see
two types of ah wavelengths are used
okay okay clearly giving you a hint okay
one is
660 second one is 940
right so what is 660 660 is red light
diode so you have two diodes
one is red light diode which is 660
nanometers
660 nanometers other one is infrared
diode which is of 940 nanometers most
commonly asked questions are these
numbers
660 and your 940
okay so what happens here okay what
happens here is
ah so once it was asked in the aims and
pga there
basing upon which principle does this
pulse oximetry is going to work so pulse
oximetry is going to work on two
principles then one is b its principle
one is peach principles and second one
is lambert's principle so what is
beard's principle brain's principle is
nothing but
the absorption of a light is directly
proportional to the concentration of the
sample
that is given so absorption is the that
if the density or the concentration is
very high
the absorption of light will be more if
it is less the absorption of light will
be less so that is the beard's principle
and the second one is lambdas
lambert's principle the absorption is
proportional to the thickness of the
sample
first one is concentration of the sample
second one is the thickness of the
sample so basing upon these
two principles your pulse oximeter is
going to work
so the important points in the pulse
oxymetry are it's a non-invasive
procedure
it helps in knowing the blood saturation
levels
it has two diets and their wavelengths
are important
and it works on two principles and what
is the meaning of those two principles
is a very very important in examination
point of view
the next comes these are few advanced
things but
there are chances that because nowadays
i mean like advanced questions are
regularly asked and most of your
advanced questions will be from perio
and like from endo perio
cons and oral surgery preferably when
compared to
any other subjects because these are the
clinically more
more like more oriented subjects so they
are asking questions on this so that is
called as joule wavelength
spectrophotometer so what is the dual
wavelength okay the word clearly gives
an idea that they have two wavelengths
okay so they are
dual wavelength spectrophotometer is is
one of the
uh principle is one of the way
by which your pulp vitality can be
known so the few few important things
that you have to make you know
when you're talking about this dual
wavelength
so this dual wavelength helps in
determining the oxygenation of the blood
oxygenation of the blood at two
wavelengths
one wavelength is 760 nanometers
and the second wavelength is 850
nanometers
you have two wavelengths one is 760 and
second one is
850 nanometers and these particular
uh like the the i mean the sensors
the sensors they helps in knowing the
oxygen oxygen levels of the blood at
these two levels that is 850 nanometers
and 760 nanometers and
uh and this particular dual wavelength
spectrophotometer
was able to differentiate okay
the productive values for a normal teeth
and an abnormal teeth so you're going to
compare a normal teeth to an abnormal
teeth by which the variations can be
gives an idea with other futures other
features and the symptoms of the patient
by which you can diagnosis the case
so you can ask me like what is the
difference between this particular thing
or pulse oximeter okay so pulse oximeter
the main difference between the pulse
oximeter is
the blood flow depends depends upon the
pulse that is
pulsation because the blood flow will
increase whenever the pulse is more
whereas this particular type of dual
wavelength
for spectrophotometer
measures the oxygen changes in the
capillary blood rather than the supplied
blood okay
so most your pulse oximeters depends
upon the supplied blood
okay whereas your your pulse oximeter
pulse oximeter depends upon the supplied
blood vessels
blood vessels whereas your
dual wavelength spectrophotometer
it depends upon the capillary
capillary prints so that is the main
difference between those
two types of devices which almost works
in the
same principle okay so so once we are
done with this the next
important aspect is uh tact
that is tuned aperture computer
tomography
okay which is called as tact so the main
important is when when you you're going
for the stacked radiograph what happens
is you're going to
expose the same teeth in different
directions
and by using a software
you're going to combine these all
radiographs which gives
a tuned aperture
this is a tuned aperture different
apertures
and you're going to buy by by by by
using a software you're going to combine
all this
in a simple simple so they're gonna ask
you question is how many radiographs are
taken in the stacked
eight radiographs are taken on the stack
you can see one
two three four five six seven eight so
eight different angulations
you're going to take a radiograph and
all these are going to be combined to
form
a single radiograph by using a software
which has
most of your questions will number of
radiographs number of angulations
of images taken in tuned aperture
tomography is eight
so i mean like i i mean like compared to
many other
scenarios like if you go uh in detail so
i mean even ct is used in some cases but
the most
prone or most commonly used nowadays is
the cbct
okay cbc2 of course we learn in detail
about the cbct
uh in your oral radiology part okay cbct
okay cone beam computer tomography is
the best way of identifying
any radiograph related stuff so they're
going to ask you like among the options
which is the best one to
determine the number of canals on the
radiograph or or
or an epical root fracture at which
level or anything
the best way is because this you can see
this in
a different layers of cross section in
the both horizontal or vertical
at any level by which you can clearly
identify any sort of abnormality or
problem with with this so that is the
main advantage because you will have a
different oxels
in this and you can observe at each
level like which like
which level it has started you can
clearly determine so this is the best
thing right now available for an
endodontist
to know the outcome of the treatment and
to it also helps in knowing the
prognosis or anything like diagnosis and
anything
so the best thing right now uh to know
the anatomy
at the best is cbct for an endodontist
so of course we'll learn in detail about
this when i'm talking about
the indoor related stuff yeah done for
now
