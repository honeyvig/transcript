hello everyone i am and welcome to
simply learn today we will take you
through the hands-on lab demo of how you
can implement the movie recommendation
system before we start i hope the skin
is clearly visible and the audio is fine
if yes please type in yes if there are
any shoes do let us know in the chat
section so that we can resolve them
i am repeating again before we start i
hope the screen is clearly visible and
the audio is fine if yes please type in
yes if there are any issues do let us
know in the chat section so that we can
resolve them
let's wait for some more minutes to let
other people join
yeah until then let me tell you guys

i'm repeating again let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple
technologies if you are a tech geek on a
continuous hunt for the latest
technological trends then consider

i can see the people start joining
great i think we can get started in
today's session we will go through what
is movie recommendation system after
that we will see how movie
recommendation system work
moving forward we will see filtering
strategies for movie recommendation
system and at the end we will see
hands-on lab demo like how to create
movie recommendation system using python
in detail we already have data set with
us we will perform different function
and implement a movie recommendation
system using python
before we move on to the programming
part let's discuss what is movie
recommendation system actually is and
proceed further for the same
so
renting cds and dvds reading local tv
listening
watching film strip projectors or
recordings all of this is a thing of the
past today all of the world's biggest
film collection have been digitized and
moved to the online streaming services
like netflix hbo or youtube
this platform can now help us with what
is possibly the most difficult task of
all choosing a movie
they have been enhanced with ai-powered
capabilities
well that is no longer a concern for you
it is finally time for machine learning
to put its skills on display in the
modern cinematic landscape
to create advanced predictive system for
true movie expert data scientists are
prepared to investigate our behavioral
patterns and those of movies
a movie recommendation system also known
as a movie recommended system uses
machine learning to predict or filter
user fill preferences based on their
prior decision and actions
it is an advanced filtration system that
anticipate the consumer in question
potential
like selection for a domain specific
item a movie
so after seeing what is movie
recommendation system let's move forward
and see how movie recommendation system
actually works a movie recommendation
system fundamental idea is a pretty
straightforward every recommended system
primarily consists of two components
users
and items
user receive more prediction from the
system and the actual movies are the
products filtering and predicting only
the movies that a matching user is most
likely to wish to see in the main
objective of movie recommendation system
the user information from the system
database is used by the ml algorithm for
these recommendation system
based on information from the past
this data is used to forecast the user
in questions behavior in the future
data should be handled by expert because
it is so crucial to ml projects
including the movie recommendation
system
after seeing how movie recommendation
system works let's see some filtration
strategies for the movie recommendation
system
to assist user in finding the most
relevant films
movie recommendation system employ a
variety of filtration techniques and
algorithm
the content based filtering and the
collaborative filtering system
subcategories of the ml algorithm used
for the movie recommendations
are the most well liked ones
filtering based on content or content
based filtering a method of filtering
movies in a movie recommendation system
that makes advantage of the item's data
this information which is taken from the
just one user is quite important in this
case
this technique uses an ml algorithm to
suggest movies that are comparable to
the user's past choices
therefore the information about the
prior movie choices and likes just one
person is used to generate similarity in
content based filtering
and the second one is collaborative
filtering
as the name implies this filtering
technique is based on the interaction
between the relevant person and the
other user
for the best outcomes the system
contrasts and compare these behaviors
it combines the film choices and uses
patterns of several people
like there are two types of
collaborative filtering algorithm the
first one is collaborative filtering
based on users the goal is to find
patterns in target users and other
database users like movie preferences
and the second one is collaborative item
based filtering the fundamental idea
behind this is to find comparable
products products like movies that
target users rate or interact with so
after seeing the filtering strategies
for movie recommendation system so here
is one question for you guys
i will give you one minute for this you
can comment or you can give answer in
chat section so i can see if the answers
given by you are right or wrong
i'm repeating again so here is one
question for you guys i will give you
one minute exactly one minute for this
you can comment or you can give your
answer in chat section so i can see if
the answers given by you are right or
wrong
so the question is
which is the best language for machine
learning programming
which is the best language for machine
learning the first one is java the
second one is python the third one is r
language and the fourth one is c plus
plus
so this is the question i am repeating
again which is the best language for
machine learning
though option one is java second python
r language and c plus plus
so i'm starting timer of one minute just
type your answers in comment section or
in a chat section do let me know your
answers
please i want that everyone should
participate in this and make this live
session interesting
so i am starting timer
oh your time starts now
please guys do let me know your answers
in chat section or in you can comment
down
42 seconds to go
you can comment or you can give your
answer in the chat section so i can see
if the answers given by you are right or
wrong
30 seconds more
which is the best language for machine
learning
you can give your answer in chat section
or you can comment
so i can see if the answers given by you
are right or wrong
guys come on please i want that everyone
should participate in this and make this
live section interesting
come on guys five second more
one
yup time up
so time is over we will give reply those
who gave correct answer and those who
didn't give correct answer we will give
you a reply with the correct answer
so now let's move to our programming
part to perform movie recommendation
system using python
so first we will open command prompt to
write command to open jupyter notebook
so we will write jupyter
notebook press enter
so this is the landing page of jupiter
notebook and select here new
new python file
so this is how jupyter notebook ui look
like so at first we will import some
major libraries of python which will
help us in mathematical functioning so
so the first one is numpy
import numpy as np
so numpy is a python library used for
working with ares it also has a function
for working in the domain of linear
algebra and matrices it is an open
source project and you can use it freely
numpy stands for numerical python
so
here np np is denoting numpy
so we will import the next library
port
pandas
as
pd
this should be space yup
so pandas is a software library written
for the python programming language for
data manipulation and analysis in
particular it offers data structures and
operation for manipulating numerical
tables and time series
so so after importing libraries we will
move ahead and import data set so for
importing data set we have to write
like we have two data set with us
let me show you the data set we have two
data set with us the first one is
credits
this one
and the second one is movies one
movies one
so don't worry you can get this data set
link in the description box
so let me write
here
credits
let's go
data frame
equals to pd dot
read
underscore csv
here you have to give your location of
the data set
edits
dot csv
the second one is
movies
let's go
data frame
this is for movie data frame pd.read
psp
so here you have to give the movie
location
movie data set location movies
dot
csv
okay everything seems good
let me run this
yeah
so then
here pd is for the pandas
library read is used for reading the
data set from the machine and csv is
used for the type of file which you want
to read
after this let's write code to see the
data set so we will write here
credits underscore df
and we will run it so this is our so
this is our credit data set
and next one is movies
underscore
so this is our movie data set
so this is how our
both data set look like so here you can
see
three dots
this one
and here also
this one
so we are unable to see our full data
set
like what if we want
like full a 4803 rows
so at that case
we can write
here
pd dot
set
underscore option
okay
and here we will write display
dot max
underscore columns
this
and here we will write none
same for the rows pd dot set
option
display
dot max
underscore rows
hey
none
let's run this
so now if we will write
credits
underscore
df
it is running yeah
so now you can see your full data set
like full credit data set with
four eight zero three rows or four eight
zero two rows because there is
this is starting from zero that's why so
what about movies data set
okay wait running
it is still running you can see here
so here you can see
the
full data set movie data set with 4802
rows
or if you want to see only five top rows
so you can write here
credits
underscore df dot
head
so by this
only five top rows so from head you we
can see our five top rows and if we will
use tail instead of head we can see our
last five rows so here let me do with
the movies one
df
dot
tail
yeah
so here you can see four seven nine
eight row four seven nine nine till four
eight zero two
so we tail we can see our last five rows
so moving forward let's merge the credit
data set to movie data set because if we
will combine them the confusion will be
less and at the end it will be better
for us
so we will write here movies
underscored
equals to movies
underscore data frame and credits
underscore df
on
it
does okay t is small i guess
yeah perfect
title
so let me do something something like
this
okay
it is saying data frame object is not
callable
edits underscore df
movies
okay why because
we haven't wrote merger
now it will work
yeah perfect it's working so data is
merged let's see the number of rows and
column using share function
so now we have only one so movies
underscore df
dot shape
okay let's run it 4 8 0 9 and 2 3 23 but
if we see here like in movies data set
so in movies data set here here yeah
yeah there are 20
and
in here we are four columns in credit
data set
so
like
so you will be thinking that's why not
24 why only 23 columns
that is why on title you can see here on
title the titles in both titles are same
you can see here
both titles are same
in both
okay let me show you like this
okay after pirates of the caribbean
spectre and so on
here you can see after pirates of the
academy inspector and so on
so that is why on title
written while merging so title are same
so moving forward let's see our merged
data set
so we will write only
movies
underscore data frame dot head
yeah
so
our data is merged you can see
the last cast crew movie id yeah you can
see here movie id title are the same
they are must car screw
okay guys
let me give some more
for the better view yeah
so you can see all columns of credit
data set are added to movies one so
moving forward let's see another
function like
movies
underscore df dot
info
so by this
yes you can see
so by this the data frame information is
printed via the info method
the data includes the total number of
columns their labels data kinds memory
use range index and the number of cells
in each columns like normal values
note that info method does indeed print
the information
so here you can see the all the
information is printed
okay
like
columns name and all null values count
and data types too like this int object
and
in which we are working most so after
this let's move forward and select some
main column in which we are working most
so we will write movies
underscore df
equals to movies
underscore df
score
title
comma and another one is overview
y
okay here we have to like this
yeah
so here we have to write genre
journal is complete and we will work on
what keywords keywords are the main
keywords ok keywords then
it will cast
then
we will
we will do recommendation with the creo
as well
okay
by running this let me see
our data again with 7
okay okay there is one error okay this
is movie
the movie the idea of jonathan yeah not
index okay got it got it
why not johnner
it's jonah's i guess
what it is it's jonah's
that's why
it's jonas okay
yeah so let's see our data again with
seven columns so i will write so i will
write
here movies underscore df
dot head
yeah
so you can see only our we have like
movies id same title overview joiners
keywords cast and crew only
so here you you can see the selected
columns okay so let's move forward and
once again let's see the info again like
movies
underscore tf dot
info has come with selected columns
and let's move forward and see how many
missing values are present in particular
column
so like
the columns is full we can see here but
we don't know about that
4803 values are filled or not
so what we will do it we will see
how many missing values are present
there
so
here we will write
like movies
underscore df
dot is null
or some
node like this
yeah perfect
so the function data frame is null this
one is null
dot sum dot sum returns the number of
missing values in the data set so here
you can see
overview have three missing values
so what we can do is we can write here
movies
underscore df
df
dot
drop n a
place
equals to
true
okay
we will run it it's sayings okay let's
document dropping a
person true okay fine
third underscore drop in a and yeah it
will not create an issue so if you set
in place equals to true the drop any
method will modify your data frame
directly that means that if you set in
place equals to true the drop n a will
drop all missing values from your
original data set let's move forward
and see
movies
underscore
df
dot
duplicated
so the duplicate method returns a series
with true on false
values that describe which rows in the
data frame are duplicated or not
use the subset parameter to specify if
any column should not be considered when
looking for duplicates
so
here let me run this first
so here we are we are getting 0
y 0
so if you are like thinking there is no
true or false return so if you write it
without sum like if i will write it
without sum
okay let me copy from here
yeah and i will run this
so
here you can see
false false false in whole data set
so some will combine them and return you
a value at the end zero represents false
itself
so we need
to not need this so we will write
something else
so moving forward let me write first
movies
underscore df
dot
i location
zero
dot jonners
let me run this
so the i log function this one i log
function
first let me do something like this
it will go up okay huh
okay so
from ilock function in python is defined
in the pandas module that helps us to
select a specific row or column from the
data set
using the ilok method in python we can
easily retrieve any particular value
from a row or column by using index
value so here zeroth position line is
coming
which is here you can see
so name action
like name action name adventure name
fantasy this side
fiction
this one science fiction yeah
so this is because i'm giving here genre
that is why you can see here
see
i did 28 name action name something
something something like that
okay
so
let's import something called ast
abstract syntax for tree
so this is one of the major library
import
ast
let me run this
import is a class defined is the ast
module that is used to express the
import statement in python in the form
of abstract syntax tree so
so an abstract syntax tree or just
syntax tree is a tree representation of
the of the abstract syntactic structure
of text written in a formal language
each node of the tree denotes a
construct occurring in the text
so
let's convert some like literal to
object and append them
so
here i will write def
convert
obj object
like
l
equals to
blank array
for
i in
s t dot
control
bit
eevee
which
object
okay like l
dot append
return
here we are converting is like
here is a convert is a function and l is
a array to append by using for loop we
can append them to name
so let me write code then i will explain
like what is happening
so let me write full code so movies
underscore tf
like
donors
okay
goes to movies
donuts
and then dot apply
what
so then movies
underscore df
then i will write keywords
let's do movies
underscore df
keywords
apply
df
dot
so if we will see our old data set in
that
like we will see old data set in that
genre and that's keyword this keyword
apps id name and so on like id that name
like
this type of things so it will create a
message retrieving them so by using ast
library we just convert them
to the normal one like
title
so got it guys so i hope you guys
understand till here
if you have any question or any query
regarding any code or question just put
as in comment our team will shortly
provide you the correct solution
application again i hope you guys
understand till here if you have any
type of questions regarding any code or
something
so
just put as in comments our team will
shortly provide you the correct solution
so moving forward let's convert cast to
and like same as previous way like like
this only
so what we will do
here we will write f convert
yeah
here i am using
so
l equals to
counter equals to zero
st
dot literal
if counter
does not
equals to 3
then
l
dot
l dot
dot append
okay then here i have to write i to name
okay
counter
equals to one
if you want to write like count as you
also counter plus one it is like both
the same
else
like
done
so let me run this
let me run this
okay so after this small code we have to
assign the values like
we are doing it for cost now so movies
okay
[Music]
let's go df
then cast
those two movies
underscore df
fast
dot
live
convert
everything seems good
so let's see the changes are visible or
not so we will write here movies
underscore tf
dot head
you can ignore this
like this is nothing
so here you can see cast is also
same like keyword and joiner
so
like
let's do for the creo 2
so
like we are converting you can say in a
structured way
so let's do for the crew one two
so let me
put some
yeah
so here we will add dev
like
fetch is nothing like
a function name as director
obj
okay
colon
l equals to
for i
n s t dot
literal
object
like we can say director
so then
l dot append
and dot a pan
um
dot append to the same name
put
return
capital l
so we have to again write that movies
video
equals to movies
in
crew
apply
h
just remember fetch director is a
function name
let's see changes
so here i have to write movies
then press enter
so yeah crew is all set so
changes are visible and data is looking
good so what we
like if i want to see the first movie
after overview this like this dot dot
dot
so i have to write
here
like
movies
overview
overview at
jiroth
place
so yeah
so this is a full overview of after
movie like let me read for this in this
2017 century
paraplegic marine is dispatched and blah
blah blah blah and civilization
so moving forward that what we want to
recommend movie in the basis of overview
genre keyword cast so for that we need a
separate separate words
like in the
then 22nd century along
so if you will see in other columns all
the words are separated but
like here if you will see all the words
are separated like action is separated
adventure is separated fantasy it's
separated
so
there is a long sentence in this this
one in the
overview one this is a long sentence
so it's difficult to recommend from this
so what we are going to do is well we
will separate them like like other
columns so here we will write
movies
overview
let's do movies
and
overview
and dot apply
lie my bad sorry
then lambda
colon x
dot
split
error
so let's see the results
so movies
yeah you can see in the center
so now you can see all the words are
separated by comma so now it will easy
to match overview to recommend a
particular movie so moving forward so
what we are going to do is if there
is a two word and space
between there
so we are going to remove that space
so here you can see science fiction are
separate separate
okay so we are going to re like remove
this one this is space
so let's write code for that
so here i will write like
overview is already done so we will do
not do for that so let's write code for
the rest columns
so here i have to write
movies
like
genres
pursue movies
and again
jonas
what apply
lambda
x
i
dot replace
this
mom
to know space
oh it seems
good
then i have to write for
everywhere so for i in
x
it's four i in x for i in x
movies genre is equal to movie journal
dot apply lambda x
i dot replace this to this one
seems good
so let's copy paste this
see
one for keywords and one for
cast and crew
fast
first
then you
test the same so let me run this
okay no error seems good
so let's see the changes so movies
so now you can see the science fiction
space is gone like here is science
fiction space is there
now science fiction space is gone
so
like
okay
let's move forward and create one new
column name as tag and put all the
column data in a particular column
okay let me do first
yeah let me write
movies
this is a column one column name goes to
movies
then first we will put
overview plus movies
and genres
and movies
and
what we have to give
keywords
keywords
then again
movies
then
fast
we run this
okay
so let's see the data frame
movies
okay still coming so
like there is one problem i guess
yeah no no no
so here you can see
all the data is merged in a under tag
column yes you can see like in the
second century blah blah blah
so
i hope you guys understand till here if
you have any question or any query
regarding any code
or anything just put as in comment or
our team will shortly provide you the
correct solution okay so i'm repeating
again i hope you guys understand till
here if you have any question or any
query regarding any code
or like any question just put as in
comment our team will shortly provide
you the correct solution
so from here let's create a new data
frame
okay
so let me create new data frame because
now we don't need this overview cast
crew journal
like columns like this we have already
merged into a one
one column like tag column so we will
write here
new
df equals to movies
okay
so
like movies we need movie id
new data frame we need movie id comma we
need title
and we have everything in tag column
text column so we need text column
okay
let's run this let's see our new data
frame
so this is our new data look likes with
only three columns like movie id title
and tags
so here you can see array brackets like
this this arrow brackets
so
we are gonna remove them
so we will do what we will write here we
will write
new
data frame
that intex
equals to
new
data frame
tags
dot apply
m
x
then i will give space
dot
join
seems good everything is okay okay fine
yeah
so let's see the results
so
we will write a new underscore data
frame
so you can see the brackets are removed
now let's see the data which is present
in the zeroth index and tag column like
this dot dot in this
okay for that we have to write here
uh a new
data frame
text
we did it before like for the overviewer
so
yeah
so this is the whole data in the first
like first index zeroth index
so
some part of the overview like from
civilization
and some are you can see this action
adventure fantasy science fiction
these are some
like genres
and
like here you can see
like these are some crews members
and
yeah like sam worthington like there are
some cast crew
okay
so like moving forward like what we are
going to do is just make them in lower
case for the better prediction like
something in capital and something like
smaller so let's make it to
case so new underscore df
tags
equals to
new
underscore df
tags
dot apply
scorm x
dot lower
okay
so don't worry about this error
let's see the result
new underscore df
dot
yeah now all the data present attack
column is in small case or you can say
lowercase moving forward
let's do some feature extraction using
count vectorizer
so
let let me write first from
sklearn
dot
feature
extraction
feature extraction okay cool
dot text
import
count
vectorizer
tv equals to
count
riser
underscore
features
features
equals to
like 5000
top
words
equals to
english
and this
yeah
so count vectorizer
okay there is a
i cannot import count vectorizer from
sql from user
okay okay sorry sorry my bad here v is
capital
okay guys so he v is capital yeah
so no error
so count vectorizer is a great tool
provided by the scikit learn library in
python it is used to transform a given
text into a vector on the basis of the
frequency count
of each word that occurs in the entire
text
so
let me write something cv dot
fit
underscore
transform
yes
x
like dot to add a
shape
okay
so the fit method like learns a
vocabulary dictionary of all tokens in
the raw documents that is it creates a
dictionary of tokens by default the
tokens are words separated by spaces and
like punctuation
so that maps each single token to a
position in the output matrix so here cv
is a like here cv is a counter
vectorizer
so let's convert into vector to array so
for this we have to write vectors
vectors equals to cv dot fit
yeah then transform
x
syn
so here we have to write
dot
to array
yeah then we have to write
vector
its vectors
yeah you can see vector 2 array all the
zeros
okay so moving forward let's get the
feature name by writing
okay so we will write here
leonlan
cv dot
get
feature
names
feature names okay then bracket
yeah
so okay we have like 500 feature names
so
i'm repeating i'm saying again like i
hope you guys understand till here if
you have any question or any query
regarding any code whatever it is so
just put as in comments our team will
shortly provide you the correct solution
okay guys like any code or you are not
understand anything just put as in
comment our team will shortly provide
you the correct solution
so let's import some major library which
is import
nltk
so what is nltk
the natural language toolkit nltk is a
platform used for building python
programs that work with human language
for applying in statical natural
language processing nlp it contain text
processing libraries for tokenization
parsing classification stemming tagging
and semantic reasoning
so moving forward like
from let me write first from
and
nltk
dot stem
dot porter
import
porter
yes equals to
water
timing is a process for reducing a word
to its word stem
that suffix and prefix or to the roots
of words known as a lemma
stemming is important in natural
language understanding nlu and natural
language processing nlp
so
here
like i have to write
so here i will write def
stem
to
text
y
equals to
or
i in
text dot split
y dot
append
dot stem
done
what join
why
so let's apply stemming to our tag
column so here we will write new
df
text
equals to
new
f
tag
dot apply
um
so let's import cosine similarity from
sklearn so here we will write from
sklearn
dot
matrices
dot pairwise
import
cosine
underscore see me
clarity
it seem good from escalant mattresses
matrix sorry matrix dot
peerwise it is
here wise
pairwise import cosine similarity okay
let's run this no error so cosine
similarity measures the similarity
between two factors
i repeat cosine similarity measures the
similarity between two vectors of an
inner product space it is measured by
the cosine of the angle between two
vectors and determines whether two
vectors are pointing in roughly the same
direction
it is often used to measure document
similarity in text analysis
so here we will write
cosine
underscore semi
clarity
vectors
so these
all are the vector present
let's see the cosine similarity vector
column and row using space
so here i will write cosine
similarity
vectors
dot shape
so it's still running you can see here
yeah
so 4806 rows and 4806 columns are there
let's assign variable similarity to this
okay so let's similarity
we'll write like this right equals to
cosine
similarity
this underscore
here why did this because we don't have
to write always this long sentence
a long keyword you can say
so moving forward let's see first column
like we will add similarity
so this is our first column
so let's see the rows only so we will
write here
clarity
zero
dot
shape
okay 4x06 okay
so let's move forward and let's create
some like sorted list
so
[Music]
for that sorted
test
enumerate
spelling is fine
okay one more like semi larity
similarity
zero
then i have to write reverse
equals to true
comma key
equals to
lambda colon
x
not capital x x
have to write one
one colon six
seems good
yeah
so the enumerate function in python
converts a data collection object into
an enumerate object
enumerate returns an object that
contains a counter as a key for each
value with an object making item within
a collection easier to access so finally
let's create the recommend function to
check the movie recommendation system
okay
so
[Music]
so let's write here df
recommend
we
yes
so new
df
in the df
title
equals to
movie
x
zero
tenses
versus similarity
and movie
yeah
so movies
list
equals to sorted
list
numerate
rate and rate
distances
comma reverse
row
keyword
sorry key only k
equals to
lambda
it's called colon x
one
and
one six
or i in movies
list
support
df
dot i lock
i
zero
zero
dot title we because we need title only
so
yeah it seems good okay
so finally that like time is game
so finally the time has come to check
the recommendation of your favorite
movies so you can comment
in the chat section so i can check
so let me write first recommend
recommend for movie
avatar
okay
so here you can see the recommendation
system is working fine
so titan a dot e small soldier
independence they are the recommendation
for the movie after
so let me check for the another one
recommend
like for
one of my favorite movie iron man
so here you can see iron man 2 iron man
3 avenger siege of ultron captain
america and the avengers are the
recommendations for the movie iron man
so let me check for the one more
recommend
liars
liar
is going on 30 and the last one is
last one i want to check is
captain america civil war
let me copy from here only
yeah you can see the captain america the
first avenger the winter soldier iron
man 3 age of ultron the avengers
so i hope you guys understand till here
if you have any questions or any query
regarding any code or question just put
as in comments our team will shortly
provide you the correct solution
i hope you guys must have understood the
concept of how movie recommendation work
and how we can implement it using python
if you have any queries you can ask in
the comment section below our team will
respond you as soon as possible and if
you want this full code if you want this
full code this full code if you want
so just comment for the same
