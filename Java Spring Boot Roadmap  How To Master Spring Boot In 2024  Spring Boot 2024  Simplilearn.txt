whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we move on just a quick
info guys simply learn has got Java full
stack course in collaboration with IBM
you can accelerate your career and
develop essential skills such as react
spring boot hibernate jsps and also
mastering MVC and web services to craft
highly scalable web application so with
that said guys let us start so guys let
us start with understanding first what
is spring board so guys springboot is an
open-source Java based framework which
is used to create Standalone production
grade spring based applications with
Minal effort it is a part of a larger
spring framework ecosystem which
provides a streamline approach to
building application by reducing the
amount of boiler plate code and also
configuration needed now let us discuss
some of the key features of spring board
the first one that comes to my mind is
called
autoconfiguration so guys spring boot
automatically configures your
application based on the dependencies
you have added to the project this means
you don't have to manually configure
settings for the majority of the common
use cases second one we have the
Standalone applications springboard
applications can run independently
without requiring an external web server
it includes embeded servers like Tomcat
JY or under which allows you to run your
application as a simple Java application
the third one that we have all over here
is called Spring boot starters starters
are a set of convenient dependency
descriptors you can include in your
application they can simplify Marvin or
gradal configuration by providing a
single dependency for common use case
example we have spring boot stter web
for web
applications next we get is the
production ready features springbot
includes several features to help you
build production ready applications this
includes heal checks metrics and
application monitoring through
springboard actuators now fifth one we
have the microservices if I talk about
microservices guys then spring boot is
particularly well suited for
microservices architecture it integrates
well with spring Cloud providing tools
for service Discovery configuration
management and resence and finally we
have the command line features spring
boot CLI is a command line tool that can
be used to quickly prototype with spring
it allows you to run groovy scripts to
perform spring boot operations so Guys
these were some of the features of the
spring boot boot now let me show you a
snippet like how exactly spring boot
works so I'll be using an eclipse ID to
demonstrate the same so guys as you can
see all over here this is a basic spring
application so I'm using spring board
for the same and you can see the folder
structure all over here that we have the
rest folder this is our project folder
inside which which we have the main
folder and here you can see there's a
rest folder this is our package two
classes we have created this is a main
class so so here you can see I have
annotated with spring boot application
which is telling the spring that hey
Spring this is a main class or an
application class okay with the main
function all over here okay next one we
created a controller all over here so
you can see the controller so if I'm
going to the Local Host saying 8080 with
uh the given URL then I'm going to see
the hello world all over here so this is
a basic controller and for the same I'm
using The annotation rest controller
which is telling spring that hey Spring
this is a controller's class okay so
this is how basically our framework
understands like what is there with the
help of annotations so it is a basic
thing and here when you run this your
spring application will start and here
you are going to see an spring
annotation something like this so you
can see the version we are using is V3
1.10 so let us go to the Local Host 880
and see what is the output
so guys as you can see all over here we
are directed to the Local Host 880 and
the URL is /hello okay which we have
mentioned in our rest controller and it
is printing hello world so this is how
basically a spring application works now
let us move on and try to understand
what is the exact road map that we have
to follow in order to master the spring
board so guys as you can see in this
image the first step is the prerequisite
which I would say so Larn J before
diving into springboard it is very
essential to have a strong foundation in
Java and make sure you understand Java's
Core Concepts such as objectoriented
programming data structures and
algorithms familiarize yourself with
Java syntax libraries and framework once
you are comfortable with Java Basics and
advanced topics like congruency streams
and Lambda Expressions you can move on
to the next step that is spring core and
the spring core is a foundation for the
spring framework it provides provides
the essential features needed for
dependency injection and aspect oriented
programming configuration start by
learning how to set up and configure
spring applications using XML and Java
based
configuration understand the use of
annotations such as configuration at the
rate atate Bean annotations for defining
beans and their dependencies learn about
the principle called dependency
injection study how spring manages
object dependencies using dependency
injection explore different types of
dependency injections such as
Constructor based setup based and field
based learn the ioc principle which
transfers the control of object creation
and the management to the spring
container understand the role of
application context and bean factory
spring aspect oriented programming is
very very important so try to understand
its aop Concepts and how they separate
cross cutting concerns like login
transaction management security also
Implement aspect oriented programming
using Springs at the rate aspect J
annotation then explore the MBC
architecture and also how spring
implements it learn to create
controllers using at theate controller
annotation also like request mapping
annotation Define models render views
using JSP or timelink also if we talk
about annotations guys get familiar with
the annotations so it is mentioned at
this section all over here so learn
about important annotations such as at
theate component atate service atate
repository atate Auto and many more
these annotations are going to simplify
the configuration and development
process the next is we have it the
spring Bean scope learn about different
Bean Scopes like single turn prototype
request session Global session Etc
understand the use of cases and life
cycle of each scope after mastering
spring core you are ready to proceed for
the next step that is Spring Security if
it talk about Spring Security Guys in
this you have to learn a comprehensive
Security Services for Java application
including authentication authorization
and protection against common attacks
authentication study about various
authentication mechanism such as form
based HTTP basic and ldap authentication
Implement authentication using Spring
Security such as at the enable web
security annotation and configure at web
security configur adapter
authorization learn about also managing
user roles and permissions Implement
method level security using
pre-authorized and secured annotations
secure web requests with URL patterns
and roles if we talk about o 2 also
understand the O2 for securing apis and
implementing the O2 authorization server
and resource server using Spring
Security
O2 also learn about handling token
generation validation and scopes
learn about JWT authentication explore
about Json web tokens for stateless
authentication you can also Implement
JWT in a spring boot application to
secure the restful apis once you are
comfortable with the Spring Security you
can advance to The Next Step that is
spring boot introduction now spring boot
is going to simplify the development of
production ready applications by
providing an opiated framework so get an
overview of spring Boot and its
advantages
understand its role in simplifying
application setup and
development okay familiarize yourself
with the key terms like starters Auto
configuration actuators and many more
learn how these components streamline
the development process also understand
the architecture okay of the spring boot
applications learn about the main
application class which is annotated
with the adorate springbot application
which I have shown you before also learn
about how you can structure your project
okay study why you have to choose spring
the benefits of using spring including
the dependency injection a of testing
and it's a rich ecosystem in the next
step learn about the spring boot
starters which are preconfigured set of
dependencies for various functionalities
use starters like spring boot starter
web for web applications and spring boot
starter data jpa for jpa applications
after understanding starters move on to
the next step that is auto
configurations explore spring boots AO
Auto configuration feature which
automatically configures your
application based on dependencies in the
class path so you're going to learn
about at theate conditional on class
annotation at theate conditional on
missing beam annotation and many more
like this once you are comfortable with
autoc configuration proceed to The Next
Step by understanding the actuators
Implement spring boot actuators to
Monitor and manage your application
understand various endpoints provided
for heal checks metrix and environment
info
next on move on understanding about the
embeded server use embeded servers like
Tomcat Jetty or undertoe bundled with
spring boot configure and customize
server settings in application.
properties file or even in application.
yml file after mastering embeded servers
advance to The Next Step that is
hibernate integrate hibernate with
spring boot for object relational
mapping configure hibernate create
entity classes manage database operation
understand the caching mechanism with
session management with hibernate
knowledge in hand proceed to The Next
Step that is spring Cloud so guys spring
cloud is going to provide tools for
building distributed systems and
microservices learn about spring Cloud
Gateway learn to use spring Cloud for
routing and filtering request for
microservices configure routes apply
filters and manage configuration spring
Cloud config implements centralized
configuration management using spread
cloud config store configurations in a
good repository and access them across
multiple microservices so guys after
understanding spring Cloud Gateway move
on to Spring Cloud config store
configurations in a gate repository and
access them across multiple
microservices then move ahead on
understanding this spring Cloud circuit
breaker use circuit breaker for fall
tolerance in microservices Implement
circuit breaker patterns using residence
4J or
hisy then move on to Spring Cloud open
fine implement the declarative rest
clients using open fine create fine
clients config load balancing and handle
errors study about historics okay for
latency and fall tolerance also you can
understand about sluth and urea for the
same so guys sluth is going to implement
distributed tracing and also you can
trace request across microservices
generate Trace IDs and visualize traces
using tools like jkin if I talk about
urea guys you can use urea for service
Discovery and
registration next one let us move on to
the next phase once you are comfortable
with the spring Cloud move on the next
step that is learning microservices
learn to develop and deploy
microservices using spring boot
understand microservices architecture
and design patterns so guys after
mastering microservices move on to the
next step that is mastering spring data
GP
so if I talk about spring data jpa guys
you can Implement jpa for database
operations after mastering this you can
also learn about spring data mongodb and
spring data jdbc moving ahead after
learning all these things after applying
the crud based operation learning all
about the manipulation like configuring
data sources creating repositories and
executing SQL queries move on to the
next step that is learning about spring
MVC
where you have to learn about serlet JSP
files architectures and its
component moving ahead after you have
completed all these things okay then
move on to the testing part so guys
testing is very very crucial for
ensuring the quality and reliability of
your
application with the help of jpa you can
write test for jpa repositories set up
an in-memory database for testing
creating test cases and verify
repository methods so you have mock MVC
Test spring MVC controllers you can use
it using mock MVC you can set up mock
MVC right unit test for controllers and
also you can verify request and response
Behavior then you can use The annotation
such as spring boot test annotation with
for integration testing you can load the
application context configure test
properties and write comprehensive test
then you have at the rate Moog Bean
annotation so generally Mo beans in test
use at the rate Mo Bean
replace real beans with Mock
implementations and verify interactions
in unit test so in this way I have laid
out the entire road map for you to
become an spring boot Master this was
