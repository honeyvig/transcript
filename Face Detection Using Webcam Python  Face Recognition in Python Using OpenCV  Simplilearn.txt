it I think we can get started so in
today's session we will see what opencv
is moving forward we will see what is
space detection and at the end we will
go through the hands of live demo of how
we can create phase detection using
opencv python we will perform different
function and use different python
libraries to create face detection
before we move on to the programming
part let's discuss what opencv is and
proceed further for the same
what is opencv
a collection of python bindings called
opencv python was created to address
issue with the computer vision
python is general purpose programming
language created by Judo Von Rasam that
quickly gained popularity largely due to
its ease of use and readable code the
programmer can express Concept in less
code without sacrificing readability
numpy a highly efficient library for
numerical operation with a Matlab like
syntax is used by opencv python numpy
arrays are translated into and out of
all opencv array forms additionally this
make it simpler to interact with other
numpy using libraries like scipy and
matplotlib after understanding what is
opencv let's move forward and see what
phase detection is so what is Phase
detection
phase detection also known as facial
detection is a computer technology that
uses artificial intelligence to find and
recognize human faces in digital
photographs
Fair detection technology can be enabled
real-time surveillance and tracking of
people in various Industries such as
security Biometrics law enforcement
entertainment and personal safety
from basic computer vision method to
developments in machine learning to
increasingly use complex artificial
neural network and related Technologies
phase detection has advanced leading or
to ongoing performance increases
it now serves as the foundation from
some crucial applications such as face
tracking phase analysis face recognition
the application ability to perform
sequential tasks subsequently impacts
the phase Direction

so now let's move to our programming
part to create phase detection using
opencv python
so first we will open command prompt to
write a command to open jupyter notebook
so here we will write Jupiter
notebook
press enter
so this is the landing page of Jupiter
notebook and here you have to select new
python file
so this is how the Jupiter notebook UI
looks like so at first we will import
some major libraries of python which
will help us in creating a phase
detection system
so first let me rename this
paste
Direction
first we will import import
CV2
press enter then import another Library
import numpy
as NP
and the third one is Major One Import
face
recognition
as
fr
then press enter
so CV means capturing video
the CV2 function is opencv can read
video video capture by using pass 0
function parameter we can access our
webcam we may pass as rtsp URL in the
function parameter to capture the CCTV
footage
which is quite helpful for video
analysis
and another one is numpy numpy is a
python Library used for working with
arrays it also has function for working
in the domain of linear algebra and
matrices it is an open source project
you can use it freely numpy stands for
numerical python
and the third one is Phase recognition
phase recognition and manipulation using
python or the command line the easiest
facial recognition library in the world
built using Cutting Edge face
recognition technology from dlib
developed using deep learning
so moving forwards let's import our
video capture device so for that we have
to write Here video
underscore capture this is our variable
name
equals to
CV2 Dot
video
capture
and we have to pass here zero
then press enter
okay here V
should be capital
so the video capture function from
opencv is used to interact with the
cameras what we can do is video can be
shown and saved display the image that
the camera captured
so moving forward let me import my image
for the further detection process okay
so
image equals to
FR dot load
underscore image
underscore file
then
image name or image path boy
dot jpg
press enter
using load image file we can import
image file to our detection system so
moving forward let's set encoding for
the image okay so I will write here
image underscore phase underscore
encoding
equals to
FR Dot
face
encodings
and image
than zero
press enter
yeah so face encoding basically uses 128
computer generated measures to represent
the phase similar encoding would be
present in two images of the same person
while being completely different in two
images of two distinct people
so moving forward let's do let me write
first
I will write here known
encodings
equals to
image
phase
coding
okay
then press enter
then known
phase
names
equals to
then here I have to put my name so I
will write
Bank
okay then press enter
so what I did is I assigned known phase
encodings to my image face encoding so
what will happen if image matches to my
face then it will print my name and for
the rest we will add name unknown
okay so let me add the function now for
face detection system
so let me write the full code for it
first then I will explain you line wise
okay
so just stay tuned with me
I will write here
so I will add while
okay true
okay so r e t comma frame I will explain
you line wise line don't worry equals to
then video
capture
dot read
and RGB
underscore frame
was to
frame
then colon
comma then again colon comma then two
colon
then minus 1.
okay
yeah
so here I will write FC underscore
locations
equals to FR dot face
underscore locations
RGB
underscore frame
right here FC FC is for basically face
encodings
plus two fr
dot face
underscore encodings
and RGB
underscore frame
comma FC underscore
locations
okay
so for
top
comma right comma
bottom
left
okay then I have to write your face
the score encoding
comma face underscore encoding this is
that was encodings this is encoding
okay so before that I will write here
Okay so
I have to write here encoding
in zip
okay then here I have to write
FC underscore
locations locations
okay
then
comma then face encodings
colon
then press enter
so here I have to write matches
yeah
matches equals to FR dot compare
and faces
then known
the score phase
let's score encodings
comma
face underscore encoding
okay
so
it so what if
the image will not match so I have to
give the name equals so
unknown
then we will write face distances
plus 2
FR dot phase
underscore distances
core phase
underscore encodings
comma paste
School
encoding
then I will write match underscore index
equals to NP Dot
AR
G min
okay then I will write here FC
underscore distances
yeah
then moving forward
I have lied if
matches
then match underscore
index
okay then colon
then name
equals to
known underscore phase
underscore names
then
match underscore index
and I have to write here CV2
Dot rectangle
and frame
comma
comma top
comma right
I have to give another bracket here
Oma
bottom
that comma
0 comma 0 comma 255
again comma then 2 for the Border
so then CV2 dot rectangle
yeah
comma then again
left comma
bottom
then minus
35.
okay
so then I will write
write
comma bottom
comma
then again
0 comma 0 comma 255
then CV2 dot f i l l e d field
okay
F should be capital
yeah
so then we will set font equals to
CV2
Dot
font
okay
font
the score
underscore
simplex
okay
so then I have to write here
CV2
dot put
text
aim
comma name
comma
left
six
comma bottom
minus six
okay then comma point
comma
1.0 then
again one comma then we have to set
location like 255
comma 255
comma 255
then comma
1.
okay
and here I have to write CV2
dot image show I am show
then like
simply learn
is detection
comma frame
foreign
CV2 Dot
weight key
is 1
and
like 0 x
f
the capital f f equals to equals to
ORD then
quit
and here I will write break
I will write video
underscore capture
dot release
dv2
dot destroy
all
windows
okay yeah
so let me explain you
so in general rad is a Boolean value
that indicates whether or not there was
a even a return each frame that is
written is at this same frame if there
is no frame you will receive none rather
than an error
in opencv reading and writing videos and
reading and writing images are quite
similar a video is nothing more than a
collection of pictures often known as
frames
so to draw a rectangle around the face
that was discovered we utilize the
opencv rectangle the rectangle function
we can draw the rectangle by using the
points or Corners position that the
phase location
and
is encoding this a face encoding this
one
so a face encoding basically uses 128
computer generated measures to represent
the phase similar encoding what we
present in two images of the same person
while being completely different in two
images of two distinct people
so this there is a use compare phase
so compare phase is used to compare my
face to uploaded image one okay if it
matches it will print my name otherwise
we have given a known here
so the numpy ARG arm
this one
where it went this numpy ARG min
so the number ARG main method delivers
the indexes of the arrays minimum
element along each axis return an array
of array indices with the same shape of
the array
so this font where is yeah
font Hershey simplex
is normal size of sans serif font okay
so put text put text is used to put the
text on the frame like my name or
unknown
so in order to display an image in a
window we use the IM show this one
the Samsung function
okay so the window adjust itself to the
size of image parameters window name a
string that identifies the window in
which the displayed image will appear
okay
so until a key is pressed wait key zero
this one okay so until a key is pressed
wait key 0 will will keep the window
open it is suitable for image display
and wait key one
I write here wait key one
so wait key one will show a frame for
one Ms before closing the display on its
own
so after the script has ended users can
close or remove all the windows use the
python
like using destroy all function function
okay you would use the function if you
wanted to close a window while it was
open in numerous windows at once
so let's see our phase detection system
is working or not so let me close this
person on your screen first okay so let
me close this first
let me run this
now so here you can see this pop-up and
I will open so here you can see my name
is correctly printing
okay
so
like I have uploaded my image it's
detecting correctly okay
so like what if I show uh one more image
so here you can see this is my card
so it is
detecting properly
yeah
so what if I will show like another guy
image so from my mobile
so here you can see
it is spring unknown in
Messi's photo
yeah
so what if if I will write here like uh
one of the
other image this random.jpg then it
should print unknown for me also okay
then I will run it again
okay it's working
has come
so here you can see it is now printing
unknown because like I have uploaded
that another random image here so it is
importing
okay so it is printing unknown here
so here you can see like it's spinning
unknown for me also so I hope you guys
understand till here if you have any
question or any query regarding any code
or question just put us in comments our
team will shortly provide you the
correct solution I hope you guys must
have understood how you can create phase
detection system using open Siri python
