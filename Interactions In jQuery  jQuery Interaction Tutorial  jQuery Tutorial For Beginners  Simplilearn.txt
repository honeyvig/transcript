hello everyone and welcome to simply
learns youtube channel today we'll be
taking you through interactions in
jquery ui in this video we'll see what
interactions are their syntax and then
we'll see different types of
interactions present in jquery
so before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple
technology videos so if you are a tech
geek in a continuous hunt for the latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and press that bell icon to
never miss any updates from simplylearn
so without any further delay let's get
started
so far we have covered widgets and their
usage in the past few videos widgets
make it easier for us to perform a
function or access a service with less
code required
we came across different types of
widgets and their usage it's quite easy
to use widgets in jquery all we have to
do is to call the widget with specific
name and that's it jquery even allows us
to make customizations in widgets right
now talking about interactions they have
almost the same syntax as widgets but
the working and customizations makes the
difference
interactions basically let the user
perform various actions on the dome
element with the help of mouse without
changing the appearance of the element
the first interaction we'll be going
through today is the draggable
interaction in jquery
this interaction enables draggable
functionality to any dom element
it is used to move the draggable object
by clicking on it with the mouse and
dragging it anywhere within the viewport
this interaction allows us to move a
particular element whether it be an
image or a box or anything movable
across the screen
we can customize the way we can move the
box with the help of certain
customizations as well
let's go through the official jquery ui
website to see the working of this
interaction and then we'll use it in our
own program here we are on the official
website of jquery ui and you can see
over here we have all the interactions
which are placed differently from
widgets right we have all the
interactions over here then we have
widgets as well click on the draggable
interaction draggable interaction is the
first interaction available here click
on it and it will take us to a new page
you can see over here we have a box with
some text present inside it which says
drag me around click and hold over the
box and try to drag it we are able to
drag it here right so let's achieve this
thing in our own program now and then
we'll go through the customizations as
well here we are in the vs code now
we'll do the draggable thing with two
different boxes so let's add them
quickly what we'll do is we'll write
here inside the body tag
we'll use the div tag we'll write here
div
and inside this div tag we'll create
another division for box one so we'll
write here div id is equal to let's say
okay we'll use class for this so we'll
write here class is equals to let's say
box and we'll close this div tag now
we'll write something inside it so let's
say we are writing here box one
now we'll create another box for that we
have to use another div tag we'll write
here diff class is going to be the same
we'll write here box
then we'll write here inside this box
2 let's say fine
save this program and you can see here
we have some text present on the screen
which says box 1 and box 2. so let's
style these boxes as well
what we'll do is we'll write here inside
the head tag
we'll use the style tag for this so
we'll write here style
and inside this
we are going to make some style changes
in these boxes so we'll write here box
because box is the class we'll write
here dot box now inside this will write
let's say we are using border border is
going to be let's say 5 pixel
solid
and let's say black in color fine let's
keep it simple for now we'll use the
height over here we'll write your height
as let's say 100 pixels
then we'll define width as well width is
again going to be 100 pixels
and finally after this we'll write here
margin margin is going to be let's say
10 pixels
and we'll align this text to the center
so we'll write here text align at the
center
fine
now we are done with it save the program
and you can see we have two boxes now
the next thing we want to do is we want
to move these boxes with the help of a
mouse button right for that we have to
use the draggable interaction from
jquery ui we discussed earlier that the
syntax remains almost the same for
interactions and widgets in jquery so
let's add the interaction to our program
now
here we are in the javascript file and
what we'll do is we'll write here
dollar now we need to access these boxes
for that we have the class as box so
we'll write here dot box
and then we'll write here dot
draggable
it is a method so we'll use parenthesis
now that's it guys we are done now we'll
be able to move those boxes in our
browser
save the program and try doing it so you
can see we are now able to move these
boxes across the browser
we are able to move them freely try
moving them to the bottom and you can
see the scroll bar appearing over here
right
the same thing will happen if we try to
move it horizontally if we try to move
it horizontally you can see the scroll
bar at the bottom of our browser
so we are good to go with that
now talking about the customizations we
have in this interaction we can control
the dragging path of the element we can
either make it draggable along the
x-axis which means horizontally or along
the y-axis which means vertically so for
that we have to write here inside this
we have to use curly braces for
customizations the same thing we did
with widgets as well
now we'll write over here axis
axis we are going to define so let's say
we are writing here x we are going to
drag the box along the x-axis now save
the program and you can see we are not
able to move the box towards the bottom
side right we are not able to move the
box along the y-axis what we can do is
we can move this box horizontally only
because we have defined the axis as
x and now we will be able to move the
box horizontally only
the next thing we can do is we can also
change the cursor upon dragging the box
to make it look a bit more interactive
what we have to do is we have to write
here after a comma we have to write here
cursor
and we have to define here
grabbing fine this is the cursor name
now save the program
and you will notice on dragging the
element the cursor changes right we can
also change the opacity of this element
on dragging you can see we have the
opacity as one because the black color
is completely visible for now we can
change it just right here after a comma
opacity
and we'll define the opacity as
let's say 0.5
fine
now save the program try to drag this
box and you can see on dragging the
opacity changes to 0.5 of this
particular box the same thing will go
for box 2 as well
because we have defined the axis as x we
are not able to move the box in other
directions so let's comment this
axis for now save it now and you can see
now we are able to move these boxes
freely fine the next thing we can do
here is we can also limit the dragging
area of this box we can either limit it
to the division or to the document as
well so for that we have to define a
property over here we have to write here
after a comma
containment
and then we have to write here either
parent for division and for document we
have to write a document only so let's
do it with parent
save the program
and you can see the area is limited now
we can drag it till here only we can't
drag it out of this box because we have
a division over here defined as well and
these boxes are present inside that
division if you go back to the html
document you can see here we have this
div tag as well we can move these boxes
only inside this div tag we can't go out
of this so this is how we can limit the
dragging area of a particular element
another property we can use is the grid
property so let's write here first and
then you can understand it much better i
guess so we'll write here grid
and we'll define the grid inside
these brackets we'll write here 300
comma 300
now save the program and you guys will
get it much better but before that let's
comment this piece of code we are not
going to limit the draggable area of
these boxes save it now and now on
dragging the box you can see that it
automatically stops after 300 pixels and
the in between movement of the box is
not visible let me zoom out the browser
for you and you can see it more clearly
now you can see the box stopping after
300 pixels and the in between movement
of this box is not visible so this is
how we can use the grid property to make
it look more interactive to the user
now the last two properties we are going
to discuss today are the snap and the
snap tolerance properties if the snap
property is set to true then the two
boxes will stick together if closer to
each other the snap tolerance property
defines the distance between the
elements to stick together so let's use
them here first
we'll
comment this grid as well we'll write
here
after
this snap so snap is a boolean property
we'll write here true for that and we'll
write here snap
tolerance fine
and we'll set snap tolerance to let's
say 100 pixels this is in pixels keep
this thing in mind
now if the distance between the two
boxes at any time becomes 100 or less
than 100 then both the boxes will stick
together save the program and you can
see over here that moving the first box
near to the second one they are sticking
together right the snap tolerance is
hundred it means that if we try to bring
the box near to box two and the distance
between them is either 100 or less than
that then the boxes will stick together
so this is how we can use the draggable
interaction to make our web page more
interactive i hope you guys got it the
basic definition states that
interactions let the user perform
various actions on the dom element with
the help of the mouse without changing
the actual appearance of the dom element
the sortable interaction we'll be going
through today is used to sort elements
just by dragging them
so let's go through the jquery ui
website quickly and then we'll use it in
our own program
here we are on the official website of
jquery ui we'll go to the sortable
interaction directly here it is click on
it and here you can see we have a list
of items
we can sort them according to our needs
if we pick any one of them from its
position and if we try to drag it to
another place you can see we can do so
because of the sortable interaction in
jquery ui
the sortable interaction enables a group
of dom elements to be sortable click on
it and drag the element to a new spot
within the list and all the other items
will adjust according to this particular
item
it shows all the properties of the
draggable interaction by default we'll
see them after going through the syntax
of this interaction so let's move on to
the vs code and we'll try to implement
this thing in our own program now here
we are on the vs code the first thing
we'll be doing is to add those elements
to our web page for that what we'll do
is we'll take a div tag and we'll define
the list inside that particular div tag
we'll write here div
close it now what we have to do is we
have to declare an unordered list for
that we'll use the ul tag we'll write a
ul
class is going to be let's say sort
we'll close this stack and now inside
this will define the list fine
we'll use the li tag for that we'll
write here li id is equals to let's say
sortable we are giving all these
elements ids because we want to style
them as well so for styling purpose
we'll be using the id attribute
we'll close it and here we'll write the
name of item let's say item one
will copy this piece of code from here
we'll paste it certain times
and then we'll change the name of items
fine we'll write here item 2
then we have item 3
4
5 6 and
7. fine
we have a list of items on our web page
so you can see we have seven different
items over here now let's style them as
well for that what we'll do is we'll
move to the head tag of our html file
and we'll use the style tag over here
we'll write here inside this style tag
hash
sortable this is the id now we'll style
these elements
we'll write here
border
border is going to be two pixels solid
in nature and
black in color
then we'll write a height so let's say
the height is
20 pixels for each box then we'll write
your width
width is going to be let's say 100
pixels they are going to be rectangular
in shape not squares so height and width
is going to be different let's define
the margin as well let's say margin is
10 pixels
then we have text align as well fine so
let's say we are writing a text align at
the center
save it now
and here you can see we have all the
boxes over here but it's still not
working
let's see what the problem is
so you can see over here we have a
mistake we have written here as loid so
we'll correct it we have solid over here
now save it and you can see we have all
the items over here we have seven items
all are placed inside boxes
now we did some basic styling here
everyone can understand it because it's
so basic the next thing we have to do is
to use the sortable interaction here for
that we'll move to a javascript file
so here is a javascript file now we have
to use this interaction in all the items
so we have to use it with the parent
element to make each box movable within
the area covered by the ul tech
so we'll be using the class attribute
here
we'll write here
dollar now we are going to take a
selector so for that we'll write here
dot sort because this is the class name
and then we'll write here dot sortable
fine this is the interaction name it is
basically a method that's why we are
using parentheses over here
that's it guys the sortable interaction
can do the rest of task by itself
this interaction over here is already
defined inside the jquery file all we
need to do is to pass it as a method and
jquery will take care of the rest
we are done with it let's save the
program
save it and here you can see it on the
browser that we are able to move a
particular box now click on item 1 and
you can see we are able to drag it and
if we put it down here you can see all
the other items adjusting themselves
without any problem so we have already
discussed that the sortable interaction
has all the customizations of the
draggable interaction by default let's
use them what we'll do is
we'll write here inside
curly braces we'll write here let's say
opacity this property we have used in
the previous interaction as well so
let's define the opacity as 0.5 then we
have cursor
we can write here cursor as let's say
grabbing a hand like thing will come
when we try to grab the boxes now
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write here containment
it can either be document or the parent
so for now we will be using parent over
here
then we have let's say delay and
we'll define the delay in milliseconds
so let's say the delay here is 300
milliseconds and the last thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
here distance
fine we are going to write here 50 now
so here we have all the customizations
allowed by this interaction in jquery ui
almost all of them are from the previous
interaction that is the draggable
interaction the distance here is in
pixels and it means that this
interaction will work only if we drag
the element for 50 pixels
save the program now try to move a box
you can see we are not able to move a
box until the distance reaches 50 pixels
fine so this is how this distance
property actually works now the delay
property defines the time interval taken
by the interaction so here the time
interval is 300 milliseconds when we try
to move a box it will take 300
milliseconds and then only the box will
move so these are some of the few
properties that i think are the most
important to understand you can find
more from the api documentation present
on the official jquery ui website
here's a task for you guys what you have
to do is to add an image in this program
and then see if this works the same or
not
now that we have a good idea of what
interactions are and how we can use them
to make a more interactive web page we
can simply go through this new
interaction in jquery ui without a
problem if you haven't watched the last
two parts wherein we discussed the
draggable and sortable interactions i'll
suggest you to go through them and it
will be easy for you guys to get this
topic
the resizable interaction in jquery
enables any dom element to be resizable
with the help of the cursor we can grab
the right or bottom border of any dom
element and drag it to the desired width
and height
so let's go through this interaction
quickly from the official website and
then we'll see what we can do with this
particular interaction to make our web
page more interactive so here we are on
the official website of jquery here's
the resizable interaction click on it
and it will take us to a new page you
can see we have a box over here which
says resizable what we can do here is we
can grab the box either from the bottom
or from the right side and you can see
we are able to change the height and
width of this particular box
we have the option for certain
customizations that will be going
through after some time
so i hope you guys must have got an idea
by now about this resizable interaction
let's use it in our program here we are
in the vs code the first thing we'll be
doing is we'll be adding an html element
over here let's use an image for now to
get an idea of the syntax so we'll add
an image to a web page for that we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll use
the div tag first so we'll write here
diff now inside this will write img
source is going to be images this is a
folder in my computer
so
right here we'll write j1.png then we
have id so let's say the id for this
image is img1 and then we have to set
the alternate as well so let's say we
are writing here javascript
close this img tag save the program and
you can see we have the image over here
which is quite large in size so let's
style this image as well we'll change
the height and width of this particular
image for that we'll write here inside
the head tag we'll use the style tag
so inside this we have the ids img one
for this particular image so we'll use
it here
then we'll define the height of this
image so let's say the height of this
image is going to be
250 pixels fine
we'll also change the width of this
image so for that we'll write here
width let's say the width is going to be
250 pixels again now we'll write here
border so let's say the border is going
to be 1 pixel
solid
and black in color fine
that's it we are done with this image
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here which is of 250
pixels in size
the next task we have to do is to make
this image resizable
for that we have to use the resizable
interaction only so we'll move to a
javascript file this is a javascript
file now inside here what we'll do is
we'll try to access this particular
image using the id attribute for that
we'll write here dollar
then inside double inverted commas we'll
write the id so we have to write here
img1 then we have to write the
interaction name only so we'll write
here resizable and then we'll use
parentheses because this is a method and
i hope you guys are aware of all these
things by now
save the program and get ready to see
what this resizable interaction can do
with our dom element save it
here if you can see we have something
present in the bottom of this image we
have an icon over here
this is an indication for the user that
this particular image or element is
resizable we can't resize the element
from the left side or from the top
because the interaction is already
programmed in that way
we can grab the element from the right
side if we try to grab it from here and
if we try to resize it you can see we
are able to resize this image
similar thing goes with the bottom part
as well we can resize this image from
here as well
now talking about the options we have in
this interaction we can use animations
with this image to make it look more
engaging to the user so for that we have
to write here inside this resizable
interaction we have to use curly braces
for properties and then we'll write
animate we'll set this property to
true fine
save the program and now you can see
that the animation is taking place on
resizing this image if we try to resize
this image you can see the animation
over here
it is working totally fine other
properties include the containment
option we can limit the area of
expansion of this image we can restrict
it to the parent element or to the
document as well we have discussed this
property in the previous two
interactions as well so this property
remains the same
we'll write here containment
and we'll write here let's say
parent fine
now save the program before that we'll
comment this animate property save it
now
and here you can see we are able to
resize this image but up to a particular
extent we are not able to resize it
outside of the div tag we can resize it
from here as well
and you can see the div tag has its own
area we can't resize this image more
than this
and we can also limit the maximum and
minimum height of this image for that we
have to write here
max height so let's say the max height
is going to be 400 pixels then we'll
write here max width
the max width is going to be 400 pixels
again
we have to write here min height and min
width as well so let's say the main
height is going to be
150 pixels
and the min width is going to be the
same so we'll write here min width
and then we'll write here
150 fine
save the program and you can see we can
now resize the image up to a specific
height and width only if we try to
increase the width you can see we are
able to increase the width up to 500
pixels only and we are not able to
increase the height because of this
containment property we'll comment this
as well save the program and now we'll
be able to resize this image you can see
on resizing it from the bottom we are
able to resize it up to 400 pixels only
same goes with the width as well now if
we try to reduce the size of this image
you can see the minimum size is 150
pixels so this is where the image stops
same thing goes from the bottom end as
well now this is the minimum size of
this particular image according to these
properties the minimum height and the
minimum width is 150 pixels
we can also use the ghost property
instead of showing the actual image
during the resizing we can set the ghost
option to true to show a
semi-transparent part of the element
so let's do it here what we'll do is
we'll write here after this min width
we'll write ghost and we'll set this
property to true save the program and
now on resizing the image you can see if
we increase the size of this image we
have a semi transparent image which
helps us in resizing this image up to an
extent same thing goes with the
reduction of size as well the last
property we have is the aspect ratio of
the image we can either give a preserved
aspect ratio or we can also give the
boolean value
both the values for this option will
work totally fine for example
if we write here after this ghost
property
aspect
ratio and if we set this property to
true
so before saving this we'll commend this
ghost property out save the program and
now if we try to resize the image you
can see the size of the whole image
resizing in a proper manner what else we
can do here is instead of setting this
property to true we can also write here
aspect ratio as
16 by
9. now this is the preserved aspect
ratio save the program and you can see
the image resizing in a different manner
now you can see the aspect ratio of the
whole image is changed
so these are the properties we have in
this interaction that can help us make a
more interactive or engaging website i
hope you guys got this
and with that we come to the end of this
