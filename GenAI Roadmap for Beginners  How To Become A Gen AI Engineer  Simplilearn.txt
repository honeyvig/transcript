hello everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel today I'm excited to
share a comprehensive 8we road map that
will take you from a complete beginner
to someone who is ready to dive into
generative AI if you have ever wondered
how AI creates realistic images music or
text then this road map is perfect for
you so basically generative AI refers to
a branch of artificial intelligence that
can create new content we whether it's
image music text or even video so unlike
traditional AI which focuses on
identifying patterns and making
predictions based on existing data
generative AI uses models like
generative adversarial networks and
variational auto encoders to generate
entirely new content so these models
learn from large data sets and produce
creative outputs that mimic the patterns
Styles and structure they were trained
on so in this video we will break down
the learning process step by step so
that by the end you'll know exactly how
to get started on your AI Journey

box and pin comments so let's get
started all right so in the first two
weeks we'll focus on building a strong
Foundation whether you are starting from
scratch or brushing up on the basics
this phase is all about learning the
essentials that you'll rely on
throughout your AI journey and the first
thing we need to talk about is Python
Programming python is the backbone of
artificial intelligence it's the
language most widely used in AI because
of its Simplicity and Powerful libraries
so if you new to coding python is a
great place to start so in these two
weeks you'll want to get comfortable
with its syntax and structure Python's
readability is what makes it ideal for
beginners so you'll be working with
variables data types and Loops the
building blocks of programming for
example you'll use Loops to repeat tasks
which is super helpful when dealing with
large data sets a common scenario in AI
another key concept is functions think
of them like recipes once you define a
function you can reuse it without
rewriting the same code this keeps your
code clean and efficient next we move on
to the math now I know math can feel
intimidate dating but don't worry AI
doesn't require deep math knowledge for
beginners just the basics to get started
two areas to focus on are linear algebra
and calculus linear algebra is essential
because data in AI is represented as
metrices essentially gits of numbers so
these metries hold the data that we feed
into AI models for example an image is
nothing more than a metric of pixel
values understanding how to manipulate
these matrices like how to multiply them
add them and transform them is cral when
trading models
then there's calculus particularly
derivatives in machine learning
derivatives help us optimize models when
training an AI we want to minimize
errors and derivatives are what guide
the model in the right direction making
it better at predictions or generating
content over time think of derivatives
as the compass that points towards the
best possible solution now with python
and some basic math under your belt it's
time to introduce machine learning so
machine learning is a type of AI that
learns from data improving its
prediction or classifications as it
processes more information so in these
two weeks we'll focus on understanding
key Concepts that form the basis of how
AI learns now let's start by breaking
down the two main types of machine
learning which is supervised and
unsupervised machine learning in
supervised learning the AI is trained
using label data think of it like
teaching a kid to recognize animals you
show it pictures of cats and dogs
labeling each one so it learns to
identify them on its own this method is
common when you already know the outcome
you want now unsupervised learning is a
little different it works with data that
isn't labeled instead the AI tries to
find the pattern on its own like
grouping similar items together a good
example of this is Market segmentation
where AI groups customers with similar
Behavior without being told in advance
what those groups are so in machine
learning we also use algorithms like
linear regression which predicts a
continuous outcome or decision trees
which are like flow charts that splits
data on specific criteria to make
decisions so learning these fundamentals
is crucial because these algorithms are
the Stepping Stones towards more complex
AI systems now as you start diving into
actual machine learning projects you'll
need a deep learning framework to help
you build and train your models so two
of the most popular Frameworks are
tensor flow and P torch so these
Frameworks are powerful tools that
provide pre-built libraries for building
neural networks and other AI models the
idea here is to make it easier for you
to implement complex algorithms without
having to code everything from scratch
so tensorflow is known for its
flexibility and scalability making it
ideal for production level projects
while py toor is often praised for its
Simplicity and ease of debugging making
it great for research and
experimentation now with a basic
understanding of machine learning you
are ready to dive into deep learning
this is where AI really starts to shine
deep learning is a subset of machine
learning and it uses structures called
nudle networks to mimic how the human
brain processes information so at the
heart of deep learning on neural
networks think of these networks as a
series of interconnect Ed layers with
each layer processing data and passing
it on to the next it starts with an
input layer where the data first enters
the network followed by the hidden
layers and finally the output layer
which gives us the prediction or result
so in each hidden layer the network
learns to recognize increasingly complex
patterns the process is similar to how
human brain works when neurons fire in
response to stimuli gradually learning
and refining the understanding the goal
of training a neural network is to
adjust its connections or weights so
that it produces accurate results nud
networks come in different flavors and
depending on the task you'll use
specialized types like CNN which are
convolutional noodle networks so CNN are
designed specifically for analyzing
visual data like images or videos
they're used in tasks like image
recognition where the network learns to
identify features like edges textures
and shapes eventually recognizing entire
objects like cars animals or even phases
CNN works by applying filters to the
image data breaking it down into smaller
more manageable pieces and recognizing
patterns that are critical for tasks
like image classification now on the
other hand ents are used for processing
sequential data such as text or time
series data they have a unique structure
that allows them to remember information
from previous input which is key for
tasks like language translation or
speech recognition in arance the network
retains information from earlier in the
sequence making it ideal for
understanding context over time and now
the final stage of your 8we journey
generate cretive AI this is where AI
becomes creative generating new data
like realistic images videos music or
even text so these last two weeks are
dedicated to understanding and working
with generative AI models so there are
two main types of generative models
you'll want to explore generative
adversarial networks or Gans and
variational Auto encoders or vaes so
let's start with G it consists of two
noodle networks that play a game with
each other one network called the
generator creates fake data like images
the second Network the discriminator
tries to figure out which images are
real and which are fake over time the
generator gets better at producing
realistic images because it's constantly
being trained by the discriminator
feedback Gans are responsible for much
of the groundbreaking work in AI
generated art deep fix and even game
design now Vees on the other hand
compress data into a simpler form and
then try to reconstruct it this process
helps the model learn how to generate
new unique output based on the patterns
it has learned from the data so they are
great for generating variations of data
like new phases or styles of artwork
that doesn't exist but still resemble
the input data both models are
incredibly powerful and open up exciting
possibilities for Creative AI projects
so that's your complete generative AI
