the little knowledge i need you are well
aware of the
structure of the nephron so i'll just
give you a brief idea of the structure
of the nephron
so the nephron has a proximal con
bowman's capsule this is a proximal
convoluted tubule
and a descending and ascending loop of
the loop of henle
and a distal convolated tubule and
a collecting duct okay so this
is a simple or basic structure of the
nephron i think you're very well aware
of
it so these group of drugs that is a
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
act at the level of the proximal
convolated tubule
okay so they act at the level of pct of
the
nephron now let's consider
the lumen of the urine
okay so the lumen and this is a
cell or the cytoplasm of the pct
okay so now we are discussing the
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
which act at the pct so what exactly
happens in the proximal cannulated
tubule
so the sodium and
