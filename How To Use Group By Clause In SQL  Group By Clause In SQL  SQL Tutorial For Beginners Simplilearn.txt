loss in SQL but before we begin let me

Ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to use the group by
clause in SQL now before we execute the
actual code let's take a quick peek on
the syntax that we will be using today
now the syntax is completely similar to
the regular syntax that we usually use
which will have the select keyword
parameters that you want to print in
your table the from keyword and the
table name which you are trying to
access the only difference is you will
have a new keyword that is the group by
keyword and based on a certain parameter
right now we would get back to the
Practical mode that is the MySQL
workmans to understand the practicality
of group by clause in a much better way

now we are on our SQL workbench now
let's get access to our simply on
database there you go now let's quickly
take the look at the tables we have we
have two different tables now let's get
access to our
employee table
now we have all the employee numbers
employee names Department designation
salary Etc right let's say you wanted to
know the average salary of all the
employees right so that would be select
that is the AVG
average function of salary
low set bracket from
employee right
let's execute this
there you go now you have the average
salary of the entire office but what
happens when your manager asks you to
find the average of each and every
Department average salary of the
employees in each and every Department
how would you do that
right every organization has multiple
departments HR development testing etc
etc right now your manager wants the
individual Department's average salary
then you can use this particular clause
which says Group by department so the
entire table will be categorized based
on the Departments and it will be
grouped on the basis of the department
and I'm also using the order by here
which we will discuss in the next
session but to give you a brief
understanding of why we're using order
by let's say your manager asks you to
find the department which has the
highest average salary right then you
will be ordering the tables or ordering
the rows based on the descending order
of the salary now let's quickly execute
this query and see the output there you
go the query got successfully executed
and we have the average salary of each
and every Department choose from over
