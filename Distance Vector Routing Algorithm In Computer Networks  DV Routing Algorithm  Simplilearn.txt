now without further ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's video
in today's session we will look into the
introduction for distance vector routing
continuing with some key points for
routing protocol
moving on to distance vector routing
algorithm
in the end we will look into some
examples to better understand the
routing protocol
now let's move on to the first heading
for this session that is
introduction to distance vector routing
distance vector routing refers to the
distance or the vector that is between
the neighboring nodes
in a network channel
and the routing part refers to the
established route through which data
packets are transmitted in the network
channel
the other aspect of this routing
protocol in a network channel is to
determine the shortest path for a data
packet in the network to reach its
destination
next we will look into some key points
regarding the routing protocol
for routing protocol three primary key
points are to be remembered
first one being
each router in this protocol is designed
to share the vector data of each node
throughout the network
this step is done to maintain proper
circulation of data in the network
channel
the next key point is the routing
pattern in the network protocol
that is the data shared by the routers
is transmitted only to those nodes that
are directly linked to a particular
router
the last key point is
that the routing protocol is designed in
a manner that it shares the updated
vector data periodically
at the network channel
now let's move on to the next heading
that is
the algorithm used in the protocol
the algorithm used in this protocol
is termed as
bellman fold algorithm
this algorithm defines the shortest path
that the data packet can take to reach
its destination node from an initial
node
where
d of x y refers to the least distance
from a node x to node y
moving on we have
c of x comma v
where x is caused from each of its
neighboring v node is taken into
consideration
then we have
d of
v y
this is the distance of each neighbor
from its initial node
and lastly
min of v
this is an abbreviation used to
determine the most shortest vector after
the solution is obtained using the
algorithm
in the next heading that is network
example we will understand all the
points used in the algorithm
now let's design a network model with
five different nodes
that are a b c and d
with each node connected to each other
using different network channel
the numerical values in the network
channel refers to the vector count that
is the distance from node a to node b or
to some other node in the network
channel
in a network model
each node shares its vector data with
its neighboring node at a regular
interval
as there are various updates in the
network model
this data is shared in a form of routing
table where three different columns are
used first being destination column
second
vector column that is the distance node
and lastly the hop
let's take a look at the neighboring
nodes for this model
for node a we have
b and e as it is directly interlinked to
the node a
for node b we have
node a and node c
for node c we have b and d
for d we have
c and e
and lastly for e we have node a and node
d
these nodes represents only the
neighboring nodes
now let's solve an actual example on
routing protocol to clear all our doubts
and understand the key points
the example we will be taking
to solve is
this network model
the initial step to start solving the
network model using the distance vector
routing protocol is to make routing
table for each of the nodes
let's make the routing table for node a
this is the routing table for node a
where we have
destination as a
that means destination is a from node a
that means the distance vector should be
zero
then we have
destination as b
let's take a look
in this given example there is no given
connection between a and b
that means
this distance vector would be infinity
then we have destination as c
similarly as node b there is no direct
connection between a and node c that
means this is also infinity
and same is the case with node d
and in the end we have
node e that is the only directly linked
node
to node a that means the distance given
is 5 so the network
vector is 5.
let's make an another dropping table for
node e
this is the routing table for node
let's take a look
in this routing table the first is
destination to node a
according to the network model given
distance is 5 so the vector value is 5
with the hop to a
then we have
destination as node b
according to the model the distance
vector should be 4
then we have destination as node c
as given there is no direct connection
between node e and node c
that determines the value would be
infinity
then we have
node d which represents
direct connection with node e
and the value is seven
and lastly
e destination from initial point e would
be zero vector
now let's make another routing table
similarly for node c
now using the same steps you can make
the routing table for the remaining
nodes that is node b and node d
now let's move on to the next step in
solving the routing issue
this step is known as update step
in this step we use the vector column
from each of the node to update the
vector column or the routing table for a
particular node
in this part we'll use
node is vector column to update the
routing table for node a
and the steps are using the algorithm
that is the bellman fold algorithm we
used earlier
as we already know
moving from a to destination node a is
always zero so we won't be doing this
step let's move on to the next one that
is moving from node a to node b
that would be
would be a comma e as we are using
vector column of node e
plus
and the distance used to reach e from b
a comma e represents
5
and
e to b represents 4 according to the
network model so the value is
9. similarly let's solve
for a to c
to a to c we have
a comma e plus destination required to
move from e to c
according to the network model we have
node a is only directly linked with node
e
so the value would be 5
but there is no connection between node
e and node c so the value would be
infinity
moving on we have
a to d
in this case we have
a comma e
the value would be
5
plus e to d that is a direct connection
and the value would be 7 so the total
distance is 12
and the last one is
a to e
for this we have a comma e that is
directly the neighboring node
the value would be 5
so the new routing table
for node a is
0 9 infinity 12 and 5.
similarly let's take another node for
this
for the next node we will take node c
and we will update the routing table of
node c
using its neighboring nodes that are
node b
and node d according to the network
model
now
how to do this step
firstly it's
c to destination a
in case of node b we have
c to a that would be
c comma b that is a direct connection
plus distance required from b to a
according to network model we have c
comma b as 6
plus b to a does not have any connection
that is infinity so the value would be
null
then we have node d
in this case we have c comma d that is a
direct connection 3 plus d to a that is
again infinity
as it is not linked directly to node a
moving on we have
destination as b
for node b we have direct connection so
c comma b value is 6
whereas for node d we have
c comma d that is distance 3 plus d to b
that is infinity as it is not directly
linked with the node b
so again the value is null
then we have
destination as c
so connection between c to c is zero
moving on we have destination at node d
that would be c to d
as
c to d
as there is no direct connection between
node b and node d
so the value is infinity
whereas for c to d is a direct
connection for node d so the value would
be 3
now for the last node that is node e
in case of node b we have
c comma b
plus
b to e
where the value for c to b node is 6 and
b to a is 4 so the sum is 10
and now in case of node d we have
3
plus 7 that would be distance from c to
d and then d to e
and the value would be again 10. so we
can use any of the side to reach the
destination node e
by completing all the steps we have the
new table for node c
similarly we can find the routing table
for all the nodes present
now to look into some key points we
learned
for the initial step use only the node
distance of immediate neighbors
nodes without distance that is directly
linked to each other is always infinity
for the update step use the vector table
of the only
neighboring node we have for the initial
node
and lastly to continue the update step
roughly n minus 1 iterations are used
where the value of n is equal to the
number of nodes
for example
the model we took has
five nodes that means we have to do a
loop of four iterations
with this we have reached the end of the
session
