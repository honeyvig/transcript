hey everyone i am rebekah kandalwal and
i welcome you all to simply launch
youtube channel today we will talk about
udt software and its features
but before we begin let me tell you guys
we have our daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for the latest
technological
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
the bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so now without any
further ado let's get started and open
up ud
software here we are in the unity
software so let's create a new project
let's make it a 3d project
and name it
demo
project
and create project
this will take few minutes to boot up
the software
so here is what a unity project would
look like let's explore its ui and tools
and then try to create a simple project
there are many different layouts that
can be used in this unity
so basically this is our
basic
layout let's look at the ui more we have
two tabs at the top that is scene tab
and the game tab
what we are looking at is our scene tab
this will be where we will place
different objects in unity
these are known as game objects we will
be placing them here so we can interact
with them and write scripts for them
next we have game tab
this is where we will be testing and
debugging our game
we can also drag these windows around
so basically we can create
two scene
windows we can also put it like this
we can also put it like this so we can
have scenes and games differently
now
we also have a 2d option in this theta
which is this
so basically we can use this to shift
from 3d to 2d
this will help us in switching between
2d and 3d perspective
now let's look at the hierarchy tab on
the left
this serves as the list view for all the
gamm objects for our project
as you can see we have
default two objects
the main camera
which is this
and the directional light
basically the main camera is where the
game
view is looking at
and the direction light is basically it
provides a slide
you can also notice that some
information comes up in the inspector
window when we are using this
like transform this camera
then we have this audio listener and all
that
we can also add more components through
this
add component button we can add audio
effects event layout mesh missileness
and all sorts of things
but if you are beginner then i would
advise you to kind of follow tutorials
on how to use them according to your
needs because you might even don't know
what these components are doing in your
project and it will make debugging
harder if any error arises
now let's look at the tab on the bottom
first let's check this console tab
this is where we will be getting if any
errors arise during our project we can
also print debug message here using
debug.log
now let's go to our next tab
this is our project tab
now this is where you will be placing
all game files like script materials
textures prefabs and animation
and it will be stored in our computer
you can see that we already have a
folder present in this asset folder
which is scenes folder
where this sample scene is basically the
scene which you are looking up there
unity projects usually have many scenes
like assassin's creed where we have
different scenes for different levels
but
we can still make
a fully functional game with just one
scene
now let's see if fish
how we should be arranging our game
files to make sure everything can be
located easily
when they are required this also helps
us with working in a team on a single
project
so now we will create a few folders to
classify files we are gonna right click
here then go to create and select folder
let's name it scripts
let's make few more folders
create
material
make sure to always capitalize the first
letter
texture
prefabs
animation
and
sounds
now
this is up to you what you want to name
them because you are the one working on
it
you might want to create more folders
according to your need but for now it's
enough
now that we have enough info on the ui
let's add some objects
and write a script on it
to add an object we can either right
click on hierarchy
and
go for these buttons
or we can use game object and create
these
now let's add a 3d object like a plane
to our scene
so we will go to here and 3d object and
clean
note that we have some options on the
left to interact with our objects
we have this view tool
which can be used to view the whole
scene
then we have move tool
this can be used to move the scene to up
left
and distraction
note that when we move this
plane
this inspect
value is also changing
we can change this position
like here
or
we can
right click here and reset it this will
basically make it to zero zero zero zero
position
you can see in our game window
where our clean is
then we also have a rotate button which
can help us in rotating these
then we have
scale option which can help us in
increasing its size
we also have
the right size
which can help
in maintaining its shape and still
increasing it
and
then we have
this master control
which is called transform tool
which can be used to do all of those
options above
one thing we must keep track of is where
our object is so if you see this inspect
screen it shows the position of our
objects
we need to make sure that our object
will come back to 0 0 location like how
i did with the reset button this will
help us in putting our objects to the
right place later on
now let's try to run it
we can play this
play button
this will load up all the scripts and
then we will go to our game view
we can close it
since it is not doing anything right now
we have to make sure to set the
resolution according to the platform for
which you are making the game
so
you can use it this way
free aspect or area
let's choose it full hd
which is basically a
laptop's view
we can also scale it
but this will not
change
the resolution of the game
what we will be seeing is this 1x
version of it
now let's stop this
to show more ui elements and some script
we will give this plane some material
and color
then we will create a button and write a
script that will enable or disable our
renderer
so now let's start
by creating a material
since we already have a materials folder
so we will just go inside this
we can right click
and create
the material
let's name this material as
green
material
do make a habit of naming everything
with
capitalized first letter
right now it is only white so we will
change we change color from here
green and go to this color
and we can cross it
so now this is green color
to apply this color to this we will just
drag it here
now
let's save this project make a habit of
saving this project otherwise you might
lose some data due to some kind of error
or power shortage or any kind of problem
which can arise
let's run it
as you can see the color for this plane
has changed
let's close it
let's go to the plane
and see what are the components
for this plane
for the components we have transform
which basically locate its location then
we have a plane
mesh filter and then we have mesh render
note that the screen material is now
showing in the mesh renderer
we need to remember it as mesh render
because it will be used during the
scripting
so now we will right click here and go
to ui to add some ui
components we have in legacy we also
have text button and drop down input
field
do remember when working with ui it's
better to do it under a user interface
canvas
so we will first add canvas so we will
go to ui
and add a canvas
if you double click on the canvas then
you can see a white outline floating in
the scene
now it won't matter where it is because
if you look here in this render mode it
is showing a screen space overlay
so
whether regardless of where it is on our
scene the user will see it over their
screen it will be a transparent sheet so
we will see when we
go and compile this
so now in order to interact with our
campus we need a button
so we will right click on the canvas and
go over
ui
then legacy then we will add a button
let's
resize this
button
to see it better
we can also
change the name for this
we will write it as enable
we should make a habit
of naming these buttons so enable
button
we should also rename it
as
green plant
now
let's try and run this
as we can see we are getting a button
here but when we click it it's not doing
anything because we have not write any
script for it
let's close it
and let's increase its size some more so
that we can see it clearly
okay
okay now it's
now it can be seen clearly
now let's go back to our plane
now to write a script for it we will go
back
to our asset folder and go to the
scripts folder
now naming is important we need to give
it a descriptive name to understand the
working of the script
so i will name it
as
enable
plane
script
always capitalize the first letter of
every word
just make it a habit it will help
others to understand what each script is
now
this script in and of itself won't work
unless we assign it to some object
so now let's drag it to a hierarchy tab
and put it on green plane object
so we will drag it
when it's highlighted
we'll put it
so now if you click on the green plan
we have something called script tab here
now we will double click on it to open
the script
this will open an ide installed in your
computer
since i had visual studio so it opened
visual studio
let's start with this void start method
which is built into this mono behavior
and you can see that we are
automatically creating a public class
enable plane script which is the name of
our script
and it is inherited from mono behavior
so it will inherit these op
functions as well
for now we can delete these methods and
make our own
so we will be deleting these
now we need our own variables to access
some objects from the
project
so we will need a variable to access a
plane object first so we will create a
public
game object
plane
then we will also declare a private mesh
renderer so private
mesh
render
and we will name it
my
renderer
let's save it
then
we will attach it
to our unity demo project
and since we didn't got any error so
that means it must be working perfectly
so we'll stop debugging
repeat
now
let's run it again
now it will still not work because we
haven't done anything yet
we have only created some variables
so let's suppose this now if you go to
this green plane
what you will see here in the script we
have now a plane
which will be asking us for a game
object
so now we will drag this plane
here
this will make it understand that this
the plane which this script is asking
for is green plane
since we made this
mesh render private so we are not seeing
it here
if we make it public then we can we will
be getting another option as mesh
renderer here for the map
for that
so now let's write a function to enable
or disable the plane
so let's go back to our visual studio
and write private
void we will not be returning anything
and let's name it on click
enable
please
we will have
my renderer
equals
to plane
dot
get
component
and here we will have
mesh renderer
then
we will write a statement
enable
my renderer
dot
enabled
equals to not
my renderer
dot enabled
so this will just flip the state which
the
function will be at
now let's save it
now to make it understand what i'm
talking about about here
let's go back to unity
here
let's select the screen plan
if you see this check box when i click
it
the plane goes away when i click it back
it is here so basically what we are
writing a code is to simply this check
and uncheck button
so now let's try it since we have
already done everything
but still not working
now it might be because we didn't write
that start function which
we had
so let's add that one as well
so private
void
start
now let's use what we had talked to you
about earlier about
debug messages
so let's write a debug message for debug
dot
log
let's write
welcome
to
simply
learns
c-sharp
unity
tutorial
now let's save this part
and go to our
main function
close it
and then run it again
but still not working
now another possibility is that we
haven't attached the script to the
button yet
which we didn't
so let's do that
now we will click on this button
and here we will find something called
on click
here we will add this button so now we
have a slot to add an object
now this should be an object which has a
script attached to it
it should be that script which has the
function
which we want this button to do
so since we have green plane has an
script so we will
drag it and put it here
now we have an option to select
different types of objects so we will go
to our enable plan script let's find our
onclick enable plan
function
but as you can see we don't have it here
what might be the reason
let's go and check the script
now here if you look closely we have
made this on click enable plan
method as private
need it public for it to show here
so let's change it
let's save it
and go back
now
let's see if enable plane has and here
you can see we have on click enable plan
here
now let's add it here let's save here as
well
now let's run it
now
let's click on enable button
as you can see now enable button is
working
flawlessly now let's try and build it so
we can go to file
and go to build and build settings
now here we have different kind of
objects
to choose for which function we want our
software to work
we can go for android and all that
but let's add scene before
we choose to do any of that because
without a seat it doesn't matter which
software you want to do it
now let's do a build and run
let's create a folder and write it as
demo
select demo and select folder
now we have to wait a minute or so for
it to compile since it's a small game so
it should not take a lot of time
here now as you can see made with unity
and here we have our software so if you
click enable disable it is working
perfectly
