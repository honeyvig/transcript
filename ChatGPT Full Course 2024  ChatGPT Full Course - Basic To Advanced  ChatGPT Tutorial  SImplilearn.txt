artificial intelligence and machine
learning program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest without
further Ado let's get started meet John
a talented programmer who is looking to
start a company that used his personally
developed mobile application to connect
restaurants and customers from for
booking and reservations even though the
app was ready Jon had difficulty getting
together a team for his startup meeting
separate people for sales marketing
programming content creation and
customer support hiring reliable
Manpower while being strict with his
budget was getting difficult he reached
out to his friend Ryan who said Jon
could start his company without hiring
any new people thanks to just a single
AI based tool J couldn't believe it
which led Ryan to introduced chat GPT
the Revolutionary AI chatbot being
developed by open AI it is a
state-of-the-art natural language
processing or NLP model that uses a
neural network architecture to provide
responses this means that the chat GPT
bot can answer questions without being
explicitly told what the answer is using
its own intellect unlike previous AI
chat bots so how does chat GPT help JN
in filling out his
team regarding sales chat GPT can
provide full-fledged sales pitches based
on the correct prompts it can provide
tips on how to pitch your product
businesses removing the need for sales
training completely customized to your
requirements and your prompts if you
don't like some things about the
response you can ask for certain changes
and the chatbot will make sure they are
done when it comes to marketing chat GPT
can provide efficient marketing
strategies which can help new
entrepreneurs learn how to Market their
products to prospective clients it can
provide trending keywords that marketers
can use for SEO purposes while providing
ad copies for your website and block
speaking of websites since JN can do a
lot of the heavy lifting and programming
chat GPT can help proofread the code and
help out when looking for bugs to fix
apart from basic bug fixing he can also
provide sample code structures for
different programming languages allowing
John to focus more on improving core
functionality and workflow rather than
fixing basic code errors
websites and blogs content is very
helpful in gathering potential customer
leads the Revolutionary bot can provide
fulllength blog posts with near perfect
fast accuracy in seconds allowing
further customization like choosing the
length of the subject matter to the
complexity of language for John's
customer support the bot can draft
complete customer service emails based
on the situation saving time and
resources the tone of the message can be
changed to reflect the nature of the
message creating an efficient
alternative for call centered
professionals Jan was left speechless
seeing this level of Versatility from
chat GPT and wanted to implement it
right away however Ryan made sure John
knew about some drawbacks of the chat
bot before getting started since the bot
is trained mostly on data up to 2021
many of the newer events May still need
to be discovered by chat GPT even basic
stuff like asking about the current date
and time is beyond it scope much like
the limited understanding of context
despite providing near lifelike
solutions to certain problems even the
accuracy of many responses can be
questioned since the AI model is still
learning and being developed there is a
section of the public that believes the
Revolutionary tool can one day replace
Google search but that day seems
far-fetched so far because of the
variety of issues people keep running
into in using chat
GPT however chat GPT poses a lot of
promise for the future of AI from Full
skilled automated divisions and
organizations to serving as the perfect
digital assistant open AI is creating a
bot for the future aimed at solving the
problems of today with the tools of
Tomorrow the ability to carry out a
myriad of tasks with minimum Manpower
will boost productivity at organizations
in every sector thanks to the
Revolutionary chat
GPT so how do you think chat GPT will
benefit your daily life are you looking
forward to using the bot regularly for
work or personal life let us know your
thoughts in the comments below meet John
a software developer JN develops a
program and now he realizes the program
is surrounded by a lot of
bugs Jon starts exploring a solution he
surfs through the internet checks
programmer communities doubting every
step of the way JN feels his problem is
not
solved desperate to find the solution
John meets his friend Adam Adam comes
comes up with an idea of an artificially
intelligent and practical solution
called the chat
GPT Adam says chat GPT has the caliber
to systematically resolve all the bugs
with an elaborate explanation for every
step it makes chat GPT is an AI trained
model that works in a conversational way
developed by open AI fascinated by
hearing this John asks Adam to explain
him in detail after Adam explains that
GPT AKA generative retraining
Transformer has come a long way before
the introduction of GPT natural language
processing used to deal with a specific
task with large amounts of data GPT was
first released in 2018 which contained
117 million parameters GPT gpt2 and GPT
3 each one is stronger than the one
before it the main reason why GP
received little attention was that it
was more of an idea or test than a
finished product but after the
introduction of gpt2 it gained a lot of
attention as it could accurately predict
the word that would begin a text then
they introduced
gpt3 which is a strong language model
achieving translation question answering
and Performing three-digit
arithmetic but chat GPT Stands Tall
compared to all other achievements of
open AI so how does it work chat GPT
uses deep learning techniques to
generate humanik text it is based on the
machine learning model derived from the
class called the large language model
chat GPT is a byproduct of instruct GPT
instruct GPT introduced a strategy for
integrating human feedback into the
training process to match model outputs
this Innovative technology made chat GPT
exceptional it is trained on the massive
data sets of text from the internet and
learns from the patterns in relation
ships between words and phrases it
responds to a prompt by determining the
next word based on the context then
repeats the process until a stop
condition is met as a result chat GPT
can produce various logical responses to
various queries and prompts the most
important components of chat GPT are the
Transformer model and language model
coming to the Transformer model it is a
neural network architecture designed to
process sequential data it consists of
multiple layers of self attention and a
feed forward Network after the
Transformer model has processed the
input a decoder generates the output the
decoder uses the context provided by the
encoder to generate the response the
model is trained using unsupervised
learning and fine-tuned on specific
tasks using supervised learning for
successful completion of tasks it needs
pre-trained data the model first encodes
the input text then converts it to a
numerical representation which can be
processed by the model's neural network
this encoding is done using the embedded
layer that Maps the word then comes the
language model chat GPT is trained as a
language model trained to predict the
next word in a sequence given the
previous words the language model
intends to produce rational consistent
and meaningful output the pre-trained
chat GPT can be tuned for a specific
task so chat G PT passes a fine-tuning
test by answering questions generating
text summaries or generating text in
response to a query overall chat GPT is
a powerful language model with a
combination of techniques like deep
learning machine learning neural
networks and natural language
processing can chat GPT change a wide
variety of business tasks John asked
chat GPT possesses the ability to
automate content creation on social
media create chatbot and Ecom sites
provide medical assistance by acting as
a symptom checker write code and assist
a developer thus chat GPT can change the
working of every industry now John can
resolve any coding issue without looking
into any other
resources but like any other technology
chat GPT comes with a few limitations
that can be its Achilles heal chat GPT
is capable of developing content up to
2021 it finds difficulty in providing l
iCal reasoning in certain situations and
also chat GPT lags in Translation
summarization and sometimes question
answering but above all chat GPT has
shown remarkable ability by providing
accurate answers flawlessly in a
creative way in very short periods of
time whether you're a tech Enthusiast a
expert or just curious about the new and
exciting development you won't want to
miss this discussion about the latest
air sensation I'm talking about Chad gbt
a highly Advanced language model based
on gpt3 technology developed by open AI
Chad GPT is a state of art language
generation AI model that has captured
the attention of millions of people
around the world it has been trained on
a massive data set of text Data making
it one of the most largest language
models to date but do you know a new
version of GPT is coming up it's called
GPT 4 and it will support up to 1
trillion parameters compared to 175
billion parameters of gpt3 now you might
be wondering what are these parameters
so what it means when a user sends a
query to the New Year version of chat
gbt then it will process that query with
all 1 trillion parameters to deliver a
correct and suitable response isn't it
mind-blowing not only that gp4 will have
more applications than its predecessor
gpt3 the gpt3 has various applications
like text generation text summarization
automated content generation application
and is also been used by various
companies like viable feable studio and
algolia aside from its remarkable
language handling ability gp4 has the
possibility of being utilized for
additional functions such as generating
images and videos this is due to the
fact gbd4 is constructed using the
Transformer architecture which has
demonstrated Effectiveness in multiple
machine learning assignments including
computer vision psychologist and
cognitive scientist Gary marker said
that he can guarantee that gp4 will blow
the minds He also mentioned that gp4
will totally Eclipse Chad GPT as it has
more parameters and is being trained
with more data however the CEO Sam Alman
debunks false information surrounding
the company's upcoming chat gp4 Alman
said that he did not have an actual AGI
that is an artificial general
intelligence that could drial humans in
learning and existence the release of
Chad GPT and other AI powered Chad
boards had had a major impact on Google
search business with the New York Times
reporting that it prompted Google's
management to declare State emergency
referred to as Cod dread GPD 4 with its
improved complexity and quicker response
time has the potential to enhance
communication by making it more natural
and accurate for instance short sentence
responses from a chatboard can reduce
the likelihood of people clicking on ads
this AI technology could bring about a
major transformation in the economy
Google employees have been assigned the
task of developing AI products with gp4
that can match the capability of gpt3
such as its capability of generating art
music and other visuals that open AI is
currently capable of Microsoft has
invested $3 billion into the open Ai and
is reportedly in discussion to invest an
additional 10 billion as reported by the
New York Times the paper also stated
that the release of gp4 is expected to
take place in the first quarter of 2023
Matt mlan a venture capitalist with
knowledge of gbd4 hinted that the new
system May possesses multimodal
capabilities which refers to the
capability of functioning in various
modes such as text images and sounds the
gp4 chatboard built using Microsoft
extensive data center network has the
potential to be similar to chat gbd
generating only text or it could be
incorporate both text and images however
Sam Alman has caution not to set
expectations too high so at this point
it is difficult to say with certainty
what gp4 will look like and what it will
be capable of so what do you think about
Chad gb4 do let us know in the comment
section below so we'll start with the
first first STP that is change your
dashboard appearance so for that we'll
move to chat jbd and you could change
the desktop appearance or dashboard
appearance of chat J you can customize
your dashboard by going to settings and
choosing a new theme or layout so for
settings you will go here and in general
you can just select the theme that is
light you can change it to dark system
theme or light theme so these are the
options you can use to change your
dashboard appearance so this can help
you create a more comfortable and
personalized working environment for
example you can change the color scheme
and you can also change the font size
also and you can generally change the
phone size by just zooming in the window
and the second tip we have is switch on
beta features so we move back to chat
jpt and here you can see the beta
features so so for that we'll go in
settings and beta that is custom
instructions try a new feature that lets
you share anything you would like chat
JP to consider across it respons so we
have switch on these beta features the
plugins prior version of chat jpd that
knows when and how to use third party
plugins that you enable the code
interoperator that is a version of
Charity that knows how to write and
execute python code and can work with
file uploads try asking for help with
data analysis image conversions on
editing a code file and these files not
persist Beyond a single session so these
are the plugins or the beta features
that we have turned on and we are using
them and in chat gb4 gb4 you could see
that is code interpreter beta and the
plugins beta they both are available for
us so this was the second tip that is
switch on the beta features and you can
use them that is you can toggle on beta
features to try out new and experiment
Al features if you like trying out new
features you can switch on beta features
they are experimental features that are
still being tested keep in mind that
they might not always work perfectly and
the next is change the tone of your
writing that is you can ask Chad j can
you rewrite any sentence in a more
formal way so now we will ask a prompt
to CH jbt that is can you rewrite this
in a more formal tone and what we can
ask is that could be hey how are you
okay so we'll ask this so you could see
that the chat JD has changed the tone of
the sentence or the imperative you were
asking that is hey how are you now
greetings how do you find yourself today
so this is a more formal tone and you
can ask CH J for more search responses
that is give me more such
responses so you can change the the tone
of the sentence that is you could give
any sentence or any imperative or any
language to chat GP and you can ask for
any tone that could be emotional that
could be funny tone or that could be
sarcastic tone so Chad JP would reply
with the particular tone so this was our
third tip and now moving on we'll see
the fourth tip that is use chat jpt for
quick learning so you can ask can you
explain the basics of anything that
could be the simple biology Concepts the
solar system and you can use chat JP for
quick learning that is for instance you
could ask any prompt that is here we
will ask
J
that teach me how to write hello world
in
Python so you can see that Jud responded
that is showed writing a hello world
program in Python is quite
straightforward due to python Simplicity
and here's how you can do it that is
print hello world and in this code it
has given you some sentences so you can
just read them and understand how the
code works that is print is a built-in
python function that outputs specified
information to the screen then the text
that is hello world that is an inverted
commas is a string which is a type of
data representing text then the
parenthesis that are used to en close
the arguments of the function so when
you run this program it will give the
output of the text that is hello world
to the console so this was our fourth
tip and moving on now we have our fifth
tip that is view the plug-in store so
now chat jpd has many plugins that is we
will create a new chat and in gb4 you
could just click on plugins So currently
no plugins are enabled and this is the
plug PL store so the developers are
developing plugins so you could use them
and be more productive and add more
features to the chat GPD so you could
see that is AI PDF that is super fast
interactive chats with PDFs of any site
complete with page references for fact
checking ask your PDF chat with PDF
Expedia notable link reader so these are
the plugins that you could use and this
comes with the GPT four version that is
the paid version so you could enable any
plugin and you can write any prompt and
the chat JP will respond to it now
moving on to the next step that is tip
six use the web browsing feature so with
gp4 and with the beta versions you get a
feature to search with Bing or to browse
with Bing that is not available for my
account or for my area so this is the
new tip you can use it if you have the
paid version and if you are accessible
for the beta version of browsing with
Bing so this was our next tip and moving
on we'll see our seventh tip that is
template ize useful prompts so you can
ask can you create a 10 minute full body
workout using some kind of dumbbells or
a barble road and save this prompt for
future use you can also template useful
prompts for instance you can also ask
can you create a menu or to-do list and
save this prompt for future use so we'll
see a quick example that would be create
a 10 minute full body workout and that
would be using so you could see that the
chat J has given us a templatized
routine so there's a quick high
intensity bubble workout that you can
complete in about 10 minutes that is
bubble deadlifts and bubble squats
bubble overhead press bubble Rose bubble
bench press so for that you also need to
have bench press also and the not is
remember the key to this workout is
intensity and form not necessarily the
weight used okay so this is how you can
templa useful
prompts and moving on the next step we
have is summarized text that is you can
paste a long article and ask chat JP to
convert it or summarize in few sentences
for example you can paste a long AR
article so I'll show you how we can do
that we will just search for simply
learn
articles so we'll use any article we
just copy it and give this to chat jpd
that is we paste
it and ask it can you
summarize this
article five
sentences so you know that this prompt
we just summarize the whole article in
five sentences and this is the feature
of chat jpt to summarize anything and in
a very concise manner and this was our T
eight and moving on
the next step we have is analyze your
writing pattern that is can you you can
ask J can you analyze my writing style
and generate a paragraph me making it
that is you can give it any text or chat
that you have done you can just copy
that chat and give that as a promp to
chat GPD and you can then write a prompt
that can you analyze my writing style
and generate a paragraph by making it on
any topic so the chat J Will analyze
your writing pattern and will mimic your
style and you can also ask it to act as
a famous person like you can ask CH jity
to act like alen musk and give your
thoughts on
AI so here we will ask CH jity that is
act as Alan musk and give your thoughts
on a
so you could see that it has stated that
artificial intelligence holds immense
potential for human advancement it's
essentially digital super intelligent
and can go beyond a human intelligence
but it is not saying that it can
perfectly act as alen musk or it can
directly speak to alen musk but it can
provide a perspective based on his
public statements on the topic of
artificial intelligence so the chat has
analyzed all its statements that are
present that is gp4 has some browsing
features so it has analyzed all the
statements and on behalf of that it has
given us the result and now moving on to
the next tip that is act as an examiner
so you can ask can you check this essay
for grammatical errors you can ask it to
check your project or even grade your
homework so as we have copy pasted the
article you can copy paste your if you
want to check your code or debug your
code you you can just give it to Chad
jpt and it will give you the suggestions
or it will point out some errors and can
give you a perfect code or you can just
ask him to get some grammatical errors
in your article or essay so this was the
10th tip that is act as an examiner and
now the next is format your outputs so
you can give any data to chat jpt and
ask him to format this into table tables
and you can ask him to add some columns
to the tables that would be Monday
Tuesday Wednesday and you can ask him to
prepare a to-do list or something like
that so you can format your outputs J J
will respond to that so for that we'll
just give it a prompt to chat jpt that
is format the days of week in a table
and days put days in column so let's see
uh so you could see that it has given us
and it has given all the days in one
column so you have to correct your
prompts and rewrite your prompts and see
what chat jpt is responding with those
prompts so you have to be concise and be
conscious and just regenerate your proms
so so now moving on to our next tip that
is tip number 12 that is generate Todo
list you can say I need to do grocery
shopping finish a report and call my
friend today and can you create a Todo
list for me so chat jpd can create to-do
list just tell it what task you need to
complete and it will create a to-do list
for you you can just you just have to
give it a prompt and the next tip we
have is explain it to a child so this is
you can ask can you explain how a rocket
works to a 5-year-old you can ask jity
to explain complex Concepts in simple
terms just say explain it to a child
followed by the concept so for example
you can also ask that can you explain
quantum physics to a child so we will
just try this prompt that is explain
quantum
physics to a child so this will give
you so you could see that the Chad JP
has given the answer that is absolutely
there's a very simple way to explain
quantum physics to a child and it has
given a Lego books example you can build
a castle a spaceship or whole city so
this is how you can use this
prompt that was the tip number 13 that
is explain it to a child then the next
tip we have is share your chat thread
links so after having a productive
conversation with chj you can share this
conversation by clicking on the share
share button and sending the generator
link to your colleagues this is a great
way to collaborate with others for
instance if you're working on a project
with a team you can share the link to
your chat thread so everyone can see the
conversation and contribute so I will
show you how you can do it that is this
is the share button share a chat and you
can just copy the link and send it to
anyone and you can collaborate with them
and now moving on to our next tip that
is tip number 15 that is export data to
mail if you want to export a chat you
can click on the export button and enter
your email address you will receive a
copy of the chat in your inbox this
useful feature is used if you want to
save a record of your conversation or if
you need to share the information with
someone who doesn't have access to chat
jity so I'll show you how you can do it
so simply you have to go here click on
settings and go to data controls and
here is your option that is export data
so just click on export confirm export
and the successfully exported data you
should receive an email shortly with
your data and now moving on we will see
another tip that is organize your chat
history so you can organize your chat
history that is you can edit it and you
can name anything that is tips for chat
jpd so this is how you can organize your
chat history and now moving on now we'll
see the next tip that is go minimalist
so what do you understand by minimalist
is you can just close this side bar so
this is the minimalist options here you
can just use the chat jpt here so in
settings you can choose a minimalist
theme which will remove any unnecessary
elements from your dashboard leaving
only with the essentials and if you
prefer cleaner Loop you can go
minimalist and this removes any
unnecessary elements and you can delete
all your history that is in settings you
can find the delete all history ptn
clicking this will erase all your
previous chats and for privacy reasons
you might want to delete your chat
history you can do this by going to a
settings and selecting delete all
history so this was our tip number 18
that is delete all your history so we'll
just go to settings data controls and
here we have chat is history and
training that is turned on if you will
turn off it will just turn off and it
will also act as an incognito mode and
here you can clear all the chats this
will delete all the history and the next
tip we have is describe images and the
next is summarize YouTube videos so this
is available with beta features of Bing
that is you can just write describe
image and paste any image link here so
the chat jpt will describe the image for
you and if you want to like know about
any YouTube video so you can just write
describe YouTube video and then paste
the link and it will describe the
YouTube video for you and that is
available with the beta feature of
browsing with Bing and if that is
available with you and currently that is
not available with me you can like if
you if the feature is avilable with you
that is the beta feature you would able
to see here that was the beta feature
and you can also go into settings and
beta and check out if the feature is
available for you or not now we'll start
with a chat jbt to automate our Excel
and we have some Excel files I will
upload them in the link with the GitHub
so you can freely download them and you
can also try this project with those
files and here we are with the chat jpd
so now we are on the chat JP website and
here you can see that there's a try chat
jpd option and when we click it we will
be redirecting to the chat jpt the chat
box and before that I will show you the
homepage it's showing us the samples
what we can do with the chat
jpt the methods
and there's the collect demonstration
data and train a supervised policy like
how it's trained how open a has trained
the chat gbt and its
limitations they have mentioned all the
things here iterative
deployment and moving on now we will log
in to our chat
jbd I will log in with my Google account
tell us about you and this is my name
and he's
asking my phone
number so I will get this blood so you
guys won't be seeing my phone number
okay
is asking for the code I'm waiting for
the code after entering the OTP you
would be directed to this page that is
chat GPT and this is the Field Box where
you can write any query in the simple
natural language that would be English
and the chat jbt would answer your
questions and if we talk about chat J uh
little bit information about chj that
it's an AI powered chatboard that has
been developed by open Ai and the
chatboard understands natural language
and responds in a humanlike manner it is
based on GPT 3.5 which is a language
model and the chatboard was unveiled as
a prototype on November 30 2022 while
announcing the chatboard open a wrote on
its announcement page that we have
trained a model called chat jpt which
interacts in a conversational way the
dialogue format makes it possible for
chat GPD to answer followup questions
admit its mistake challenge incorrect
premises and reject inappropriate
requests so now we will talk about the
Chad j so Chad j is an AI powered
chatboard that has been developed by the
artificial intelligence and it's been
researched by the company open a and the
chatboard understands natural language
and responds in a human-like manner it
is is based on GPT 3.5 which is a
language model the chatbot was unveiled
as a prototype on November 30 2022 while
announcing the chatbot openi wrote on
its announcement page that we have
trained a model called Chad jpt which
interacts in a conversational way the
dialogue format makes it possible for
chat gbt to answer followup questions
admit its mistake challenge incorrect
premises and reject inappropriate
requests so this this is
JJ and it's been Bo all the developers
around the globe so now we'll start with
automating Excel with the help of chat
jpt and with the help of Python
language so
first we will create a folder and see
the Excel files with which we will use
Python and with the help of chat
jpt we will automate them
so first we'll create a folder for our
project and we'll create in Python
projects and name it
as automate Excel using Chad
jpt and inside this we will open the
command
prompt and now will open any ideally so
that we'll write a request to chat GPT
and he'll answer us with the suitable
code and that code we will copy paste
into our idle and run it if it gives any
error we will copy paste the error same
to the chat jpt and as I know he answers
that so here we will open our ideally
and for that we are writing a command
that is code space period and that will
open R ideally that is Visual Studio
Bo now we have open our ID and first
we'll create a file
here or first we'll see our Excel files
on which we will do the
Automation and and for that we'll get
back to our
folder and here we have the number
folder in which we have two files that
is CSV files phone number and phone
number
two and other we have the sales folder
and in that we have the date of the
sales of the year
20122 so we'll use these files sales and
the number so we'll cut them
and get to a
folder and inside the number file no uh
we'll start with
sales first we'll do the automation with
the sales
files so we'll open the sales folder and
inside that we'll create a file that
would be the py
file and the first automation we would
would be doing is concatenating all the
files in a single Excel file we have the
files from January to December that is
the sales files so we'll concatenate
them and ask the chat jpt to write the
code con sorry to concatenate all
these so for
that we'll name the file as conate
only Nate
_ data
py so now we'll give the command to the
chat
jpd so here is a chat jpd and here we
will write a command for it that would
be I have 12 Excel
files and I want to concatenate
them and we'll also mention the name
name
named
January spelling of January is this only
but we'll check with the file
January and then we have
February and moving
on so on we have till
December so we have all these 12 files
and now we'll command him to use
Python to concatenate the data inside
the 12xl files into one
file so this is a command
and it's in the simplest natural
language that is the English language so
we'll just press enter okay it shows us
that an error occurred if that show so
for this thing we'll just copy the open
a link and paste it here and open it as
the chat jpt is seeing a huge
traffic sometimes it
shows these errors
so he's verifying us whether we are a
robot or not so we will agree with the
chat
J and answer it questions
here it's asking again okay now we are
clear with the chity and will paste our
Command here and press
enter and here you can see that it has
started answering our question that you
can use the Panda's library in Python to
rename the data from each of the Excel
files and use the concat function to
combine the data from all the FES into
one data frame here's an example of how
you want
okay he going in a very right
Manner and he has imported pandas and
then create a data and using the for
Loop
he is going through all the months
reading the Excel file and appending
okay
done and result he has concatenated but
he has not created the Excel file where
we can see all the data and he has also
not printed it so what we want so first
we'll
see what does this code do as I have
seen so it will concatenate but it has
not created the Excel file in which we
can see all the data so we have copied
the code we'll paste it
here save it and run
it and most important thing you have to
import the Panda's library and if you
have not installed it please install it
in the command prompt with the command
pip install pandas or you can use it in
the terminal
okay it has not found the january.
XLS okay JN u a are
by sping we'll
see what error it expects
we'll save this and run once
again so we'll just copy the error and
write it back to chat jpt and
see how does it
respond okay is seeing is indicating
that the Pand library is unable to find
the Excel file you trying to read in
based on the error message look like the
files are not located in the same
directory as the python
script okay we'll see that but we have
the python script and the
library in the
same
folder
yeah concate to evi and we'll check once
again here let go data
P they are in the same folder and why we
have this
error okay
so so there is we have opened our
ID
in automated Excel using Chad jpd folder
and currently we are in sales folder so
it is not
recognizing the
directory so what we'll
do we'll copy all these
files copy the sales
files and paste it
here
now now we'll run the quote that chat
chpt provided us
okay uh yeah it has run
successfully exed successfully okay
we'll try once again we kill the
terminal save it and run it
again now we'll see yeah it has executed
successfully uh but the thing is it has
not converted it
into a single Excel file for that we
will write
right you forgot to
create the
concatenated file as we also haven't
mentioned in our
Command
specifically so we have to be specific
with the commands
Also let's see
yeah after conting the data frame to
export to a Excel file we can just write
this
command and index equal to false here
okay and he's giving all the
explanations so you can just read them
correct I apologize for the site to
create a new Excel file at contain data
you can use the 2core XEL method of the
data frame here is an example of how you
could do this okay cre a new Excel file
named concore data. xlsx in the same
directory as your python script and it
will contain the concatenated data form
from all of the original Excel file you
could also use a 2core CSU method to
save the data frame in CSV format yeah
we can do that
also okay
we make the xlsx file
and just beneath
it
yeah C
part
okay uh we don't need any path we'll
just do it here
only yeah result to
XEL data
xlsx so we'll save this and run
it and is showing that it has executed
successfully and yeah outside the sales
folder we'll close it you can see that
it has created the con atore data
xlsx so for that we move here yeah it
has created it
here we'll open
it and first I will show you what these
files
contain so every file have the entry of
around, every file has
th000
entries so so the ConEd file should have
around
12,000 so this is the concore
data and if we go
beneath yeah we can
see
2000 and it's yeah it says it has G ated
all the data so yeah chat GPT responded
and we have to precise with the commands
what we are writing in English as it has
not mentioned to convert it into Excel
file now when we have written it again
it has done that now moving on we will
do the second
Automation and for that we'll move back
to our ideally and the next automation
we would be doing would be that we will
be using the sum and the average
function to all the files that is from
January to December files and
we'll use sum and average function I'll
show you where will
use so it's
data so we'll open the August
file and here you can see the quantity
in the edge
column so we'll average down the
quantity so what is the average per
customer
and in the J column we have the total
cost so we'll add all the cost in all
the files this is the August file from
January to December we will do in column
H the average for the quantities and
column J we'll do the sum of the total
amount per customer and we'll get it
printed at the last column that would be
we have the th000
entries it's going
till
h11 so we would get it printed on
h12 and the sum we would get it printed
on
J12 okay so moving on we'll close these
files we will get back to a chat jpd and
give him a command that I have 12 Excel
files and we'll tell him that we have
named
them
January then we
have
February
then we have till
December and
now we want you to use
Python
to
apply the Su
formula the sum formula and the average
formula so the sum formula would be
applied from J2 to j101
let's see okay we have Clos file yeah
what I remember some formula
from J2 2 J 1 0 1 okay and the average
function and now we want him to use the
average
formula from H2 to h11
okay and that would be in all the Excel
files and we want him to write the
results in the cells and that would be
J12 and
h12
effectively so we have to be precise
with the commands and we have an error
here uh that is done and yeah it's all
done I'll just give this command to chat
jpt and see how it answers use the p in
Python to read okay and perform the sum
and average calculations good and then
write the results back to the same file
here is an example of how you could do
this yeah we writing in the same file
okay we are importing par PD and running
a loop for all the months we have read
all the Excel files one by one and we
are taking the
cell one and I location and doing the
sum and doing the mean of the edge colum
yeah it's
good Excel
yeah I think it would do our
job so we'll copy this and create a new
file and name it
as some
dopy and inside this we will paste the
code that our GPT has provided
us and we'll run this and it has
executed successfully okay no
uh we got an error that
is okay okay okay it has made the
mistake yeah
it okay we just see what query
we I have 12 X Files named jan2 the Su
and use Python to apply the sum formula
from J2 to
j11 and the average formula from H2 to
h11 in all the files and write the
results
okay
done uh we would be a little specific
in the sales
j102 and
okay okay okay okay yeah we once again
submit it if we didn't
get okay yeah now he has used the
open yxl Library that's
good yeah that would be working for us
let's
see what he will provide to
us
yeah
she
and
okay
okay yeah
think H it can serve the purpose but
first we'll run it
so he is giving us the explanation for
what he has written this code that is
this code will apply the Su formula to
the range J2 to j101 and the average
formula to the range H2 to h101 in all
the Excel files the results will be
written in
j102 and h12 respectively it is
important to note that this code will
overwrite the original file so that it's
recommended to make a backup okay we
don't need that and we have backup in
the sales folder also so you can also
the read XEL and 2core XEL function from
P
okay so we'll try this
code uh it is not return to import OS
and guys uh you have to install all
these libraries open pyxl I have already
installed them you can search on the
browser that open pyxl
installation Python and it would be
directed to pypi tocom that's the
official website for the particular
libraries and there you can see the
command that would be the PIP install
and the particular command for the
module
name uh it is showing that it has run
successfully so we'll just see if it has
done its job or not
and in the AIL file we have in the Hedge
column that is the average of the Hedge
column that was the items and in the J
column we have the total sum of the
amount of the customers yeah the query
has run successfully J jpt has provided
us with the perfect code heads off to
the J jpt and moving on now we'll do
some other
automations and and
now what we can
do uh we have other files that is phone
number and phone number
two and what it
contains it contains the phone
numbers so what we could do is we could
add the plus 91 extension that is the
country code for India we will ask
charity to add the country code plus 91
to both the
files so I'll close these
files and
first we'll copy them and paste in
our root directory so we don't get any
error and
we'll change the
slide
name instead of
hyph we will add the underscore
okay now we'll move back to chat jpd and
write a
command and these files are CSV files
not xlsx
file yeah these are CSV files both the
files are CSV files other files are xlsx
files
okay so for that we'll write the command
to chj
that I have two
files uh with to CSV
extension and they are named
phone
underscore number and the second was
named phone uncore number underscore
2 okay so we have told the J jpt that we
have two files and now we'll tell him to
use python
to add the country
code add
the
country code plus
91 as string
prefix and that would be adding as a
string prefix else it would only show N9
it won't show plus so we'll see if Chad
jpd understand that or not as string
prefix in both the CSV files
with column name that was
phone okay now we'll just press
enter and wait for a chat jity to answer
this query
and we'll see how it
responds you can use the Pand library to
well okay and the to the phone numbers
and modify data
okay do this
[Music]
okay okay
the now we are
reading and
phone it's adding as type string okay it
has understood that and to
CSV then this code will in both the
files yeah I think this will
work we have copied the code this code
will in both CS files and the plus time
string to the phone numbers and write
the modifi data back to the C files it's
important to know that this will over
write the original file so it's
recommended to make a backup with the
original
okay uh you could also use the apply
function to add the prefix to the phone
number in the column
okay okay yeah uh we can do this also
with the Lambda
function and that's all this will also
do a
job first we'll see
this and we will create a
file for this Automation and name it as
country code. py okay and we'll paste
the code
here and run it for you guys it's
showing that it has executed
successfully uh yeah it has executed
successfully so we'll
just go back to our
files and see whether the go + 91 as a
prefix or not okay the numbers
okay the files code only 91 as the
column it's still in the number
format it
hasn't converted into string
format we'll see the second code
also
like yeah it has converted X into string
okay Lambda X we'll
see whe it's working or not
like it has worked uh and the issue is
we
have change the files permission denied
okay we have opened a file we'll close
it and
save save this and run it
again now Cho it has executed
successfully we'll open the
files and now if we
see it is showing yeah uh now it has
added 2
91s uh so no issues uh the thing is
first we have to transform it into the
string format and then we can add plus
91 as a string to that
string so Chad JP misses with the
slightest
implementation the
code now moving on uh we'll see this
command later if you want to see how we
can add plus 91 I will tell you how to
write that code
okay so now moving on we will do another
Automation and you would be glad to know
that chat jpt improves the existing code
like uh in the first automation it has
concatenated but it hasn't converted the
concatenated file like it hasn't created
that file it had created the file when
we have returned to it that you forgot
to create that file so chat jpd it
modulates the existing code
also and moving
on
now uh in
any okay we'll open the concatenated _
data not
xlsx and inside this okay we have the
product line so what we will do is we
will change
the name of the electronic assesses to
electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to
Lifestyle now we'll automate this
process and we can do this automation
all the files also from January to
December so we'll do that only
okay now
here we will command
is Okay now we'll command the chat jpt
that using python
iterate
through all the Excel
files in
the directory so we are asking him to
iterate through all the Excel files in
the directory and we will ask him to
replace what was electronic SSS
electronic
accessories see the spelling
oric accessories
okay yeah electronic accessories with
electronic equipments
and you also ask
him
equipments okay we do equipment only and
home and lifestyle we have choosen
yeah
and home and
lifestyle and
and change it with
only
lifestyle okay so using python we are
iterating through all the Excel files
and changing
these uh that would be in each Excel
file so we have to be specific with a
written language and now we'll save the
modified workbook
in we'll create another the folder and
in that we will save the
files
okay save
the
modified
file in
the
output
folder and if the folder is not created
we'll ask him to
created
okay then create
one
hold add it
in okay I don't know why I'm saving this
so I have written the command I will
press enter so that J jpd can process it
and give us the code for
that so it's showing us sorry that was
show she showing us uh you can use the
OS Library toate through all the Excel
files and directory the pandas library
to read in the files and make the
changes and to save the modified files
okay here's an example of how you could
do this
now here we imported OS Pand as PD and
it has written the code we'll copy that
this code will iterate through all the
Excel files in the current directory
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle in the data
frame and then save the modified files
in the output folder if the sorry if the
output folder doesn't exist the script
will create
it you would also use replace function
to replace value in the colum
okay this will WR it through all the
cells in each row of the Excel sheet and
replace electronic accessories with
electronic equipment and home and
lifestyle with lifestyle if the cell
value is equal to the respective string
okay we have copied a
code and now we will create a
file
and name it as at trade.
py paste the code here and run it for
you
guys the code has been executed
successfully now we'll
see we open all the files not all but
yeah we'll open
some that was the previous electronic
access okay so it hasn't changed in this
okay we will open another
file and see if we code the changes in
that or
not that also States the electronic
accessories so it
hasn't done its
job so we move back to
jpt and use this code if
it functions
else we'll write back to the chat
jpd
join
okay just a second the we using the
replace and F
accident okay so for there we have to
import the
OS
done load uncore
book and for
that import
this
it close this files
okay now we'll
see if we quote our solution or
not no it's showing electronic
accessories and home and lifestyle so
Chad jpd
doesn't go the code to change
them so we'll ask him another time and
with a different language this
time Al I don't think it has created the
output folder
it has oh
sorry I'm really sorry what I have done
is my
mistake those were the original
files and we have the product line here
and we have electronic accessories
here and that should be equipments
okay uh we have electronic accessories
and
lifestyle let me see my
command okay I have asked him to change
electronic with electronic equipment and
moment lifestyle with lifestyle so it
has changed only
lifestyle let see
okay
okay uh the E here is small we'll update
that in the
code you can write this back to chat jpt
also but yeah first we do
this what are i
showing not has executed successfully
okay in the output foldo we have the
this
number
accessories that the capital okay
okay okay okay so this code is giving us
error we'll see the last code we'll copy
that
and try to use this
close the terminal and run it
again it has executed successfully now
we'll see the
file whether it has changes or not it
has not now we ask the chat
JP what have you done brother
using python I through all the Excel
files in the Dory and replace electronic
accessories with electronic equipment
and home and lifestyle with lifestyle
okay in each Excel file save the
modified
[Music]
F
okay will ask the same thing once again
to
him and with this
electronic accessories oh
sorry and save the modified
file output folder and get a folder it
doesn't exist okay
okay the same the mov
let see once
again close these
files has executed successfully now will
open
it and now we can see that it has
changed to electronic
equipment electronic
equipment yeah now it has executed
successfully maybe there would be an
error with us while copying it as we
have also created the output folder but
we for go to see in that folder maybe
that could be the error from our
side now now we are done with the
changing of the column names uh it's the
cell names that was electronic assesses
to electronic equipments and home and
lifestyle to Lifestyle now we'll do the
next
automation for that first we'll open an
Excel
file uh this was in the output
folder and get back to our main
directory and open the file J
like and
here here we will filter the Excel file
for gender that is we'll select gender
as female and with the unique values in
column
City and we'll extract the data from
column A to q that would be the whole
data and for each Unique city value
we'll create a new Excel file for each
City and that will contain data only for
that City and for females only and after
that we'll save this file in a folder
named City so we'll give this command to
chat
jpt and here you can also specify the
module you want chat JP to use for the
particular command here we will be
commanding the chat jpt to use the
pandas module and for that we'll write
the command note command in the natural
language we'll give this command to the
chat
jbd and for that we'll write using
Python and
pandas filter
the okay we will just pick a single
Excel file or we can pick the
concatenated file that is concatenate
atore
data filter
the
concatenated underscore
data dot Xcel
SX Excel
file and that would be for gender
fil and by the
unique values in column
City okay first we give the
command by the unique
values in the
column
City and after that we want to extract
the data from column A to q that is the
whole
sheet extract the
data from the column A2 q and for each
Unique city value
for each
Unique
city
value now we will extract the data and
now we'll create a new Excel file so for
that also we'll give the command to J
jpd and we'll write create a new Excel
file and that would be for each
City
okay so we'll write create a new
Excel
file for each
City
containing
data only
for
that
City and four
females
okay and save this file in the
City
folder and if it's not being there chat
jpt can create the folder for that
also okay City folder
and naming the each file with the city
name
Okay naming each
file after
the
corresonding
city
okay now F
the city folder that is we have written
the small City
okay if the city for
doesn't
exist then create
it before saving the
files
okay now we have given this command to
the chat jpt and it has responded us
with you can use the pandas Library as
we have already mentioned to use that to
read in the
concore data. xlsx file and filter the
data for gender female group the data by
the unique values in the city column and
extract the data from the specified
columns for each group and here is an
example so we have put the
code we'll wait till chat jpd continues
and we can see that the chat GPD has
completed
and we will copy this
code Pro open
okay just
seeed G
female City we make the D City and for
City Group in female data Ro Group by
okay
City and you could also use the as in
method to filter the data frame for
female gender okay first we'll see
this and
for that we will create filter. py
and run the
code it has been executed successfully
so now you'll see that the city folder
has been created or
not I'm not able to see the city
folder okay it's been
created so we'll see okay
it's been
created man it's still
empty so we'll give
time okay V quote an
error okay okay we'll pass this error to
CH J first and after that we'll see
what's wrong with this
and you are so the error message you're
saying is indicating that the column
name specified in the list are not
present in the data frame it's likely
that the actual column names in the data
frame are different than the ones you
specified in the
list okay we just see the
list that is concatenated data
go
back and see that is
A2 okay it's still
R okay we made a little mistake
here so we'll just
change a
command yeah this is it and instead of Q
now we'll write R and save and submit
now we'll see what it
would what it would generate for
us we'll close this
okay this will Exel files filter the
data for females group the data by the
unique values in the city column create
and exract the data from the column A to
R for each Unique city name and then
create a new Excel file for each City
containing data only for that City and
for femes files will be sa in the city
folder name H file after the
corresponding City
okay it's done now we'll copy this
code and paste it here and
see whether this code works for us or
not
so it's been executed successfully now
we have moved to the city okay it's
executing so we'll give time to the
code let it do it so yeah it's been
executed
successfully okay so there were three
cities that was Mandalay Na and
Yangon and if I show you the
data you could
see there see three cities and it has
created the Excel files with the name of
the Cities only the unique cities and it
has extracted the data for the gender
female now we'll see those
files CL this
and
back in the city
folder could see the and lity and the
data is just for the
females so this automation works well
with J
jbt now moving on we will do one more
Automation and that would be to use
Python to identify what is the count of
each payment mode
mode so for
that I will just get you aware of the
payment modes in our sheet and we'll do
this automation on the concatenated data
sheet
only so this is the payment column and
you can see the mode of payments that is
ewallet cash credit card and these are
repeating so we will use Python to
identify what is the count of each
payment mode from column M column n
sorry and that is from this sheet only
and then we'll create a new sheet and
name it as count. xlsx and write the
count against each payment method so
we'll give this command to our chat
gbt and ask him to write the code for
our
automation so we writing use Python to
identify
use Python to
identify what is the count
of
each payment
method
[Music]
from column and the column was n from
column n and that was
in
concatenated con
cated
underscore data do xlsx
sheet
and create a new
sheet
named count.
xlsx
and write the count
against each payment
method
okay now we have given this command to a
chat jpd and we'll see what it offers to
us you can use the Pand library to okay
that's the same value counts function to
get the count of each method okay and
you can use the two Exel method to the
data frame to write the count to a new
sheet okay that's good and and he has
imported the Panda's library and create
the DF variable in which he has read the
con file and used counts function with
payment
method and to pay okay the column name
is
payment note payment method I think it
would
generate an error for
us so
spon of each one method from column
n and we will
specify column M and that is
named payment as it has used payment
method here you can
see that it has used the column name as
payment method so we'll specify
this we we have to be very specific with
our commands for these automations for
simple task you can use Simple language
like no complex sentences or you have to
mention every detail but for these
automations you have to
use now our chat jpd is working with
this and mostly it will deliver us with
the perfect code I hope so
okay
uh has right and the value and it has
exported
reset thep by function to group the data
method and use the size fun method
okay okay we'll see this
and
here we will create a file as count.
py and in this file we'll paste the code
delivered us by the
chity we have executed it it's being
executed we'll wait for that
it's been executed
successfully so we have back to our
folder and we have to look
for f count file now yeah count
file is this the no it's okay yeah it's
showing us the mode of payments that is
ewallet cash credit card and the number
of
usage yeah 4
483 12 yeah it's 12,000 that was the
whole entry of the
concore data. xlsx so we have done with
this Automation and now we'll do one
last
Automation and first we'll close all
these files
okay and moving back to our jat GPT and
now we will do we will rename all the 12
Excel files that was January February to
December and we'll add the
word uh Car Sales just before the month
name that would we will just add the
prefix before the month name and for
that we'll give the command to the chat
jpd in the natural language and here
only we will change it in the main
directory only as we have the copy of
all these files so for this we write the
Quant use
Python
rename all the 12 Excel
files
named
January
February
until
December
okay and that is present in my
directory and what we have to do is
we have
to add uh the word we will add Car Sales
okay car Sals
and front
of
each in front
of each file
name
okay so what it will do is car sales
uncore January Car Sales _ February and
so on so we'll wait for the chat jbd you
can use the O library to iterate through
all the Excel files then use the W
rename function okay rename the files
here is an example of how you could do
this go to S and we have the months
okay this code will iterate through all
the Excel files in the current directory
and add carels in front of each file
name
and those files would be those only the
months and good it's using the glow
module and you could also use the Glo
mod okay that's the second
code it's the easy one
okay but we'll go with OS
first and get back to our ideally and
name the file as rename dop Y and here
we'll paste the
code and run
it it's been executed we'll move back
yeah you could see that car sales have
been added to all the
files and with that we have done with
our
automations and if you want you can also
submit your code to chat GPT and ask it
to add commands to your code so that it
could explain you what that line does or
what that function does it would explain
very tediously and if you want you can
also try chat gbd to automate many
office
tasks you can automate PowerPoint for
that and do many more tasks with jity on
that note we present you postgraduate
program in Ai and machine learning
elevate your professional journey by
enrolling in this a ml course presented
through through a partnership between
per University and IBM hurry up and
enroll Now find the complete course
details from the link mentioned in the
description box below during our
childhood we have heard the fictional
stories of robots taking over various
household courses making the lives of
humans easy peasy but if you're not
aware then these fictional stories are
turning into reality though not in the
form of physical robots but yes in the
form of computer programs and apps with
the help of artificial intelligence and
machine learning Technologies confused
let me introduce to you to chat GPT a
pre-trained model that interacts with
user in a conversational way chat GPT is
founded by open Ai and the model is
based on supervised and reinforcement
learning so are you excited to know more
about chat GPT chat GPT has various
application in various domains in this
video we are going to see the
application of chat GPT in the SEO
domain also we are going to discuss how
chat GPT will play an important role in
search engine optimization so here is a
question for you chat GPT is based on
which of the following GPT models
created by open AI option one chat GPT 1
option two chat gpt2 option three chat
GPT 3 and option four none of the above
let us know your answer in the comment
section below and if your answer is
correct you will get a heart from Simply
learn so to begin with let's open chat
GPT we need to go to new chat which is
already open
here let's start by we will try to
demonstrate an Su optimized uh blog in
this demonstration so let's get some
keyword ideas for the blog so before
that let's choose what kind of blog we
want to create I really love traveling
so let's try to create a travel blog so
for the travel blog we will find some
good keywords
so here you can see we are getting some
suggestions for the travel destinations
we can choose any of them
okay so here we got around uh seven of
the
results so let's try to get something
for Japan
suest me good keywords to create a
blog on
Japan okay so what I understand from
this is we are just getting few of the
random
keywords okay so it
is it is showing that these keywords
cover a range of topics related to
Japanese culture history food and
more uh out of these I guess we can
start with the places here are few
places like Mount
Fiji Tokyo and everything so let's try
to create a
blog on top 10 places to visit in
Japan okay so we are getting places to
visit in Japan for
let's try to get keywords related to top
10 places in Japan
okay so we are getting some of the
keyword
recommendations and it is also
suggesting that by using these keywords
our content will be more dis
discoverable and it will be easy for
rank for for for sear for search
rankings
write me a Blog on top
10 places to
visit in
Japan so the idea is we will try to
write a blog and after which we will try
to uh uh optimize the blog with respect
to the keyword top 10 places to visit in
Japan and we will also uh see whether
all the SEO practices can be easily
applicable or not using chat
gbt so here you can see we are getting a
Blog with a introduction with top 10
places and probably what I expect is to
get a good conclusion out of it
also like uh uh chat jpt provides you
the facility so that you can reduce the
length of your content the textual
content the blog or article or anything
you want uh to several number of words
like if this Blog has 2,000 or 5,000
words you can just ask chat GPD to
reduce it to 2,000 or th000 words also
so here you can see that before when we
searched there were only one liners
about these destinations these places in
Japan and now we are getting a detail
about all the 10 places
definitely we have targeted this blog
for the uh keyword top 10 places to
visit in Japan however we can ask for
some more keywords to increase its reach
suggest few more
relevant keywords for my block
okay so we are getting some more
keywords
here for any blog it is really important
to have a very good title so we will try
to implement a catchy title for this
blog
as a good title helps the user to click
on your content and it uh increases the
possibility to get more and more
traffic so here you can see the tit is
completely keyword optimize our keyword
is top 10 places to Vis it in Japan and
here I can see most of the suggestions
most of the suggested titles have the
keyword top 10 places or top 10
destinations which is somewhat similar
to what we are
expecting I have the best
suitable title in my
block okay so we are getting something
different here The Ultimate Guide to
Japan's hidden gems 10 places you can't
miss okay so here we got title for a
Blog but here we can see there is a
slight limitation that it is suggesting
the title but it is not adding it to our
blog and repr presenting it again to us
optimize my
blog for the
keyword top
10 places to visit in Japan top 10
places to visit in
Japan with an
optimized
title for
okay so we have to do it manually it's
not able to add the title in the
blog
optimize blog for the
keyword top 10 places to visit
and okay so here it is showing the
relevant suggestions
so maybe there is a
slight ambiguity in the query that's why
it's not representing us the correct
results we are going to optimize our
blog using all these factors
visit in Jaan
again these are the suggestions
let's try to implement these one by
one add headings H1
H2 in the above
blog so yes we are getting the updated
versions having H1 and
H2 and yes you can see
easily that the title of the blog is in
H1 and the rest are maybe in
H2 H1 and H2 tags are some of the
practices in the on page optimization
which uh helps the search engine boards
to understand that this is something
important really important uh for the
page and they pick up these hints for uh
getting your uh page
rank so yes it is
implemented e
okay so our blog is completed with H1
and H2
implementations let's try to get some
interlinks for this blog interlinks have
their own importance as interlinking
your blog with other pages of your
website or your blogging Pages this will
help you you to gain the traffic from
other pages to your blog and uh uh
putting the traffic from your blog to
other pages of your
website also it helps the search engine
boards to understand the crawl structure
understand the website structure
also
so suggest me
few ENT links for the above blog
so yes definitely these are the relevant
and uh expected links we are getting so
if you have any of these uh blog pages
in your uh website or if you have
created any of these blogs earlier do
Interlink it
which of the
above can I use in my blog so definitely
there are number of suggestions but if
you want to choose one how can you pick
the one let's see if we get the relevant
thing for
this
okay so it is not only suggesting that
we can use all of the above but it is
also showing the significance of
interlinking okay moving ahead
so till now we have optimized our blog
for a keyword top 10 places we have
tried to get some of the keywords
relevant to the uh top 10 places to
visit in Japan we have added headings
and we have tried to get some of the
good Interlink suggestions to add inter
links in our blogs which are some of the
good practices of the on page
optimizations so next moving ahead in
another on page optimization technique
is let's try to get a cover image for
this
blog so by by getting a cover image
suggestions we will try to implement the
image optimization technique for our
blog page
okay so it is showing uh some of the
suggestions related to the diversity of
the country panormic view of Tokyo
Skyline the beautiful image of Koto
traditional Temple Mount Fuji
hiroshima's peace Memorial
Park so we will try to pick one and uh
see if we are getting any image
idea let's take for Mount
Fuji suggest me the image idea for
Mount so let's see we have seen in
generic for all now let's see for this
uh image suggestion specific to M
Fuji okay definitely it is showing uh
number of suggestions for the specific
Mount Fuji
image so if you are looking to create
another block for Mount Fuji then these
ideas are easy to take up
optimize the
mount fui image for my
blog here are some tips to optimize the
image for Mount Fuji for my blog which
are they're showing that the image
should be high
resolution then a clear
subject definitely if you have a large
image a large file size it really gets
difficult to load and the page load
speed will increase so if you have a
large file size the image should be
compressed without reducing its quality
image quality
we should have descriptive file names
and all
tags
okay so let's try to get a very good
file name and all tag also we'll try to
implement a good caption because adding
a caption is very good in the uh when
considered as a
user
so get me
good
image title and
alt tag
for Mount fug
image so there is importance for alag as
search engines are Bots uh they won't
able to identify the image directly so
Al tags helps the search engines to
understand what the image is
about so yes it is showing not one but
number of suggestions for all the Mount
Fuji recommendations which we got
earlier so we will try to choose one and
get a caption for
it write a
good
caption for
for the
image
Scenic
Fugi Five Lakes Region
so yes definitely we're getting
suggestions
here I guess this caption is quite long
so let's try to reduce it to 40
words reduce the above caption
to not even 40 let's do it in 20 20
words okay this one is
better now let's try to get the image if
there is any
choose the
mount Fugi image for my
blog choose image it should not I
repeat choose the perfect
illustration
for Mount
fui image for
my blog
so you can see here that it is not
choosing any image but it is again
providing us the suggestion what we can
choose again this is the limitation that
it is not showing us any of the image we
will try to put it in another way to get
an image
if it really works we can get
it okay so it is not possible to
download or get an image representation
using chat GPT
we can only get the recommendations to
choose the image and yes it is showing
some suggestions of un unsplash pixels
or Shuttle stock to download the image
so we can uh really navigate to these
websites and download some of the
required image for our block so we we
have uh completed here with the image
optimizations let's try to get some
video ideas because again having a video
is a catchy factor for the users
visiting your
website or your blog
page suggest me suggest video ideas for
the
above
blog Okay so we are getting few of the
video ideas
which of the above idea is best match
for my blog let's try to extract anyone
from the above
okay so it is completely dependent on
the user's Choice what a user wants so
here I'll
choose
for again we will continue with Mount
Fuji only
provide video optimization
optimization
ideas video
optimizations
for Mount Fuji video for a above
block okay so it is showing us some of
the suggestions which uh which we can
Implement for a video as we do not have
any video here we can just take these
recommendations and optimize whatever
the video of our choice
so let's take the thumbnail suggestions
in our next query uh if it can suggest
as a mount fui uh thumbnail uh image
suggestion uh and the video tag
suggestion
right suggest
me
good thumbnail idea for
Mount
2G
video thumbnails have the Major Impact
for any videos it is the only thing
uh I
repeat
thumbnails thumbnails are one of the
important factors which encourages the
user to click on your video and watch
the complete video
so definitely having a good thumbnail
will help your content to
rank so yes we have got around 10 of the
thumbnail ideas from which we can
Implement any one uh as of the video we
are having for our
blog so we are done with the thumbnail
ideas after which we will get we will
try to get video tags so for getting
video tags let's get for all of
them find
me
video tags
for the all of
above
thumbnail suggestions
tags are important to help the user to
get your videos in the search
list like if someone uh uh types Mount
Fuji in the search box and if the Mount
Fuji keyword is or a tag is added to
your video tag it is more likely to get
searched and appear in the search
results and possibly user may click on
it
so here we have tried to get uh try to
implement some of the good uh some of
the important um on page optimization
practices now let's try to get back
links which is one of the most famous
off page optimization
technique above
block Okay so it is
showing some of the link
suggestions so basically backlinks are
the
links which points from another website
or another web page to your web page or
your website so getting backlink uh is
one of the trust factors in the search
engine eyes that your content is really
unique and more of more users wants to
read it and share it with another uh
users so the search engines by by by
these search engines understand that
your content is really good and it is
worth of ranking so definitely getting a
good backlink from a very good authority
websites is uh fruitful for your
content so let's try to
get which
pages on web are
suitable to get backlinks for my
blog so here we are getting some of the
ideas or suggestions that which Pages we
can choose to get a backlink so here is
industry specific websites so if you are
writing a travel blog there should be a
travel trip at uh Trip Advisor like
websites uh which are showing more of
the trip oriented or bookings related
oriented for travel or
destinations there are few of the
directories okay government websites
which are the tourism websites in our
case right
now blogging websites and social media
platforms which can be relevant to the
current scenario which we are using here
so let's check how can we get back
links from
the
above
recommendations for my
blog okay guest
posting broken link building
okay these are some of the backlink
building methods which we are getting so
that we can find one and get one of the
uh I
repeat so these are some of the backlink
building strategies which we are getting
in the recommendation so we can
Implement any of these to get a backing
for our block
let's choose the specific platform and
try to get the
recommendations or the ideas to get back
links for the from the blogging site
so we can Implement these ideas and it
it may be possible to get backlinks
now that we have got some of the ideas
to get backlinks for our blog let's try
to add the catchy metadata for our blog
metadata like having meta title or meta
description these are the only uh data
which is um which is appearing in the
search results as you you have seen that
in the search result the link the Blue
Link we get is the meta title of our
blog page or a website page or any page
on the web whereas a few lines written
below that link is the meta description
that we are providing to let the user
know that what the blog is exactly about
so it is considered to be a good
practice to have the targeted keyword in
the title as well as in the description
so let's try to get
one
is
the create
seize meta title and
meta description for my block
so we are getting some suggestions
here top 10 places to visit in Japan
discover the best place to visit in
Japan top 10 destinations definitely we
have your top 10
destinations see also we are getting
some of the notes
that it is good to have meta title less
than 60 characters so if if it is more
than 60 character director you may get
the dot dot part and the title will not
be clearly visible in the search result
page so let's try to again optimize The
Meta title and meta description for top
10 places to visit in Japan
description for the key
word top
10 places to visit in
Japan okay
so we can use any of the one the one we
have got the recommendation the
previously and this one also both are
completely relevant to our
content so one of the technical SEO
factor which we are going to see here is
getting the URL
recommendation uh URLs are the important
factor uh it helps the search engine
boards to understand about the page as
the URL is the first thing search
engines may be visiting to come to your
page so uh it is a good practice to have
the keyword in your url rather than
having some of the abrupt characters
like x a r at the rate these kind of
stuffs in the link so let's
create the URL
suggestions suggest me
SEO
optimized URL for the above
blog see so here we are getting top 10
places to visit in Japan which is
definitely our blog and as a keyword we
are using it to optimize our content and
it is placed in the URL so this URL is
completely
correct also these kind of suggestions
are very good for the newbies in the uh
search engine domain as they will
definitely understand why and what we
are doing to optimize our
pages so next moving ahead with some of
the non-technical aspects which may
impact which may definitely impact to
bring the traffic so let's try to get
some of the sharing suggestions
like which
platforms should
I I
repeat which sharing
options should I add in my
block so out of the mentioned uh sharing
buttons we can add any of them adding at
least three to four sharing buttons is
considered to be really good out of
which there are many common like
Facebook is really common then Reddit is
really very common
WhatsApp Shares are really common
Twitter Shares are really common so you
can choose any of these to add it in
your
blogs D
commenting
on my blog
impact
on traffic source so here we are taking
the suggestion that will this help or
not
again this is again linked to the
backlinks that if we are adding the
comment section someone else may ask for
a backlink for their web and this is
again uh going in symbiotic way like if
they are asking for a a backlink for
from your blog you can even ask from
them so this is a way of or a part of a
communication to get a back links as
well
can you find
the
duplicate
content in above blog so duplicate
content is a concept where search
engines you you must be aware that
search engines are really in love with
the unique content so having a duplicate
content may
really uh affect your uh uh web
visibility and and it is possible that
your page may get dead after a
time so plagarism is not at all allowed
uh when you're creating a Content it is
not suggested in any
case Okay so it is not uh able to uh
charity is not able to identify the
duplicate content however uh it is
suggesting us some of the tools like
copy scape or sideliner to understand if
the content we are creating for our blog
is duplicate or
not and let's get some suggestions how
to
make content
unique just in case if someone is not
aware to create a unique
content we can get some of the tips here
okay so we have got some of the
suggestions Also let's try to uh see one
of the other aspects of technical SE
that is 44 Pages 44 pages
are really not are not likely to get
searched
because I
repeat let's try to see another aspect
of technical
Su uh try to find some 44 pages on the
website
so from this I can understand that
though we have not posted any blog link
or any uh internal links that leads to
that blog which we are expecting this is
not the clear idea we are providing but
yes uh to find 4004
Pages uh it is not possible for the chat
GPT to get one but we can use uh some of
the tools suggested like uh screaming
frog or Google search console where we
get the detailed report of the broken
links or 44 pages that is the dead pages
of our
website so let's wrap up from the uh
view of the technical SEO perspective
let's consider one of the scenario that
we have published this blog and how can
we promote this blog to reach more of
the relevant audience so
okay so we are getting some of the
recommendations that we can share our
blog on social media reach to the
influencer uh add it as a guest
post and Link back to this this blog
email marketing yes it is the most
trending technique to reach more of the
audiences PID advertising commenting
content
syndication yes medium and Linkedin are
the very famous platforms for this
online
communities so you can you can
definitely uh try to be the member of
the online communities and forums where
you can just put up the link and the
members of your Niche may definitely
visit your content and share it with
others
also so yes we we have seen that uh
search
for as as a perspective of search engine
optimization chat GPT is uh helpful
really really helpful to create the in
content Creation in optimizations and
many of the other

minutes you not be worried when we have
chat GPT now even though there are
numerous AI writing tools for Content
creation chat GPT stands out from the
crowd due to its faster response rate
ease of use increased productivity
support for multiple languages and other
benefits now let's try to understand
what exactly chat GPT is and how to
create content from it now generally
chat GPT is an open AI trained and
developed model that works
conversationally chat GPT is capable of
systematically resolving all bugs while
providing detailed explanation for each
step it takes so in simple words chat
GPT is a tool that creates content for
any query chat GPT stands out among all
the other achievements of open AI so let
us now move ahead and understand how
does chat GPT work now chat GPT uses
deep learning techniques to generate
humanlike text which is based on a
machine learning model derived from the
large language model class now it is
trained on a massive Text data sets from
the internet and learns patterns and
relationship between words and phrases
it responds to a question by selecting
the next word based on the context and
then repeats the process until a stop
condition is fulfilled so as a result
chat GPT can logically respond to your
queries and commands so let's see how to
create content in chat GPT now as we
already discussed content creation can
be of any type so for instance let's
take blog a Blog is an online general or
a website where a writer or a group of
writers share their views on an
individual subject now there are variety
of categories for writing a Blog so
let's pick one for Char GPD here so as
you can see we have navigated into chat
GPD and let us now ask a simple question
about food blogging now lately food
blogs are the most popular blogs that
everyone wants to write about so let's
find out what chat GPT has to say about
it now you can give any question to chat
GPT and it will answer so I'm just uh

some steps to get started in food
blogging career it is saying choose a
nishe choose a name and domain choose a
blogging platform create your blog
create high quality content and so on so
in this way CH GPT will automatically
generate the response for you based on
the questions that you giving input to
it next we will see another question on
lifestyle blogs now with the world on
social media everyone wants to read more
about lifestyle especially of a famous
or a popular uh entity what habits they
adapt and what to let go of Etc so let's

goodbye to mundane tasks and hello to a
10-fold boost in productivity let's dive
in ever since open a launched JP it has
been making waves in every field be it
academic marketing engineering or
content writing so here's a little
trivia for you who are the investors in
openi the company behind the development
of jjpd and your options are option A
Alan musk and Sam Altman option option b
Jeff Bezos and sa de option C Mark
Zuckerberg and L page option D zma and
masayoshi Son drop your answer in the
comment section Below on that note we
present you postgraduate program in Ai
and machine learning elevate your
professional journey by enrolling in
this a ml course presented through a
partnership between Pur University and
IBM hurry up and enroll Now find the
complete course details from the link
mentioned in the description box below
okay then let's get started there are
many uses of CH jpt in digital marketing
its main USB is smart human sounding
content writing we can command it to
write content related to marketing first
on our agenda is an ad copy there are
various ways to go about it but the must
understand that no matter how much
content sounds like humans it is still a
piece of content written by an AI so you
have to give detailed and precise
queries to get the best results let's
start by giving it a big basic command
like write an add
[Music]
copy as you can see it gave us random ad
content let's give this query more
content like write an ad copy for simply
learn digital marketing Master's
[Music]
course now as you can see it gave us a
more precise ad copy we can also ask to
make it longer or shorter let's give it
a next query can you make it
[Music]
longer and VOA it gave us a long version
of that same content now let's try to
convert it into email newsletters we
digital marketers often send emails to
promote our products and services so
let's give it a query as can you convert
it to email
newsletters as you can see it has
generated an email with a subject line
and body that is is enticing and
engaging to read we can also utilize
chat GPT to correct grammar or change
the tone of the content for example
let's enter a new query what is
[Music]
Facebook it has given us a general
overview of Facebook now let's ask it to
rephrase it more engagingly and in a
digital marketing context we can give
queries like can you make it more
engaging and relatable with digital
[Music]
marketing as you can see it has
completely replaced it and it is more
interesting to read it as well CH GPT
can also help with keyword research so
let's try it we will give a query as
suggest more Search keywords for a
digital marketing course head
[Music]
and voila it has completed a work we use
to spend 10 to 15 minutes in a few
seconds you can request to write blogs
as well let's give it a query to search
for some keywords for the blog suggest
keywords to write a blog on digital
marketing
it gave us some keywords you can ask it
to reduce these topics based on search
volume to get maximum results let's ask
it to narrow it down to five topics
based on keywords
volume here we have some suggestions
let's pick a topic content writing and
ask it to write an article on content
writing
[Music]
here we have our article for the blog
let's use chat GPT to se optimize it
let's first request it to give us meta
title and meta
[Music]
description here we have meta title and
meta description for this article we can
even request it to give us an SEO
optimized URL link
we can also request it to write the SC
optimized version of this article just
give it a command as also can you as you
optimize this article to improve Google
search results
[Music]
[Music]
here we have fully SE optimized article
with meta title and meta description
with a s optimized URL chat GPD can also
be used to train your customer service
chat boards but we can discuss the
process in some other video Chad gbt is
well vered with its content writing
capabilities it can even help you write
product marketing campaigns let's try it
with this query the query is write a
product marketing campaign for simpl and
digital marketing
courses well J jpt has done it again
this campaign looks interesting and it
will be able to generate more leads for
simply lar courses Chad jpt can also be
used to write scripts for YouTube videos
let's give it a query as write a script
for 5 minute YouTube video promoting
simply learn and its digital marketing
courses
[Music]
[Music]
as you can see it gave us full script
along with few suggestions for video
editor on where to put logos and clips
to make the video more engaging if
you're a content creator and you don't
know how to approach other content
creators for a collaborative video then
chat GP can help you with that it can
help you writing collaboration emails as
well my next query will be to write a
collaborative email for a YouTube video
on digital
[Music]
marketing since my last query was
related to Simply learn J GP assured
that I work for simply learn and I wrote
a customer collaboration email that
looks professional plus easy to read and
understand let me tell you what chart
gbt is chart GPT is a machine model that
generates humanik text responses it's
been generated on a massive data set of
text and can generate highly accurate
responses to a wide range of queries but
how can Char GPT be used for web
development there are number of ways for
example charity can generate website
content improving SEO and boosting
engagement chat GPT can also be used to
create chat boards that can interact
with customers in a natural and engaging
way now let's look at some of the real
life examples of how CH GPT has been
used for web development so for example
if I ask rgbd to create a e-commerce
website for me it will easily created so
let's see
it please create a website
for me in
HTML and CSS so there is one point that
I wanted to tell you guys if you want to
ask chat jpt for anything just give good
description about it so it can give you
a good response if I tell you tell it
more about my uh requirements it will
generate good uh quality of product okay
so let me tell it please create a
website for me in cssn
HTML that
should
[Music]
some like
orange and
blue
right
and where I'm selling
okay now lay wait for the response of
char gbt it will create us the things
the code okay now it's writing the HTML
code
right so I'll tell you more about it
like for example e-commerce sites use
Char GB to generate product descriptions
improving their Su and uh driving sales
customer service team use CH GPT to
create automated chat boards that can
help customers with common queries and
there are so many other things also like
uh content creators also use chat GPT to
generate engaging content for their
website right so let's wait a couple of
minutes more until it gets completed
right so as you can see it's giving us a
proper response of
everything as it created this file for
us and we can just easily copy it from
here and I have logged into my online
editor you can open any editor if you
want so this is the online editor that
I'm working on right now I'll clean
this so as you can see ecommer website
is ready right so this is a very basic
website but chat GPT has created this
for us it's a very easy website like
very basic but as the instructions that
I gave
it applied all the things that it's
using yellow color but I asked for
orange but it's fine I asked for blue
color so this is also fine but before
asking chart gbt you should know a
little bit about coding right so in H1
tag here you have to write the heading
it's the header tag inside that it's the
H1 The Heading
one okay so here I'll write my website
name I'll write
website and then you can see let
join website right so how can you use CH
GPT for your own we development projects
first you have to familiar yourself with
the programming languages and tools that
are compatible with Char GPT and it will
only knows the data until
2021 so once you are done that you can
experience with chat GPT to see how it
can benefit your
project right if I ask him to create
wait I'll show you guys some of the
things that CH jbt can
do create a
header so I've told jgb to create a
header and make it functional and also
add page product page and contact us
page make it a little more more I have
written make it attractive right so
let's
see it's will write us a code for that
so until then let me tell you the use
cases so as I already mentioned chat GPT
has already proven its values in various
web development scenarios for example
e-commerce platform use CH gbd to
generate product descriptions boosting
their search engine optimization and and
driving more sales customer service team
employ chat GPT to build interactive
chat boards that provides instant and
accurate responses to customer queries
enhancing the overall user experience so
optimize the generated content from SEO
ensures that the text generated by CH
GPT aligns with relevant keywords and
follow SEO best practices right so with
the help of char GP SEO thing
this can help improve your website
visibility in search engine results and
it can create natural and authentic
chatboard experience so when using chat
GPT to develop chat boards focus on
creating conversation that feels like
human use context and personalization to
ensure user engagement and build trust
leverage ad GPT for customer engagement
Beyond generating content right chat GPT
can help engage user on your website
also for instance you can use it to
develop
interactivity and so many other things
okay so now let's see what chat GPT has
created for us right let's copy this and
paste it on the online editor that I
have showed
you I don't recommend using uh online
editor you can have Visual Studio code
it's very good so it doesn't have any
CSS I guess yeah add your customer Uh
custom styles for product pages here
yeah so as I know we have to write the
CSS here but it's fine I have to show
you something different so as I told it
to create a e-commerce website so it
give given its name as welcome to uh
e-commerce website but we can change it
from here the title of the website we
can change it right and I have told it
to create home product and contact page
right as I have showed you so it has
created the same thing that I have told
Char video to create for me as in the
products page there's no things added
right now but we can add it add your
products and their details here as it's
written in the code also I guess yeah in
the section part we can add our product
and the things that have want right now
let's ask charb to
create
Circle create five Circle
different
radius or 20
pixels
to pixel right and
[Music]
files
and blue
and
orange now let's see whether it can
create five circles of different radius
for us or not right and now it's writing
the HTML file for
us let's wait a couple of seconds to see
whether it can create so it given us the
things we want but I don't think so it
has different uh radius okay as you can
see in the CSS part it is given
everything a different height and width
let's copy the CSS first or HTML
anything you want and we'll paste it on
the online editor let's go again and
copy the HTML part also and paste it
here now we will down and as you can see
the first circle is small and then the
last one is the largest one right so as
you have given it the chart GPT the
instructions that I want this thing or
that thing it has created the same thing
that I told him to to right so it's all
about instructions but as I know that
this is Weir height this is very simple
thing but when you'll uh code on python
or JavaScript or Java it'll be a very
complex things so I recommend first
learn the language and then use charb to
improve it right so many developers and
programmers use charity to enhance their
productivity not to learn it so it's
very good for learning purpose also if I
tell
it I want to to
learn Java is I say
Java
from where
should
start learning
it give
me
some
rences
and some
web
sites from
where I can
start with
the links of them right so I asked Char
to tell me from where should I start
learning the HT Java so it's now telling
that's great Java is a popular
programming language as there are many
resources available to help you learn it
here are some of the website and
resources is where you can start
learning Java right so it's giving me
Oracle Java tutorials it's very good to
learn Java from uh Java programming on
course era it's giving some of the
renowned Java certification courses but
I recommend you to take our Java
certification fullstack Java
certification the link will be in the
description box for that it's a very
good certification for um
newly uh starting developer or
programmer or experience one also so
from there you will start learning Java
from scratch so that is also very good
you can also check it out right so as I
told it to give me the instructions from
how to uh learn Java so it just gave me
everything with the links right so
now let's get
to give me
any projects I
ideas
for react
J
right so now it's telling me uh you can
create a project on react for from
starting from Todo list which is a very
basic app when you start learning any
language you start it by from too list
only or too app whatever you say next
one is weather app movie Library which
is also very good practice for Library
uh for react developers to start
learning react from and the e-commerce
store accept founder chart
application and these are the 10
projects that they uh the chart gbt told
us to learn right so it's very good you
can ask it anything if you don't know
anything like uh I'll tell
you JS
right I don't no
thing about
reactjs
please about
it so I told it I don't know anything
about reactjs I know about reactjs but
it's like I want to see what it's saying
you can also check out the projects that
I have created on react on this simply
learns YouTube channel so as it's saying
everything certainly reactjs is a
popular JavaScript library for building
user interfaces it was developed by
Facebook and it is widely used for
building single page application it's a
dynamic over application so some of the
key points of react component based
architecture virtual Dom and declarative
syntax unidirectional data flow react
Hooks and so many other things so as you
don't know anything about react it will
tell you to get started with react you
can begin by learning fundamentals of
JavaScript and familiarize uh yourself
with HTML and CSS once you have a good
understanding of these Technologies you
can explore reactjs by following
tutorials reading documentation I
recommend documentation because it's
very good you will get a deep
understanding of that then move to
tutorials and all and build small
projects it is also very good thing
start from uh learning from the projects
you'll learn more react official
document is here so excellent resource
to learn reactjs from scratch
additionally there are various online
courses tutorials and YouTube channels
dedicated to teaching learn reactjs such
as react course on these platforms and
you can also learn react from our
YouTube channel remember to to practice
regularly build projects to refine uh
yours learning and Leverage The react JS
Community for support and
guidance as technology advances in all
aspects of our life programming has
become increasingly important it is used
in many fields and industries including
software development gaming and
entertainment education scientific
research web development and many more
so needless to say the demand for
programming and coding in the IT
industry will probably keep increasing
for the foreseeable future but where
does chat open AI popular language model
fall in this chain that's exactly what
we are focusing on in this today's video
as I said earlier programming is
utilized in many domains like web
development robotics mobile development
machine learning and so on so how can a
program achieve maximum code efficiency
nowadays we have VII based tools like
charab to make our programming
experience more efficient although there
are several coding resources platforms
such as stack Overflow and GitHub where
programmers can find solutions to their
technical programming questions charity
stands out from the competition because
of its quick response time usability and
support for numerous languages among
many other benefits now let's first
discuss how chip Works chip generates
responses to the text input using a
method called Transformer architecture a
large volume of text is fed into the
chat GPT from various sources including
books websites and other social media
platforms the model then uses this
information to forecast the following
word in a phrase based on the words that
came before it the charity systems
allows users to enter text or queries
and then the system uses its training
data and algorithms to produce the right
answer the answer is created after the
input text has been examined and the
pattern most likely to match the input
have been identified using the training
data in short chity is designed to
respond to queries logically and command
more quickly and accurately but why do
programmers use chip on a regular basis
chib assists programmers by offering
programming related answers and
solutions and helping them improve their
skills beside that Char is utilized for
code generation code completion code
review and a natural language interface
let us understand each in detail chip is
trained to generate the code or even the
entire program described in the natural
language specified by what they want a
program to do and then Char could
generate the relevant code look at the
example of how chat GPT generates the
code so now open the chat GPT and you
can type any program that you want CH
GPT to generate so I will give write a
paladon program in Java so here you can
type write a
palum program in
Java so using Java programming language
it should generate the whole
program so as you can see it has
generated the program so it has used a
class name called palum Checker and it
has used is pandrum as a method name and
also it will give the explanation on the
program so so you can see here why it is
explaining why e palum is used as a
method and it also explains the for Loop
if a condition and so on next we have
code completion charity is trained to
generate Snippets of code or even fully
fledged programs it can generate a list
of possible code completion depending on
the context of the users incomplete
piece of Code by automatically producing
the entire code it can help the
developer save time and minimize error
next let's see the example of code
completion using chip so even if the
program is explained in natural language
chip will generate the proper code and
give the complete code so let's type
here using a
function write a
program to
convert the
string in
uppercase so you using which language
let's keep using C
programming and enter it once
again so as you can see we have just
said that using a function write a
program to convert the string in uper
case so using C programming language and
using C programming language it has used
function and you know this is the
function convert to uppercase and has
given the complete code for string or to
convert a string in uppercase and also
it gave the explanation here the convert
to uppercase function takes a pointer to
a string as its argument and then
iterates over each character in the
string using a for Loop so it explained
why for Loop is used why two upper is
used and why the method convert to
uppercase is used
everything so let's say uh we'll give
one piece of code like
void to
ER care s
strr so as you can see we just gave the
method to Upper and it's generating the
complete code so this is how charity
works for code completion next code
review jity can analyze code identify
the bugs or errors in the program and
further help resolve them it allows
developers to fix errors more quickly so
now let's have a look at the example of
code review so in this example charity
will review the code so even if the code
has some mistake it will give the proper
output let's say we have given the
example here so we give the function or
a method called
upper and here we are giving the keyword
called upper so it should check whether
this piece of code is proper or is there
any mistake in
this so as I said uh it's saying that
the given code appears to have logical
error as the function upper is being
called recursively on itself inside the
loop so instead of giving two upper we
just give upper here right so using the
keyword two upper only then the string
can be converted to upper case so here
we gave just upper so it says that it is
having this piece of code is having a
logical error and it gives a proper code
for
us so I hope it's clear and then we have
natural language interface with the use
of chpt a software application can be
given a natural language user interface
that enables users to communicate with
it through natural language instructions
rather than through conventional user
interfaces next let's see how charity
helps the programmers for natural
language interface so let's say we'll
give
here create
create a software
application
where the
user asked to
enter
credential for the too
app leave enter
so as you can see the charge will give
this steps so it can provide you with an
outlet for creating a software
applications that requires the user to
enter credential for a Todo app so here
it is few steps that we need to follow
to do a to-do
app so it's giving the explanation step
by step
so it says that determine the
programming language and framework then
set up the database to store the user
information and then create the
registration page and then finally
create the login page as well and once
the user is successfully logged in um
you know it will have the options like
like add edit and delete task as well
and then finally implement the security
measures to you know protect your
passwords and then test the application
to ensure that it works as intendent and
the user data is being stored and
retrieved correctly so it gives the
steps of how it has to be developed I'm
sure you all are aware of Charity at
this point the Revolutionary new aib
based chatbot developed by open AI has
taken the World by storm thanks to its
near life like responses and a very
intricate pattern of answers we have
never seen this level of expertise from
a chatbot before which really made us
think to what extent can we push it
there are many questions on lead code
that even the most experienced
programmers have difficulty answering so
we wanted to see how far chat gbd can
take us have we finally reached the
stage where AI is going to replace us
let's find out so basically here we will
be listing 10 really difficult questions
that we found on lead code popularly
asked while hiring and other Superior
examinations and see if chat GPD can
actually answer or solve those difficult
questions or not but before you like to
watch more such interesting videos then
do subscribe to our YouTube channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn so let's get
started so here is the lead code let's
see uh in our list which is the first
question that we are going to implement
in our chart GPD and see if it's able to
solve it or not mainly we'll focus on
hard category questions only
so according to my research there's a
question of
median of two sorted
arays so as you can see the success rate
is
35.7% so let's see if the chart GPD is
able to do this question so so first let
us go through the
question
okay press enter let's see what it first
returns uh on a one approach to solving
this problem is to use a modified binary
search algorithm to find the median of
the two sorted arrays so right now it's
particularly giving the logic which we
can actually imply to solve this
question and uh this is a good about the
chat GPD is that before uh giving the
code it's actually explaining how they
are putting the logic in together in the
code so probably you can use this logic
to create your own program but let's see
how sensible this code
is quite a ly
program this in Python so if uh you are
looking for your Solutions on chat GPD
you can always opt out or you know
mention the specific program you want
the code in so okay it's it's also gives
that okay that the time complexity will
be o log Min m or n so let's see if it
the case or
not so we have copied it and we'll
quickly paste it over
here as you can
see uh as we know that python is uh very
sensitive towards its uh syntax and you
can see the indentation over here is
perfect but here it's not so I feel that
something like this is something with
lead code so let me just quickly Rectify
this you can see I have cleared out the
indentation issue and let's just quickly
run this program so that we can get an
idea if this is the correct
program uh now you can see here we have
an error let's see copy this and see
what CH gbd has to say for this
so if you remember when we actually saw
this question there were three arguments
passed through this function which is
self nums one and nums 2 ask GPT if it
can write the code with self argument
and see if it's
correct and wait that if it can pass a
self argument through that function and
see if it can generate a new
code okay now it has cleared that yes it
takes three
arguments let's Cy this
code it over here again I think we will
have to go through the indentation
process
oh no this time it's fine okay so now
quickly run this program let's see if
this time it passes all the test cases
or
not
okay I think it doesn't need because the
class is already mentioned over
here uh yeah
okay the run time is 35 Ms and as we can
see case one and case two is definitely
passed
so let us see
if this code can pass all the desk cases
internally mentioned in this question
now you can see the first three cases
are actually accepted but the other the
three are not there's a runtime
error
so the first question in our list Jad
GPT was unable to solve so let's move on
to our next
question that is zigzag
conversion now let me quickly search for
it
this is the question here also you can
see the success rate is definitely below
50 and uh the difficulty level is medium
so the hard one charity was not able to
solve let's see if this can be
done so it will give a string that will
be written in a zigzag pattern on a
given number of rows and uh then you
have to read the line in a certain as
you can see over
here we have to write the code that will
take a string and make this conversion
given in a number of
row this also means a certain amount of
certific uh repeat does also given a
certain specifications that we exactly
want so this time we'll make sure that
we are mentioning
everything so let's quickly copy
this
yeah okay now that we have mentioned all
the the
specifications uh let me
quickly
feed and pasted now let's see what code
it has to generate
it's implementing the code in C++ so
meanwhile it's generating the code let's
quickly like the code oh it's already
C++
okay okay it's also suggesting that we
can definitely use Python and Java
and it's generating an alternative code
as well for
us that's
sharp just quickly copy this
[Music]
code a one I think it's a okay so it's
generating in uh
Java it's generating we'll definitely
have a look at it's alternative codes as
well let's quickly have a look at what
it has to C++ 1 the first code generated
by
it uh is correct or
not okay copy the
code Eed over here
dilation
error okay
okay 28
okay so
let's this
error one thing definitely this time we
have mentioned all the constraints
criteria specifications that we wanted
in our code but again
charge questions we have implemented
till
now let's see if it has any success rate
in
further okay it seems okay
now it is okay so this time it is uh
generating the solution or considering
the error in
Java uh see what it has to say in Java
and we'll make it specific that the
error was in C++ program so generates
the correct
code Plus+
program what it has to say
than see so this error is something
related to the compiler and now it is
giving the updated code in
C++ is the correct one or
not apologizing for making errors in
their
Solutions quite
fascinating
uh
okay paste the code over here I don't
see there's a lot of difference or
changes over here let's see if it runs
or
not let me see if all the braces are
covered over here or not
I think it's missing a brace
okay so there was a syntax error one
brace was
missing um I
don't B
that definitely something with the code
but okay we can give that to chity it
was partially read codes issue because
we were copying still it was not giving
the error that there is a brace
missing has passed the first three cases
mentioned over here and the runtime is 3
Ms now just let us submit this code and
see if it passes all the rest of the
cases or not minded this time we have
actually mentioned all the constraints
so let's see if this has to and
two okay so this time it has passed all
the test cases but still my conclusion
with this question is uh it was still
not able to generate the solution in one
go uh but I can give that to char GPT
because the first era that we faced was
more of a lead courses issue because it
was something with
compile and Char GPT was able to give a
prop
oh now let's go back to our problems
list so right now the score is one in
one it was unable to solve one question
and one not so let's have a look at the
third question and see if that brings
any difference to the Chart gpts
scoreboard right now or
not third question that we are going to
deal with is
substring
with concatenation of all words this is
in the category again and the Su success
rate is
31.1% which is even lesser than the
first question that we faced which was
median of the two sorted
Aras we trying here we are actually
trying to cover all all the Spectra the
huge Spectra of different types of
questions and you know categories
available in coding and uh to give you
an idea of
how beneficial charity can be for you to
solve difficult questions which can be
helpful for your interview base
in companies or you you can say well
established companies or M companies so
here this video is specifically for you
to give an idea that whether you can use
it for your benefit and you know to get
an idea or you can actually uh compare
it with
yours uh and you can get a you know
wider range of different types of
approaches to a certain
question so let's start with the third
question
is that you're given a string and an
array of strings probably words and all
the strings of words are of the same
length now a concatenated substring in s
is a substring that contains all the
strings of any permutation of words
concatenated here you can see it's given
an example that if words has a b c d EF
then a b CDE e f basically it uh has
done all the permutation and
combinations that can be done using that
specific
array
uh and that ACD BF is not a concatenated
substring because it is not the
concatenation of any permutation of
words so we have to basically return the
starting indices of all the concatenated
substring in the a
string also you can choose any order for
it here it has also given uh two
examples for you
to understand the question in a better
perspective
now uh copy this question and see
if what programming language aib chooses
to answer this time
start with new chart
again copy these
constraints okay it's just a
question okay this is the solution that
we are getting right now you requested a
model that is not compatible with this
engine please contact us through our
help center at
help. open.com for further questions let
me just quickly refresh it if it has
something to do with the you know demand
also sometimes it happens that the
console is very busy and you're unable
to
implement uh your task in it so again
let's
quickly paste it over
here we want a code write a
code return now
PR
enter definitely it's not giving the
same error let's see this time it Char P
has anything to give as a solution
okay so it's generating the code in
Python more thing every time charge
doesn't follows a similar pattern as you
can see in the first question it
explained the logic first and uh then
implemented the code second time it just
gave you the approach not the logic and
then implemented the code in multiple
language es uh first choosing for
C++ and this time it straightaway went
for the code so definitely we can say
that it has some different styles of
generating their code and explaining the
code I think it depends on the
understanding how they want the code to
be presented in front of the user and to
give the perspective that if the code is
understandable or not and if the code
has multiple approaches I think charity
is capable to keep enough to give
that that the code is generated let's
quickly copy
it
and paste it over
here I feel the indentation issue is
going to be
there it was not
there okay
F probably I think if we back
space sure let me quickly Rectify this
and
I'll you once the indentations are
but
e
e
e e
the indentation is corrected now uh
let's have a look at the code if it's
correct or not let's quickly run
it definitely it has given our first
syntax error again I can see that even
specific video question it definitely
goes to at least one error which is
mainly the syntax
one sure if that is something with the
lead code or you know with
the CH GPD code
generation
okay that we have given the error okay
it seems that the error is caused by the
use of type hints the function type
hints were introduced the version we
using is lower than that okay so
basically it's generating now in the
python version uh probably this code
is well suited for different version of
python let's change it then and see if
that
helps is actually generating the
code okay again given the other I think
it's again something with the
self
uh one the new code generated is
here we definitely come back to that
error and have a look at the Python 3
code
also uh first let's copy this code
and e
in giving the same
[Music]
error and see what it has to
say uh you know every time the charity
generates the python code we
cannot ever takes self as an argument
but the
lead as you can see when we start the
code it's already mentioned what
arguments we need to pass from that
particular function so I think that is
something with the lead code
so at what all arguments it's passing
even though we have mentioned everything
this time we have mentioned all the
constraints we have mentioned all the uh
necessary specifications that we want in
the code even then
the code is not correct in the one go so
probably I'll give this point to GPD
it's something with the lead code
because it's passing that parameter and
every time we have to mention that
parameter pretty much when we do the
charab is able to solve the question so
let's see what let me U actually mention
that pass uh self parameter self
argument from that parameters one of
make it a one of the parameters
processing
that yes self can be passed as the first
argument to the given function now let's
see if that it's able to give the
correct solution or not again we can see
it's generating the code in you
know Python
3 but we can give that to CH GPD that
either it uses python or Python 3 the
error is with the self argument so once
we mention that error and one we
mentioned that specification that if
charb can pass self argument through
that particular function in that code
the solution is pretty
much right so here it's also
implementing in giving the
answer okay also has mentioned that uh
it's important to mention import
imported list and counter so
okay just copy this because again there
will be a lot of uh ination
issues okay now that we have
it let copy the
code already mentioned so yeah we'll
just copy it from the function
paste
it one this code and see if it has the
solution in it or not
yeah there's an indentation
issue let
me again as you can see it it is able to
pass all the test cases here and the run
time is 208
Ms now let us submit this question and
see if it is able to pass other test
cases or
not accepted so it is able to pass all
the test cases and uh I think this is
something with lead code again uh
whenever we are generating the python
code we are actually passing self
argument uh in lead code but chart GPD
is not assuming it so the solution is
definitely correct uh even though we are
specifying everything we will have to be
more specific that we have to run one
more argument uh from the function so
that it you know generates the solution
in one go so let us try that in our next
question we can definitely C chgb was
able to solve this so now the scoreboard
is 21 one uh among three questions it is
definitely able to solve two questions
even in the first question it was able
to generate a correct solution but it
was not that accurate to pass all the
test
cases to our question
list the next question we are going to
cover is in
Queens category but still the success
rate is 63% over here again a new genre
or question we are covering over here
let us see
if solve it or not definitely the
success rate shows that many people were
able to do it
definitely more than half of people who
have attempted it so let's see if the
question can this AI can beat that or
not so uh I have copied this question
the question mentions that the N Queen's
puzzle is the problem of placing n
Queens on an N into to end chessboard
such that no two queens attack each
other given an integer n return all
distinct solutions to the n Queen puzzle
so basically n is any given number and
you have to create a puzzle of n n and
you have to arrange all the Queens in
such uh you know way also the number of
Queens in the board will be equal to the
number and in such a way that it is not
able to attack each other in any
case po it this part of the
question and the constraint is just
one let
me it will be easier to keep a track of
uh what all questions chart gbt is able
to solve
so these questions are very popular uh
in
interviews uh whenever you actually go
to technical rounds and uh for
prestigious companies these questions
are very popular uh they are considered
as very uh suitable questions to check
uh to check your you know IQ and to
check your potential that how well aware
you are towards your coding potential
that we have pressed enter it is giving
the logic it is going to implement in
its code one approach to solve the end
Queen's puzzle is to use
backtracking idea is to start by placing
a queen in the First Column of the first
row so let's see if the Cod is again
capable to you know solve it or not
again it's giving the python code
generating the code let us quickly see
whether it's python or Python
3 Python
3
okay once the code is generated I'll
also write that you need to pass one
more argument from the main
function uh that is self and uh let let
it generate the code again and see that
code can run in one go or not
what I want and let us see sure here's
an example of how you can pass an
additional parameter self let's see if
it
suits the code or not
look solve n Queen function is a method
of the N Queen's class and it takes self
as its first parameter followed by the
integer n so yes this solution does take
self as a parameter so let's see if this
can run in one go or not because this
time we have already covered the most uh
frequently generated error which is
syntax error of not mentioning parameter
self let let me see the indentation if
it's correct or
not this time uh let us quickly run this
plus okay there you go now you can see
that it has actually run the code in one
go and all the test cases are passed in
one go even the run time is 39 Ms so
definitely CH GB is able to provide the
solutions the Logics in a proper manner
it's just that we have to be more
specific with what we want exactly uh
from chat gbt right now we can see that
it has been able to successfully
generate of five uh questions that we
have actually implemented till now out
of which four are from hard
category let us submit this code and see
if it also covers all the test cases
inter internally fed in for this
question just a second I think I will
have to answer submit it
again there you go it has accepted all
the test cases and this question is done
by CH GPT it has actually
implemented question that we are going
to cover till now I can say Char gbody
has taken the lead it is pretty much
able to implement all the questions uh I
think there are still some range of
questions that it is not able to
implement as we saw the first one was
not a huge
success but uh I can still give that to
char as it is in Ai and still in a you
know developing mode but still if it can
give you 90% of the output correct it is
a pretty decent and you know amazing
thing to do
is shortest subar with some at least K
now let me search for
it again this question is from heart
category and it success rate is even low
which is 26.1 let's see this question
can be solved by Char
GPT let's have a look at the question
given an integer AR nums and an integer
K return the length of the shortest
non-empty subarray of nums with a sum of
at least K so if there is no such sub
add return
minus1 so
AR is a contagious part of an array it
has also given a description of what an
array is or what sub AR is so now that
we
have a new
chat and let
me CH
so here is one way to solve the problem
initialize two pointers uh left and
right both pointing to the first element
of the array initialize a variable so
now this time this it is giving pointers
to solve this question uh you know a
perfect approach in a sequential manner
so that you can also use these pointers
and the Logics it's given to actually
Implement your own code apart from you
know asking it to generate a
code I can see that it has given the
poters but not the code
specific oh yes uh it's giving an
implementation of the algorithm in
Python uh again we can see see it's not
the Python 3 it's python uh little low
version of python
um switch
to
python then we have to pass self
so it has generated a code and explained
what all variables and what statements
have the individual F functionality as
so we have also asked it to pass self
parameter through its function and then
write the code so let's see if it aders
to it and generates a new code with self
parameter okay so
here is the new code with self pass to
the main
function now I do have confidence on
chat GPT till now that it was able to
generate log logical and you know pretty
decent solutions for every
question this pass to the class as an
argument when an object is created and
is stored as an instance variable the
shortest subar takes K as an argument
which is the target sum so basically
it's trying to explain the code that
what exactly it's doing and what in
visual statements have as an influence
on the
code and whatever parameters they are
passing what influence or what position
they hold in the
code uh definitely charge abity is not
just generating the code uh you know
it's also explaining the logic and
approaches towards it and when it's
generating the code as you can see here
they have legit explained the whole code
how it's actually
functioning that's a good way to you
know
put emphasis on you know put a
confidence on the
solution remove this
yeah typ error okay let
me okay so it's apologizing it made a
mistake in its previous response the
init method it should take two arguments
one for the nums array and one for key
so now it's again generating a new code
adding to the syntax error or type error
generated
let right or
not mentioned that here the meod takes
two hour ents one for the nums array and
one for the G which was the error
exactly and it's again explaining the
whole code so that one person who
watches code or you know the logic could
understand the functionality of
it let's see if this code can run
Bo checking for indentation removing
class and
run is one more type
error let's copy it and
we mention that we want self argument to
be
passed it is still not able to generate
you know the correct solution twice so
let's see if this time it can work
out issue though with the code
apologize for the confusion seems that I
misunderstood
the that you are trying to call the
function directly without creating an
instance of the class in that function
outside of the class and simply Call It
by passing the parameters like this okay
the code is definitely generated by
itself definitely I am not calling any
function uh the code I copied was
actually generated by Char GPD itself so
it's it contradicting its own pointers
maybe we have copied the question uh
sorry the code let's paste
it again look for
indentation and run this
code okay once again it is not able to
you know
pass time error is there and now again
we have to copy this error and paste it
again according to chat gbd it was
confused with the context of the
question uh like I said the code was
anywh generated by chart GPT so yeah
this I think CH gbt is trying to
contradict its own
Logics let's see if the current code can
do the miracle of solving this question
[Music]
CL and
run okay so after four attempts of
running the codes generated by chart GPD
on lead code for this particular
question finally now it's able to pass
all the test cases so so I can I have a
very contradicting point right now uh
not exactly contradicting more of a
skeptism that okay Chad jity does
generates uh proper code or logic but it
doesn't considers all the criterias or
it also has a tendency of taking the
question in a wrong
context so I feel that when we as a
human try to solve these questions we
definitely try to implement all the
Logics and if we get it we can actually
get the code in one
go or you know demand of the question
and being AI being the superior version
or you know trying to be the superior
version of human brain and going to the
extents of a human
brain still faces those issues can be a
you know drawback for chat GPT because
you can see for this specific question
we have face multiple types of error and
we have seen chity contradicting its own
prior code
so definitely this is something to
consider or you know something to think
about submit this code
and like I said after giving four
attempts it is still not able to pass
all the test cases it is only able to
pass 61 out of 97 test
cases which is almost 70% of the test
cases 30% of the test cases are still
not passed even though we mentioned all
the constraints we have mentioned the
comments we have mentioned all the
errors that this particular code can go
through still it was not able to
generate the proper code that could go
through all the test cases so this was a
fail for Char GPT uh at least till now
we have made out this point that Char
GPT is definitely not able to solve
every question
question lit array with same
average for
it
let AR
with this is from the category of hard
questions and the success rate is only
25% uh Let me refresh it and remove this
code now let's have a look at the code
what it demands so you are given an
integer AR nums now you should move each
element of nums into one of the two
arrays A and
B and B are nonempty and average of
array a is equal to average of array B
now return true if it is possible to
achieve
that condition is not
justified also given a note that for an
array uh average array is the sum of all
the elements of array over the length of
AR okay so it it is giving the logic of
how to actually you know find out the
average of what average is exactly and
also it has given a few examples to give
you IDE how the code needs to be project
Ed or
implemented past copy the code and paste
it okay this for possible to achieve
this by checking all the possible
subsets of the nums array and comparing
the averages of the subsets so
definitely it has given you the approach
uh the way you can actually think of
solving this question uh however this
approach would have a Time complexity so
it's also giving that this approach can
have a Time complexity of O to the power
n so again it's suggesting a different
approach a more efficient approach that
will be using dynamic programming now
that can be used to find the subsets
with a specific average and create a 2d
array with the length of I and J will
that will be the length of the two we
have actually given as input and
represents whether or not it is possible
to get a sum of J using the first
elements of the nums array so
[Music]
so the time complexity of this approach
would be o NS so definitely is not given
a code uh let me ask for
it that not for every question chgb is
generating a code it is also mentioning
just and the approaches that we can
actually use uh definitely again we will
have to mention that what we want from
them as you can see I've mentioned this
time to write a code for it and now it's
generating a new code for
it is also mentioning comments that what
every snippet of the code is actually
for and what it will do like here you
can see it will fill the 2D DP uh DP
stands for dynamic programming this here
it has mentioned initialize the First
Column as true so it is also mentioning
the comments for better idea of you know
understanding the code in a better
way also giving the note that this
implementation assumes that the nums
array is nonempty and that the elements
of the nums array are non- negative inte
fatures
yeah also the above implementation will
return the possible subset that can be
formed by the array to fulfill the given
condition and not Pion true and false
but that's what we want exactly right uh
still okay let us this approach is in
Python so let's copy this and see this
code can run or
not I can clearly see that again it
needs to pass
self uh
parameter indentation
give it a heads up
or I have mentioned what I want
specifically uh sure here is an example
of how you can pass the self parameter
so now the current solution will pass
self
okay there was an A okay
in and it has generated a new code uh
considering the criteria I just
mentioned that I need self parameter to
be passed through the function can
partip so I have copied it and let's
quickly paste it over
here uh you know pass all the cases are
not wait uh we need to remove
this okay it's done now quickly just run
this program
okay so here is
uh error attribute error solution object
has no attribute okay so let me copy it
and paste it over here and see what CH
gbt has to say about this
error okay the error message solution
object has no
attribute uh split array same average
suggest that there is no method named
with this in the solution class so it is
likely that the test case is trying to
call this method but it does not exist
in your implementation anyway that I
have not mentioned this method this was
given by CH G itself so again we can see
the condition that it is contradicting
its own so again it has generated new
response and it says that it should
resolve the issue and the test case
should be able to call this particular
method
correctly so that is something for us to
decide now let us copy this code and see
that now is it able to run or not and
pass all the test cases or
not and click on
run okay now the new generated response
does works for this particular question
and the runtime is 12 Ms and it thus
passes the first two cases mentioned so
let us quickly submit this code and see
if the code is perfectly you know fine
to deal with all the test cases actually
fed by lead
code okay now again we can see one more
situation that this code is not able to
pass all the test test cases even though
we mentioned all the specifications
constraints and we were pretty precise
about the questions and parameters that
we want our code to be done in certain
form but still it is just able to pass
68 test cases out
of1 which is almost 50 to 60% of uh
total amount of test
cases so let's move on to the next
question
that is find substring with given hash
value so let me quickly search for this
question find
substring
with value again it's it's a question
from hard cat I and the success rate is
22.2% so let's have a look at the
question what it demands so here the
hash of a zero indexed string of length
K given integers P and M is computed
using the following functions now hash
with parameters
SPM uh this is the logic given how we
want our output to be demonstrated in
certain value or how the hash can be
generated rated the particular formula
uh how you can get the hash value of
your you know uh
string so the question is you are given
a string and the
integers uh and you have to return the
first substring of that string of length
uh given to you here it's K the test
cases will be generated such that an
answer always exists we are going to
copy the course and mention all the
specifications mentioned here here in
their chart GPD console so that it gets
all the
specifications the code
and so I have copied the code and and
paste it over here now let's check for
indentation that's fine let's remove
class my
class
and again it faces a type error so let's
move on to the next question again we
saw that CHP was not able to solve this
particular question coming back to our
list the next question in list that we
are going to cover is partition array
into two arrays to minimize some
difference let's quickly search for that
question partition array
to two
arrays again this question is from heart
category and the success rate is even
more low so let's have a look at the
question first it's partition array into
two arrays to minimize some difference
that is generated as the
output we can see that there are three
constraints so now quickly quick off Cy
this question and see if it is able to
solve this question or not first we have
to create a new
chat
copy all the constraints
let's see what chat jity has to say for
this particular
question let's ask it to generate a code
this time it has only generated the
logic not exactly Logic the approach
that they are going to follow or anyone
can follow to solve this
question let me ask if it can generate a
code
it's definitely taking longer time to
generate this code okay here is the code
which is possible python
implementation and
uh okay the code is generated and uh
it's mentioning that the code takes in
an input an array of an integer called
nums so basically uh it's explaining
that what it actually it's doing which
is is pretty much explained in the
question itself that what exactly it
needs to function like and what will be
the variables and what will be the
inputs and how it needs to be segregated
to uh obtain our Optimum
result
so let's copy
this
and paste it over here again like I said
we can see that it's generating you know
uh
again we could see
that pass self
parameter
okay and
then attribute error let's quickly copy
it paste it over here
see what CH GPD has to say about it
okay that you have seen that after
placing the error it's giving that error
message you're seeing suggest that
there's a problem with the function name
in your code so the error message is
indicating that there is no function
called minimum difference within the
solution uh also I have seen that apart
from the function name it doesn't have a
self parameter so let me just write it
down
self
argument
in apps wait let me copy it that will be
better
and write
a new cod with
it let me see if it can generate a new
code this
time oh yeah it has a GRE sure there is
an example and here's the code so I have
copied
this and and pasted
over see any such huge difference in the
syntax or the logic of the code but yeah
we can definitely think of running now
let's run this
code me copy it and paste it over here
again an error has prompted out I don't
know how uh valid
code we'll get after projecting this
error over here in chart
GPD so yeah definitely considering the
error message you are seeing is
indicated that the function is returning
INF which is not a valid value for the
expected return type
integer so in the base case where I and
J are both zero the value of is set to
float which is positively Infinity
however the expected output is an
integer so this valid this value is not
valid so again considering this change
the Char is giving a new code so let us
see how valid this new code
is okay I can see that it has changed
logic over here instead of float INF it
has changed it has uh written a new
syntax a new logic over there now and
also J gu guarantees that this may solve
the issue of returning INF as the value
let's see how accurate chart GPT here
is
now we have pasted the
logic uh yeah
as oh sorry I need to remove these two
lines now let's quickly run this program
okay so now as you can see it could only
pass one test case but not the first two
so there's no point of submitting this
code as we can see that the logic for
this code or this code as a whole is
not well moving on next in the list we
have
is longest common subar now let's see
longest
common
subpath so this question also comes from
category of hard questions and the
success rate is 27% now let's see what
this question demands actually now let's
quickly copy this question with all the
constraints and whatever apart from
example is left on the screen we need to
copy it as you can see over here you
cannot just miss miss out on any
specifications talking about the
constraints
copy and paste now
enter giving the approach to solve this
question which is dynamic programming
approach okay we didn't got any code
over here so let's
try that if it can present a
code okay I asked to write a code for
this and yes CHP has definitely agreed
to provide me a code for it uh CHP is
done with its explanations I'll uh type
it out and wait for the new code which
will contain self as a parameter that
it's this scode is pretty similar to the
previous one it's just that it's using
the self argument the function as it was
mentioned by me so let's quickly copy
this
code paste it over here check for the
indentation
run this
code I should be any okay I spoke too
fast here we have another error let's
see what charp has to say about
this the list index out of range error
is likely occurring on line 10 because
the indices I and J are being properly
bounce checked before being used to
access elements in the path and dprs
okay so we have found a new code let's
quickly copy this code and see if this
code is capable of you
know eliminating the errors we probably
found cck copy and paste
let me check for the
ination done and
run then we got a error over here even
though after providing so many
specifications and criterias and errors
and conditions yet chat gbd is not able
to provide a perfect solution for the
code uh moving on to the last question
of our list that is going to be uh sum
of total strength of wizards hopefully
this question does some magic for Chad
GPT and prove itself lucky for chat GPT
graph for this video because for now we
can see it's a 50/50 scene uh half of
the question chat GB was able to provide
Solutions with and half of the questions
chat G couldn't actually figure out what
uh needs to be done even the logic and
approach was correct still the
implementation of the code was not
correct so let me search for
this question sum of
total strength of wizards again a hard
category question so let's have a look
at the question
first let's quickly copy this
question uh create a new
chat paste it over here
and uh look for constraints now that we
have copied it paste it and
enter it's giving an approach how you
can actually uh think of a solution for
this particular question chargeability
has not generated any code uh let me ask
for it
okay so here's an example again they
have implemented the code in Python now
it is also giving a note that the
approach is valid only if we allowed to
modify the original array and also we
are not working on down over
menion and then write this code so let's
see if it can do it with self
argument okay so yeah there's an example
it's generating the code okay so let's
see what's the update with the
code
okay this
R let's
add
solution and run the
code so there's a runtime error let me
see why
this
error and paste it over
here what charity have to say the error
message solution object has no attribute
mod suggest that there is a class Nam
solution and the code is trying to
access an attribute named mod on an
instance of that class but attribute
doesn't exist we probably uh need to
make more specification and if it still
doesn't works then it clearly classifies
that charge doesn't takes every point or
a classification uh you know in
consideration uh which
ultimately uh you know reflects on the
solution the new code is here let me
quickly paste
it
okay let's try running this code let's
see if this
works try running it
again and it has a runtime error I was
unable to solve one more question now
that we have tried and tested a huge
spectrum of questions from Deep code on
chat GPT we can conclude that though
chat GPT is an amazing tool with the
bright future it still has its own
limitations and maybe it is not ready to
replace humans or compete with human
brain
these questions were picked from a list
of frequently asked questions for
interviews and examinations chat GPT
does have a potential to generate Logics
and approaches for the code in an
effective manner but still its ability
to analyze the question is weak as
compared to humans as we know these
questions are there the success rate
just shows that a proper solution to
exist for these questions but still even
after multiple attempts chat GPD was not
able to find the correct answer but we
can also give chat GPD the benefit of
doubt that it's still still it's in in
its initial phase and still there are a
lot of aspects that need to be worked on
so probably in future CH GPT can take an
upper hand over this but for now Char
GPD needs to do a lot of work for these
situations on that note we present you
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning elevate your professional
journey by enrolling in this AI ml
course present it through a partnership
between perue University and IBM hurry
up and enroll Now find the complete
course details from the link mentioned
in the description box below we start
with our
project and for that first we'll create
a
folder in Python
projects and name it
as
telegram Port using chat
JB okay and inside this we'll open the
cont prompt and open our ID that is I
would be using the visual studio code
and you can use any ID that you have
hands
on and
now we will go back to our chat jpd and
we'll start here but before that uh
let's talk about telegram board so a
telegram board is a program that
interacts with users VI the telegram
messaging app uh the prerequisite is you
should have a telegram account and boats
can be used for a wide range of purposes
such as customer support news delivery
and even games and chj so chj is a large
language model trained by openi that is
based on gbt 3.5 architecture and J gbt
is capable of generating humanik
response to text based inputs making it
a great tool for building chat
boards and now if we talk about
prerequisites you should have a telegram
account python install on your system
and we need a python telegram board
library that I will show you what to
install and that chat J will tell us
like what to
install so we'll just ask CH
J to
create telegram
boort
using
python okay so it says error we'll just
refresh the page
and ask again create telegram
board using python okay I see
but he States so create a telegram board
you need a
telegram talking to the board father
yeah we have to go to the board father I
will show you guys how to do that
install the required libraries next you
need to
install okay and write this
code
okay so in this
script they have started with the start
function
so it will just say us
hello when it would be started
okay so we'll add some more
functionalities
and we will ask uh where to find the
your API token here so I know like we
have to go to the board father but we
will ask chity
also where can we
find the rate open
so it states that to get to telegram V
AP token you need to create a new boot
by talking to the board father on
telegram open telegram and search for
board father okay and send the board
father message that is/ newb and the
board father will ask you for the name
of the board and it will ask you about
the username and the fifth is the boat
father will then generate a token for
your boat this token is a string of
characters that uniquely ident
identifies your boat on telegram so keep
this token secure and I will also blur
it so you guys won't be able to see it
okay so moving to our
telegram we'll just search Bard father
here and you can see this is the board
father and we'll just click on
start and they asked the jge asked us to
right SL new board we'll just click on
this and we'll
get so all WR a new board how are we
going to call it please choose a name
for the
board so
right simply
learncore
new Bo
okay good let's choose an username
so
[Music]
simply
learn 1
onecore Port and it states that that
user name should end in boat so we have
to end it with Bo and you could see the
token here and here you can just access
your
board
so we'll get back to our ID and create a
new file and I will name it as new. py
only or you can name it as board. py or
anything you want we'll get back to
our uh chity but before that first we
need to install the library for that you
can go to the command prompt or you
could use the terminal of your
ID that is
uh in Visual Studio code you you could
use the terminal to install the
libraries you could see that the
requirement is already satisfied as this
library is already installed on the
system so moving back library is
installed and now we'll copy this
code and paste it
here and we will just change the token
we'll go back to board
fur we'll copy this
token come
back and paste it
here
okay now we will run this and see
whether our board is working or
not so it has successfully executed
we'll get back to our board further and
just click on simply on one one board
so we click on
start and see it says hello I'm your
board so it's working fine so if we
write
hello it won't respond as there are no
functionalities so we will ask jity to
add
functionalities please add some
more
functionalities and
response to the
port let's
see so sure here's an example of how you
can add some more functionality
so the put updat dispatcher
okay Define the help command
Handler okay
so CH J has defined three functions that
is Eco and what does eco do it will just
give you the same thing what you give to
the board or what you write to the board
caps that he has also declared a help
function and in which you can see like
what functionalities does the board have
and the Caps will do it will convert the
message to all caps Eco uh e the message
back to you it will give you the same
message SL start it will start the board
and/ help to get
help and
now unknown uh if there's something you
ask out of these things it will just say
sorry okay I will let you guys
understand this code also but first
we'll see whether it's working or
not so for that we have pasted it here
and we'll paste our API token
again so I pasted it here now uh first
we will close this terminal and get a
new terminal and then run the
program we'll get back to the board F
and this is our board so we'll just
write
slash
start and it says hello I am your
board
now we'll
say hi to the
bot so okay it's not
responding okay we just close the
terminal and we have pasted
the keys also
okay run it
again now we'll see whether it's working
on
not
start
I so the code is not
working just see theod
again okay uh here we don't have any
response to I or hello so what we'll do
we'll use the help and to call the help
what we have slel so these are the
commands for what it will
respond so we'll use slash
help okay now you can see that SL start
to start the board that we have done
help and
Eco e the message back to you so we'll
write hi don't write back so we'll write
slash equo
High then he has given us the output
that is high so we can write slash
EO how are
you so it has given you back and same we
have slash caps so we write SL caps and
we'll write something in small GS that
would be
greatly
built okay now you can see it has
returned in
caps so you can add some more
functionality to it and before that I
will get you guys understood the code
so now we'll see what does this code do
so first we have imported the necessary
modules that is the classes from the
python telegram board library that we
will need to create our board so telgram
contains the main board class while
updator command Handler message Handler
and filters are classes that we use to
handle incoming updates and messages
from
telegram okay now these are like uh we
have created an instance of the board
class that is using our telegram board
API token as well as an updat instance
that will continuously fetch new updates
from Telegram and pass them to the
appropriate handlers and we have used
context equal to true that tells the
updator to use the new context based API
introduced in version 12 of the Python
telegram board library and we also used
a dispatcher object that will handle
incoming updates
after that we have created a start
function and passed update and context
so we have defined a function that will
handle the start
command and the update parameter
contains information about the incoming
update from tegram while the context
parameter contains some useful methods
and objects that we can use to interact
with the telegram API in this case we
have used uh context. port. send do uh
sendor message to send a message to the
chat with the ID specified by update.
effective chat.
ID and after that we have created a help
function so we use a multi-line string
to define the help message which
contains a list of available commands
and then we have used the context.
board. sendor message to send the help
message to the
chat and after that we have the Eco
function so we use context. arguments to
get the message sent by the user after
the SLO command so to use this we have
to use the SL EO and after that we have
to write the message and then use join
to join the message back together to a
single string we then uh we have use the
context. board do send message to send
the message back to the chat then we
have caps so this function defines that
will handle the Caps command and we have
again used the context to arguments to
get the message sent by the user after
the/ caps command and then the we have
used the upper function to convert the
message to all gaps and then we have
used the context Tob do sendor message
to send the message back to the chat
then we have unknown
function that is this function defines
that will handle any command that the
board doesn't recognize so we have used
text. port. send so it will just say
sorry okay so these are the start
Handler help Handler Eco Handler and
caps Handler so these are the
commands and we have the we have added
the ADD handl and to start the bo we
have used update do startor poing so
this is how we have created the board
with the help of python and J
so we are done with the project you can
add more functionalities also to the
board you can just ask CH JB to get more
functionalities to play music in the
telegram board or you could just ask him
how to send messages to a particular
user by the boat only and you could
also send media files ask the media
files from the board and you can train a
fully board by the help of Chad jpd and
this is called Chad jpd scripting so
with the help of Jad GPT you can just
ask him and he will guide you with all
the code and processes you just have to
like make them in a sequence and use
them to full of your
use so for that first we will open the
command
prompt and run the file Main for that we
write the command go run main. go so
this is the file that is written in the
go language and we going to run with the
command go run main. go for that you
need to have goang install on your
system so I will guide you with all the
process but currently we seeing the demo
so here this command will generate a QR
code that will scan with the device
which we want want to integrate the chat
GP on so we'll wait for the file to get
executed and after this we will execute
the server.py file and that will open
the chat JP on the Firefox browser you
can also use other browsers that is
chromium and other if you want but we'll
use Firefox to skip the onstep
verification that chat jity ask us
whether if we are a b or a human so
we'll run the file again as there was
some
error so this time yeah it run perfectly
now we'll take the device and open
WhatsApp on it in which we want to
integrate the chat jpd so I'm using one
device to just capture this QR
code so this is the device and you can
see that my device has captured this QR
code
and you can see here that WhatApp me
Meo it has been activated so now we'll
run another file that is server.py file
and that is the python file for that
we'll open the command prompt again and
that would be another command prompt and
to run that file we'll write the command
Python server.py
and you can see
in the Firefox browser chat jpt has
opened and I have logged in already so
it didn't it didn't ask me to log in
again now we'll take another device and
we'll message on the mobile device which
has been integrated with the CH
jity so from this device I will write
hi and you can see on the screen that
chat gy replies hello how can I assist
you today and the same you could see on
the WhatsApp chat so today we will ask
chat JP what is the capital
of India so you can see that the chat J
is typing the capital of India is New
Delhi and it has been responded to our
mobile device so this is
how we can integrate chat JP on a
WhatsApp and this would be the simple
tutorial in this you don't need to code
any uh this there would be another
tutorial if you know what's behind the
code or what behinds the integration
part so you could watch that video and
know how we have integrated but in this
tutorial I will guide you with how to
download the files and how to run the
files and how you can integrate chat J
on your device to start start
integrating CH jpd on our device so for
that first you have to download this
repository and it contains some files
and I will upload some more files here
you just have to download it download
the zip
file and after downloading
it you just need to extract it in a
folder
so we'll extract in C drive in Python
projects mainly we create the folder
here only so here we'll create a
folder okay integrate CH whats mean or
yeah right
integrate chat GP that's it so inside
this folder we'll extract the files and
I think it's been done so we'll just
visit C drive uh python projects and
inside it we have integrate
chargeability and we have these two
files so to run these two files what you
need is you need python install leer
system and goang install leer system so
I hope you guys know how to install
Python and goink if you don't I will
just give you a quick
tutorial so to download the python you
just need to visit the python.org
website and move to the download section
and you will see the download the latest
version for Windows you just need to
click that and the download will start
for you the package has been downloaded
so I will provide you the link on how to
download the
python in the description box and also
the link for the GitHub repository so
you don't have to search it anywhere
also you can search it on the browser
just write integrate CH in WhatsApp and
abisara you will get the GitHub link and
just write GitHub also in the search bar
you will just redirect it to
this and now you have downloaded the
python so just open the exe file
and start with the installation so you
can choose at python. EXA to path you
can choose
that
and customize installation and just cck
on the python test
suit and the next you can add the python
to environment variables so you have to
take both these options and then you
will click on the install as I have
already installed it so I won't need to
install it again you just need to click
on the install button and here you will
get the python installed
okay and the other thing you need is
goang go language so to download it you
have to go sorry you have to go to its
official website and go to the download
section and here you will see the
Microsoft Windows as I'm working on the
Windows operating system so I will
download for the windows I've already
download it and installed it so you guys
can download it and I will show you like
this is simple how to install go you
don't need to add anything so it's been
downloaded here to guide to the
installation okay so we are just waiting
for the setup to be initialized so that
we can install it
now you can see the next button is
available just click on that and a
previous version of go programming is
currently installed yes you can see that
it's already installed so you don't need
to do anything in installing the go
language just click on install and it
would be installed for you so I won't be
installing it again as I already
installed on my device so moving on now
what we'll do first we'll run the
server. pyi
so for that we will go to the folder
where we have extracted our files and
here we will open the command prompt and
run the file server.py so to run a
python file we have to write the command
Python and then the name of the file
that is server and its extension that is
py so we have initiated
that okay uh Firefox is already running
as we have
not closed what we have opened for the
demo uh I think
uh it's an error I
will
again run the Comm prompt I will just
close the previous command
prompts yeah I have closed them now I
will open the new one and you should
open the command prompt the new command
prompt after installing the Python and
the code language I will also assist you
in installing the GCC compiler because
you would be needing that for go
language so first
will run the server
file so you could see that by running
the python server.py file you could see
that the chat jpd has opened up in the
Firefox browser so I will show you the
code what we need for that you need to
install the
flask system OS modules playright
module and here in the 16th line you
could see that we have used Firefox you
could use chromium for Chrome but the
cas is you need to do the one step
verification that is the capture thing
for like
initializing the chat jpd but we don't
need that so we are using the Firefox so
you should have Firefox on your system
now what I want you to do is just
install these modules as if you if these
modules would not be installed on your
system it would show an error it would
give you an error in the command prompt
only as I've already installed them so
it's not giving me any
error so I will tell you the commands to
install them
[Music]
so to install flask you can just write
pypi space flask in any browser and it
will direct to the
website so you could open the first link
that would be pypi dog and this is the
command pip install flask so you can
just copy that and open your command
prom first we'll create it control
C
and now you could see that we are in the
folder integr cre Char jpd and here you
could paste this command and press
enter it states that that the
requirement is already satisfied as I
have already installed these modules and
the other module you need is play right
so just copy the command go to your
command prompt and paste this
command and press enter it will be
installed for you and another module you
need is virtual environment so just copy
this and paste in your command prompt
and another module you need
is the OS module
OS Sy system uh and we'll open the
pypi that is the official website the
PIP command website and you just copy
the command go to your command prompt
paste the command and press enter and
this module would also be installed for
you guys and now you have installed the
go language the Python language and the
modules you need to run the server.py
file now what you need to do is run the
go file but before running the goang
file what you need is GCC compiler so to
download it I will provide you the link
for the GCC or you could just see here
I'll provide you the link in the
description box below you could just
click on that
you would be directed to this page just
click on this release that was 24th May
and what you need to download is this
64+
32bit just download it and as it gets
downloaded just open
it and click on the create
button and after that the second option
then next and the directory you want to
install in
as I already installed
this I will
[Music]
choose the C directory
only and
see I
would install in Python projects
okay okay didn't took the
folder in
see sorry canel
it in Python projects and in the same
folder that was integrate CH
JB okay so I'll click on
next no time to installer yes I want to
install here and when you click on
install it would get installed for you
guys I've already installed
it and the process started so it will
get installed
again so now what you have to do is you
have got the all the requirements to
integrate the chat jity on WhatsApp that
is all the modules for the server.py
file and the main. go file for that you
have installed the go language and the
GCC compiler so you could run both the
files and for
that we will close the command prompts
and open the new command
prompts and this is
a folder so we will open one command
prompt here
sorry and we have to open different
command prompts for both the files for
the uh goang file and the python file
okay so we will open the command prompt
here
and now to run the goink file we need to
write the command go space run space the
name of the file and the extension that
is main. go and we have executed the
file and this file will provide us with
a QR code and we'll scan this QR code
from our first device in which we want
to integrate the chat jpd and before
that we will run our another file that
that is server.py file and for that
we'll open another command
prompt and to run this
command to run this file we'll write the
command python space the name of the
file that is server and the extension
py so we'll see whether a QR code is
generated or
not and I can
see that it's link
to the previous device as we have done
in the demo so we haven't logged it out
so I will check with the device
yeah it's been active so I will just log
out from that
device and run it
again or I will open another command
prompt to run the goang file
again so to run
it we'll open the command prompt and
write the command CMD for that and here
we'll write the command to run the go
file and we have done
that and if we see the server. py file
yeah it has been perfectly
executed but we not able
to yeah our jity is running fine now
what we have to do
is use our first device to scan this QR
code so that J jity gets linked to our
first device and then we'll use another
device
to chat with the chat
jpd so now we have opened our first
device and open the WhatsApp and click
on the link
devices and
here we scan this QR
code and you can see that it's loging
in now it's logged
in and now from the another
device we'll ask a query to
char and we will ask chity to write a
code to add two
integers and that to
python so we just misspelled python but
we hope that are CH JPY understood that
so here we can see that the J Code the
command and it
has and a good example show here's an
example code to add two integers in
Python so you can see that chj has been
integrated and we'll
see it response yeah we got the
response and now we'll ask another
question and that would be
what is the currency of United
States let's see what it responds the gr
of United States is the United States
dollar it is the most commonly used
currency in international transaction
and in other words primary Reserve
currency so we can see that t it writes
all the lines what
say it's been executed on the browser
and after it completes or it stops
generating the answer it sends it to the
whats
chat so here we are done with a
project now you guys have understood how
to integrate chat jpt with WhatsApp and
what you have done is we have downloaded
the repository and we have to extract
all the files that are present in the
repository I will update all the files
you just have to extract them into a
folder and then run the main.go file and
the server.py and before executing these
files you need to have goang and python
installed on your system and for the
python you need some modules that we
have seen that is the playright module
the flask module the OS system module
and the virtual environment module so we
have seen how to install them and when
you will just execute the file on the
command you would get errors if these
files or modules are not installed on
your system and for goang we have
installed the GCC compiler and after
installing all these requirements then
you have to just run both the files and
when you run the goang file you will get
the QR code just scan it with your
device on which you want to integrate
that jpd and after that from any device
you can just message on that number on
which you have integrated the J jpt and
the J jpt Will answer all your queries
we are going to automate WhatsApp using
python by pyot kit library and with the
help of chat jbd and before starting I
have a quiz question for you
guys and your question is how much did
meta that is formerly Facebook spend to
acquire WhatsApp in 2014 and your
options are your first option is dollar
$10 million second option is $19 million
third option is $20 billion and the
fourth option is $21 billion please
answer in the comment section below and
we'll update the correct answer in the
pin comment you can pause the video give
it a thought and answer in the comment
section so moving
on now we'll move to create our
project so first we will create a folder
for a
project and for that we will will create
a folder in Python
projects and we name it as automate
WhatsApp using chat jbd
okay and inside this we'll open the
command
prompt and open our
ID that is we want to automate the
whatsap using Python and with the help
of CH jity we won't write the code on
our own we will ask chat gbd to automate
it we will create the file and name it
as Main
py and now we'll move to chat jpd
and ask chat jity to write a code to
send messages through WhatsApp using
Python and the pivot kit
Library so we'll give a command send
message
through WhatsApp
using Python
and pivot
kit let's see but chat CH responds to us
and we have also created the automate
WhatsApp using python video I will just
link it in the I button you can check
that out and we'll see
what chat jpd tells us
okay country code
message minutes yeah it could work
and first you need to install the pivot
kit
Library by running Pap inst private kit
in your terminal or command prompt okay
replace Target phone number with the
Target phone number you want to send the
message to country code with the country
code of the Target phone number message
with the message you want to send r with
the r in 24hour format and you want to
send message and minute with the minute
you want to send the message okay for
example yeah okay
all right so we'll copy this
code
and
paste in our ID but before that first
you need to install the pivot kit
library and for that you can go to the
command prompt and write the
command
pip space install
Space by V kit and press
enter it states that the requirement is
already satisfied as I already installed
this module and you can install it by
writing the simple command and you'll
get it installed and if you face any
error installing it just comment down
and we would be very happy to resolve
your queries
okay
so as Jad jpd States we'll just enter
the things it want from us so it's
asking the Target phone number and the
country code without plus
sign
okay so here we'll just
WR all the things but uh as you can see
it has also given us an example to
see and work on the code so
here we just clear
it I will write the phone number to whom
I want to send the
message so it would
be and I would just blur this number so
you guys won't be able to see okay and
here we'll just add the country
code and that is without plus
sign
okay so my country code
is you can search it that is I live in
India and the message I want to send to
him is
hello how are
you and
now we'll set
the hour and minute so the current time
is
15:14 so we'll set
16
okay we'll save
this and run
it so it says that the country code
is
missing so we'll
just copy the error and give it to chat
jpd as we are taking the help of chat
jpd in this video so he has given us the
code so we'll just provide the error to
him let's see what it states if it's not
able to resolve this then we will
resolve
it country code the phone number you're
trying to send
okay this and the country code is 912
send the message correctly you need to
make
sure
okay 1 2 3 4 5 6
7
mention the person the provided phone
number is this and the country code is
91
okay you need to make sure that country
code is prefix to the phone number like
this
2 three four five six S8
n
okay okay we don't have to make a Str
yeah
now we'll run it again
okay it's a string
only so I will write the phone number
again
this 3
okay now we'll
see
and what I will
do I will write the country code here
we'll save this and the time is 1517 now
so we just turn it to
1518 save this and run it
so our code has been executed
successfully that is in 202 WhatsApp
will open and after 15 seconds message
will be delivered so we just have to see
that we have enter the time as
1518 is the seconds available
for the code to get executed yeah has
open the
WhatsApp it will take time as my
WhatsApp has loads of chats and
contacts yeah I have to scan
it don't
think it would be a l we have reached
the
1518 yeah have scanned
it let's see if it will deliver the
message or not else we have to change
the time
so we just have to wait for 15
seconds let's see
okay just stop the
terminal and run it again
4521 so we will save this and run it
again so it states that in 85 seconds
whatever will open and after 15 seconds
message will be
delivered so we'll get fast forwarded
here so we are still
waiting let's see then it will open the
WhatsApp
okay it states that the phone number
shared by URL is in inv
valid okay I'll just check the phone
number
[Music]
again okay I entered the wrong phone
number sorry
guys so I will just update the time
again and it would be 15 22 we'll make
it fast we'll run
this okay it say that the cold time must
be greater than so we'll right 1523 save
it we will make the time is
1527 save it and run
it okay it St that and 40 seconds
WhatsApp will open and after 15 seconds
message will be
delivered it has opened the
WhatsApp and it has started the
chat okay it has written the
and we have send it to hello how are
you that's
good on that note we present you
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning elevate your professional
journey by enrolling in this AI ml
course present it through a partnership
between Pur University and IBM hurry up
and enroll Now find the complete course
details from the link mentioned in the
description box below see how chgb can
help you to make a great app so here we
have chbt
okay you can write here chat.
openair.com so here I will ask to chat
gity what is chat gity so I will here
write what is
chat
GPT so here you can stop generating if
you want to okay I will stop generating
okay so chat bit is a conversational
artificial intelligence model developed
by open a it is based on the GPD Genera
pre and transform architecture
specifically GPT 3.5 which is at
Advanced language model so GPT 3.5 is
trained on a massive amount of Text data
to generate human like response to wide
range of prompts and question you can
ask anything to chat
gbt
okay after coming
[Music]
chat
GPT software
developers are
safe software developer jobs are
safe like me ask see yes after the
introduction of chat gbt and similar
language model software developers still
have important roles and their jobs
remain revent while AI models like chat
gbt can generate text and provide
automated response they have limitations
see they have limitations chat gity have
limitation and cannot replace the skills
and expertise of human software
developers so here is a few reasons why
softare Developer jobs remain valuable
okay so here are the few reasons so you
can ask anything to chat gbt so what we
will do we will create a small small
gaming app okay so here I will
write uh let's make first Tic Tac do
okay so here I will write
give me the
code for
pick T
to
game see it will give you the step by
step jjb will explain you everything see
this board then player check columns
check diagonals play game everything see
please check for the winner play
game I see to play the game simply run
the python script players will take
turns entering the row column numbers to
make their moves the game will okay so
what I will do okay first I will ask the
steps to make a game tic tac to
okay give me these steps to make game
take Ty
see first it will uh we will ask for the
steps then we will ask for the
code CH can make your app in 2 three
minutes in Just 2 three minutes small
small app in two 3 minutes okay see what
what is the first step set up the game
board create a data structure to
represent the Tic Tac to board this can
be 3x3 Grid or nested list with initial
empty values okay for example this this
then second is the print the game board
write a function to display the current
state of the board on the screen this
will help player visualize the game and
the third is get player input prompt the
player to enter their moves accept the
input for the rows and columns where the
players want to place their symbol X or
zero okay or you can change the value X
or Z whatever cross right okay update
the board after receiving the player
input update the game board with their
move make sure to validate the move and
check if the selected position is empty
okay then check for the winner then
check for it is draw what then alternate
turns okay then repeat two to 7 until
the game sends optional add additional
features we will first we will make Tic
Tac to uh what you can say a simple Tic
Tac do then we will add the additional
features on this okay using chgb only
okay
so I will
write provide me
the ti
T
to game
code what we will do we will uh open the
visual studio and copy it
directly okay see current player is X
then o
see current player row the second player
switch
player okay what we will do we will copy
it from here and we will open the visual
studio that new file I will write here t
t
to.py okay Enter I will save it so here
I will directly copy the
code where is my code oh it's it comes
in
okay copied this
also copy the whole
thing okay I have to remove this or I
can make it you know
comment yeah so let's try to run it what
terminal says
see enter the row okay
two enter the column
two okay it made like
this okay what I will
do I will ask for the
GUI uh provide me
the T tag to game with with
GUI okay now the Tinker came Tinker is
python Library used for the GUI in
Python okay okay now uh we'll copy the
code and just paste it it will run okay
with GUI and then we will add the
additional features okay from here now
I'm copying the code now select all
replace with this code like here no
error no red sign so let me play it it
will run I guess no
problems okay what happened see as you
can
see we got the ti to gam okay so see
here x 0 x 0 x player X vins so let me
add the additional features in this so
what we will do we'll go to chat GPT
again we'll ask for the additional
feature see note the code above uses the
message box module from the Tinker for
displaying messages ensure that you have
compatible version to Tinker okay when
you run this code a graphical windows
will appear by 3x3 grip and this uh okay
players can click on the buttons to make
their move the game state will
okay okay update you can you not talk to
chat so I I will say
update my code with some good font and
scoreboard
scoreboard font score scoreboard and
color update my GUI code I can
write here is an update see right
certainly here is an updated version of
GUI code with improved font scoreboard
and color if you get error in this you
can ask to chat gbt
okay anything you are facing issue about
your code whatever it is you can ask
directly to chat
GPT see we created an App in like 2
minutes just in 2
minutes so chat gbt is making our life
easier okay let me copy this
code okay let's see the changes what
what CH
does
okay there's nothing changed I guess
player X me like this
cross
okay
okay uh I will write here see in this
updated code the font style has been
improved with the Bold aial font the
buttons have a custom background color
and the overall window and scard have a
different
color oh I didn't feel like this
I didn't feel like
this okay
so
[Music]
change uh
the grid style of the
game it's giving updating the boat see
to change the great of the same you can
modify appearance of the buttons and the
spacing between them is an updated
verion GI code with the modifi Gest
St it's just a little bit of time taking
that's it nothing else it's very useful
J you can create your app in 2 three
minutes
only okay
continue generating it's a half
code okay code is
copied let me select and paste it here
and check
see player x z player o zer
okay it's little bit different I
guess ma okay this one two three box why
these lines then okay who
cares play XS okay see the scoreboard is
updated
okay so this is how you can make your
Tic Tac Toe more
beautiful okay uh
let me write
here let me write here I want the black
and white boxes okay or colorful boxes
so
code provide me the code for the
colorful
boxes okay
okay here chbd wrote certainly here is
an updated version of the code with
colorful boxes instead of grid
lines
okay so wait waiting for the code update
code see in this updated code each
player's button X and O has a specific
color assigned to it the button colors
okay let me copy the code and paste it
here and run
it see the color is changed here I will
write c x and o x o x o x ler x v okay
so this is how you can make your app
more beautiful beautiful using
customization you can ask CH GPT
anything color style font or any
function anything you can ask and you
you can make your app more beautiful
okay so now let's move on to the next uh
game which I want a snake game okay
using p game we will make so here I will
write please
provide me the code of
snake game
using p game
python
okay everyone knows what is this NE
game or first you want to ask the steps
we can ask the steps okay after this I
will ask this
step okay so till then let's make a new
file of
snake game. p
y
okay let me close it see it's a
long code I guess just continue
generating now you can see the see the
food and all will come
okay you can ask anything like any
question any language question this code
sets up the basic structure for the
Snake Game using pame it includes a
functionality for displaying the snake
controlling this movement detecting
collision with the boundaries and food
and managing the score you can run the
code and play the snake game with P game
window feel free to customize see at the
end what chb feel free to customize and
enhance the game according your
preference okay that is what I was
talking
about you can change n number of times
you can ask any number of times for the
code new new code okay there is one why
this error is
coming import P game could not be
resolved P
lens what is this py lens okay let me
ask to CH GP
only what
is
vience p is a language server for python
developed by Microsoft it provides
Advanced language features including
code completion type
checking static analysis and code
navigation cap pil is built on the top
of language server okay let me give the
error
itself copy
message
okay I will write debug error
vience
okay uh make sure you have a p game
installed P game is already installed on
my okay install on python environment
open your command prom
terminal and run the following command
okay let me open the command
prom okay then what I have to
write let me copy the code and paste it
here what is
this okay emergency this this this this
this if P game is not installed install
you can reinstall by
running already installed I
guess ensure the Pence is using the
correct python inter verify that py is
config to use the same P which you have
installed by a game you can check the
python interpreter setting in your
code editor or ID which make sure it's
point to correct P environment where P
game is
installed okay
what I will do I will go to terminal and
here I will
write
P
store P
okay maybe it will be
helpful okay let me do this
what Char P install by
game okay successfully install new
pip some error of pame I guess okay
we'll run it online no worries
if it won't work in this I will run it
online okay you see the requirement is
already satisfying this this this this
so what we will do uh we will
open replate
okay we'll open replate and we'll create
the new
repple okay then
Python and creator
okay this is the same like you know one
of
the ID you can see okay then what I will
I will copy this P
code and paste it
here okay I will make a new file name
py okay on that I will copy the code and
I will run
it
okay that plate updating the package uh
the p and the P
game okay it's running the code is
running okay it's installing P
game okay let me run now
what happened what's the
error where's the
error okay
okay some hello from pame Community this
pame
F some game Loop module
file
68
okay okay we ask to chat GPT
snake
game cod
showing
better
okay
provide me
the snake game code
using python
gii this time from Turtle
okay let's
see because the pi games I don't know P
game is installed on my system it's not
working so we will leave
it okay we'll ask from this some good
GUI with some good GUI
see is is the head everything is there
the keyboard bindings from wsd or you
can up down left right the keys you can
use from use the both
okay continue
generating then the functions the pan
the snake body everything is here snake
head is like everything is here what you
want everything is here
see the code utilize the turtle module
to create the basic game with the snake
then moves collect food the the score
ised okay feel free
to let me copy the
code let me copy here
only and run
it see this is the
snake Okay this is the food this is the
score or high score okay I will uh run

GPD okay artificial intelligence large
language models and AI chat Bots have
come a long way and today we have many
AI language models which are helping us
throughout various domains few examples
are Microsoft's ring Google's Bard open
AI chat GPT Megatron T5 and many more
today we will be discussing about the
caliber of chat gbd and AI which can
leverage you and help you to build a
perfect Prof business so few of the
reasons that you need to consider are
the decision- making capabilities of
chat GPT and AI customer services that
you can offer through chat GPT and AI
chat GPT potential to create content and
its potential to leverage data analysis
and chatties and AI capabilities to
provide sales and marketing for you and
run automation for you we will discuss
each one of these in detail so the first
one is decision- making capabilities of
of chat GPT in terms of raw processing
speed chat GPT can analyze and generate
text at a rapid Pace capable of
processing and generating responses much
faster than a human can type or think it
can quickly access and retrieve
information from its pre-trained
knowledge providing intermediate answers
to suggestions therefore chat GPT excels
in processing and generating text at
higher speeds however it cannot be
directly compared to humans in terms of
decision making abilities however it is
proof that it is 90% accurate in
decision making whereas humans tend to
be accurate at a rate of 80 to 85% CH
GPT is anyways stronger in terms of
dision making at this case followed by
that moving ahead to the next reason
that is the customer service that Char
gbd and AI can help you with if you
compare a human the customer support
representative reads the customer care
compared to human the customer support
representative has to read a customer's
query analyze the problem and formulate
a response this process may take a few
minutes or more depending on the
complexity of the issue and
representatives typing speed right but
when you compare it with chat GPD the AI
power chatbot like chat GPD quickly
scans and comprehens the customer's
query it generates a response within
milliseconds providing intermediate
assistance as well so chbd is proficient
at providing customer services at a much
faster rate and it can also eliminate
you the cost of hiring training and
maintaining an entire Army of customer
services moving ahead we have content
creation if you are a startup company or
a company which needs content creation
for your product then obviously you
might end up hiring Freelancers or a
team of content creators right but
compared to humans chat GPD is
proficient at generating content and can
produce coherent and contextually
relevant text so you can even save money
by using the most powerful and fully
operational AI model to create more
versatile and highly qualified content
for you to avoid hiring Freelancers and
employees now moving ahead the next
reason is using AI models for business
data analysis AI can assist you in data
analysis by leveraging its computational
power and advanced algorithms to possess
and extract valuable insights from large
and complex data sets AI algorithms can
automate data cleaning pattern
recognition and anomaly detection tasks
enabling faster and more accurate
results AI models can also perform
Predictive Analytics identifying Trends
and making forecast based on historical
data additionally AI can facilitate data
visualization presenting information in
intuitive and interactive formats for
better understanding by automating
repetitive tasks and augmenting human
capabilities AI enhances the proficiency
efficiency accuracy and scalability of
data analysis procedures you can rely on
AI language model to extract transform
and load data and analyze your business
data generate reports draw projections
and make datadriven decisions to help
grow your company and this also Awards
you to hire and maintain a h huge Army
of data analyst which may produce some
of the other errors in real time right
and next reason is sales and marketing
chat GPD can leverage sales and
marketing efforts in the following ways
customer engagement chat GPD can engage
with potential customers in real time
answering their queries providing
product information and guiding them
through sales process it enhances
customer experience by delivering prompt

support chat gpt's ability to operate
Around the Clock allows for continuous

inquiries offer product recommendations
and resolve issues even outside regular
business hour improving customer
satisfaction and retention now instead
of hiring a team and manually marketing
your product on social media platforms
and spending thousands of dollars to run
paid marketing you can use AI models to
crack the algorithms and Market the
product to your target audience with
that let's proceed to the next reason
that is automating your tasks chat GT
can automate business procedures in the
following ways the first one being
customer service chb can handle customer
inquiries Provide support and resolve
common issues through automated chat
interactions it reduces need for human

when we host with that in mind let's
start with the elephant in the room that
is the chat
gbd chat gbd was released on the 30th of
November 2022 it uses the GPT llm to
elaborate llm is an approvation for
large language model and chat GPD is
globally available to its users using
the generative pre-trained Transformer
also called as chat GPT llm with one
trillion parameters as its variables
learned during the model training now
the Bing Microsoft was one of the
largest investors in open AI Bing is an
AI language model created in
collaboration with open Ai and publicly
released on the 4th of May
2023 Bing uses the same data set that
chat GP uses Bing has an H chart GPD as
Microsoft integrates its Prometheus with
about 13 5 billion parameters now next
up we have Bard B is Google's answer to
chat gbd with limited capabilities and
lukewarm responses it was released on
21st of March 2023 but initially started
off with Lambda llm with a caliber of
137 billion parameters Google's CEO ASAS
Bard will switch to pathway model named
as palm 2 llm with about 400 billion
plus parameters to take on chat gbd
head- onhe head in generating responses
and the application codes and programs
with the details discuss let's move
ahead to some of the important
parameters to be considered to discuss
the differences firstly user interface
and experience chat GPD has a simple and
subtle interface making it easy to
understand and get along with the usage
so chat gpt's user interface looks
something like this chat GPT has a
simple dog theme pH focusing on
providing users with high quality
language processing capabilities rather
than immersive visuals you can ask
questions get answers and even you can
ask to enhance or optimize the answer
according to your needs again user needs
to manually request chat GPD the other
hand Bing is more inclined towards
giving a blissful visual experience to
their users by choosing brilliant
background images colorful interfaces
and emojis so a typical Bing user
interface looks looks something like
this in addition to that it is backed up
by chat gpt's data set and prome llm to
help users with the best and- class
answers to their questions it even
delivers three different answers at the
same time creative balanced and precise
are the three variants and you can
choose the best ones which suits your
requests now lastly b b is a little
different from others unlike others B
just dumps the answers at once
Enthusiast call fast but it misses the
human touch of giving the answers in a
word by word typing manner yet similar
to Bing it manages to give you different
versions of the answers besides that B
has a decent interface and its logo
shines with multiple colors giving you
the feeling of B processing the data to
give you a better result now let's try
to ask a few most frequently asked
questions to part chat gbd and ping
let's ask with a simple one are you
friends
with chat
GPT and Bing you can see The Shining
logo of B and you have just seen the way
how Google B answers you it just Dums
the answer now if you go or if you ask
the same question to the other ones like
chgb and wiing let's see how they
respond and you can see you have other
drafts as well right so you can see
draft one draft two and draft three so
you can choose any ones which you feel
are more optimized and you know
deliverable according to your requests
right now let's go back to Ping right
now let's ask the same
question are you friends
with chat
GPT and but
see the word by word typing approach of
Bing and chity give you a little more
immersive feeling that somebody is
really talking to you right and you also
have the freedom of choosing the answer
wisely right so it gives you three
different options which are creative
balanced and precise right and on just
one single scroll you have the Bing
search open here right this is one other
good way of using Bing in the in case if
you have any questions that are
unanswered or which did not satisfy you
you can also go back to Bing and you can
manually search for the data and get the
information right now let's get back to
chat
gbd and here let's ask the same question
are you friends
with Bing and B
so that's how individual AI models
respond to each other and now let's get
back to the next point of discussion
which is what is the data or history
about the questions you asked or the
prompts you have opened that each one of
these
stores so this is about the conversation
history or the prompt that you have with
individual one of these AI
models first comes the chat gbd chat GPD
claims they do not store any data about
its interaction with its users but in
chat GPD it can access the proms and
questions you asked you can also export
your transcripts in chat GPD on the
other hand we have bing bing says they
do not have any history or promps of
your previous conversations as well and
lastly but B is a little mix and match
of both so what b does is it Stores Only
the prompts whereas in chat gbd when you
ask a question it will store the
question and the answer it gave you but
but it will only store the pr that is
the question you asked and not the
answer it gave to you so with that the
next point of discussion would be the
mobile version of each one of these as
of now Chad GPD hasn't released any of
the official mobile application version
version yet and on the other hand on
Bing it has just one click of a button
and you can click it and Bing Launches
on your mobile phone and Bing has a
mobile variant with similar and much
better Aesthetics that can get started
on a touch of an app launcher and lastly
we have B B has a similar approach to
its mobile variant Google has enabled B
usage in Google mobile application as
well and now comes the number of
questions asked disclaimer if you want
to work on a project presentation or
thesis choose your AI model wisely cuz
if you are close to wrapping up your
project and the AI model says sorry pal
you're out of your wishes Yes you heard
me right a few of these language models
have a limitation on the number of
questions asked on one single topic or
one single keyword or one single concept
let's look into details before we
proceed to the next part of this video
let's take a minute to hear from our
Learners who have experienced massive
success in their careers hey I'm sharar
Jal I live in Ontario Canada I have been
in it sector for the past 20 years I
recently took the professional
certificate program in artificial
intelligence and machine learning the
course has changed the way I look at
things and helped me back some amazing
freelance projects I started my career
in 1999 and over the years I have worked
with many companies my last tenor was
with IBM Canada my aim was to restart my
career and learn something that would
help accelerate my
career I thought artificial intelligence
can make me Future Ready the course in
artificial intelligence and machine
learning is provided by simply learn in
association with Purdue University which
is why I chose the course I did not have
high expectations from online course but
my experience was simply awesome the
quality of interaction within the course
was simply amazing the course faculty
was also very experienced and
knowledgeable after the course my
knowledge has grown manifold I have
immensely benefited from Python and
coding skills I am able to get some new
freelance projects also I am planning to
start an AI based startup with my friend
where I feel that the learning from the
course to be very helpful I am really
delighted and happy in my free time I
try to create meaningful content on
YouTube and I talk about new
technologies and what kind of courses
professionals should be taking along
with many other topics I definitely
recommend this course to everyone after
after all when it comes to new skills to
advance your career there should be no
compromise you should always learn from
the
B first comes chat GPD chat GPD takes 25
questions on a single keyword or a
single subject or a single topic of
discussion post that it refrains from
answering your questions same with Bing
it takes no more than 20 questions on
single key word or a single C topic or a
single concept but now comes
Brad Brad is a little different Brad
kind of said Stakes a little too high it
almost has no limits to your questions
you can ask any number of questions to B
and that can be a real deal breaker
lastly we will differentiate these AI
models based on their productivity yes
exactly we do know all these three
models are smart but how how smart
exactly how humanly are they how close
are they in convincing you with an
optimistic answer what's their potential
to judge a hypothetical question and
give you a balanced answer sounds
interesting right let's get started
first let's start with chat GPT so let's
say I want to learn Ai and machine
learning so obviously this should be
able to teach me that let's ask
it can you teach me
artificial
intelligence machine learning
brilliant it gave me a brief about
artificial intelligence machine learning
types of machine learning and deep
learning in one go and it also convinced
you here right yes as nii model I can
certainly help you with that right so
it's a good answer now let's try to ask
a little different one
or can it plan an Nary or can it buy me
a product online or can it do some uh
other things like booking me in Uber
right so let's try can
you
purchase an
online training
program for AI and ml
brilliant CHP knows its limits right as
an AI model I cannot directly purchase
online right it's giving you the brutal
truth here that's good and apart from
that it also gave you a stepbystep
procedure to buying your course do your
research check the curriculum check the
instr structor what's the format what's
the cost right a few parameters which
you might want to consider before buying
a course right so now let's try to
question the same queries to Bing so
since Bing and chat gbt share the same
training data set I could expect a
similar answer but let's see it is
taking a while I guess Prometheus is a
little slower compared to GPD okay there
might be a connection issue let's ask
the question once
again wow it's way too better than chbd
so it is even asking you details on if
you if you are looking for a specific
topic or a general overview let's say I
would need a general overview
I could straight away say Bing is a
little more smarter and productive
compared to chat jpd but still we have
one more Contender to compare with B
right so there might be again the
internet
connection now let's say we refresh Bing
once again and straight away ask the
second question what we had right that
is can you buy me a c
course online
course for
learning
artificial did gave me a good answer for
the previous question let's see what
kind of an answer it gives me now I'm
sorry but I'm not capable of making
online and purchases however I can find
you some online courses for learning AI
would you like me to search for some
options brilliant so this is a little
more optimized answer compared to chat
GPD 1's and it is also honest it does
know its limits fine it can help you
search for some online courses but again
uh chat GPD gave us some parameters to
consider right so I would give or I
would choose to to tie them up here they
are on the tie now our last Contender
that is B let's try to ask the same
questions to B so here is B now let's
try to ask questions to B let's see can
you teach
me machine
learning you can see the B logo shining
there now it should be dumping the
answer anytime soon yeah of course we do
miss that humanly Touch of giving the
answer in a word by word typing
way let's refresh and ask the question
again can you teach
me chain
learning this is a little too
straightforward I'm a language model and
don't have the capacity to help you out
so okay let's not give up here let's try
to ask the second question can you
purchase an
online training
program to
me to
learn machine
learning yes I can help you purchase an
online Pro program for machine learning
here are a few things that you need to
consider
good it's not being brutally honest here
it is saying it can help you out so
again what I intended to expect here was
you cannot just directly buy an online
program right you need some details
credentials and everything to purchase
so again it is sugarcoating the answer
and it is definitely giving you
suggestions similar to chat GP
but a little different which focuses on
your learning style level of experience
your budget good nice way to answer some
questions like this one so all these
three ones are brilliant and good in
their own way so it might be a little
difficult to declare who's the winner as
of now since the B AI model is going to
switch to Palm 2 and we are expecting
some updates to each one of these with
that we can consider currently they are
standing next to each other with similar
capabilities and better enhancement in
different fields so with that having
said we can conclude this session on
chat GPD versus Bing versus B and if you
would like me to answer the conclusion I
would say well it seems like we all have
our strengths and weaknesses at the end
of the day it comes to what users value
the most do they want a visually
appealing interface strong privacy
protections or the ability to with an AI
language model it's up to them to decide
so you are the viewers and you can
decide the winner of this particular
battle on chat GPT versus Bing versus B
so guys here we are in the GPT that is
chat GPT 4 version I have the premium
version that is I have GPT 40 gp4 GPT
3.5 I have the gp4 version and if I show
you my plan I have the plus
plan so here I will show you guys where
we can explore the gpds so this is a
section where we are having explore gpts
we click on that here is the whole
overview here are the topics that are
featured then if you click on writing so
these are the custom gpts so now I will
tell you what is a GPT and how do they
work so a GPT is a type of artificial
intelligence model that is designed to
generate human like text based on the
input it receives so it uses a machine
learning technique called Transformers
which allows it to consider the context
of all words in a sentence rather than
one at a time so this makes gpds
exceptionally good at understanding and
generating cerent and contextually
appropriate responses so these are the
gpts and what are custom gpts if I tell
you so these are all the custom gpts
what I told you was GPT that is the
whole GPT 4 version so so they are based
on Transformers now if I tell you about
custom gbts they are generative
pre-trained Transformers and are
tailored versions of the original GPT
models developed by open and these
custom models are modified to serve
specific task or Industries more
effectively such as legal assistance
medical inquiries or customer support So
by training on Specialized data sets
they can offer more precise and relevant
responses in their respective fields
so I will show you guys how you can
create a custom GPD also so I created on
the create section I'll show you guys
once again so this is a section you just
need to click on create I will show you
guys the whole process at the last of
the video after exploring the top 10
amazing gpds okay here you can create it
and you can here have the preview of the
custom GPD if you want to create
it okay so now if I tell you what the
benefits of these gpts so they offer
several benefits one is efficiency that
is it automates repetitive task and
handle multiple queries simultaneously
so if you click on chat
GPT and if you want to have some data
analysis you have to type the prompts
again and again for that we have a
particular custom
GPT that is
data
analyst think research anal analysis we
will move here okay this is for research
or I will tell you guys that's consensus
so this is the custom GPT that have all
the research papers all the studies
provided in it if I tell you guys in the
create section you could attach more and
more files if you attach files here data
and other related information it will
help you create the perfect custom GPD
so you don't have to write the prompts
again and again or automate you can
automate the repetitive task here number
two benefit what I can tell about is
scalability this assist in scaling
services without the need for
proportional increase in Human Resources
then comes the customization you can
tailor responses based on the specific
needs of a business or context then we
have the accessibility it improves
access to information and services by
providing another layer of interaction
so these benefits of gpts are the ones
that help you guys now we start with the
top 10 gpts that are prevailing now so
starting with number one that is cod
GPT so here is the Cod GPT you could see
here other gpts that are used for coding
purposes you could use any GPT so let's
start this or you could have another GPT
I will show you guys that is for
programming you just click on
programming and these are the top gpts
that are are prevailing in the
programming world so if I click on Code
Pilot so this has been rated 4.2 2
million plus conversations and rank
number one in programming so we click on
start chat now we are here with the
custom
GPT and you don't need to download any
GPT or you don't need to install any GPT
you just have to click on the export GPT
section and you would be accessible to
all the
gpts so here we have this Code Pilot so
what does this do is this GPT assist
users in writing and debugging code and
it provides programming guidance suggest
Corrections and can help with code
optimization for a variety of
programming languages and this gbd is
useful for both noce programmers needing
help with Basics syntax and for
experienced developers looking for
advanced optimization suggestions you
could see that he is suggesting some of
the proms that he can reply to and and
we will write some prompt and ask this
Code Pilot what he can
do so I will ask
him can
you write a
function in Python language and what it
should do is that should sort a list of
numbers so you could ask this GPT or you
could provide your code and if you want
to debug your code you can can just
provide the code to him and he will
debug for you so you could see that it
has provided the code for sorting the
numbers so this was one of the GPD now
moving to another we'll move to explore
GPT sections one again
and we have one most popular that is
canva so canva GPD assist users in
designing and editing visual content by
providing suggestions automations and
creative ideas tailored to the users
design need
I don't know why it's not
showing yeah this is the one Cana you
could see that it has been rated three
star 2 million plus conversations now we
click on start and you could have a
generic view
also like what this GPT do uh wait a
second I'll show you guys once again so
if you click on that you could read the
description here also that is
effortlessly design anything that to do
presentations logos social media post
these are the conversation starters here
and here are the capabilities that Reves
or takes actions outside of
GPT the ratings given by the
users now we'll start the chat and here
we will we could just ask him what they
are suggesting also I need a poster for
our online stores seasonal sale but they
have not specified what what their story
is
about or we can ask him that create a
series of Instagram post promoting an
upcoming music festival and including
vibrant colors and modern Design
Elements so we will go with their
suggestion only let's see what they so
let's create an ey
catching start creative Journey with can
but we will Design together today
okay so create a poster
for medical
online store you could specify like uh I
won't be talking about the prompts here
more how you can generate the good
prompts so for generating the good
prompts you can watch our another video
that is prompt engineering and for that
you guys have to do is you have to write
the full prompt that what you need to be
and what you need ched to do you need to
be more specific as you can see that it
has created the online poster but it's
not good looking or engaging which can
attract customers but it's okay like
with this prom you can get this you have
to be prompt
specific so this was our second GPD now
moving to third going back to explore
GPD
section here we will search for Del now
so Dal is very popular
nowadays think okay D was there only
it's the topmost only so it's an AI
program that is capable of generating
unique images from textual descriptions
and it Blends Concepts and styles to
create high quality images based on user
inputs so we can ask him to generate an
image of a futuristic cityscape at
Sunset blending elements of cyberpunk
and Art Deco Styles you could add
anything in the prompt what you need to
create so I will ask him that generate
an image
of a
futuristic city space at
Sunset you could add more things to
it be more specific and the custom gpts
will create the thing for
you so you could see that our D custom
gbt has provided the response to us so
these are the futuristic city at the
sunset you can download these images and
use them and you can give the credits to
GPD also so this was all about our third
gbd now mov to the next one and we will
see now web pilot this is also one of
the top most search and the recently
used like this browsing history that was
the recently
used so it has been rated 4.2 by the
users 800,000 plus conversations and # 4
in productivity Global so we'll start
the chat with it and and so what does
this GPT do this GPT helps users by
summarizing long web pages into concise
versions highlighting the main points
and crucial
information for example we
will have some simply learn
articles we'll provide the link
here we'll provide the link to web pilot
GPT and then we'll ask him to summarize
this article in around 100 or 200 words
okay
so we have paste the link here now we
will ask him summarize the
article in around 150 words okay so
let's see you could see here that it has
started taking the
action okay uh we made a mistake here
the link is about some story blogs it
didn't copy the article
link we will copy it again and paste it
here yeah now you can see that it
has go
link now we'll ask him
again as it has summarized a story Block
video what I have copied earlier I
think so you could see that it has
generated the response that the article
from Simply learn outlines the role of a
risk manager and and it has summarized
the article into 150 words so this is
the magic of web pilot GPD now coming to
number five so now move to the fifth GPT
and we will explore it from the writing
section this is the right for
me so this is the fifth GPT on our list
so what you can do with this is you can
have a right for me a tailored engaging
content with a focus on quality
relevance and precise word count so you
could ask him we will go for
the like what they have suggested the
prompts we have gone with that only so
you could see that how they're
writing and what English words they
using how their vocabulary so these kind
of gpts are collaborate made to get all
the content delivered with a great
understanding of vocabulary and the
content creation so with with that we'll
move to our next GPT that is 6
GPT and that will be diagrams so this is
one of my favorites so this tool creates
flowcharts mind maps uml chart Lo uml
workflow sequence ER database and
architecture visualization for code so
what does this do is it creates diagrams
and charts instantly from descriptions
aing in visual data presentation and
Analysis so if I ask him that
generate a flowchart
illustrating the software development
life
cycle with
stages and Key activities in each
stage so you could see that it has
started generating the response it will
create the diagram first it had all the
stages listed here and now he is telling
about the diagram syntax so it seems
that flowchart is not a supported
diagram type for rendering so is
fetching syntax that is so you guys so
here is a diagram what diagrams GPD has
created and you could view in the full
screen here download the PNG file if you
want to use this diagram and if you want
to see the code you could see here or
what theory part they have done behind
this diagram or what they have done for
creating this diagram that is they have
used the graph
here and you could edit the code also
here so this is the code written to
create this
diagram so this was all about our six
GPT now moving to the next GPT and that
would be around the data analysis
part uh not research and Analysis but it
would be around data
analysis I would search for you guys
that would be data analyst and I've used
this GPT many times and it's one of my
favorites so what does data analyst do
is so this jpd helps analyze large sets
of data providing insights performing
statistical analysis and making
predictions based on the data provided
I'll show you guys what it can
do so I think yeah this is the one I use
it's not showing any ratings or
something but yeah this one is good so
what we'll do is we will upload a file
so I must be having some Excel
files okay Excel data let's see what
this data
contains okay we'll open it
only can you
analyze the Excel
file and tell
me what it is
about you could draw graphs
bar charts or analyze data and got some
pivot tables with this GPT model you
could see that it has started
analyzing and I've used it many times
for generating my
reports so you could see that what it
has provided is this Excel file contains
two sheets with the following content so
sheet that is data 2 it has it includes
columns such as order date customer name
name so these are the things that are
provided in the sheet if you need to get
the code you could have the code here
and use this in your ID and it will
provide all the things what here GPD is
doing you can do in your ID so if I show
you guys what this file contains as okay
so this is the data so we have two
spreadsheets here one is data one is
data 2 and it has provided columns and
you can do the analysis further so this
was all about data analyst GPD now
moving to the next that is eth GPD that
is consensus so this we'll use we move
to education section and here we should
find that or else we'll search it this
is one of the most used GPD here so this
is the one that is you can ask the
research chck directly with the world's
scientific
literature so it8 in academic research
by locating relevant scholarly articles
papers and studies quickly and
summarizing their
findings so what we can ask him is we
can ask him find the recent
studies on the impact
of virtual
reality and on learning outcomes
in higher
education so it is asking for the
permission so we will grant the
permission to him that is always
allow and it has all the research papers
that are available on the net and you
would see that it has started providing
the response and these are the evidence
for this and he has mentioned the
research papers all the
articles that are that have the studies
so this is about the consensus GPT now
moving to the number nine and on number
nine we have Tex support advisor that is
taex
troubleshooting we'll move to explore
GPT
section and search
for tech support advisor
so this GPD provides solutions to Common
technical issues offering stepbystep
troubleshooting guidance so we will ask
him that my laptop is running
slow uh despite no visible running
application so what steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the
issues uh
despite no running application
so what
steps can I take to
diagnose and fix the
issue so you could see that it has
started providing the response like
check the task manager check for Mal
free up dis space and update your system
check startup programs so this is the
perfect support
Tech advisor as a GPD that can help you
diagnose any Tech related problem in
your laptop in your desktop or in any
device so this is the great GPD that we
have here so now number 10 on the list
is legal
adviser So This legal adviser helps
draft review and interpret legal
documents offering guidance on legal
terminology and
compliance so you could update any legal
document here and ask him what this is
about and what should I do this if you
go to any court hearing or something I
hope you not but if you have any
document you can update it here or
upload it here and ask this GPT what
this is about and what I can do to
counter it so I will ask him something
so I need a
or I need to draft
a lease
agreement for a residential
property okay so I will also ask him
that what closes should I
include to protect both the landlord and
the tenant
so you would see that it has started
generating the response that creating a
comprehensive residential lease
agreement is crucial and these are the
closes that you should include number
one is parties clearly State the full
names and contact information property
description lease term rent security
deposit utilities and maintenance use of
property occupancy limits pets access
and entry so this was about our legal
advisor GPT that was number 10 and guys
we have a lot of gpts in the explore GPT
section and you can create your own also
uh I told you about how you can create
that just go on the explore GPT
section and then click on
Create and here on the left side you
have a create tab where you can use
plain language to customize your own GPD
through prompting you just have to write
the prompt sve and it will do the task
for you and you also have a
configuration tab where you can provide
more information about the custom GPT
that is such as the name and description
what this GPD is about and what exactly
the GPD does and what it should not do
and when you make changes in the create
and configure tab you will see these
live updates in the preview window on
the right hand that is this and message
your GPT to accesses abilities you can
start messaging also and you can also
choose the capability that is web
browsing D image generation and you can
also upload the files that you want to
store data for a particular GPD you can
upload the files here
also so this is how you can create a new
GPD hello everyone welcome to this
amazing video on the open AI latest
model GPT 40 whether you are curious
about its underlying technology real
world applications or future prospects
this video covers everything you need to
know about GPT 4
so let's quickly understand what is GPT
40 GPT 40 is a big upgrade in open AI
smart Tech it's better at understanding
and talking like human than previous
version it's super good at task like
answering questions or writing stories
just have a look hey how's it going hey
there it's going great how about you I
see you're rocking an open AI hoodie
nice choice what's up with that ceiling
though are you in a cool industry sty
office or something well can you take a
guess at what I might be doing based on
what I'm showing you
here from what I can see it looks like
you're in some kind of recording or
production setup with those lights
tripods and possibly a mic it seems like
you might be gearing up to shoot a video
or maybe even a live stream yeah now it
can even understand pictures this makes
it even more useful hey chbt
hello there how's it going it's going
really well today I'd really like your
help solving a math problem I'm all ears
what math problem can I help you tackle
today so I'm going to write down a
linear equation on a sheet of paper and
I'll show you and then I love your help
working me through it but importantly
don't tell me the solution just help
give me hints along the
way got
it okay I see it h no I didn't show you
yet just give me help along the way one
second
whoops I got too excited I'm ready when
you
are so chat
GPT what equation did I write down there
ah I see it now you wrote down 3x + 1
equals 4 whether you are using it for
fun or work it's way better now it shows
that open AI is really good at making
smart stuff if we talk about model
evaluation as measured on traditional
benchmarks GPT 4 achieves GPT for Turbo
level performance on the text reasoning
and coding intelligence while setting
new H marks on multilingual audio and
vision capabilities so now let's move
forward to the demo part and now let's
explore the features of chgb 4 so as you
can see my phone screen is there so this
is the UI of Charity 40 here you can see
the model name
gp40 and gp4 GPT 3.5 so gp4 is for
premium version so as you can see here
this camera button you can upload the
files you can upload the picture you can
give the audio text give you can
chitchat with chat GPT okay so these are
some okay default prompts are there so
let's start with the this audio version
this new version okay so you have to
just click here so it will connect with
the open AI server so hi CH how are
you hi there I'm doing well thanks for
asking how about you I'm also
good that's great to hear is there
something specific you'd like to chat
about today yeah please tell me
something about gbd4
O gp4 is a language model devel veloped
by open AI it's designed to understand
and generate humanlike text based on the
input it receives gp4 is an improvement
over previous versions with better
accuracy understanding and generation
capabilities it can be used for a wide
range of application so CH GPT can you
please tell me how to become machine
learning
engineer sure becoming a machine
learning engineer involves several steps
one education start with a strong
foundation in mathematics especially in
areas like statistics linear algebra and
calculus a degree in computer science
data
science so this is how you can ask jgp
anything right so let's ask something
related to IQ let's check the
IQ so can you please tell me which is
the most spoken language in the
world the most spoken language in the
world by number of native speakers is
Mandarin Chinese it has over a billion
native speakers however when considering
the total number of speakers including
those who speak it as a second language
English often ranks at the
top okay so CH can you please tell me
like I want to create you YouTube video
on what is machine learning so can you
please help me with the content
plan sure here's a simple content plan
for your YouTube video on what is
machine learning one introduction one to
two minutes greet your audience briefly
introduce yourself and your channel
State the topic of the video what is
machine learning two what is machine
learning two three minutes Define
machine learning in simple terms
okay see this is how you can ask GPT
anything and all the file all the data
will come here okay see I asked this
okay so can you please tell me this then
the answer is there so now let's check
the another feature which is image
recognition Okay so first what you can
do you can click the pictures right away
or you can upload your screenshot so I
have I will go to the gallery and I will
upload this one code is that at please
explain this code you can write this
okay just send this so here you can see
the code in the image is a simple Java
program I will show you the image the
prints hello world to the console here
is breakdown of each part okay so it
explained beautifully okay so let me
show you the picture so so this is a
simple hello world program so you can
ask chat GPT by uploading a screenshot
your screenshot okay you can ask any
doubt of
yours so now let's again upload one
image then I will upload my image and
add
describe this picture or you can make
even stories okay describe this picture
and make short story in 100 words this
is the current photo as you can see in a
modern studio John prepared to shoot his
latest YouTube tutorial on machine
learning wow with a green screen behind
him professional lightning Illuminating
the room he sat at his desk left on open
and notes ready okay and if you will see
the picture right so you can ask
anything to CH gbt by uploading your
screenshot or a particular image
what if I want to click one present
picture okay so what I can do I can open
this camera part and I can do this
okay so
next
describe this
upload this image shows the screen of a
d laptop displaying an award from the
world number one online boot cam simply
learn see
so this is how you can upload your
picture or even you can talk to chat GPT
on video call like you do with your
friends or your family okay so this is
not published yes this version but it
will come soon okay and even the time is
displayed wow okay so what if I want
like you can write oh Google
logo image okay now it will create an
image see doing research with Bing
searching Google logo image to will
search and it will create one image I
guess it should it's Char it can do
anything
okay okay I want
image I want
image I want logo
image or I can write create image for me
okay give something something okay let
me write create Google logo image now I
think it will make okay see as you can
see on the screen creating image right
so it will I hope it will create not
sure okay done show me the image see
Google image not exact but somewhat
right okay so this is one
and what you can do you can there is one
more feature multilingual so again we
should
connect
connect so how can I say how are you in
Spanish in Spanish you can say how are
you as if you're addressing someone
informally for a more formal
context okay how can tell my name in
French to
someone to tell someone your name in
French you can say jel your name for
example if your name is John you would
say jel
John wow amazing right so this is how
you can learn any language you want to
okay so these are some basic features of
chbd 40 maybe in future it will launch
more and more new features right you can
upload your document you can upload any
sort of a screenshot you can ask for the
code you can do anything right you can
upload your image any sort of image and
you can ask JB to describe it or to make
one story so now let's move forward and
and see some safety and limitation of CH
GPT 4 so now let's talk about safety and
limitation of gp4 gp40 prioritize safety
by Design across different types of data
and by refining Its Behavior after
training they have also developed new
safety measures to control voice outputs
they also had outside experts review gbt
40 to identify and address risk
especially in new areas like audio they
will keep improving safety as we learn
more while text and image inputs and
outputs are available now they are still
working on making other features like
audio safety and user friendly so guys
let's see so membran chat gbt allows the
AI to keep track of information shared
in past conversations and this
capability enhances the way chat gbt
interacts with users by using previously
mentioned details to provide more tailor
and relevant responses think of it as a
having a digital assistant that
remembers your preferences and past
discussions to make each conversation
smoother and more personal
I will show you guys from where you can
turn this memory feature on you just
have to go to your username click on
that then go to settings and then click
on personalization here's the memory
feature you just have to turn it on and
you can go to manage to check it has
stored any memory regarding you or not
and you can clear the chat gyp's memory
also so it's up to you whether you want
to keep the memory or you want to delete
it or what memory you want him to keep
or what memory you want wanted to delete
so this feature is handled by you only
and you could see that this memory
feature is accessible for the chaty 4
plus users and the Enterprise users and
they have a description here that chat
Gip will become more helpful as you chat
picking up details and preferences is
tailor it responses to you and you can
click here learn more and get a hands on
where it will show as this is the
official website for open Ai and they
have memory and new controls for chat
gity and here you could see that this is
the manage memory section that I showed
you this is the manage memory section as
currently I don't have any memory stored
in the chat GPT they have some memory
store that is has a 2-year-old daughter
named Lena daughter Lena loves jellyfish
so these are the kinds of memories that
has been stored and you could see they
have mentioned how memory works so as
you with chat gbt you can ask it to
remember something specific or let it
pick up and these details can be used in
the further chats I will provide you
some examples and I will show you some
prompts that how could you use this
memory feature and how this will help
you in prioritizing your task or if you
are dedicated to your fitness journey or
you are like working on any project so
how could this feature help you so let's
move and see you are in control so what
they're doing here is I think they will
be showing how you can use the memory
and delete the memory accordingly and
viewing and managing memory that's in
the manage section you can view and
there's a temporary chat section that if
you want to to conversate without
storing the memory so I will show you
guys where this option is so when you
click on chat4 there's a temporary chat
section if you just turn it on like you
you could see here that it won't store
any history no model training and the
memories of here if you click on
continue so you would start conversation
in the chat jpt with the temporary chat
section and he won't store any memory
regarding this conversation so we'll
close this template chat
as we will be using the memory section
here and you could use the custom
instructions also that chat GPT and that
would be more helpful so the custom
instructions they are here you could
just use customized Char and you could
provide some custom instructions but
they are generic so what we want is we
want the memory to be stored and the
chat gy should use the memory for
further chats so you could see that so
they also mentioned evolving our privacy
and safety standard say and then they
have shown that team and Enterprise
customers can work more efficiently as
they have got this feature so for
Enterprise and team users memory can be
useful when using chat gbt for work and
chat gbt can remember your tone voice
and format preferences like how you want
so you could use chat jpd to remember
your tone voice and format preferences
and he can write in your own tone like
how you write how you use some keywords
how your English is like how fluent and
what's your tone Chad gyy can deduce it
from its memory and use that and provide
the same output as you want so this is
about the Chad jipt memory thing so gpts
will also have memory they have
mentioned it so I will show you guys
what are gpts so here's the explore GPT
section and there are many that are
provided by openi only like these are
featured ones these are trending ones
that is image generator logo generator
and you can create your own GPT also
that's here here's the create section
and these are by chat GPT by openi team
only data analyst D Port modes creative
writing so they will also have the
feature of storing memory so let's see
an example like they have provided it
like the books GPD helps you find your
next street with memory enabled it
remembers your preferences such as
favorite chones or top books and tailor
recommendations accordingly without
needing repeated inputs so it will make
your task easier as you don't have to
input all the prompts they will have
their memory they will just refind it
retune it get the memory get your geners
your preferences and they will suggest
you so now moving on we will have some
or we will discuss some applications
where you could use it so let's start
with applications so if you are managing
some project
or a project manager you could use the
chat gy memory feature like you can keep
track of ongoing projects deadlines and
responsibilities or if you are a student
and you are learning something so the
chat gy can remember the users learning
goals that I want to learn some language
and dedicated to these weeks so provide
me a road map and the daily when you
will be learning with Chad jpd he will
remind you that today is this day and
you should accomplish all these codes or
the task that are provided to learn that
language so similarly if you have
personalized recommendations for that
application also that could be recall
preferences in books movies or
restaurants to offer customized
recomendations and in your health and
fitness journey also you could ask him
to track fitness goals dietary
restrictions and exercise preferences to
provide tailored advice so let's see an
example prom for memory storage so let's
see the example for project management
let's start it so we will ask him to
remember that my project
deadline for
the mark marketing
campaign and we can name it like any
marketing campaign rise
up marketing campaign named rise
up okay
uh is June
30th okay so you could see here that is
updating the memory memory updated so
project title and for the market
campaign name rise up is June 30th you
can go to settings personalization and
the manage memory you could see here
that it has stored this memory that
project deadline for the marketing
campaign named rise up is June 30th so
similarly he remembers the things and
will help you that this deadline is on
June 30th and how you would be
proceeding with your chats he will help
you to like meet the deadline so you
won't miss the deadline and he will
guide you with all the
outputs and if we see another prompt
that could be if you are interested in
learning something so you can ask him
that keep that in mind and if we discuss
something provide those output also that
you could ask him that I am interested
in learning about renewable energy that
I
am interested in
learning about renewable
energy so keep that in
mind for our
discussions you could see that he's
updating the memory when you will see or
write these prompts now that keep that
in mind or remember so he will store
that in you in the memory and he will
guide you accordingly so you have
written there that keep that in mind
like this a spell mistake but he has
updated the memory so these kind of
prompts allow chity to store relevant
details which it can recall in future
conversations make the interaction more
personalized and context aware so let's
focus on the application of project
management using Chip's memory feature
so we'll write some of the prompts and
we'll see how he will guide us for the
project management so we'll start here
and ask him that
remember that
the next review
meeting for the rise up
project is
scheduled for May 20th
at 3
p.m. so we have provided this
information to him and he will store
this into the memory as you could see
that he's updating the memory memory
updated you could go back click on
settings personalization and check
whether it has done that or not and if
you want to clear that you could do that
and if you want a specific memory to be
cleared you could delete from here or
you could just ask him by writing the
prom that I mentioned you to keep the
track of review meeting for the rise up
project you can delete that memory I
that meeting is rescheduled or that
meeting is cancelled so he will delete
that memory so you could use that
feature also and and similarly you could
see that it has provided us the output
that goed to next riew meeting for the
rise of project is scheduled for May
20th at 3 p.m. if there's anything you
would like to prepare or discussion
before then let's just let me know so
you could start the conversation here or
we will ask him some other promps that
keep in mind that Sara is the lead
designer on the on this project and make
sure to include her in relevant updates
so we'll provide this pumpt also chity
to store in memory that keep in mind so
these kind of forms that keep in mind
this will allow chat G to store that
into the memory that Sara is the
lead designer uh on this project that is
we will mention the project only on the
rise up project
and make
sure to include
her in
relevant
updates okay and after this you could
ask him that you need some reports so
can you draft me reports you could just
provide him the xlsx file or Excel file
or what prompt you can write here is I
need to submit the budget report for the
sustainability initiative by the end of
next month for this project so keep that
in mind and the deadline for this budget
report will be like it's May 20th you
could prepare it before May 19th so he
will help you with that
so I will write the prom so you guys can
understand how it
will that I need to submit the budget
report for the
sustainability
initiative and for this project
only for this project and that
two at the deadline was May 20th so and
that to at May 15th so that's up to you
like what you want to tell him to
remember so ask him that we should
discuss this in the upcoming
chats and you can also ask him that I
will provide you the Excel file and
after that we can start preparing the
report or just let me remember these
things so you could see that it has
provided that understood you need to
submit the budget report for the
sustainability Initiative for the rise
up project by May 15th so we can discuss
this in our upcoming chats to make sure
you are fully prepared if there's any
specifics you want to start start with
let me know okay so here we will start
with the budget report only so let's
start
with budget
report and have a road
map to complete
it till the
deadline so let's see what it will
respond so you could see that it has
started to the response that you have
the deadline on May 15th so first is
gather the data then structure the
report draft the content review and
revise finalize the report submission
preparation and submit the report so the
number one is gather data we have the
xlx file so you could provide it here
and as this is the hypothetical example
so really I don't have the file what I
telling you is if you have the file just
provide to him and he will start
structuring the report and what you want
to show in the report like if you want
to create the dashboard or you want to
create the graphs or you want to analyze
the data he will do that for you just
ask him that these are the functions and
these are the dashboards or these are
the graphs I need so he will start
drafting that so this is how the memory
is used and how you can store it and how
you can use it for any purpose so
similarly we can use another example
that could be we'll create a new chat
for that that I want some recipes or
healthy
recipes
uh as I have started working
out and
remember I
am
allergic to
peanuts okay so this is the point that
what recipes he will provide he should
keep in mind that I'm to peanuts so he
won't include peanuts in that so you
could see that it has SP the spon and it
has updated the memory home so that's
great to hear that you focusing on
Fitness on hand and the first recipe is
Kona and black bean salad and then we
have chicken and avocado wraps veget Ste
fry with tofu so similarly you could
keep your journey accordingly that now
he knows that you are allergic to
peanuts if you want any recipe without
being the specific to healthy thing so
he will keep that in mind and won't
include peanuts in your recipes so this
is how you could use the memory feature
and the team and Enterprise customers
can work more efficiently with this chy
feature and you can learn your style and
preferences and build upon past
interactions Chad GPT will help you
provide all the outcomes and you also
knew that it has memory section for the
GP is also so I think we have covered
all the things for this new feature that
is chj m memory and if you want you
could go to settings
personalization if you want you can turn
off the memory if you don't want CH to
store the memory just click turn off
click on the section turn off and if you
want anything to delete it you can
delete it from here or you could just
type the promt that what have told you
about the allergy to peanuts just delete
that prompt or delete that memory as now
I am fit for the peanuts so getting back
and the thing that we have the temporary
chat section also that won't store any
memory so this is the section that is
temporary chat if you have conversation
here it won't be storing any memory for
you and you could just go on and write
all the pr so let's get started guys so
this is a chat jpt and we want to make
it as an AI assistant so what we'll do
is we will use a Chrome extension that
is talk to chat GPD extension moving on
to that we will install that extension
into the same browser where your chat
gbt has been loged and it's applicable
for the 3.5 version of Chad GPT and the
GPT 4 also like if you have the free
version of GPT you could also integrate
talk to chat GT extension into it so as
it has been installed we'll refresh the
chat gbt and you could see that here's a
dialog box appeared with the name top to
chat jpt and after clicking on start you
could see there are options mic volume
and this option is you could skip the
message that has been currently being
read by the board and these are the
settings if you unmute this and talk to
chat GPT or give any prompt it will
listen to it and run the prompt and
before that we'll move to the settings
and here you could see that we have ai
voice and language and in this you could
choose any one of them and these are
freely available you could use any of
them and there are no limit credits for
this so let's have a demo for this so
we'll unmute and we'll ask Chad jpt to
list the difference between list and
tles in
Python so you could see that the chat
jpt has taken our prompt and started
generating the
response so stop this prompt and moving
back to settings first we'll unmute this
as chat jpt will take the prompt uh
moving back to the settings you could
see here that there are various free AI
voice languages that you can choose from
else we have another option that is even
labs and this is one of the prominent AI
speakers in the market today so we will
get the even La API key and paste it
here and we'll get some credits that
would be according to the characters and
we'll use them and show you guys how we
can use it and there's a voice control
system here if you say the stop word The
Prompt will automatically stop or the
response that would be generating by the
GPT that will get halted and this PA
word also if you speak the PA word uh
with the mic unmuted it will catch the
POS word and it will pose The Prompt
there only so we'll save this and we'll
search for even Labs API key so moving
to even Labs first you have to do is
sign up and create a profile here and
after that move to the profile section
and here you would see the API key copy
that and get back to your chat
jpt and in the settings of talk to GPT
extension you have enabled the even Labs
API key and here I will paste it and
I'll make it blur so you guys won't be
able to access it so we have pasted the
API key here and you could choose from
the Emil lamps voice that would be only
in English or multilanguage and here are
the voice assistants that are available
so we will choose anony here and save it
so as you unmute this option you could
ask the prompt with the chat jpt and he
will answer and provide the solution to
you so let's try out once so let's see
the output we will ask Chad jpt what is
the difference between list and dou in
Python you could see that Chad gbt has
it looks like there might have been a
typo or misunderstanding in the origin
question regarding doubles in Python if
you meant tuples instead I already
provided a comparison between lists and
tupal however if you meant doubles as in
a data type for storing decimal or
floating Point numbers the term double
isn't specifically used in Python like
it is in some other programming
languages e g who see your Java in
Python floating Point numbers are
typically referred to just as Flo
and they are used to represent both
single and double Precision numbers
depending on the platform Python's float
type typically as you can see that the
chat gbt has provided us the response
and it is acting as an AI voice
assistant and here are the voice that
you can choose from and I have one of
them that is of Alex and poll similarly
you could choose any one of them and we
have some of the free credit
that you can use let's move to the
subscription plans and we have 10,000
characters per month free with the
initial plan and if you want to upgrade
the plan here are the subscriptions and
with that guys we have made chbt as an
AI voice assistant so you could see this
is the GPD 4 version and here you will
get the plugins option here is the GPT 4
and here we have GPT 3. five and if you
want to use the plugins you just have to
click here and then or let's just first
explore Char plugins so enhancement for
the AI model chat jpt that is open a
advanced a language model has been
widespread application across various
fields from enhancing customer
interaction to streamlining content
generation while CH GPS core
capabilities are impressive its
functionalities can be significantly
expanded through the integration of
specialized plugins these plugins
designed exclusively for chat GPT serve
to broaden its utility by introducing
new features and functionalities
enabling users to fully exploit the AI
models potential so now we'll see how we
can install the chat gbt plugins so
setting up chat gbd plugin is
straightforward with the Plus account so
you need to have a Plus account for that
that is you need the gbd4 version and
follow the following steps that I will
tell you that is click on your account
name at the bottom right that would
be bottom right just click on the
account and then select settings and
beta and then go for the beta features
tab settings beta features and this is
the beta features tab you just need
to click on the plugin section that is a
triy version of jat jpt that knows when
and how to use third party plugins that
you enable so you just need to enable
the plugins and after you have activated
the plugins and you could see the plugin
here so this is the drop down menu and
if you just scroll down you will see the
plug-in store here so click on the
plug-in store so this is the plug-in
store and these are the popular plugins
that are available here you could see
the new ones or the old plugins and you
could see they are 129 pages and this
page includes around eight plugins so
you could see like how many plugins are
available so going back to popular you
could install any plugin as I clicked on
this AI
diagrams and it has been installed and
you could see here that we can only
enable three plugins at a time when you
will be writing the prompt so those
plugins those are enabled will be active
and you can use them for the prompts so
you could see AI diagram and scraper
these both plugins are enabled currently
ly and if you want to explore like what
plug-in does what do what so you could
see here that it creates an edit
whimsicle flowcharts mind maps and
sequence diagrams that is AI diagrams
and then we have ai PDF that is super
fast interactive chats with PDFs of any
size complete with page references for
fact checking so you could see
that and after installing the plugins
you could start working with them and
and now we will discuss the role and
functionality of chat JD plugins so
plugins are essentially software
extensions that introduce additional
features to an exciting or the existing
software framework without altering its
original code in the context of chat gbt
these extensions are crafted to
complement the AI functionalities
allowing for a more tailored and
expanded use by employing these plugins
developers and users can enhance chat
gpd's interaction with external
applications databases and services
thereby customizing the AI to suit
specific needs or industry requirements
and if we talk about the operational
dynamics of chat gbd plugins so the
operational framework of chat gbd plugin
is centered around the extension of the
AI models native features through the
Strategic use of application programming
interfaces that is apis these plugins
facilitate a seamless interaction
between chat GP and various external
resources this integration not only
enhances the AI capabilities but also
allows for a more versatile application
across different sectors and moreover we
will also talk about advantages but
currently we will search for some
specific plugins and write some prompts
for that so in the plug-in store we will
search for prompt
perfect so this is the prompt
perfect so you could see here that start
your prompt with perfect to craft the
perfect prompts every time so that is
first up we have promt perfect that is
one of the best J JT extensions that
lets users write the perfect prompts for
the AI chatboard if you're part of the
few not able to do so perfect will
immensely help you write the prompts so
to begin we will install
it so guys here you could see that the
three of three are enabled but we will
disable these and we'll just have one
that is prompt perfect enabled and here
we will write a prompt that is however
make sure to write the word perfect
before your prompt so that is we'll
write perfect
uh write
a
story on
automobiles or we will write he prompt
perfect so you could see that the CH is
using the prom perfect here so you could
see that it is writing the prompt that
we can just give it to chat gbt and it
will write a story on
automobiles oh sorry like we have asked
him to write a story on
automobiles so you could see that this
is done and you could see a notification
from the open a only that is jpts will
soon replace
plugins and you could learn more about
it that is a beta
feature and moving to next we will
install some other plug
also and let's have the Wolf Ram that I
have installed so I will show you but
description it has so it access
computation math curated knowledge and
real time data through wfrm Alpha and
Wolfram
language okay now we'll use it
Wolfram so while while it can get a bit
technical for some users the WF frame
chat plugin is one of the best due to
its advanced typ abilities so powered by
Advanced Data Wolfram allows chare gbt
users to access advanced commutation
math and realtime data to solve all
types of queries so instead of sticking
to just basic math problems you can ask
Wolfram for advanced help like creating
a genealogical tree creating an audio
spectrogram illustrating anatomy and
much more it can even tell the date and
time in real time which isn't something
Chad jbt can do so go ahead and
experiment with W frame and I will show
you guys
something so we will create another one
and ask him
here so you could see that it has
started using the Wolfram extension here
or the plugin here and it is saying that
I am unable to directly generate or
export a spectrogram for a phrase so it
is here using the current
setup so it is unable to
like generate a spectrogram so it's okay
we will explore some other plugins so we
will explore the web pilot
then it's also one of the most popular
plugins out there so you could browse
web page PDF data chat and write like WR
with one that would be many one URLs so
we'll explore this so you could browse
any web page so first we'll enable it
web pilot and close
this and open another window and now
we'll search for simply learn
articles and now we'll ask this web
pilot hey web
pilot I will provide
you a
link can you
summarize the article for
me so we will provide the link so you
could see that CH gbt is using the web
pilot plugin
here so you could see that it is like it
has started summarizing the article here
and this was the original
article and you could also ask him to
read any
PDF so these are done with these plugins
only and now moving on we'll explore
some other plugins or I will just take
you through them that is here coder pad
diagrams that create diagrams that is
schemes diagrams architecture
visualizations flowcharts SM Ms you
could export and edit for free and you
could run code in more than 30 different
programming languages and let us worry
about setting up the environment so you
don't have to set up any environment
here as you know that CHT can only run
python code but you are not able to set
up any environment to run any other
programming languages so you could use
the coder pad for that and you have many
popular plugins also like the canma one
and there are many other two book tables
or
RG that is used to generate images
without learning how to prompt so you
could utilize these plugins and create
what you want so if we talk about the
advantages of deploying chat GB plugins
so incorporating chat gbd plugins into
the AI models unlocks a pleora of
benefits and these advantages range from
the ability to customize the AI for
specific task integrating with third
party service for enhanced functionality
to offering specialized features
pertinent to sectors such as Healthcare
e-commerce and finance furthermore
plugins can Empower CH gbt with
capabilities like language translation
and complex data analysis significantly
broadening its applicability and
efficiency and if we talk about
consideration and challenges so with the
integration of CH plugins offers
numerous benefits it's important to
consider the associated challenges and
limitations access to these enhanced
function fun alties often comes at a
cost requiring a subscription
Additionally the development of these
plugins by third party providers
introduces potential risk related to
data privacy and security users must be
vigilant about the data they share and
understood how it's managed by plug-in
providers to mitigate risk associated
with sensitive information
exposure so as you guys see we have
covered how to install the plugins how
to use them how to enable them and how
to call them the evolution of AI would
be an understatement when it come to the
latest releases from two of the Titans
in the world of AI language models
Google and open AI have taken their game
to the next level and M imagination
would hold you at the edge of your seats
imagine a breakthrough in the hardware
and a Flawless AI assistant who could be
your next emotional support companion
who could understand you speak to you
and try to solve problems thrown at it
does it sounds too futuristic to be true
well your speculation is now a thing of
the past today we take you to the
reality hey Chachi
PT hey there what's up how can I
brighten your day today okay yeah so I'm
going to show you um a selfie of what I
look like and then I'd like you to try
to see what emotions I'm feeling based
on how I'm looking sounds like a fun
challenge go ahead and show me that
selfie and I'll put my emotional
detective hat on okay so here's me so
what kind of emotions do you think I'm
feeling H it seems like I'm looking at a
picture of a wooden surface oh you know
what that was the thing I sent you
before don't worry I'm not actually a
table um okay so so take a take another
look ah that makes more
sense a there we go it looks like you're
feeling pretty happy and cheerful with a
big smile and maybe even a touch of
excitement
whatever's going on it seems like you're
in a great mood care to share the source
of those Good Vibes yeah no uh the
reason I'm in a really good mood is
because we were doing a presentation
showcasing how useful and amazing you
are oh stop it you're making me
BL welcome to the simply learn in
today's session we introduce you to the
Google IO and chat gb4 Omni that said if
these are the type of the videos you'd
like to watch then hit the Subscribe
button and click the Bell icon to get
notified both Google and openi equally
share a part of historic moment with
their AI model launch events it's
nothing less to say that they just
reinvented the wheel ground up in this
video we'll discuss the key points
happened on May 14
2024 Google IO and openi along with few
others are in constant state of war
against each other on the grounds of
artificial intelligence the chat GPD 4
Omni is a faster powerful and less
expensive than its predecessor the gbd4
turbo the AI model can now combine text
vision and audio into a single model and
is capable of interacting with humans
like a human remember irona from rich
rich that just got real hey chat GPT I'm
Mark how are you oh
Mark I'm doing great thanks for asking
how about you hey so I'm on stage right
now I'm doing a live demo and frankly
I'm feeling a little bit nervous can you
help me calm my nerves a little
bit oh you're doing a live demo right
now that's awesome just take a deep
breath and remember you're the expert I
like that suggestion let me try a couple
deep breaths can you give me feedback on
my breaths okay here I
go whoa
slow a bit there mark you're not a
vacuum cleaner breathe in
for count of four okay uh let me try
again so I'm going to breathe in
deeply and then breathe
out for four and then exhale
slowly okay I'll try again breathing
in and breathe
out that's it how do you feel I feel a
lot better thank you so much sadly just
like Arona the conversational features
of gbd4 aren't available for free to the
public users yet the voice of of gbd4
omni is presumed to be a Californian
valley girl for Omni is capable of voice
modulation based on the topic of
discussion it can go sarcastic dramatic
and subtle based on the situation and
emotion once upon a time in a world not
too different from ours there was a
robot named no chat I really want
maximal emotion like maximal
expressiveness much more than you were
doing before understood let's amplify
the drama once on a time in a world not
too different from ours there was a
robot named bite j4 Omni is currently
free to use and the unavailability of
the conversational AI models doesn't
hurt much overball open AI is all set
with a plan to integrate 4 ohni with the
latest Apple devices now enters the
Google Google is always one of the
healthy competitors in the grounds of
technology and chose not to take a step
back in the AI race Google launched its
latest model the Gemini 1.5 against om
and Google also has plans to integrate
its model with Apple's lineup apart from
that Google also launched another weapon
from its asail called project Astra in
the Collision Course with 4 Omni as a
head- onhe head competitor Astra feels
completely similar to 4 Omni and can
visually scan things around and remember
where you left your glasses from the
last time you used them do do you
remember where you saw my
glasses yes I do your glasses were on
the desk near a red
apple despite the similarities netizens
found it a little laggy in terms of
speed and voice sounds a little less
human now circling back to the spotlight
of the today's discussion the Google IO
the biggest announcement from Google is
Gemini 1.5 Pro the latest model now can
process 2 million tokens of context
Windows just to get a wild guess that's
equal to 1.4 million words or 60,000
lines of code or 22 hours of audio or 2
hours of video that's basically a lot of
context and speaking of tokens the
memory they can use can make the model
expensive to cut down the cost Google
introduced something like token caching
can reuse token at a fraction of cost
apart from that let's dive into the
latest Hardware that Google has
announced Google announced a latest TPU
called trillum the sixth generation of
Google Cloud TPU Trillium TPU achieves
an impressive 4.7x increase in a peak
compute performance per chip compared to
TPU v5v along with trillum Google is
here with the latest arm-based processor
the Axion for their data centers to
deliver instances up to 30% better
performance than fastest general purpose
arm-based incenses available in the
cloud today up to 50% better performance
and up to 60% better Energy Efficiency
than comparable current generation x86
based instances also Google announced vo
the generative video model to compare
against open AI s we get experience to a
lot of progress compared to the previous
year from the Google's front but find
the winner of this competition is
turning out to be a little tricky since
the momentum of this AI model
competition broke out many competitors
like clu AI open AI Google and many more
are coming up with their impressive
tools and Hardware some set benchmarks
and some bed setbacks what do you think
let us know in the comments below so
opena recently released a multimodel
version of gp4 called gp4 Vision that is
GPT 4V so GPT 4V can understand images
as input and answer questions based on
it 80% of the world's data is
unstructured and Scattered across
formats like websites PDFs or images
that are hard to access and analyze we
believe that this new era of multimodel
models will have a big impact on the web
scraping and document processing space
because it's now possible to understand
unstructured data without having to rely
on complex OCR Technologies or tooling
so let's explore potential application
of GPD 4 we for web scripting so first
what we'll do is we will open any
website or we'll just open the simply
learn website only and we will save this
as a HTML
doc HTML Only We have replaced
it so this is the HTML
log we will drag and drop it to chat jpd
and now ask the chat jpd to web scrape
the data
so we'll ask the chity that use the
above HTML
file and script the
data from it so first we'll see the
script data in text format only and
after that we will uh ask the CH to
scrip the data into Json format or if
there are any CSS files or styling or
metadata so we'll ask the J gyy to do
so so you could see that jjd has
responded that the HTML file you
uploaded from the simply website it
provides a variety of courses and the
platform AES too so it has just given us
the summary so now we ask chat gity to
extract the data into Json format
about
HTML
file in
Json format so you could see that it's
analyzing so you could see that it has
extracted the data into Json format and
here's a B for of the extracted data so
this is how you could web script the
data from the websites using gp4 Vision
so now what we'll do we will go to all
courses click on explore the category so
here you could see all the courses of
the data science and business analytics
category so what we'll do we'll ask the
chat GP what we'll do is we'll ask chat
jpd to extract the titles of all the
courses so for that first we'll save the
page as HTML
Doc and we'll upload to chat
jbd and going back to the page just
inspect you could see that heading three
has the title of this course so we'll
provide this as a reference to the chat
jity so it can understand and extract
all the other titles from this page so
we'll get back to chat J and ask him
that extract the course
title from the
attached web
page or HTML
do
HTML and you can use Python and
beautiful soup
and
Export
the results to a CSV
file and the title
tag
edge3 like this and now we will provide
it
just copy the element paste it to chat
jpd extract all the post
titles attached web page okay let's see
but does a chat shiy respond to
this so you would see that it has
created a CSF file so we'll click this
open the file
and it has extracted all the titles
which are present in
H3 into a CSV file but we asked only for
the course titles and it has done so for
all the H3
points and now we'll ask the chat JP to
extract
the
metadata into Json
format from the
attached HTML
file so you could see that JT has
provided the metadata into Json format
and similarly we can ask it for other
scripts if this web page has any
scripts
provide that to in Json
format so you could see that I extracted
the scripts from the HTML file and
presented them in Json format so here a
preview of the extracted scripts so this
is the script that contains the
JavaScript code and within the web page
and due to the length of the scripts
only the first part is shown here if you
need the full Chon file all the scripts
please let me
know yeah
I need the full
script so you could see that it has
provided us the Json file so we can just
download it and open it with any
ID so this is the Json format
for the whole web
page moving back we move back to the
website and now we will ask chat jpt to
extract the data from this image that is
or like make someone understand what
does this image show so first we'll do
is we'll save the page into HTML dog and
P this
image
element and ask the chat J first we'll
upload the HTML file and ask the chat
J uh explain
the
graph present in the
attached web
page and describe it so we'll save and
submit it and let's see what does it
respond if it doesn't respond we'll just
get back to the web page and inspect the
element for it and provide the div class
or the particular element so it could
understand for Which diagram asking chat
CH to describe
it see so H file you provided title
postgraduate in data science does not
display content in a format that allows
me to interact with or interpret any
eded
graphs so we provide
you with the
element
present HTML
file read that and explain
the
graph would di to
us so let's
see so you could see that it has
provided the information about that
image that the HTML snip provide in
appears to represent a style graphical
element likely part of a larger graph or
visual representation specifically it
describes a d element M rotated by - 53°
containing another D with a background
color of a shade of pink so this is how
the gp4 version works and it also
describes the images which is about
integrating AI into your day-to-day
operations in Excel now let's quickly
switch to the Excel workbook now here I
have a simple basic Excel workbook and
to demonstrate the uh Power and
potential of integrating EI into your
Excel spreadsheet we are performing a
small minor operation over here where we
just have few results right the students
their department and their percentage
now we going to calculate the result of
the pass or fail now you might be
telling me or you you might wonder this
is just a very simple if formula why do
you want to integrated an AI into this
now the speciality is let's say you are
a beginner in business analytics or data
analytics and even though if you're a
beginner you might figure out the
formula but let's say you don't have any
idea on generating a new formula Al
together it's like asking a question to
chat GPD so here the AI editor that we
are going to integrate with Excel is
related to chat jpt and it's you know
built on chat jpt so basically it will
give you a query editor where you can
just write your query in very simple
terms like you're just talking to excel
right in the same way like you talk to
chat GPD ask AI Editor to give you a
formula to identify column D numbers and
give you a result in column e so let's
get started on how it can be done so
it's really simple go to the home bar
and here you can see add ends option
just click on that and here we have the
AI Ed editor in case if you don't find
it just you can you can just you know
download any of the gbd for Excel so
just U you know click on this button
over here and uh you will get a search
window just type down AI editor or
something so you can just get one of
those just press enter so I'm using this
the first
recommendation formula editor there you
can choose any one of these right charge
video Exel we've got a multiple ones so
I'm using the first one's already added
into my workbook so let's quickly go to
the EI Ed formula Ed
you might have to um you know create
your Microsoft account and try to login
right so here I have the AI generator
right now you can just write it down in
your own terms you can use your local
language you can use Excel anything just
write it down the way you want it right
uh you can just type down uh give me an
Excel
formula to
identify if the students test
exam not result
percentage percentage greater than or
okay percentage greater than or equal to
35% is pass and
percentage that's than 35 is fail is
your
parameter are you parameters
just submit it and it will give you a
query or a formula which you can just
copy and paste into the Excel cell or
work PR here we have one you can just
copy it the way it is just paste it over
here so in place of A1 you're supposed
to use percentage enter now you have the
results CL fa fa right so it is we did
not specify the column number here right
in case if we have specified the column
number or column header which is
basically e over here sorry D over here
so we named it as percentage so it did
not and another thing to recognize we
did not convert this into table so basic
few things but overall you are getting a
readily available formula which is
completely Flawless you can also
experiment this particular feature of AI
AED formula editor with some complex
Advanced Excel as well should you feel
that we should prepare one of the
tutorials on Advanced Excel formulas
which are AI AED formula editor based
videos please do let us know in the
comment section below and we will get
that done for you so now you can see
some data on my spreadsheet so we have
row ID order ID audit date and ship date
ship mode Etc so this means that this
particular data set belongs to a a sales
data set for a store or something so
what I have done is if you look out the
videos on our Channel we already have
created one of the interactive
dashboards using the same data set so we
try to extract month-on-month sales
region category subcategory sales
country-wise sales shipment type sales
Etc right so I have uh you know kept the
data as it is and all the pivot tables
as it is now let's say we do not know
how to create all these pivot tables and
pivot charts and slicers Etc we just
know that we have the data and you're
new to this and you want to analyze your
data how do you do that chat GPD is here
for the rescue so before we get on to
chat GPD let's quickly remove all our
reference pivot
tables about pivot table so I'm quickly
deleting all these they left out with
only the data right and again you can do
this dashboard using chat gbd 3.5 or in
case if you have a premium version which
is chat gbd4 you can directly attach
your data set onto the chat GPT prompt
and chat GPT will do all the analysis
you need right but for now let's
experiment using the chat GPD 3.5
version which is basically open source
and free to use now let's quickly hop on
to chat
GPD y there you go we have chat GPD
version 3.5 we are not switching to
four so now let's quickly um explain
what we are up
to hi chart GPT just keep it simple as
if you're talking to your friend
the D set belongs
to super store sales
or is
about the data set is about uh
Superstore sales
report and I need
to
create a dashboard
for month on
month f
so this is the prompt and basically I
just explained in a brief way I'm not uh
giving a detailed information but hope
this works so basically uh what you are
supposed to do is uh give U the
requirement one by one but I'm giving it
in a single PR so that I'll get the
results in one single PR let's move for
that so what you're trying to explain
Chan GPD is that you have a sales data
set and you're using Excel for for
storing it and manipulating the data and
trying to build some Innovative
Interactive visually appealing charts
and you don't know how to do it so you
explained that to your chat jpd and uh
what are the uh things you are looking
to build what are the charts you're
looking to build so I'm looking to build
a month- on-month sales report which can
be a quarter on quarter month on month
year on Year date wise however the way
you like it right so uh make sure that
your data is properly formatted first so
here let's check out that your date
column is for to date data type right
sometimes what happens is the
representation of date uh changes to
user by user let's say this particular
data set or this particular inventory is
been allocated to five different people
to entry the data right somebody might
use this type of you know here you have
uh let's create a new sheet and try to
let me elaborate what I'm trying to
explain so let's say U person one
person three so let's say I use this
type of uh
formatting 15th December 2025 something
like that and somebody else uses 15 12
2025 and another one uses 15
December only
25 and also sometimes few people also uh
intend or you know may uh follow uh a
date pattern which looks something like
this December the 31st
2025 right and it's not wrong so many
people will have different uh
conventions of writing their dates so
you need to make some data cleaning and
okay if you are coming back to data
cleaning we have listed a video in our
descriptions for data cleaning and Excel
and uh that would help you in various uh
data cleaning operations that are um you
know used in day-to-day lives of a data
analyst so that should help so basically
what you are looking for is so instead
of General go back to the data types and
here you can check out the data type
options and you can either give a short
date long date or in the case you want
to go for some additional formatting you
can also go to more formatting and here
you can check out the custom formatting
options here you can give a customized
option for now I want to go with date
and the date I want to go with is this
particular one which gives me date month
and yeah click on that and you should be
good to go right so make sure that all
the uh uh dates in your spreadsheet are
following one single date pattern so
that when it comes to uh month on month
quarter on quarter and earby sales that
will help you a lot okay it will just
give you a filtered option it will give
you year on year first then quarter on
quarter next and if you expand the
option of quarter on quarter you will
have month on month and if you expand
the month then you will have date wise
so you will have a you know better
understanding when we perform this
operation in a practical Way in real
time and then we have the next type of
chart where we want to identify
country-wise sales then we have
regionwise sales so let's say I have one
country here let's say I want sales from
France and uh I want to know what are
the uh sales happening in central region
of France North region of France so
you'll have region wise sales there and
category wise which category is giving
you the maximum profits or the maximum
sales and inside the category which is
that subcategory or which product is
that that which is giving you the
highest number of sales you can identify
that and based on that you can plan a
business uh you know you can get a with
a business strategy there and shipment
modes so which type of shipment mode
which should you invest in much so that
you can you know offer better services
to your customers so everything comes so
this is what I want to um you know um
extract from my D set so this is my
requirement you have explained this to
your chat GPD through the prompt and
just
enter now chat GPD should help you break
down the requirements and chat gbd
should help you uh how to you know it'll
get tell you how to uh do the process so
here it will tell you the line chart so
basically it's a it's a it's a rule that
month- on month sales or quote on quote
sales basically wherever the time is
involved the line chart is the best to
represent your numbers so now U it
basically tells you how to uh represent
your charts in what I or how what type
of chart to be selected that's good but
now uh can you help
me
create the first
chart in
Excel there you go so it tells you how
to create it and sure you have a column
for dates and other correspon oning
value so basically it is telling you to
have a properly mentioned or properly
defined metadata or column headers then
select the data go to the insert tab
choose the line chart okay and let's say
uh you wanted to create an interactive
dashboard right so to create an
interactive dashboard or to basically
create a dashboard you need a pivot
tables and you don't know how to create
a pivot table you can ask chart GPD to
help you create uh a pivot
table help me create a pivot
table
for the first
type for all the types okay
or for the data
set
certainly so it'll mention you the steps
to follow to create a pivot
table there you go so what's the first
step highlight the range of cells that
contain your data set and including
headers and go back to Excel and you can
just click on any cell and control a all
your dat set has been selected or these
days you can just select one of the
cells and go to insert menu and pivot
table and now from the table range Excel
will automatically select the entire
range of the table you're looking for or
you're working on and in case if you are
having any doubts on that you can just
select all the range and go to the same
insert option and select the pivot table
click on okay in a new worksheet and
there you go you have your new uh say
pivot table let's delete this now
remember we wanted to create the
month-on-month sale for the first pivot
table and pivot chart so and remember
about the uh date formatting so we'll be
looking on that now we will drag OD date
onto row here and you can see here so
this is what I was talking about so
Excel has automatically segmented your
dates we we have about 10,000 rows in
this particular data set and it has
segregated all the 10,000 rows into four
different years 2020 21 22 and 23 and if
you expand the selection of air it has
segregated again into quarter 1 2 3 and
four right and if you expand quarter one
you have month-on-month sales in quarter
one month-on-month sales in quarter two
and month-on-month sales in quarter
three and so on right so this is why I
was requesting you to have a proper data
formatting for all your dates right
which could be really helpful when you
want to extract the quarter on quarter
sales and date wise sales and year wise
sales right so now we wanted to find out
month- on-month sales right or year
on-ear sales so where is the sales yeah
here we have the sales parameter just
drag that onto the values and there you
go now format this into the currency
type so the currency is dollars American
dollars and you can uh eliminate the
leading zeros here if you don't want
them there you go now you have the whole
number here you can also do the same for
this you can select the entire
table go to pivot table okay let's check
the uh options provided by chat
GPD so basically we have created a pivot
table now we want to create a pivot
chart how do I create
a pivot
chart so again it's making really clear
statements and really clear steps so
it's again making sure that you create a
pivot table first right so we have a
pivot table and uh highlight pivot table
data click anywhere on your pivot table
to highlight the entire range insert
pivot chart with the pivot table
selected go go to the insert tab on the
ribbon and then click on pivot chart and
uh open the insert chart dialogue box
choose the type you want and uh
customize the chart select the chart so
customizing the chart we'll look onto it
and Fields if you want to keep a few
Fields you can and if you want to
eliminate a few Fields you can you can
also do that refresh data let's say why
refresh data see chgb is so brilliant
right so let's say uh I have the sales
data until 20 23 and now we're in 2024
let's say we update 2024 onto this
particular strad sheeet and now we have
that particular data in the original
spreadsheet but that is missing here in
that scenario what you can do is just go
to data and here you will find the
refresh all option once you click on
this you can find the 2024 data updated
here for now we have not added yet but
in case if it's added all you can do is
just refresh your sheet and everything
will change so brilliant suggestion from
chat jpt and save and share in case if
you want to share so let's follow the
same steps select any cell in the pivot
table select all the sheets go to insert
Tab and here recommended charts or go to
the charts option and select the chart
that you are looking for so we are
dealing with uh time so I would go with
the line chart just click okay but in
case if you want to create an
interactive dashboard just go to pivot
table analyze and here you have the
pivot charts and again it'll give you
the same option just select the line
chart here and press okay so you have
your line chart over here so again if
you are editing this so you can remove
the Legends if you want remove U
anything else or you can customize that
okay there you
go and if you want to edit the name of
the chart you can also do that so I will
do this as M Sales report
okay accordingly I'll change the sheet
name there you right
now quickly we will create the other
charts as well so the process is same
you can hold control and drag this
particular sheet and you have the next
sheet so the next
uh requirement that we had that we
requested chat jpd was the country-wise
sales so everything will remain the same
what changes is okay let's close this
and here instead of order data we will
have okay let's remove this from rows
and quarters
months right country so we will drag
country into rows and there you go now
we have countries now country wise so
you can uh select select the cell go to
pivot table analyze pivot chart and you
can select the bar graph so it
automatically gave you the first
suggestion is bar graph click on that
and you have the bar graph over here and
you can also edit the chart you don't
want you don't want the Legends you can
remove them and edit the name of the
chart
to Country wise
sales no and and uh quickly drag and
drop the sheet again new pivot table and
here you wanted category wise
sales or segment wise
sales uh close this
particular thing be this and instead of
country you're going to add segment to
the Rose and remove country and you have
segment wise sales select any on the
pivot table go to pivot table analyze
pivot chart and here you can use any of
the available um charts here let me use
the final chart or
histogram bar chart will be better press
okay and there you go you have the bar
chart same edit your you know customize
your uh
chart change the name
to te m m wise
sales hold control and drag the sheet
now you have subcategory wise
sales instead of segment you will be
selecting the
subcategory you can remove
segment and you can see the chart also
changed here and again you can do the
category wise sales so this was segment
wise
sales you can quickly change the segment
to
category and you have it we quick
quickly go back to yeah so we have done
the category Wise subcategory Wise
region wise is remaining and shipment
modes
so quickly drag or drop the region
remove subcategory from the
list there you have the region wise
sales edit the name
and the last one which is about the
shipment
modes remove region and there you
go you can create a new dashboard over
here and name it as
dashboard you can do some customization
to your dashboard like selecting these
sales
giving it a
color there you go now you can quickly
copy and paste all these uh charts to
the
dashboard starting from the month- on
Monon
sales
copy
paste so I'll quickly do all the U Pas
thingss as soon as
possible
e
e e
there you go you can also manage the
size of these charts so that everything
fits onto one sheet so for now let's try
to unpen
this so that we have a little better
visual
appearance okay not a
problem and now uh we need some filter
right so something which can make it a
little more interactive that's when you
add slices and let's say you don't know
how to add slices back to chat gbd and
ask chat gbd how do I add
slices to my
dashboard there you go so is telling you
to
uh add everything in a step-by-step way
and it also is talking about the
interactivity right it's it is asking
you to connect all the slices it it's
telling you to report the connections
right if you just add the slices based
on one single okay basically you need to
select one of your charts here and uh
select a pivot table or pivot chart go
to the pivot table or chart associate
with the slicer and insert and go to the
insert Tab and insert a slicer I'll I'll
tell you that so basically it it's
telling you in a very beautiful way step
by-step manner right and even after
adding the slicer it it is telling you
to connect all the uh basically all the
charts or all the um you know chart
dashboards and charts you created at
this particular tutorial and connect all
the charts to that particular slicer
using the report connections option and
you can get the interactivity right so
in in a very beautiful manner it has
explained let's try the way it has
explained to us go to the dashboard
select any one of it and go to the
insert option and here you have the
slicer right so now you have all the
slices over here so basically we wanted
what type of slices so I created a
month-on-month
uh chart so I'll go with audit date
slicer which is here then I have created
segment wise sales so I want segment
slicer country-wise slicer cat ategory
and subcategory wise
slicers region wise so region slicer and
do I have anything else let's scroll
down that's the last one so where is the
shipment
here yeah ship mode country region
category subcategory segment audit dates
and ship mode so I will have multiple
slic in one go right now you have to
arrange your slices in such a way that
they are interactive and they they look
like they are sorted in one place so let
me do that quickly we have some space
left here in the bottom place of the
dashboard you can also keep your slices
there so what basically chat gbd meant
was if you try to use the slices here it
will you know the changes will reflect
only in one of the pivot charts not on
all the pivot charts so to get that
Interactive to get that connectivity
between all the charts you need to do a
small setting which is called as report
connections so select one of the slices
over here right click and here you have
something called report connections so
when you report connections you have all
the pivot charts and pivot tables that
you just created you can just select all
those pivot tables that you created and
press on okay so that all these pivot
tables are connected to that particular
slicer uh you can just expand this and
check if all the pivot tables are
selected press okay do the same for all
the slices I'll quickly do
that e
so there you go we have interconnected
all the charts now let's say I want to
find out the sales that happened in the
latest year just go to the filters
select any of the dates
2023 and you have the data and if you
want to select any particular country
then you can also do that I want to go
with United Kingdom and in United
Kingdom we have all the data here let's
say I want to check out only for the
phones there you go now you have an
interactive dashboard which will tell
you the sales that happened on the date
of 16th of November 2023 in the region
United Kingdom for phones all right and
uh segment is home or office shipment
mode with standard class and major sales
that happen are from nor region and the
category is from tech technology right
and that's how you create an interactive
dashboard using chat GPD in Excel so
each and every step has been mentioned
very clearly by chat GPD and you have
all the data in one place so let's
quickly remove all the
filters and there you have the entire
dashboard now most of you might have
been an aspiring artificial intelligence
and machine learning expert or you might
have been having some aspirations on
different job rules like business
analyst State analyst but you might not
know how to build a resume that is ATC
friendly that is application tracking
system friendly and get you a job most
of you just go through the job
description provided on LinkedIn Indy
not or any other job portals and you
just copy paste the uh job rules and
responsibilities and expect the at
system to crack it or if not the ATA
system the hiring manager or the HR to
click on your Receiver right that might
not work in all the cases so we have our
AI friend chat GPT to to help us build
the resum according to the job
description and the ATS friendly nature
of your resume should help you land your
train job now let's take an example
let's open one of the job portal
platforms like
LinkedIn okay so here I'll be looking
for data analyst and here are my search
results I have senior data analyst data
analyst senior product data analyst
let's go with this one which is about
data analyst and here is your existing
re resum so let's say this is your
existing resume and you have a a lot of
things to add in here you have your
educational qualifications here you have
your you know maybe the cover letter and
you have your skills which are enlisted
bottom in the bottom section of the
resume right so it talks a lot let's say
uh these are not the ones which the uh
ATS system or uh the hiring manager is
looking for how do you make it a little
more interesting to do is I would use
chat GPD I would go to the job
description here job purpose and job
description I'll simply copy the job
description job roles and
responsibilities and everything right
now I'll go back to chat
GPT and write a prom just tell chat GPT
hi chat
GPT imagine you are uh 20 year old or
let's say 15y old professional
resum
wrer
now I need you to check on the job
description for a data
analyst and help me with the cover
letter resum it
so it should be a two-way communication
most of you end up doing some mistakes
wherein you try to extract all the
information just in one prompt so I
would uh recommend you to keep it in a
two-way communication let chat GPD know
what you're up to let chat gbt know its
role and responsibility right it should
understand what you are expecting from
it so I'm trying to convince it that it
is a professional resume writer and I'm
telling it to check out a job
description which I'll be sending it in
a m and then I need it help to create me
a cover letter and resume right now let
it know about the job description okay
I'll give you a job
description we need to understand
the
key the key points of this job and
critical
expectations from the
candidate here are critical expectations
from the candidate here is
the JD
now is given me some of the critical
roles and responsibilities that this
particular job role demands from the
candidates now uh you have all this
right so you need a cover letter first
so give me a cover
letter covering top three
responsibilities or highlighting instead
of covering you can write it as
highlighting in my according okay so
give me a cover letter highlighting the
top three
responsibilities keep the cover
letter under 200
words so here you have your cover letter
dear hiring manager I'm writing to
express my Keen interest in data an
position at your esteemed organization
and uh I bring expertise in three
pivotal rules some of the uh corporate
languages that chat gbt helps you with
is the one key factor which will help
you crack your uh you know uh the
initial stages of the interview you can
just get uh a clickbait from the hiring
manager and it's the best chance to get
your resume selected now let us proceed
with the resume
right build me
resume using the job
description so this is is what you
actually do but uh I would recommend you
to go a step further right now you can
use this template it will give you
professional summary key skills required
professional experience correct and
education so this is not everything so
what you need to do is take the key
responsibilities right so you can take
the professional summary as is given by
chat GPD or you can enhance it based on
your own words and you can give your
basic details about your name address
ZIP code email address phone number
LinkedIn profile Etc you can go with the
same professional summary or you can
enhance it in your own words and coming
back to key skills you can add your key
skills here based on the profile you're
adding and uh here you have professional
experience and here you just have plain
English plain statements right so what I
would recommend is the plain English
points will not help you you can take
the entire template as it t and when it
comes to your uh uh professional
experience I would suggest a few
modifications here so these are the few
modifications which will help you and
your resume to stand up from the others
correct so here you can add your
educational qualifications your
certifications and professional
membership so in case if you have any
professional certifications from
authorized organizations you can also
take them and attach them to this
particular re
and references will be available upon
request now coming back to the critical
modification that I was been suggesting
you so when it comes to professional
experience let's say I have this
particular professional experience on my
resumer right so what I could do is uh
tell chat
jbd uh or you can also use the same uh
detail that it gave you you can copy
this
and ask CH to quantify
this can you please
is
FY my
experience you can
use terms
like 15% organic
growth
10% reduction in expenses
for
advertisement is
in increased Revenue per
lead lead by 12% so you can just add on
some numbers right so it will when you
quantify your experience when you
quantify your pointers it will help the
potential recruiter to understand your
potential in a much better way and your
resume will also be shortlisted there
you go you have your new resume here and
again giving you some key notes on this
particular area so what you can do is
you can also modify or enhance these uh
professional experience based on the top
problems faced by the company or top key
critical roles and responsibilities that
you need to fill right to solve those
problems in that particular company and
take those possessions and secure the
company right that's the overall point
of it so ensure that these particular
professional experience fall in line
with these key skills at least the top
three right and that will be
self-explanatory for your recruiter and
the rest of the part is as usual so the
chart GPT resume always follows the ads
format and the only major different what
it makes is right the only uh difference
what your regime and the rest of the
people resume make is the difference in
the way you are quantifying your
achievements the way you are measuring
your capabilities and adding them onto
your resume to catch the eye of the
recruiter are the few things that matter
today we will discuss about booming
topic of this era multimodel AI let's
understand with an example imagine you
are showing a friend your vacation
photos you might describe the site you
saw the sounds you Hur and even your
emotions this is how humans naturally
understand the world by combining
information from different sources
multimodel AI aims to do the same thing
let's break the model AI first
multimodel refers to two different ways
of communicating information like text
speech images and videos where AI stands
for artificial intelligence which are
systems that can learn and make decision
so multimodel AI is a type of AI that
can process and understand information
from multiple sources just like you do
when you look at at your vacation photos
now that we have understood what is
multimodel AI let's now go a bit further
it is obvious that multimodel AI is not
the only AI out there but what is big
deal about multimodel AI that everyone
is talking about that is what we will
discuss in this segment so now let's
understand the difference between
multimodel Ai and the generative AI
while both multimodel Ai and generative
AI are exciting advancement in AI they
differ in their approach to data and
functionality so generative AI Focus
creates new data similar to the data
it's strained down and in multimodel AI
focus is to understand and processes
information from multiple sources that
is text speech images and videos data
types of generative AI are primarily
works with a single data type like text
writing poems or images that is
generating realistic portraits whereas
in multimodel AI data types works with
diverse data types enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the world
the third one is examples like chat
boards text generation models image
editing tools whereas multimodel AI
example covers virtual assistance
medical diagnosis system and autonomous
vehicles strength are can produce
creative and Innovative content
automated repetitive task and
personalize your experience whereas in
multimodel AI stren are provides a more
humanlike understanding of the world and
and improve accuracy in essence
generative AI excels at creating new
data while multimodel AI excels at
understanding and utilizing exising data
from diverse sources they can be
complimentary with generative models
being used to create new data for
multimodel AI systems to learn more from
and improve their understanding to the
work next let's understand what are the
benefits of multimodel AI the benefits
of multimodel AI is that it offers
developers and users an AI with more
more advanced reasoning problem solving
and generation capabilities these
advancement offers endless possibilities
for how Next Generation application can
change the way we work and live for
developers looking to start building Vex
AI gini API offers features such as
Enterprise security data residency
performance and technical support if
you're existing Google Cloud customers
can start prompting with Gemini AI in
Vex AI right now next next let's see
what are the multimodel AI big
challenges multimodel AI is powerful but
faces hurdles the first one is data
overload managing and storing massive
diverse data is expensive and complex
the second one is meaning mystery
teaching AI to understand subtle
difference in between meaning like
sarcasm is tricky the third one is data
alignment ensuring data points from
different sources saying in tune is
challenging the fourth one is data
scarcity limited and potentially biased
data sets hinder effective training the
fifth one is missing data Blues what
happens when data is missing like
disorted audio the last one is Black Box
Blues understanding how AI makes
decision can be difficult so these
challenges must be addressed to unlock
the full potential of model AI next
let's see what is the future of
multimodel AI and why is it important
multimodel Ai and multimodels are
represent Leap Forward in how developers
build and expand the functionality of AI
in the next generation of application
for example Gemini can understand
explain and generate high quality code
in the world's most popular programming
languages like python Java C++ and go
freeing developers to work on building
more featured fill application
multimodels AI potential also bring the
world closer to AI That's less like
smart software and more like an expert
