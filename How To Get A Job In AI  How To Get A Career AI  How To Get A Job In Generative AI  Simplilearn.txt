description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start if you want to
learn AI an ml from the industry expert
try a simply learns postgraduate program
in Ai and machine learning from P
University in collaboration with IBM
this score teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
compter Vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engineering chat GT
and many more so don't forget to check
out the course link from the description
box below and the pin comment so without
any further Ado let's get started so now
let's see steps to get an AI engineer
job so to thrive in this field
developing a comprehensive skill set is
crucial while encompasses May
specialized areas so here are some
certain code skills that are essential
across most roles so here is you can
build the easy skills first one is
technical skills so AI roles heavily
rely on technical expertise particularly
in programming data handling or working
with AI specific tools or you can say
the cloud specific tools so here are
some key areas to focus on the first one
is the programming languages so profy in
journal purpose programming language
like Python and R is a fundamental
python in particular is widely used in
AI for Simplicity and robust liability
such as T oflow and python which are
crucial for machine learning and deep
learning T the second one is database
management so understanding how to
manage and manipulate large data set is
essential in AI familiarity with
database Management Systems like Apache
cassendra couch base and Dynamo DB will
allow you to store retrieve and process
data efficiently the third one data
analysis and statistics strong skills in
data analysis are must tools like matlb
Exel and pandas are invaluable for
statical analysis data manipulation and
visualization Trends and data which are
critical for developing AI models fourth
one Cloud AI platform knowing of
cloud-based AI platform such as
Microsoft Azure AI Google Cloud Ai and
IBM Watson is increasingly important so
these platform provide pre-build models
tools and infrastructure that can
accelerate AI development and deployment
the second one is industry knowledge
while technical skills from the backbone
of your AI expertise understanding the
industry context is equally important
for example knowing how AI integrates
with digital marketing goals and
strategies can be significant Advantage
if you are working in or targeting
Industries like e-commerce or
advertising so industry specific
knowledge allows you to apply AI
Solutions more effectively and
communicate their value to stakeholders
the third one workplace or soft skills
in addition to technical industry
specific skills developing workplace
skills or you can say soft skill is
essentially for success in AI roles or
any rules so these softare skills often
hor through experience include the first
one is communication clearly
articulating complex AI concept to
non-technical stakeholder is crucial
whether you are explaining how machine
learning model works or presenting data
driven Insight effective communication
ensure that your work is understood and
valued second one is collaboration AI
projects often require teamwork across
diverse field including data science
software development and other things
the third one is analytical thinking a
is fundamentally about problem solving
you will need a strong analytical
thinking skills to approach challenges
logically break them down into
manageable parts and develop Innovative
solution the fourth one problem solving
AI projects frequently involve
unexpected challenges whether it's a
technical bug or an unforeseen data
issue strong problem solving will help
you navigate these hurdles and key
projects on TR so building these skills
can be achieved through various methods
including self-study online courses boot
camp soft formal education additionally
working on real projects contributing to
open source CI initiatives and seeking
mentorship can provide practical
experience and further enhance your
expertise so next thing is learn
Advanced topics so as you advanced in
your machine Learning Journey it is
important to delve into more advanced
topics these areas will deepen your
understandings and help you tackle
complex problem so some key topics to
focus are the first one is deep learning
and neural network the second thing is
instable learning techniques the third
thing is generative models and aders
learning the fourth one is
recommendation system and collaborative
filtering the fifth one is time series
analysis and forecasting so now let's
move forward and see some machine
learning projects so working on real
world projects to apply your knowledge
focus on data collection and preparation
Capstone project in image recognition
and NLP predictive modeling and enal
detection practical experience key to
solidifying your skills so now let's
move forward and see what is the next
skill that is on a certification so if
you are already hold on undergraduate
degree in a field of related to AI
enrolling in specialized course to
enhance your technical skills can be
highly beneficial even if you don't have
a degree earning certification can show
potential employers that you are
committed to your career goals and
actively investing in your professional
development so you can unleash your
career potential with our artificial
intelligence and machine learning
courses tailor for diverse industry and
roles at top Global forms our program
features key tools enhance your AI
knowledge and business equipment join
the job market and become soft after
professional the next thing is
continuous learning and exploration so
stay updated with the latest development
by following industry leaders engaging
in online committees and working on
person project pursue Advanced learning
through courses and certification to
keep your skill sharp so now let's move
forward and see some AI career
opportunities with salary so the job
market for machine learning professional
is booming the average annual salary for
AI Engineers can be veryy based on
location experience and Company so here
are some roles like machine learning
engineer data scientist NLP engineer
computer vision and AIML researcher so
now let's see how much they earn so the
first one is ml engineer so machine
learning Engineers earn $153,000 in us
and 11 lakh in India per anom the second
one is data senters the data centers
earn $150,000 in us and 12 lakh perom in
India the third one is NLP engineer they
earn
$17,000 in us and 7 lakh in India perom
fourth one is compter Vision engineer CV
engineer they earn around
$126,000 in us and 650,000 in India the
last one is AIML researchers they earn
$130,000 in us and in India they earn
around 9 lakh perm so note that these
these figures can vary on website to
website and changes frequently so now
last step is start applying for
entry-level jobs when you feel confident
in your training begin researching and
applying for jobs many entry-level AI
positions like software engineer or
developer roles are often labeled as
entry level or Junior in the job
