with the increased exchange of multiple
information and data units across
distinct network models
the need for hdlc protocols arises in
the network channel
these protocols are used by the data
link layer to apply a efficient and
secure channel between multiple network
devices
hi guys and welcome to year 10 and
untrusting video by simply learn
but before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to remiss an update
from us now without further ado let's
take a look at the agenda for today's
session
to begin with we will look into what is
hdlc
moving on with different hdlc stations
available
different hdlc transfer models
and then looking into hdlc frame model
and types
now let's move on to the first heading
that is
what is hdlc
let's take a look
the hdlc stands for high level data link
control
refers to the bit oriented network
protocol design to connect multiple
network system according to the
communication requirement
the hdlc model applies the airq protocol
for application and establishes a full
duplex communication channel between the
network devices
moving on we have the different types of
hdlc stations available
hdlc stations can efficiently be
differentiated into three different
types where the first type is primary
station
in this station it handles the
establishing and de-establishing of the
primary data channel to share different
frames in the network channel
known as commands
it also performs the data management for
the network
moving on we have the secondary station
this station work under the command of
the primary station and the frames
issued by the stations are known as
responses
as for the last station we have combined
station as the name suggests this type
of station is available for both
commands and response value
next we will look into hdlc transfer
models
the hdlc protocol supports two types of
transfer models which are applied
according to the need of communication
channel where the first type is known as
normal response model or in short nrm
this transfer model combines the primary
station and the secondary station in a
point-to-point or multi-point
configuration
to exchange commands from primary
station and responses from the secondary
station
and response to the multi-connection
moving on we have the second type of
transfer model which is asynchronous
balanced model
in this transfer model the combined
stations are installed in a
point-to-point configuration for
exchange of command or responses from
either of the node
moving on let's take a look at the hdlc
frame model and types
the data unit for sharing information in
the hdlc protocol is known as frames
the hdlc frame consists of multiple
frame fields which may vary according to
the frame type
in general the hdlc frame consists of
five different frame fields where the
first field is flag field
in hdlc each frame starts with the flag
field in the configuration and is
defined by an 8-bit octet sequence which
is 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 in the flag field
moving on we have the address field it
encapsulates the receiver's address in
the field for example if the frame is
sent from the primary station it
contains the secondary station's address
and vice versa
next we have the control field this
field contains the flow and error
control information in byte format
next we have payload or the information
field it carries the actual information
from the upper layer of the osi model
and the last field is known as fcs field
this field stands for frame sequence
check
and acts as an error detection field in
the hdlc protocol which includes a 6-bit
crc check
given is a frame format for an hdlc
protocol
with flag
in the both ending and the starting
point followed by address field control
field
information field and fcs view
now let's take up a quiz
to understand all the things we have
learned so far
the question is
the hdlc protocol functions under which
network layer in the osm model
and the options are
application layer
data link layer
physical layer
and the network layer
you can give your answers in the
comments section
now let's move on to different types of
frame models available in hdlc
the frame models in hdlc can be
classified of following three types
depending upon the control field value
of the frame
where the first frame is known as iframe
the iframe stands for information frame
and is applied to encapsulate the user
information from the upper layer in the
model
and then transmit it to the network
channel
note the first bit of the control field
in this frame is always 0
which also acts as an identification
point for iframe
moving on we have the s frame
the s frame stands for supervisory frame
and is used for error and data flow
control and does not contain any
information regarding the information
field in the format
note for the s frame s the first two
bits of the control field is one and
zero
which acts as an identification point
for s frame
as for the last type of frame model we
have
u-frame
the u-frame stands for unnumbered frame
used for system management and
exchanging information between connected
network devices
with this we have covered all the
relevant information regarding the hdlc
protocol

topic you can ask them in the comment
