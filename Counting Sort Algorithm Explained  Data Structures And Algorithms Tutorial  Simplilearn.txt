hey everyone i am peppa khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel
in this session we will discuss the
counting sort algorithm
we shall begin our session by
introducing counting sort
then we will discuss counting sort
algorithm
after that we will implement the
counting sort algorithm in the co-data
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn's
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction to counting
sort
a counting sort is a sorting algorithm
that sorts the elements of an array by
counting the number of occurrence of
each unique element in the array the
count is stored in an auxiliary array
and the sorting is done by mapping the
count as an index of that auxiliary
array
now let's discuss the counting sort
algorithm
let's say we have an array
first we will find the largest element
in this array to evaluate the range of
the elements
then we will create a count array to
store the count of element from the
array
then we will update the count arrays
element with a cumulative count
at last we will output each element from
the array followed by decreasing its
count by 1.
we have now introduced the counting sort
and its algorithm
now let's try to implement this
algorithm in the code editor
let's start by creating account sort
function
void
count sort
its argument as int arr
comma and
n
we will declare an array
output
size 10
and an array count
again with the size 10
and an integer variable max
is equals to
arr at 0.
now we will write a for loop to find the
largest element of this array
so for
end i is equals to 1
i less than n
i plus plus
if
a r
at i
is greater than max
then max
will be equals to
arr at i
now we will initialize the count array
with all zeros
so for
and i is equals to 0
to i less than equals to max
plus plus i
count
at i
is equals to zero
now we will store the count of each
element in this array so for loop
and
i is equals to zero
i less than n
i plus plus
count
at arr bracket i
is plus plus
now we will write a for loop to store
the cumulative count of each array so 4
and
i is equals to
1
where i is less than equals to max
at i plus plus
count
at i
is equals to
plus equals to
count
at i
minus 1
now we will find the index of each
element of the original array in count
error and place the elements in the
output array
so for
end
i is equals to n
minus 1
i
greater than equals to 0
i minus minus
so output
account
at arr
i
minus
one
is equals to
arr
at i
and
then we will decrease count
arr
i
by one
now let's write a function to print this
array so void
print array
so end
arr bracket
comma end
n
so for loop
i is equals to 0
i less than n
i plus plus
c out
arr
at i
handle
now
let's write the main block
and
arr
is equals to
we will write the element
now let's find out the size of this
array so end n is equals to
size of
array
divided by
size of
that is first element
now we will call the count sort function
arr comma and
now we will print this array so print
array
arr comma n
now let's try and execute this
as you can see we have successfully
sorted this array using counting sort
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned from this session
first up counting sort is not an
comparison based sorting algorithm next
up it is frequently used as subroutine
in other sorting algorithms such as
radix sort
next up counting sort can be performed
only on positive integers
finally counting sort utilizes a partial
hashing to calculate the data item
occurrence in big o of one
and this was all for today's session
