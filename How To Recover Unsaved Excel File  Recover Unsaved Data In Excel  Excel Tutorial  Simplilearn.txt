hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning how to recover unsaved data
in excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech gig in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply done now at times you might be
working on a really important
spreadsheet on your excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some pocket issue and you forgot to
save or you missed to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly going to discuss the same
and see how to do it in multiple ways so
excel comes up with an option to
automatically save the data also it will
try to warn you that your data is not
being saved would you like me to save it
or not right so we'll do the first one
so here you have the auto save option
you can either say ok to it or you can
ignore it in case if you ignore it if
you choose to ignore it or if you choose
to manually save it and then if you want
to close the file remember we haven't
saved the file if you wish to close it
excel will automatically come up with a
dialog box asking you want to save your
changes to your data.xlsx
that means it is asking you if i have to
save it or not
let's try to ignore this and
forcefully let's try to close it you can
go to task manager option here we are
trying to simulate the option of pocket
issues
so we are forcefully closing excel
without saving any data
so we have closed it now here you can
see we do not have excel running in the
background now when you directly open or
try to start excel when you get the
power backup again and if you want to
open that same data file it will ask you
the document recovery option it says you
have closed the file without saving the
changes and you can choose to you know
come back from the same place where we
left last time okay
now that was the pocket issue and now
let's see uh another way okay let's
imagine that somebody uh eliminated a
few important data files from your
organization's confidential data
employee id employee name etc and again
let's simulate the force
close of the excel
now we are closing it again without
saving no data has been saved
now it will also ask the same
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place
so this was one way also we have another
few multiple ways just we have to
navigate to file and here you can open
and in the open menu you have a button
called recover unsaved workbooks not
just the current workbook it will also
have all the remaining files
which are related to excel that are not
saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option
we can just navigate to info
and there you have another option called
manage workbook and in the manage
workbook you have another option called
recover unsaved workbooks which will
also redirect you to the same file that
is microsoft office unsaved files and
you will have all the ncaa workbooks
which are related to excel so this is
how you can recover the unsaved data in
excel using multiple ways first thing
excel will automatically ask you if you
have to save the file or not and in case
if you forget to save it you can
directly recover it by default by excel
it will automatically show that some
folder was not saved on the left side of
your excel spreadsheet by default and in
case if you missed out on that one you
can manually go to file and you can
either choose open option or info option
to recover the unsaved folders from your
default file location from your pc that
is microsoft office unsaved files etc
which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to excel
now with that we have come to an end of

data from excel if you have any queries
