welcome to MDS conquer online finish
line goes for the first MBA students
paper one today myself dr. Sethe uses
free consultant author on this team MDS
conquer going to discuss about prenatal
and postnatal growth and development of
the mandible this is the continuation of
the previous videos which is which are
describing the development of the face
and also the development of the maxilla
and as a general topic the development
of the mandible and maxilla are
discussed in other videos so I am now in
this video I am only including the extra
points which we have to write as in the
orthodontic perspective and I am just
giving a outline which contents are to
be included in your answer for the
prenatal and postnatal development of
the mandible so you have to include the
anatomy of the mandible and prenatal
development of the mandible mandible at
the time of birth postnatal development
of the mandible mandibular rotations
which are described in the previous
video so you have to write from the
growth rotations you the mandibular
rotations which are discussed earlier
and the development of the mandible in
relation to various theories of the
growth and the a changes in the mandible
how they appear prenatally and in the
infant age at the time of birth and in
the adult and what are the various
muscle attachments which are present and
the clinical implications of the growth
and development and what are the various
developmental anomalies if you study
these developmental anomalies as a part
of this prenatal and postnatal
development of the mandible itself you
can answer the question which will come
as an essay question or a 75 marks
question that is various craniofacial
deformities so the craniofacial
anomalies of the maxilla and mandible
should be included in the craniofacial
deformities so I'm just running through
the prenatal development of the mandible
it develops from the mandibular arch and
it is explained in the previous video
and the importance of the meckel's
catalyst should be definitely
studied and this this Michael's
cartilage alone can come as a seven max
question so brief description of the
Michael's cartilage is necessary and
what is the time at which the Michael's
cartilage appears that is a sixth week
of in Torun life and the center of the
ausf
of the Michael Scott center of the
ossification of the mandibular arch lies
a de beside a mental foramen and most of
the Michael's cartilage will disappear
only a remnant of the metal miracles
catalyst remains so you have to write
about the fate of the Michaels cartilage
and what are the extremities developed
that is incus and man use or also
developed in the Michael Scott life so
it's alone can come as a seven max
question then you have to include all
the parts of Michael's cartilage and
what it forms the mandible mandible
major part is formed by the Michaels
cartilage only okay next what are the
other secondiy cartilages involved in
the mandibular development so Michaels
catalyst will form the ramus of the
ramus in the body of the mandible
whereas the other parts like kondal and
coronoid are exceptionally secondary
cartilages and the symphysis L cartilage
present in the midline so you have to
explain how they are formed so this is
the condylar process which is formed at
the 10th week so you have to explain the
position of the condyle which is present
away from the body of the mandible that
is this is formed by the meckel's
cartilage and this is the secondary
cartilage which is fun and gradually
attaches to the mandible this is the
coronoid process and this is the
condylar process so coronoid process
will appear as 10 to 50 weak and the
mantle region symphysis these are all
the three are secondary cartilages so
with this the prenatal development of
the mandible will complete and at the
time of the birth how the mandible
appears so it is very short and you have
to describe the mandible at the time of
the birth and later
postnatally that is after the birth it
expands through V principle which is
explained in the previous videos and
another seven marks question may ask and
you have to include in this question is
the endless counterpart principle that
is for every part there is an opposite
counterpart which is growing at the same
pace so maxilla and mandible are
counterparts to each other and the
middle cranial fossa is a counterpart to
the Naza maxillary fossa
so like this the counterpart principal
growth equivalent concept runs and you
have to read this and this is also a
seven max question and the mandibular
remodeling takes place by resorption and
bone deposition deposit the
in this picture pyrite arrows and the
blue arrows they are measured and you
have to individually each part should be
described how the desorption takes place
at particular part okay so the growth at
the condyle how it takes place and what
are the parts of the condyle articular
cartilage and the growth cartilage the
remaining of the growth cartilage acts
as the second the cartilage for the rest
of the period and this because of this
region the functional appliance
treatment plan can be run in the
orthotics
so that implication you have to include
in the growth condyle next is the
condyle and neck and this is also a
specific part rather than the other
other parts you have to explain how the
condylar net also include get includes
into the ramus of the body and how it
gets into a shape in the form of a neck
okay and next comes your sigmoid not
coronoid process and growth if the ramus
how it happens and angle of the mandible
and angle of the mandible you have to
write both outer surface and the lingual
surfaces and the lingual tuberosity and
how the anti corneal notch is formed
okay because of the muscle pull the anti
go neol notch is formed in the case of
mandibular body of the mandible
next comes um late mandibular growth so
sometimes the postnatal growth of the
growth and development of the mandible
alone is asked so then after birth how
the changes in every part of the
mandible is explained and later you have
to include certain articles regarding
the late mandibular growth also what
does late mandibular growth mean
especially when compared to maxilla as
the Civello caudal gradient mandible
grows at a puberty age than maxilla
maxillary growth restricts first and
mandibular hood completes next so the
one of the three events may occur and
majority of the articles reported that
the crowding is mainly because of the
late mandibular growth and this point
you have to include and these are the
three events which are present and these
two are the more important events that /
incisors may play forward and opening of
these spaces of the spaces between the
maxillary teeth and lower incisors made
distally this place in coming to the
Remo
of the chin this one also the chin will
also develop only after the puberty age
and that and the bone deposition takes
place how it takes place everything bone
remodeling of the chin should be
explained and next is the annular
process as the teeth emerges the whole
inner process also remodeling takes
place and this is the just a table which
is explaining each and every surface
where the bone deposition and bone
resorption takes place resulting in
which dimension that is the transverse
dimension or the anterior-posterior or
the vertical dimension so this table
should be included in your answer in the
case of postnatal growth of the mandible
next this is the differential growth so
at eight weeks how the growth takes
place mandible is greater than maxilla
but at the thirteen thirteen to twenty
weeks maxilla is greater than mandible
at the time of birth mandible tends to
be retro Matic and early postnatal life
the orthographic mandible will be
present so next comes your rotation of
the mandible during the growth these are
already discussed we know growth
rotations video so you can go through
and you have to include in the case of
twenty marks question you have to
include the rotations of mandible next
these are the eight changes in the
mandible in infants what is the position
of your mental foramen mandibular canal
and angle of the mandible here the
mandibular cannoli is concerned as a
more stable point so you have to mention
how it changes from infant to the adults
and in the old age how the changes of
the mandible are present next is the
timing of the growth in the width length
and height different dimensions of the
growth of the mandible should be
answered here and these are the various
changes in girls and boys depending upon
the gender differences also there are
changes in your Mandeville you are
timing and the at last a concept you
have to include the muscle attachments
totally thirteen muscles are present so
you have to write order all the muscle
attachments of your in the later surface
and also on the medial surfaces of the
mandible finally the clinical
implication of growth in development
here functionally how we can use the
growth and development of the growth and
development of the mandible in your
orthodontic therapy so the functional
appliances like activity by Anita chin
cup and face
mas can be used and these are the
anomalies of the development so these
anomaly these syndromes you can include
in your answer of craniofacial
deformities okay this is a brief
description of your growth in
development of the mandible and
depending upon this you can develop your
answer we are concerning to a particular
number of marks 20 months or 70 from 20
bucks or seven marks question and this
cannot be asked this and long answer
this is only a seven MUX question or
twenty marks question okay thank you
