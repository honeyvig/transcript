ethereum 2.0 is an upgraded ethereum and
everybody knows about it
but everyone is curious to know when
this upgrade is going to be released so
they could take advantage of its more
efficient and enhanced resources
hey everyone i am shanghi and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on ethereum 2.0
in this video we will explore ethereum
2.0 and will go through some of the
fascinating concepts and components
revolving around it
first we will have a quick introduction
of what is ethereum network
then we will look into what ethereum 2.0
is
then we will understand what led to the
origin of ethereum 2.0
then we will understand the changes in
ethereum 2.0
then we will look into the current
status of ethereum 2.0 research
and at last what future we expect for
ethereum 2.0
so without doing much ado let's get
started with the video
so what is the ethereum network
ethereum is defined as a blockchain
based computing platform that enables
its developers to build and deploy
decentralized application
ether is the cryptocurrency for ethereum
used to build decentralized application
smart contracts and make standard
peer-to-peer payments
it tracks and facilitates all the
transactions and make sure they are
cryptographically secure in the network
ether basically acts as a fuel for the
ethereum network
so what is ethereum 2.0
ethereum 2.0 is a set of interrelated
upgrades that will make the ethereum
network more secure scalable and
sustainable
multiple teams from across the ethereum
ecosystem have come together to work on
these upgrades in ethereum 2.0
then what led to the region of ethereum
2.0
with growing popularity ether and the
ethereum network has gotten more blocked
by transactions
currently it is capable of handling 15
to 45 transactions per second which is
comparatively impressive but it is not
enough to handle all of italian's users
worldwide
also the high demand is affecting the
driving up of transaction fees
nodes power the ethereum blockchain
network but currently its nodes are
experiencing too much volume
although the programmers working on the
upgrade have claimed that making its
nodes bigger wouldn't be practical
ethereum 2.0 intends to make the network
more scalable to handle all of the
activities on the ethereum network
that makes us wonder what are the
changes in ethereum 2.0
the two significant changes that will
come with the upgrade are adopting proof
of stake and sharding
adopting proof of stake ethereum
blockchain implementations suffer from
performance issues because they rely on
a processing power intensive process
known as proof of work
to record and validate their
transactions
the problem with proof-of-work design is
that it's very inefficient
ethereum 2.0 will solve these issues by
transitioning its blockchain to a more
efficient proof-of-stake system
it will decrease the complexities faced
by the network leading to massive
throughput gains for the whole network
sharding is a process that intends to
enhance ethereum's efficiency and
ability to scale
in the current version of ethereum
blockchain all data that is added to the
chain
undergoes verification by all
participating nodes
that means that the speed of its fluids
participant limits the processing speed
of the entire network
sharding will increase the efficiency of
the network resources by breaking data
verification tasks among its set of
nodes
and each of them will be responsible for
validating and verifying just the data
allotted to them
this will increase the network's overall
capacity and make it much faster and
efficient than its outdated version
so what is the current status of
ethereum 2.0 research
while ethereum 2.0 has been in research
and development since 2014.
it has actually been making some
progress the beacon chain went live in
december 2020 introducing this taking
concept but still there is no official
claim for the completion of this
transition
the next phase is mainnet
merging the beacon chain into the
current ethereum network
mining ethereum tokens will officially
end in this phase and staking will
become the primary way to create new
tokens in the ethereum network
the last part of the transition is
expected to unfold in multiple phases
like adding the sharp chains to give the
ethereum blockchain network more
capacity and efficiency to handle all of
the demand and increased transactions
per second
although it has been a long road and
there is still a good deal of
uncertainty around the timing the
ethereum developers do seem to be
motivated and on their way to completing
the whole transition so what is the
future of ethereum 2.0
if executed properly this transition to
ethereum 2.0 could be a total game
changer it will create a modified
network that could potentially process
one lag transactions per second
and a much more sustainable network
without the energy intensive mining
process and it will introduce smart
contracts worldwide
increasing the ethereum's network
utility
furthermore ethereum co-founder with
alex buduran once said that the issuance
of new token should be highly reduced
under ethereum 2.0 which could increase
its demand
given all these factors ethereum 2.0
seems to hold a bright future for
ethereum blockchain network
so this is all about ethereum 2.0 we
have almost reached the end of this
