hey guys I'm sure you all have heard
about phrases like web development full
stack development front end and backend
development but if you are not sure
about what exactly they mean or how
they're different then don't worry
you're in the right place this video on
frontend versus backend development will
help you differentiate the
two but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an
update now let's Jump Right In and look
at what's in store for
us so first we look at what exactly web
development is then we look at the
different types of web
development going ahead we'll look at
what front end development is and
understand what exactly back end
development is
and lastly we'll be comparing the two on
the basis of languages libraries and
Frameworks skills job roles and
S so now let's begin by understanding
what web development
is web development is the process of
creating a website on the
internet it refers to the non-design
aspects of a website such as creating
features and functionality using
programming markup and scripting
languages developers concentrate on the
technical aspects of web development
such as architecture programming
application integration and
Graphics now let's look at the different
types of web
development now web development could
include the front end and the back end
now
together they form something called as
full stack development now I'm sure
you're wondering what they actually mean
so let's go ahead and understand
them let's begin by understanding what
front-end development
is now front end development is the part
of the website that codes and creates
front-end elements of a website which
are features that are directly viewable
and accessible by the client now
essentially a front-end developer is in
charge of everything you see be styling
Graphics text alignment navigation
colors Etc and he attempts and he
attempts to improve the user experience
to make it as seamless as
possible now these front-end developers
also contribute to the overall design
and aesthetic along with
debugging responsiveness and performance
are the two main objectives of front-end
development then what exactly is backend
development you guessed it right now web
development that occurs at the back end
of programs is actually accurately
termed as backend
development now this backend development
covers serers side web application logic
and integration and activities like
writing apis creating libraries and
working with system competents as
opposed to front end development which
focuses on customer facing services and
programs now backend developers create
code that allows database and an
application to communicate with each
other essentially a backend developer
handles what you don't see we are in
charge of the back end of the website
which includes servers databases and
applications so now that you have a
brief understanding of what frontend
development is and backend development
is let's go ahead and compare the
two so we'll be comparing the two based
on five different features that is
languages libraries and Frameworks
skills job roles and
salaries now let's begin with languages
now front development typically includes
coding using languages like HTML CSS and
JavaScript now as you all know HTML is a
markup language that is standardized
system for tagging text files to achieve
font color graphics and hyperlinks now
CSS is used to format the layout of
these web pages and JavaScript is used
to create interactive elements on the
web
page when it comes to backend the
languages include python chash Java
Pearl PHP Ruby and some JavaScript now
Java in particular was built from ground
up to run on the server side so Java is
extremely useful python is also one of
the most popularly used languages and C
language is the preferred architecture
for backend programming in Windows
environments now talking about libraries
and Frameworks frontend libraries and
Frameworks include reactjs angular view
jQuery and bootstrap while talking about
backend Frameworks we have expressjs
node spring Jango flask JSF asp.net and
net
MVC now front-end and backend developers
work very closely so it's helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end developer Technologies like
HTML and CSS as well moving on to skills
now frontend developers are in charge of
bringing visual elements to a website as
well as interactive ele M such as
navigation buttons and anything else
that improves overall
usability HTML JavaScript and CSS are
frequently used to ensure that a site's
visual side operates well so it's
crucial to know these languages and a
good understanding of JavaScript
Frameworks and libraries is also
essential and other General skills
include a good grasp of front-end
programming languages the ability to
create a responsive design the knowledge
of testing and debugging and an
understanding understanding of frontend
development tools like automation
content management Version Control
Systems talking about the skills
required for backend
development now backend developers deal
with backend languages and Frameworks
like Java Ruby on Rails Etc now backend
developers deal with languages like Java
Ruby on Rails Etc to make web pages and
applications operate now it's vital to
know commonly used backend languages and
Frameworks like Jango no JS expressjs
and so on other important skills include
database management framework
utilization programming knowledge of
accessibility and security compliance
and understanding requirements and
ensuring data consistency and
integrity now moving ahead let's look at
some of the job roles for front-end and
backend development talking about
front-end we have the front-end
developer the CSS or HTML developer we
have frontend web designer we have front
SEO expert full stack developer and a UI
developer talking about backend there's
backend developer Java developer full
stack developer devops engineer software
engineer and an iOS
Developer and lastly let's look at the
salaries offered to these front-end and
backend developers in India the average
salary of a front-end developer is
around 6 lakh rupees perom
while a backend developer earns about 7
lakh rupees perom in the US a front-end
developer earns around 100,000 perom
while a backend developer earns about
$121,000
perom and so with that we conclude this
session on frontend versus backend
development now if you have any doubts
