hey guys this is harsh badass from
simply learn and welcome to this video
where we'll be telling you how you can
install c plus on vs code and dev c plus
plus after we are done with the
installation we'll also learn how to run
a program on both of these code editors
so we'll start with visual studio code
to download vs code let's go to google
and search for visual studio code
or vs code
we'll click on this first link
this is the official web page for
downloading the visual studio code
and we'll now click on this download for
windows blue button
and now we'll click on download now
here it is getting download and
as you can see
thanks for downloading visual studio
code for windows
once we are done with the download we
can click on this open folder
here it is
now we need to install this file so
we'll double click on this file
and this is a setup wizard
we'll click on this i accept the
agreement
and we'll click on next
as we have accepted the licensing
agreement now
we can select our destination folder or
we can leave it as it is but make sure
there must be 293.2 mb of free space on
that particular disk space now
we'll click on next
here we can again click on x there is no
need to change over here
and now
you can click on this create a desktop
icon button or anyone else as per your
choice
now we'll click on next
and now we'll click finally on install
it is getting installed it will take
some time
now we can click on this finish button
launch visual studio we have marked it
it is already marked so when we click on
this finish button it will launch the
visual studio code
so as we can see this is the visual
studio code
so as we have installed vs code now we
have to configure it so that the c plus
programs can run in this code editor
so in order to do that we need to add
some extensions so we'll click on this
extensions button
now here we will write code runner
extension
right code
runner and this is extension
when click on this install
and it is getting installed
here are some instructions we can click
on control plus alt plus n
or press f1 and then select type run
code
but we'll deal with that later
now
we'll add another extension that is
c
slash c plus
here it is we'll click on this install
here you can see downloading visual
studio windows debugger
it is getting installed and i think it
is installed now so as we have added
both the extensions so let's move on and
do a program of cps plus in this code
editor
okay
so first of all we'll create a new file
we'll go to file and click on this new
file
now in order to save this one we can
click on control s or we can go over
here and click on this save as
now we can select the location
like
let's keep it over here only
let's name it as
visual dot cpp
dot cpp is extension which is used when
we want to do a program in c plus
now we'll click on this save button
now let's do a simple program to check
whether the program is running on this
code editor or not
so we'll include the header files
i should include iostream
now we'll write namespace standard
now we'll write int main
now inside int main will display a
message
welcome to this video
okay now return zero
make sure to
save this after making changes or you
can click on control s
or you can go to file
and click on this save
so once you have saved the program now
you can run it
we can click on this play button
it will run the code
as we can see in the output
welcome to this video we can see
here it is
so
it means our program is working it is
running fine
now let's do another example in which we
will take the inputs from the user
so let's make a new file
we'll go to file and click on this new
file
now
we'll save as
and we'll write
visual
2.cpp
all right in this program we'll take the
input from the user so start with
header files hash include iostream
our spelling is wrong
hash include iostream after that
using namespace standard
now inside int main
will take the inputs from the user
will display the message
enter the
first
number
now using c in
we'll take the input
we forgot to mention this
declare this n1 variable so
write int n1
int n2
and int
sum equals 0
all right here we have taken the input
of n1 the first number
now we'll take the input of another
number
by displaying the message
enter the second number
we'll write n2
now we'll
add both of these
and one plus
n2
and will display the result
we'll write endline
so that it looks good
all right now we need to save it
we'll go to file
and click on this save
now it is saved now we can run this
program
we will click on this run code
now in order to write the first number
over here that is in order to write in
the terminal we have to configure the
visual studio code
and to do that
we'll go to file
and we'll now go to preference
and in the settings we'll click on the
settings
and here we will type run in terminal
all right now we can scroll down
and here we can see code runner run in
terminal in my via studio it is already
marked but you have to mark this if you
want to
write in terminal or enter the inputs in
the terminal
all right once you have marked this you
can
close it and
then you can control s that is save
and then you can
close the vs studio and then open it
again
once you are done
now
let's try to run this
so now you will be able to write the
inputs
like let's say
4
the first number is 4
now the second number let's say
9
on addition it becomes 13 which is the
right answer
so these were some configurations that
you need to do if you want to run a
program of c plus in visual studio code
so as we have understood how to download
and configure visual studio code for c
plus plus programs
so let's move on to learn how we can
download dev c plus plus and run c plus
programs in that
so let's go to google
and type dev c plus plus
this is the first link
we'll click on that
now this is the green button
saying download will click on that to
download devc plus plus
as you can see it is getting downloaded
your download will start shortly
so now we'll click on download now
now it is getting downloaded
it will take a while the size of this
file is 48.1 mb
so as you can see the downloading is
almost done
so the downloading is complete now we'll
click on open folder
here it is dev c plus plus setup
now we'll click on this
setup
we'll click on yes
the setup is loading
so now here we will select the preferred
language it is english we'll click on ok
now
we'll click on this is the license
agreement we'll click on i agree
now
we'll click on next we don't need to
change this i think the space required
is
346.8 mb
and we'll click on next
now if you want to change the
destination folder you can
but i don't want to change it so i'll
click on install
now it is getting installed
it will take a while
it's done and now we'll click on finish
and it is marked
so when we click on finish it will
launch the devc plus
so here we have to select the language
it is english so we'll click on next
here again we'll click on next and now
we'll click on ok
so this is our code editor that is dev c
plus plus
so let's write a code
first of all let's create a file
we'll go to file and go to new
and we'll click on source file
all right now we need to save this one
and in order to save this we'll click on
file then we'll go to save as
and now we'll select the destination
and name it as
dev dot cpp
all right now let's start
with the header file
hash include iostream
we'll do a simple program over here
using namespace
std
because we want to check
that whether the program is running in
this editor or not
name space std
now we'll write int main
insight into main will
display a message
welcome
to
dev
c plus
all right after that we'll write return
0
now let's try to run this
and in order to run this program we'll
go to execute
and now we'll click on compile and run
here this is the pop-up welcome to dev c
plus plus as we can see this is the
output
now press any key to continue it will
close this window
so our output is correct welcome to dev
c plus plus so this is how you can run a
program in dev c plus
and
our program was also working fine in the
visual studio code
so this is how you can download both of
these code editors to run the c plus
programs
and with that we have reached to the end
of this video i hope you find this video
helpful
