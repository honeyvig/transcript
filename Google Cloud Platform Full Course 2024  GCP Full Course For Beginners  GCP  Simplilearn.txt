below so let's get started so when we
talk about Google Cloud platform we also
need to know what is cloud computing so
cloud computing is the use of hardware
and software components to deliver a
service to a network users can access
these files and
applications and services provided by a
cloud provider from any device that has
access to Internet in short cloud
computing is a way where cloud provider
provides access to different services
such as resources and when we talk about
resources here we talk about computer in
we talk about memory we talk about
processing power we talk about storage
and we also talk about different
Services which Cloud providers make
available for the users now that allows
us for automatic software integration
backup and restoring data unlimited
storage capacity having a reliable use
of different services and having a cost
efficient
solution now we know that cloud
computing models there are different
service models so you have platform as a
service you have infrastructure as a
service and you have software as a
service and these are the prominent
models which are offered by different
Cloud providers such as Google Cloud
such as Google you have Amazon you have
Azure and also some organizations build
their own private cloud using open
source open stack let's focus more on
Google Cloud platform and what it has to
offer and how it is gaining popularity
in the market with different
organizations which would want to work
on a cloud platform or which would want
to work on an infrastructure which is
modernized so when we talk about cloud
computing this is one of the approach
which organizations can take to
instantaneously benefit from
modernization using different Services
different platforms and also newer
Technologies for their various
requirements such as scalability or
dynamic
businesses before we get into Google
Cloud platform it is also good to
understand where you can find some
useful resources about Google Cloud
platform and here you have a website
which is from from your Google Cloud so
this is cloud
academy.com librarygoogle and here you
can create a free account now that would
give you just 7 days trial but that has
a lot of videos which talk about your
Google Cloud platform and Essentials and
it has various certification related
videos which you can access and then
after 7 days after you have tried you
can obviously go for a paid account
where you can take detailed learning
from here now this is your training
Library which shows your different Cloud
providers such as Amazon Microsoft asure
gcp and then you have various other
topics which are specifics to
organization you can obviously look at
the pricing and you can also look at
resources which will give you a good
experience in learning from these videos
you can also create a free account which
I will you through later so you can
create a free account on
cloud.google.com now when I say free
account that basically means it allows
you to create an account and every user
who creates an account gets a $300 free
credit which can be used to practice
brush up your skills and also explore
and learn about different Google Cloud
products which are offered by Google now
coming back to our our Google Cloud
platform let's understand why Google
Cloud platform so Google Cloud platform
is popular for many reasons now let us
see few of most important reasons why it
stands out when you talk about pricing
pricing is one of the significant
factors that make Google Cloud Stand Out
Among the other Cloud
providers it offers a monthly pricing
plan which is build according to monthly
usage and when we talk about billing
here the billing can be in hours it can
be in minutes and it can also be in
seconds there are different options when
you talk about your pricing which can be
found from your Google Cloud web page
now pricing could be based on preemptive
machines pricing could be based on
reserved instances or reserved resources
I'll show you the link where you can
find more details on pricing part of it
so Google Cloud really has various
pricing options which help customers in
their different requirements whether
they would go for any of the service
models such as infrastructure as a
service platform as a service or even
software as a service one more
attractive thing about Google Cloud
pricing is that it provides committed
use discounts for example under this
scheme you can purchase a specific
amount of virtual CPU course and memory
for up to 57% Discount off regular
prices if you commit usage for either 1
or 3 years now this is just one option
there are various such options which you
can learn about from the Google Cloud's
page and that really suits different
customers for their different
requirements now when we talk about
speed we don't need to really challenge
this aspect when it comes to Google
services so Google provides its Google
cloud and Google app customer speed up
to 10 tbyt because of its faster cable
system there are different kind of
machines which can be used if you're
talking about computation if you're
talking about memory hungry applications
or even storage intensive workloads all
in all speed is one of the defining
characteristics of Google cloud services
the cable has connections over us West
CO main cities in Japan and even major
hubs in Asia this speed enhances
performances and leads to customer
satisfaction now when we talk about
customers any or every customer would
prefer to have low latency High
throughput Based Services they would
want to use higher speeds to process
their data in as less time as possible
Google provides a low latency Network
infrastructure in fact you can say that
when you are using Google cloud services
you are using the services from the same
infrastructure which Google uses for its
popular services such as Google search
or even YouTube which is one of the
second largest repository which can be
accessed for videos now when we talk
about Big Data big data is data which is
very complex has lot of other
characteristics such such as your volume
you have velocity you have variety you
have vacity validity volatility virality
and so on so if an organization has is
working on Big Data Google Cloud can be
a better choice because Google has many
Innovative tools for cloud warehousing
for example such as bigquery and even
realtime data processing tools such as
data flow big query is a Warehouse that
allows massive processing of data at
high speeds basically working on your
structured data Google also has launched
some new machine learning from
artificial intelligence tools now there
are various other services which we can
which we can use from Google Cloud
platform but let's understand what is
Google Cloud platform and what are some
of the services even the services which
are not listed here can be found in your
con console from Google Cloud so what is
Google Cloud platform gcp it is a set of
Cloud Computing Services provided by
Google that runs on the same
infrastructure as I mentioned that
Google uses for its end user products
like YouTube Gmail and even Google
search the various set of services
offered by Google Cloud platform are so
you have Services which are specific to
Computing requirements and again in
Computing you have various different
options available you have machines
which are compute optimized machines
which are memory optimized machines
which are storage optimized and also we
have certain machines such as preff
which basically means that you could get
a machine to work on at a far lesser
price than any other machine but when we
talk about preemptive these are the
machines which can be requested on
demand and they can be taken back by
Google at any time you have networking
related Services which can be very
useful when you are setting up your
applications or your services across
Globe you also have different Services
which are specific to machine learning
and organizations which would be
interested in working on machine
learning or artificial intelligence
would be really interested in using
these Services there are also innovative
solutions to work on big data and Big
Data related Technologies now when we
talk about Google Cloud platform domains
so we can break down these Services into
specifics such as you have compute now
the compute service allows for computing
and hosting the cloud now when you talk
about Computing here there are different
services such as app engine you have
compute engine you have kubernetes you
have Cloud functions and Cloud run when
you talk about storage and database so
the storage and database service allows
application to store media files backups
or other fil like objects now various
Services Under This are as follows you
have cloud storage Cloud SQL Cloud big
table for unstructured data you have
Cloud spanner cloud data store
persistent discs and Cloud memory store
when we talk about networking the
networking service allows us to load
balance traffic across resources now as
I mentioned earlier resources could be
your different resources which you would
be using from a cloud platform such as
your devices your instances memory
optimized or CPU optimized instances or
other resources creating DNS records and
much more so various Services Under This
are VP BC that stands for virtual
private Cloud you have Cloud load
balancing Cloud armor Cloud CDN you have
Cloud interconnect DNS and network
service TI when we talk about the big
data service this allows us to process
and query big data in Cloud now various
Services under these are as follows you
have big query cloud cloud data proc
Cloud composer cloud data lab cloud data
prep Cloud Pub sub which as publish and
subscribing system you have cloud data
studio now you also have the developer
tools and developer Tools service
includes tools related to development of
an application now various Services
under these are as follows that is you
have Cloud SDK software development kit
you have deployment manager Cloud Source
repositories and Cloud test lab when we
talk about identity and security which
is one of the primary concerns for any
organization or any user who would be
interested in using a cloud platform
Google Cloud really has taken care of
this so when you talk about identity and
security domain this deals with Security
Services now various Services here are
Cloud identity you have identity and
access management that is cloud am you
have identity aware proxies you have
cloud data loss prevention API security
key enforcement Key Management Service
and many more you also have cloud
services which are related to internet
of things so very much would be used by
organizations who would be working on
iot devices or the data generated by
these devices so various Services here
are Cloud iot Core you have Edge TPU and
Cloud iot also when we talk about Cloud
AI that is artificial intelligence this
comprises of services related to machine
learning and much more so you have Cloud
autom ml Cloud TPU Cloud machine
learning engine job Discovery dialog
flow Enterprise natural language Cloud
text to speech and much more if you
would be interested in Services related
to API platform then there are different
Services Under This category or this
domain so you have Maps platform you
have APG API platform
monetization developer portal analytics
that is API analytics APG sense Cloud
endpoints and service infrastructure so
these are some of the listing of
services under each Cloud platform
domain now let's look at Ferrero use
case and let's also understand what was
done here so ferero is one of the famous
chocolate and ranks third among
worldwide chocolate and confectionary
producers it was found in 1946 in Italy
I'm sure you would have seen the ferero
chocolates when you would have gone out
to buy some chocolates so the challenges
here was that ferero as we know is sold
in every supermarket and is known for
its quality once the business grew some
issues Arrow right and that's what
happens when the business grows you have
issues popping up which could be related
to the volume of data the speed with
which the data is getting generated the
variety of data and also looking at your
platforms which support different
Dynamic applications or your scalability
requirements performance requirements
and so on so it needed data storage
processing and Analysis system for a
wide customer
database there was a huge gap between
the company and the people who bought
its goods because the company relied on
data given sales outlets now that's one
of the challenge Ferrero wanted to
create a digital ecosystem where there
was a point of contact with its
customers and also a foundation for an
Innovative datadriven marketing strategy
what was the solution here so one of the
service of cloud platforms or Google
Cloud platform is Big query and this was
an answer to ferrero's challenges since
it was capable of hyper fast and
efficient data analysis as a solution
now as I mentioned big query is a
datawarehouse which allows you to store
structured data now this could directly
be used as a service where you could
store in any amount of data and you
would not be paying for storage so there
are different pricing models and for
data up to 1 terabytes you would not be
charged anything and if you would be
accessing the data that is reading the
data or processing the data from
bigquery that's where the pricing model
kicks in now using Google Cloud's big
query business analysts of ferero were
able to store and analyze massive data
sets in a very reliable fast and
affordable
manner consumer behavior and sales
pattern data reports were easy to build
and automate
and the analysis also followed ferero to
adopt advertising across various
marketing channels to serve the customer
needs in a better way what was the
result they could divide their database
into realtime actionable consumer
clusters to generate more accurate user
profiles fero was also able to
personalize its marketing strategies to
match the user needs now Google Cloud
platform completely tailored the website
mobile content and advertising and
created a very costeffective media by
strategy today I want to take you on a
journey that could transform your career
much like how cloud computing has
transformed some of the world's most
Innovative companies imagine Netflix
once a DVD rental service transforming
into a streaming giant capable of
delivering high definition content to
millions of users simultaneously or
consider a BNB which has used cloud
computing to manage listings and
bookings for millions of properties
around the globe providing a seamless
experience for host and travelers alike
both Netflix and Airbnb utilized Cloud
Technologies to efficiently scale their
businesses manage large volumes of data
and Ensure High availability and
performance so by transitioning from
traditional costly and inflexible own
premises infrastructure to scalable
Cloud environments they significantly
reduce cost accelerated innovation and
improved user experience in real time
now you might think that working on such
impactful projects requires years of
experience and advanced decrease but
there's the good news guys with the
right approach you can start a career in
crowd Engineering in just 3 months even
if you are starting from scratch in this
video I will outline a clear actionable
plan that uses entirely free online
resources to get you there we will cover
the essential skills you need to learn
the certifications that can help
validate your knowledge and practical
projects that will make your Reg resum
is stand out so if you're ready to dive
into the world of cloud computing and
perhaps one day contribute to the next
big thing in Tech so stay tuned guys so
let's get started and the number one
point you should start with is starting
your Cloud Journey so transitioning into
Cloud engineering may seem daunting
especially if you are new to this field
the first step is understanding why this
is a valuable career move the cloud
industry is booming with a projected
market value of $800 billion by 2025 and
the potential to grow even further this
growth means a constant demand for
skilled professionals making it an
excellent time to enter the field now
that we understand the industry's
potential the next question is where
should you start so you should choose a
cloud provider so choosing a cloud
provider is a critical decision as it
shapes your learning path and future
jobs opportunities so the three major
players are AWS Azure and Google Cloud
platform gcp so starting with AWS so WS
that is Amazon web services is often
recommended for beginners because it has
the largest market share and a wide
range of services which translates into
more job opportunities now coming to
Azure that is another strong option
especially if you're targeting jobs in
Enterprises that use Microsoft
Technologies now coming to gcp that is
Google Cloud platform and it is gaining
popularity and offers excellent features
especially in data analytics and machine
learning for beginners aws's popular
choice duee to its widespread use and
extensive documentation however it's
important to research the demand in your
local job market and consider your own
interest when making a decision and with
a cloud provider chosen the next step is
to build a strong foundation in the
fundamental technologies that underpin
cloud computing so now before diving
into Cloud specific Services it's
essential to understand the foundational
technologies that cloud computing relies
on these include number one comes
networking so understanding how data
moves across networks is crucial for
setting up and managing Cloud
infrastructure then comes operating
systems familiarity with operating
systems particularly Linux is essential
as most Cloud environments run on Linux
servers then comes virtualization so
this is the process of creating virtual
instances of physical Hardware that's a
core Concept in cloud computing and then
comes databases so knowledge of
databases both relational and
non-relational is critical for managing
data in the cloud so with these
foundational skills in place you are now
ready to explore Cloud specific learning
parts so let's start with certifications
so certifications can validate your
knowledge and make you stand out in the
job market for AWS starting with the AWS
Cloud practitioner certification is
advisable this certification provides a
broad overview of cloud Concepts and AWS
Services it covers key areas such as
compute Services storage options
security measures Network broking
capabilities and billing and pricing
structures craving a career upgrade

pin comand now coming back while
certifications are valuable they need to
be complemented with practical hands-on
experience to truly demonstrate your
skills Here Comes building projects or
hands on practice so building projects
is the most effective way to apply what
you have learned and to demonstrate your
abilities to potential employers so here
are a few beginner friendly projects to
consider number one is setting up
virtual machines so start by launching
an ec2 instance on AWS learn about the
different instance types configurations
and the basics of server management then
comes the next project that is cloud
storage systems so experiment with
services like S3 for object storage and
RDS for relational databases document
the use cases and differences between
these Services then deploy a web
application host a static website using
S3 and cloudfront which will teach you
about web hosting content delivery and
the basics of DNS management with Route
53 initially you can use the AWS console
for these task but as you progress try
implementing these projects using
infrastructure as core tools like
terraform this approach not only deepens
your understanding but also aligns with
industry best practices in addition to
practical projects having some coding
knowledge can greatly enhance your
capabilities as a cloud engineer so now
we'll see how you can learn to code
while not always mandatory coding skills
can significantly enhance your
Effectiveness as a cloud engineer
languages like Python and Bash are
particularly useful for scripting and
automation even a basic understanding
can help with tasks such as writing
scripts for Server automation managing
cloud services or resources
programmatically then implementing
infrastructure as code for those new to
coding check out Simply learn videos on
YouTube which offers excellent starting
points coding skills not not only make
you more versatile but also open up
opportunities to specialize in areas
like devops or Cloud native development
and once you have built your skills and
some projects it's time to start with
the job hunting process that is building
your profile creating a strong online
presence is crucial when job hunting
your LinkedIn profile should clearly
reflect your new skills certifications
and projects so here are some tips
number one is optimize your LinkedIn
profile that is include a professional
photo an engaging summary and detailed
description of your projects then comes
network activity connect with
Professionals in the field join cloud
computing groups and participate in
discussions and then comes apply
strategically tailor your resume for
each job application highlighting the
skills and projects that align with the
job description applying for jobs can be
a number game so be persistent it's also
helpful to reach out to recruiters or
hiring managers directly to express your
interest in the role as you start to
gain experience in your first Cloud role
consider specializing in a need each
area to advance your career and then
comes specializing and continuous
learning so specializing in a particular
area of cloud computing can make you
more valuable and increase your earning
potential possible specializations
include devops that is it focus on
automation continuous integration and
continuous deployment practices then
comes serverless Computing work with
functions as a service that is FAS and
other serverless architectures and then
comes security specialize in Cloud
security to protect data and
infrastructure the cloud industry is
dynamic with new tools and Technologies
emerging regularly so continuous
learning is key so stay updated through
online courses webinars and industry
news finally remember that the journey
into Cloud engineering is continuous and
ever evolving so if we talk about
resources so embarking on a career in
Cloud engineering is challenging but
highly rewarding utilize free resources
like YouTube tutorials Community forums
and documentation to guide your learning
so let us first understand what exactly
is cloud security Cloud security is a
set of tools and practices designed to
protect businesses from threats both
inside and outside the organization as
companies move to use more online tools
and services ensuring their Cloud
security is essential let's start with a
simple case study imagine an IT
consulting firm the owner Alex decides
to move the company's operation to the
cloud to streamline project management
client interactions and data storage
Alex chooses a cloud service provider to
host all the data and application but
here's the thing the internet can be a
dangerous place just like you would want
to protect your home from burglers Alex
needs to protect his business from cyber
criminals who might try to steal
sensitive client data or disrupt
services this is where Cloud security
comes in Cloud security involves using
various tools and practices to keep your
data safe ensure only authorized people
can access it and protect it from the
potential threats for Alex this means
making sure that the client's
information is encrypted so even if
someone intercepts it they can't read it
setting up strong passwords and
multiactor authentication to make sure
only the right people have access and
regularly updating software to fix any
security weaknesses so in simple terms
Cloud security is like having a
high-tech security system for your
online and data applications it's about
making sure your valuable information is
safe and sound just like you would
protect your most prized possessions but
why is cloud security so important
lately terms like digital transformation
and Cloud migration are often heard in
businesses these terms means different
things to different companies but then
they both highlight the need to change
as businesses are adopt these new
technologies to improve their operations
they face new challenges in keeping
everything secure while maintaining
productivity modern Technologies allows
businesses to work Beyond traditional
office setups but switching to
cloud-based systems can be risky if not
done correctly to get the best results
businesses needs to understand how to
use these Technologies safely and
effectively this means finding the right
balance between using Advanced Cloud
tools and ensuring ing strong security
practices are in the place before we
jump in let's talk briefly why the cloud
is such a game Cher cloud computing
offers OnDemand self-service broad
network access rapid elasticity and
scalable resources making it incredibly
convenient for businesses you can access
resources from anywhere scale up or down
based on your needs and enjoy a flexible
and efficient Computing environment
however these benefits can introduce
unique security challenges that needs to
be addressed data breaches encryption is
your best friend make sure that your
data is encrypted both at rest and
Transit think of it like this if someone
steals a lock box but doesn't have the
key they can't access what's inside
access controls only authorized users
can access sensitive data use Road based
access control rbac and multiactor
Authentication MFA to make this happen
it's like having a bouncer at a VIP
party only the right people get in then
we have insecure apis secure coding
practices always use secure coding
practices to protect your apis validate
inputs and use proper authentication
it's like making sure your doors and
windows are locked tight regular audits
regularly audit your apis for
vulnerabilities think of it as a routine
checkup to keep everything is on top
shape then we have Insider threats to
overcome this we have monitoring
activities keep an eye on what's
happening within your organization use
monitoring tools to detect unusual
activities it's like having security
cameras inside your premises employe
training educate your employees about
Security's best practices sometimes a
simple mistake can lead to big problems
training is the first line of defense
the next threat we have is the denial of
service attacks traffic management use
traffic management tools to filter out
malicious traffic it's like having a
flood gate to control the flow of water
and keep out the bad stuff rency and
load balancing Implement rency and load
balancing to ensure your system can
handle sudden spikes in traffic it's
like having multiple Lanes on a highway
to prevent traffic jams then we have
advanced persistent threats
APS to overcome this we should ensure
continuous monitoring always monitor
your system for any signs of intrusion
use Advanced security measures to detect
and respond to threats quickly think of
it as having a night Watchman on duty 24
into 7 then we have incident response
plans having a plan in place to respond
to security incidents it's like having
an emergency drill you'll know exactly
what to do if something goes wrong best
practices here are some of the best
practices to enhance Cloud security at
first Implement strong access controls
use multiactor authentication and limit
access based on rules to ensure that
users only have the permission they need
regularly update and path systems keep
your systems up to date with the latest
patches to close vulnerabilities that
could be exploited by attackers then we
have employee training educate your
employees on Security's best practices
such as recognizing fishing attempts and
creating strong passwords then we have
Network segmentation divide your network
into smaller more secure zones to limit
the impact of potential breaches
monitoring and logging continuously
monitor your environment and maintain
detailed logs to detect and respond to
threats promptly Cloud security is an
ongoing effort that requires vigilance
right tools and a commitment to best
practices by staying informed using the
right security measures and following
best practices you can protect your
Cloud environment from threats now these
were some Basics on Google Cloud now as
I said you can always find lot of
details about pricing about services and
also all the services are accessible in
your free trial account now let me just
walk you through here so one is you
could always find details on
documentation on each of these services
so if I would click on getting started
you have quick start which basically
shows you short tutorials you have
trainings and you have also
certifications now if we click on quick
start now that takes me to this page
which shows me quick starts or if you
would want to understand about different
projects if you would want to look into
the documentation of creating a Linux
virtual machine or storing a file and
sharing it deploying a container Docker
container image and so on so you have a
lot of quick starts here you can also
look at Cloud
minute on the same page on the right
side you have docs and once you click on
that it takes you to these links now
this shows you build Solutions which
shows you top use cases best practices
all the solutions it's always good to
learn from these use cases which are
available and here you have different
feature products and all the different
Services which Google Cloud offers now
you can click on featured products and
that basically shows you a list of these
products now here we have all the
solutions which you can look at
architecture database Enterprise level
big data and Analysis gaming related
internet of things and so on now if you
go down here it shows you featured
products and that shows you some of the
important products such as compute
engine which is belonging to the compute
domain you have Cloud run you have
anthers which is for
migration and basically Cloud adoption
when organizations would want to move
from on premise to cloud-based Solutions
you have Vision AI you have cloud
storage now that basically allows you to
store any kind of data whether that's an
object so this is acting as an object
storage you have cloudsql which is
basically a ready to use service where
you would be using MySQL post or any the
SQL Server database Services you have
big query which is a data warehouse
which basically allows you to store your
structured data and then you have your
AI and machine learning related products
so you have automl Vision AI video AI
text to speech speech to text and so on
now you also have different platform
accelerators which can be used and in
any of these cases for example if I
would click on compute engine which is a
featured product from Google Cloud now
that shows you basically your quick
starts using your Linux machines how to
guides which tells you completely
working on a VM instance or working on
storage working on persistent Diss and
so on and it shows you the documentation
here now you also have products and
pricing option which you can see for GCB
pricing and you could straight away go
to the pricing you could be looking at
Solutions which talks about
infrastructure modernization now this is
something which organizations are
interested in when they would want to
move from their on premise solution to
your Google Cloud now here I can say for
example I click on infrastructure
modernization you can always find some
case studies what are the different
solutions we have here right when you
talk about Google Cloud so you can
always click on see Solutions and you
can look at M migration or sap Cloud
right by Google Cloud what it can be
used for VMware as a service or HPC that
is high performance Computing and about
these Services we will learn in detail
later now I can go back on the same page
where I was clicking on the services so
you have quick starts you have how to
guides you have deep understanding of
different concepts right and here if I
click on all how to guides so that shows
me what are the different ways in which
you can work with compute engine and
working with different instances
although it's quite exhaustive content
but then if you follow steadily then you
can learn a lot about Google Cloud now
here I can just go back so this is just
giving you some idea on the different
products which are available from Google
Cloud looking into different sections
finding right documents documentation
here right and you can always look into
each one of these in detail for each
product which Google Cloud
offers now if we scroll down we could
see all the options or all the domains
which we see here right let me just go
back because we got into Solutions now
we have quick starts right and then you
can basically scroll all the way down to
look at Cloud SDK which can be set up on
your Windows machine like I have set it
up on my Windows machine plus when you
use Google console you have a GUI which
I'll show you in a couple of minutes and
also a cloud shell where you can use
your command line options to work with
Google Cloud platform you have Cloud
console which is nothing but your GUI to
access your resources now you can also
look at in-depth tutorials pricing and
you have different other options so
let's just click on pricing here and
then we have your price list which
basically gives you details of different
Services what are available and what are
the services or what are the prices so
for example if I click on computer
engine right and this shows me the
pricing aspect of compute engine which
belongs to compute domain and here you
can see you have VM instance pricing you
have networking pricing sold tenant noes
which which are specific to particular
organizations or if organizations would
want to have dedicated nodes you have
GPU based pricing right so General
processing units you have dis and image
pricing and you can click on any of the
links and you can see pricing which also
shows you your different kind of machine
types so here you have different kind of
machine types which says N1 N2 n2d E2
you have memory optimized machine types
you have compute optimized you have
premium images
and you can basically look at all the
categories you can look at disk pricing
which involves your persistent disk
pricing for ssds or sdds what are the
kind of images what are the different
network Services right and you can
always look at your machine types you
can choose a particular region right
there is the concept of region and
availability zones here and as per
region you could look at the prices you
can also look look at standard prices
you could be looking for what are the
free tier machines if I'm specifically
looking for VM instance pricing I can
click on this one and that takes me to
the VM instance pricing what is the
bilding module what is the instance up
time what is the resource base pricing
and then you can also look at different
kind of discounts such as sustained use
discounts committed use discounts
discounts for preemptable FM instances
and so on and this is how you can be
looking at price pricing for all
different resources and you can choose
the resource which you are interested in
and then look for the pricing bench
marks reservations if you would want to
use and you would want to benefit if you
would want to look at what are the
quotas and limits and so on so please
explore this link and you can find lot
of information when it comes to
technical options looking at different
Google Cloud products which we briefly
discussed when it comes to domains and
what each product can be used for you
can always come back to the main page
where I was showing you different
Services we went into pricing straight
away right now you can always come back
to this page on your cloud.google.com
and then you have your
Solutions which talks about different
products right and you can click on
these or you can look into technical
documentation so this talks about your
different featured Solutions
infrastructure Solutions you have data
center migration related
and so on so I could be talking more and
more about Google Cloud platform it's a
ocean it's a huge chunk of different
services for different organizational
requirements so look into this link and
also what you can do is create a account
on Gmail I mean you could create a free
account or you could go to
cloud.google.com
and then you could create a free account
like I have created here and I can just
click on Console now that's my GUI or
Google Cloud console which basically
allows me to work with Google Cloud now
there are a lot of options here by
default when you create an account now
in my case on the top it says it's a
free trial account I have $300 credit
and out of that $251 is left and 237
days out of a year are left for my
account now here I can basically see the
project right and by default we can
create an project or by default there is
a project existing for any user so when
you log in it creates a particular
project and you could create a new
project and project would be to dedicate
your different services or different
resources per different project so this
is your dashboard which basically shows
your project which shows you a project
number and a project ID which is always
unique now you can click on this and
this if you would want you can hide this
information you can also look into the
documentation part of it then it shows
you the different services or a
graphical information of services which
you might have used in past so you have
compute engine which shows you how much
percentage of CPU was used you can
always go to compute engine as a service
you can look at your Google Cloud
platform status and look at the Google
Cloud status now this is billing now
since this show shows me the billing
period for April month and I can always
look at detailed charges I can look at
reporting I can look at different apis
which Google offers and you for your
different kind of work you can always go
to the API overview or the API link and
enable or disable any API now once you
enable or disable any API then you can
use that so you have news section you
have documentation and you have getting
started guides which tells you how to
work or enable different apis if you
would want to deploy a pre-built
solution at Dynamic logging monitoring
errors deploying a Hello World app and
so on now this is your dashboard I can
click on activity and that would show me
what kind of activity I would have done
in my cloud platform I can always choose
the kind of activities by saying
activity type I can choose the resources
now it shows show me that I created some
VM instances I deleted them I updated
some metadata I basically worked on
instances I changed some firewall rules
here I have then also worked on some
other services or API so I created some
buckets which is for object storage and
again I have been working with some
instances and creating some firewall
rules here I have granted some
permissions I am setting up a policy
right so this activity gives me a
history of what things I have done over
past couple of months while working on
Google Cloud platform now on the top
left corner you have the hamburger menu
which you can click on this so that's
your navigation menu and when you click
on this this shows you home it takes you
to the marketplace it specifically takes
you to billing you can always look at
apis and services so here in API
Services I can pretty much go to a
dashboard and I can see a report on the
traffic or errors or latency and the
kind of apis which are available so you
have compute engine API you have big
query API big query data transfer API
big query storage cloud data proc so
these are some of the apis or Services
I've used in past might be I was
evaluating a product might be I was
using a particular product so you have
whenever you would want to use a
particular service from Google Cloud
platform you would be enabling these
apis so here we see some apis for data
proc you have logging monitoring you
have resource manager API you have
cloudsql which allows you to directly
use MySQL or postgress you have cloud
storage right and so many apis so if I
would want to enable a particular API
which is not right now required but then
it's good good to know you can always
click on this one you can search for an
API so for example if I would say data
Brock right and that shows me the cloud
data proc API which manages Hadoop based
clusters and jobs on Google Cloud
platform so I can spin up a Hadoop
cluster and I can start running some
jobs on a Hadoop cluster on demand and
as I'm done with it I can just get rid
of it so this is an API which I would
have to enable and then for every
particular service you also have an
admin API which you would enable now
going back so coming out from this API
Library I got into API and services now
there is you can look into the library
you can look at credentials and you can
also look at different time intervals
for which you can see the usage of your
different apis now going back to the
menu you have support wherein you can
always reach out to the Google support
team if you are using
a paid version even with free trial you
can try to reach out and you will find
someone to help but it is always good
when you have a billing cycle reaching
out the customer care you have identity
access management and admin and this is
required when you're working with
different apis or Services when you
would want to have relevant access you
have getting started you have security
related options you have anthos which is
mainly for migration now here you can
look at your different domains such as
which we discussed so you have compute
and in compute you have different
services so you have app engine you have
compute engine kubernetes you have Cloud
functions and Cloud run you can look
into the storage aspect which shows you
big table which is usually and mainly
for your unstructured data big table
which is something which gave rise to
popular nosql databases like hbas and
cassendra you have data store which can
be used you have fire store file store
storage which can be used to put in data
of any kinds you have SQL for structured
data you have spanner as a service you
have memory store and you have data
transfer now when it comes to the
networking domain you have all these
services such as VPC virtual private
network network related services for
your load balancing for using a
cloud-based DNS or Cloud defined Network
you have hybrid connectivity network
service tis security and intelligence
then you have other options for your
operations which can be used and here
you have different other tools which can
be used such as Cloud build you have
Cloud tasks container registry
deployment manager and many more big
data specific you have the services here
so you have data proc which can be used
to spin up your clusters you have
published subscribe messaging systems
such as now Kafka which you might have
heard of originates its idea from here
so Pub sub you have data flow you have
iot core bigquery which is a data
warehouse package or data warehousing
solution from Google Cloud now then you
have your artificial intelligence
related services and other Google
Solutions so you can always find a huge
list of services or you can say at high
level Solutions offered by Google cloud
and we can use these to basic basically
test some of the solutions use them and
work on them so I'll give you a quick
demo on different Services which can be
used here from your Google Cloud
platform now this is your Google Cloud
platform and this is your console now
this also gives you a cloud shell which
can be activated so that you can work
from command line and you can always
find lot of documentation on that so you
can also set up your Cloud shell that is
SDK on your Windows machine and if you
have set it up then basically you could
be doing something like gcloud right if
the cloud has been set up so in my case
I had set up the cloud SDK and basically
I can get into that by looking at what
path I have set up so Cloud SDK and then
I can be using it from my Windows
machine as per my comfort I can also
activate the cloud shell here which will
basically open up a terminal and at any
point of time you can open up this one
Cloud shell in a different window it is
preparing the cloud shell where it will
by default set up your project it will
set up the metadata and now I am logged
into my Google Cloud account from
command line and here I can basically
use gcloud right and that basically
shows you the different options which
are available which you can be using so
if you would want to use a part regular
service you can also try giving a help
and that shows you how do you manage
your Google Cloud platform right so you
have different options for billing to
work with your different services and
basically you could be working on Google
Cloud using this Cloud shell from your
command line usually for people who are
learning Google cloud in the beginning
it is always good to go for console and
use your different services from here in
an easier way but as I said you can
always use the command line for example
if I would just go ahead and type gcloud
create
instances and that will directly take me
to the cloud console documentation which
shows you different options which you
can use to work with instances so I
could do a g-cloud compute instances
create and then I can give my instance
name and so on and I'll show you some
examples on that so you can be using
your Cloud console right that is your
Cloud shell and you can straight away
start working from command line however
I would suggest using console in the
beginning and when you are well
experienced then you can start using
Cloud shell to do things from command
line and when you are fully experienced
you can always switch and certain things
are usually useful or easier when done
from command line and some are easier
when you do it from the console and you
can use any one of these options now we
can go to Google Cloud console now as of
now I can close this one I still have my
cloud shell open if I would want to look
into it I can click on this one and I
can straight away go to compute engine
where I would want to work on creating
some instances on Google Cloud platform
using the compute engine service and
then basically connecting to those
instances and basically trying out some
basic things so you can click on VM
instances and then once the this comes
up I can always create some instances
now if you see here I have some
instances already created right and I
can continue working on those I can
create new instances I can use different
options while creating instances and
I'll show you that in a demo in quick
seconds so let's have a quick demo on
setting up gcp instances now before that
let's have a quick recap so when you
talk about instance or a virtual machine
it is hosted on Google's infrastructure
right and you can create your Google
Cloud instance using this Google Cloud
console that is by clicking on this and
then going to compute engine and
clicking on VM instances now you can
also do that from Google Cloud command
line tool that is cloud shell and you
can be doing that using compute engine
API so compute engine instances can run
the Public Image
for Linux or Windows servers that Google
provides you also have option of
creating or using custom images that you
can create and import from your existing
systems you can deploy Docker containers
which are automatically launched on
instance running containers optimized OS
now when you talk about instances and
projects always remember that and each
instance belongs to a Google Cloud
console project and a project can can
have one or more instances when you talk
about instances and storage options each
instance has a small boot persistent dis
which I will show you in further screens
that contains the OS you can add more
storage space if needed and when you
talk about instances and network a
project can have up to five VPC networks
so vbc network is virtual private
networks wherein you can virtual private
Cloud Network Works where you can have
your resources within your own subnet
and each instance belongs to one VPC
Network now instances in same network
can communicate with each other through
local area network protocol an instance
uses internet to communicate within any
machine so that could be virtual
physical or outside its own network when
you talk about instances and containers
you should remember that comp compute
engine instances support a declarative
method for launching your application
using containers now you can create a VM
instance or a VM instance template you
can provide a Docker image and launch
the configuration so there are different
ways in which you can create these
instances and once you create these
instances you can say for example you're
creating a Linux instance you can
associate SSH keys with your Google
account or your G Suite account and then
manage your admin non-admin access to
the instance using IM roles if you
connect to your instance using g-cloud
or SSH from console which we will see
later compute engine can generate SSH
keys for you and apply that to your
Google cloud or G Suite account now what
we can do is we can see how we can
create your Google Cloud instances from
your console or from the the command
line let's have a look in creating
instances using gcp console now that we
have learned on some basics of Google
Cloud platform what are the different
Services what are different domains
basically looking at your Google Cloud
console or even Cloud Shell let's go
ahead and create some VM instances now
that's from your compute engine service
and let's try connecting to these
instances and see how this Works let's
also see what are the different options
which are available when you would want
to create the virtual machine instances
here so when you click on your drop-
down from the top left and choose
compute engine so it brings you to this
page so I can show that again so you can
click on compute engine click on VM
instances and that basically brings you
to this page now here it tells you
compute engine lets you use Virtual
machines that run on Google's
infrastructure so we can create microv
VMS or large instances running different
distributions of Linux or Windows using
standard images that is public images
and you can also have your own image so
let's create a VM instance by clicking
on create now that's basically helping
me to create an instance here so it
shows me the instance name I can give it
something so let me say C1 now I can add
labels so what is label it basically
allows you to organize your project add
arbitrary labels as key value pairs to
your resources this so this is basically
categorizing your labels and projects if
you have multiple projects now remember
if you have your Cloud console and if
you have created your free trial account
it will allow you to do these things if
not you may have to go back to the
billing section and see if the billing
is enabled which also means that when
you are creating your Google Cloud
account it will ask you to ke your
credit card details but they do not
charge anything or they might charge
might be $1 or one rupee depending on
your location and that's also refunded
but that's just to verify your card now
once I've given the name I can choose a
region so I would basically choose
Europe since I'm in Europe I would be
clicking on Europe West 3 and here I can
choose an availability Zone availability
zone is basically to make your services
or instances or any other resources
highly available so you can choose one
of the availability zones now I would
choose save S 3 now this one we can
scroll down and here it says machine
configurations you have general purpose
machines you have memory optimized
machines which is M1 series and you can
always go back to the Google Cloud page
and see what a particular kind of
machine specializes in so I would click
on General's purpose and in general
purpose you have different categories so
you have N1 which is powered by Intel
Skylake CPU platform or you have E2
which is CPU platform selected selection
based on availability so let's have N1
selected now this one shows me the
machine type and if you are using your
free tier account then you can start
with correcting a micro machine which is
one virtual CPU core you can go for a G1
small which is one virtual CPU code and
1.7 GB Ram you can even go up to a
high-end machine and then you can
basically see if you're using a free
account how many of these machines you
can use if I would be selecting eight
virtual CPU CES and 32 gigabyte of
memory then it would allow me to create
at least two instances by this
configuration we will use N1 standard
which is one virtual CPU core 3.75 GB
memory now then we can also deploy a
container image to this VM instance if
you would be interested in deploying a
container image let's not get into that
right now here it shows you the boot dis
and it shows you dbn gnu 9 Linux 9 what
I would do is I can go for this
distribution or I can choose a Linux
distribution of my choice so here you
have public images you have custom
images you also have snapshots if you
have created backup of your previous
images here I can choose for example
ubben 2 and then I I can choose a
particular version so let's go for to
18.04 you can go for the latest one also
18.04 would be good enough and here it
tells me what is the boot dis so you
have ssds or you have standard
persistent discs now ssds are little
expensive in comparison to your standard
persistent disc or your sdds but then
ssds are faster so as of now we can
choose standard persistent disk as it is
and we can let the gigaby might be 10
now depending on your requirement you
can increase this you can even add diss
later that's not a problem click on
select now here I have access Scopes so
here I will say allow default access you
can also set access for each API or you
can give full access to all Cloud apis
so that based on your requirement you
can anytime change later also we will
also say allow HTTP traffic and we can
also choose allow https traffic that
basically allows me to access this
machine or Services which are HTTP based
accessible from this machine now I can
just click on create however it would be
good to basically enable connectivity to
this machine now we can do that in
different ways one is when you bring up
your machine it will have an SSH access
which you can log in from the cloud
platform here itself or what you can do
is you can create a private and a public
key using some softwares like puty or
puty gen so for example if you do not
have that on your machine you can
download you can just type in download
puty that takes you to the p.org page
and here you can click on download puty
and scroll down which shows you for your
64-bit machine which I have in my case
you can download putty.exe which is
basically your SSH andet client to
connect to your machines you can also
use puty gen which will be allowing you
to create a private and a public key
which I have done in my case let me show
you how so what you can do is you can go
to puty gen to begin with and here you
can click on generate now then to have
this key generated just move your cursor
on the top here in the empty space and
that creates your key you can give it a
name so for example let's give a
username I would give HD now I can give
a password for this one so let me give a
simple
password and what I can also do is I can
copy this public key from here and for
my later usage I can just keep it in my
notepad file which I can use later and
I'll show you when so now we can save
this private key and this will basically
allow me to save my private key I can
choose desktop and I can give it a name
so let's say new key new key and that
will be getting saved in a PPK file so
let's save it and that's done so we also
have our public key and we have saved
our private key now we know that when
you would want to connect using SSH you
need your private keys to the client and
public key also has to be existing so
let's take this public key so let's do a
control a I'm going to copy this and I'm
going to come back to my Google Cloud
console and here you can click on
security so you can click on the
security tab here scroll down and just
give your public key once you give that
it resolves and shows you the name and
this is good enough so that I can use my
SSH client to connect to this machine I
can click on Create and this will
basically create my VM instance it will
take some time and then your instance
will have an internal IP which will show
up here external IP and it will also
show you options to connect to these
machines so this is my internal IP this
is my external IP which I can use to
connect from a client I can easily
connect from the option here which says
SSH and I can say open in a browser
window I can even open this in a custom
Port I can look at the g-cloud command
which you can give from cloudshell or
you can use another SSH so let's first
do a open in browser window and let's
see if this connects so we can easily
connect to our instance the U 218
instance which I just set up here easily
in couple of seconds now this is trying
to establish a connection using your SSH
keys and when you do that it also
basically brings up this web browser so
I'm already connected it shows my
username which is my cloud account
username and I have been connected to
this machine here using SSH it did not
ask me for any password and basically
now I can just check what do I have in
my Linux file system right and I can
anytime log in as root by doing a pseudo
Su for example let's try installing a
package and I can say app get install
whm or apt get install WG get or apt get
install open SSH and all these packages
are already existing so not an issue now
I can start using this inst S I can just
look at the disk what is available okay
now we gave around 10 GB out of which we
see 8.3 gab here for the dev SDA 1 and
then 1.8 GB available and you can
continue using this machine this was the
easiest way of connecting to a VM
instance using
SSH now what we can also do is I can
just leave this and I will now try to
connect using an external SSH client
right and here you can copy the public
IP so when you want to connect to an
instance you will have to get the public
IP also remember that if you select and
stop this machine which will stop your
billing counter and if you start it
again the internal IP will remain same
but the external IP is the one which
will change I can obviously select this
machine Any time and I can do a cleanup
and I can delete it I can do a start of
the machine if it is stopped and I can
even import the virtual machine to be
used later so there are different
options which you can always use so this
is my instance and if you would want to
look at the details click on this one
see1 and that should basically allow you
to look at the details so it shows you
what is the instance ID what is the
machine type is it reservation specific
what is the CPU platform what's the zone
and all the other details at any point
of time if you would want to edit you
can always click on edit and you can
change the details as you need now you
can also look at the equivalent rest
command to basically use the rest API to
connect to this instance for now I have
copied the public IP and I would want to
connect it using puty so let's go in
here and let's give it the host name so
I can give Ubuntu I can give my IP
address so that's in my session now I
will click on SSH I would go going into
authentication I'll click on browse and
this is where I need to choose the PPK
file so this is the one which we created
new key let's select this and then I can
come back to session I can even save
this and I can call it as my instance
one let's save it and you can create any
number of instances so you see I have
created different instances here for my
Google cloud or Amazon related instances
and I can click on open it say is the
servers host key is not cast in the
registry that's fine just click on yes
and basically it says no authentication
method supported now this could be
because we have not enabled your SSH
access so let's look at that so now
let's see if we were trying to connect
using puty what was the issue here so if
I go back to my puty select my instance
load it it says Port 2 to I'm giving the
username which is wi to or sorry that's
the wrong username we gave and that
might be the reason we had set up the
user as sdu so let's save this again and
now let's try connecting to this one and
it asks for my password and you are able
to connect this right now if there was
any other issue related to network
connectivity then we could look at the
rules the inbound and outbound rules
which allow us to look into the machine
now now we are connected to our machine
here using hdu user I can log in as root
and I can continue working so not only
from the SSH within the cloud console
but you can use an external SSH client
and connect to your machine so this is
your UB to machine and we can basically
look at the space and that basically
confirms we are connecting to the same
machine which shows 8.3 GB here and 1.8
GB here which we were seeing from the
SSH in the browser now let's close this
and let's go back to our instance page
now here you can always look at the
network details and this will show you
your different kind of rules that is
ingress or egress rules which basically
allows to connect to this machine from
an external network or for this machine
to connect to an external network so
here we have different firewall rules
which shows default allow HTTP that's
your Ingress Rule and it tells you apply
to all it shows me what are the IP
ranges where I can specifically give the
IP of my machine it shows the protocols
it shows what are the different ports
which you have used for these services
for example RDP or SSH which shows 22
you have icmp HTTP and https now anytime
if you would want to make a change to
these rules that can be done by going
into your network details and say for
example you would want to work on
firewall rules so we have these firewall
rules here you can click on this one so
right now we are looking into the
network domain and we are looking into
VPC Network right and this shows me what
are the different rules we have now if I
would want to create a different
firewall rule for a different protocol I
can always click on create firewall rule
I can give it a name okay I can say what
if you would want to turn all the
firewall logs you can basically say what
is the kind of traffic so Ingress
applies to incoming traffic and egress
applies to outgoing traffic and you can
then basically choose what are the IP
ranges from where you want that
connection to be coming in or two going
out you can choose a particular protocol
you can give a protocol here with comma
separated values and you can create a
firewall rule so this might be required
depending on the services which you are
running wherein you might want to enable
your access to your machine from an
external service or to an external
service so you can always go to network
details from here you can then go into
firewall rules create a firewall rule
apply that to your instance and restart
your instance so as of now we don't need
to create any network details here
because my Ingress or egress rules are
already available right now I can
basically Al then have my instance
stopped and removed so I can just do a
stop or since this is running the ideal
wave would be to do a stop I could also
do a reset now what does reset do reset
does not basically delete the machine
what it does is it does a cleanup of the
machine and it brings it to the initial
state so sometimes we might have
installed certain things on our machine
we would want to clean them up and at
that time reset can be useful I can
basically click on delete right and I
can select this and I can do a cleanup
and this is good always when you are
using a free trial account try to use
different Services play around with them
and then you can clean up so that you do
not waste your free billing credit right
and you can use it for Meaningful stuff
now I have clicked on delete and within
few seconds my instance which I had
created will be deleted also to remember
is if you are creating multiple
instances then you can connect from one
machine to other machine using SSH by
using the private file so for that we
can learn in detail later so this is
just a simple example of using your
compute engine creating your instances
connecting to it from an internal SSH or
from an external SSH client such as puty
where you have already created your
private and public Keys now I can click
on the browser here and then I can
basically come out and I can basically
be looking into any particular service
so we just looked into compute engine
right you have different other options
you have instance groups you have
instance templates for example let's
click on instance templates here and
that basically shows you that you don't
have any instance template and this
basically facilitates say for example
you are working as a admin and you would
want to create an instance template so
that using that you can describe a VM
instance and then you can basically use
this template to create different
instances you can go for soul tenant
noes you can look for machine images you
can also look at your discs you can
create a snapshots and you can look at
different options here now let's come
back here and let's click on home and
that should take you back to your
homepage which basically shows you if a
particular API which you have used
recently which shows me in the graph
here here so I can go to the API
overview right and that basically shows
me if there were any errors if I was
using the compute engine API to
basically create a VM instance and
that's why we were seeing some spike in
the graph so this is a quick demo of
using your compute engine service
provided by Google Cloud wherein you can
create VM instances and use those VM
instances for your application
installation for any other purpose now
that we have seen how you use your Cloud
console to create an instance and also
clean it up let's also understand how
you can do using your command line
options and let's see what it takes or
what are the different commands which
you can use to create your
instances now you can always when when
you're creating an instance you can use
compute engine which Provisions resource
to start the instance so instance
basically has different states which we
can see when we are creating the
instance so you basically start the
instance instance moves into staging
that is prepared for your first boot
finally it boots up and then it moves
into running so when you look at
instance states which we will create
instance and see it will basically have
different states such as provisioning
where resources are being allocated for
instance but instance is not yet running
then it goes into staging where
resources have been acquired an instance
is being prepared for your first boot
then instance is booting up and running
and if you are stopping an instance it
goes into being stop status and it would
be moved to the terminated option you
can also do a repairing of instance and
finally you can terminate your instance
or clean it up by stopping and then
deleting it now when you say stopping
and resetting an instance you can stop
the instance as I showed earlier if you
no longer need it but if you need for
future use you can just use the reset
option which will basically wipe the
contents of instance or any application
State and then finally you can stop it
and have it terminated now when you
would want to do that using your Cloud
console uh we have seen the option now
let's also see from the command line
tool how you can do it so here I have
the cloud shell which I brought up from
here and I basically opened it in a new
window so command line tool enables you
to easily manage your compute engine
resources in a friendlier format than
using your compute engine API now gcloud
which is part of cloud SDK is the main
command here and then you can always
autocomplete the different options here
so when you would want to create or work
on g-cloud you can just type in gcloud
here and then for example I could just
say help to see different options of
gcloud which will show me different
options which you can use here now we
would be interested in compute instances
so I could also do a
gcloud
compute compute instances and then I can
B basically say create and then I can do
a help now that should show me different
options which work with g-cloud compute
instances create command which is
expecting an instance name so your
Google Cloud SDK which we can set up on
our Windows machine or even on your
Linux machine is set of tools that helps
you to manage resources and applications
hosted on your gcp that is your Google
Cloud platform now here you have options
such as g-cloud which I'm showing you
right now you have Gs util and then you
have BQ so that also can be used so you
can set up a Google Cloud compute if
using gcloud now what we can do is if we
are setting up our SDK on our Windows
machine then we would have to do a
g-cloud in it which basically
initializes your configurations for
gcloud now here we are using a cloud
shell which was started from the console
and we don't have to basically give your
gcloud init command because it's already
initialized now you can always look at
your default Zone you can look at your
region what is being used all those
things are coming from the metadata
which is being used so for example I
could be looking at the metadata for my
particular project by just doing a
gcloud and then I can say
compute and I would be interested in
Project info so I can just do a project
minus info and then I can do a describe
and then I need my project ID so I can
say minus minus project and I can get my
project ID from here so you can click on
this one and that's my project ID so I
can click on this one
and here I can just do a right click and
if it does not paste then you can do a
control V and then I can try to look at
my project info so this basically will
give me the metadata which is by default
set and we can always look at what are
the regions or what is the Zone which
has been set so if it has been set so
I'm looking at my details it is showing
me my SSH keys and then it can be using
your default region and your default
available zones it also shows my
username and other details so this is
basically to look at the metadata which
is available now at any point of time I
can basically say add metad dat I can
basically choose metadata option and I
can say my default region should be
Europe which I was choosing earlier so I
can just bring up this command again and
what I can do is I can and say here
where I have g-cloud compute project
info where I did a describe earlier now
what I can also do is I can just say add
metadata and then I can specify what is
the metadata I would be interested in
adding I can then say Google
compute
default region and then I can basically
give a region for example Europe and
then I can say West
3 and if you are not well experienced
you can always do it from console or you
can be doing it from here so I'm giving
Google Cloud compute Google compute
default region then I can also give a
Google compute default
Zone and then I can pass in a value for
default zone so I can say Europe West 3
and then basically I can give an
availability zone so if it is basically
giving me some error where I'm trying to
pass in these values so I can just give
it this way and then it basically says
that if you can look into particular
help to see what is the command which
you would have to do now I can basically
do a
gcloud init here initial configuration
and this basically says that it is
initializing my default configuration it
says reinitialize this configuration
from cloud shell you want to create a
new configuration so if I had updated my
metadata then basically I could just do
a cloud in it and I could be
reinitializing my default configuration
or properties which I have passed in so
as of now I will not activate or change
the default region let's go for a simple
way in which you can create your compute
engine so for example I'll just say one
and it is reinitializing it asks me what
is the username and let's select that it
says what is the project and let's
select that and do you want to configure
a default compute region and zone right
and I will just say Yes And basically
then it shows me different options which
we have here so there are too many
options here and then here we were
interested in Europe West three so let's
choose 21 right and then that basically
allows me to choose my region and my
zone so it also gives you some
specification so it says your project
default compute Zone has been set to
Europe West 3A you can change it by
running g-cloud config set and you can
give a compute zone right so I can
always give these commands I can get
help information here so I can just say
G Cloud config set and I can be
specifying the compute zone so I can say
compute /zone and I can give a Zone I
can say compute SL region and I can give
a region name if I would want to do it
or the easier way is like what I did
right now so you can basically do a
command g-cloud in it and then basically
it allows you to change your
configuration or set default things here
you can all the times you can say
g-cloud config unset to basically remove
a compute zone or a compute region now
there are different ways so if you were
working on a Linux machine you could
always use an export command something
like this so you could do export compute
sorry Cloud
SDK and then you can say compute uncore
Zone and then give your Zone name or
compute uncore region and give your
region or you could add it in your bash
RC file right now that is when you have
your Cloud SDK set up on your Linux
machine or on Windows machine and you
would want to specifically set a Zone
and a region for all your compute
related resources so we don't need to do
that the default settings are already
given here right and what we can do is
we can start by quickly looking into
gcloud comput in instances options so I
can say g-cloud compute
instances and then I can just do a list
at any point of time if you would need
help you can just do a g-cloud compute
and then say minus minus help or I could
just to a g-cloud compute and that shows
me different options which I have here
from which I use instances I can always
type instances and again hit enter and
it shows me different options what you
would want to do so I can and initially
just type list which should show me what
are the list or what are the instances
available and as of now we don't have
any instances I can always do a list and
then I can specify minus minus format
and then try to get the information in a
Json format or EML or minus minus format
text so you can always do a list you can
do a filter so there are different
options with your list and you can you
can try doing a help here and that
basically shows you what are the options
so for example if I do a help and it
shows me with list what are the things
you can do so you can give a name you
can give a regular expression you can
say in particular Zone you can use a
minus filter so there are different
commands which are available and you can
always find all those options here as I
showed you earlier so now what we would
be interested Ed in is basically going
for your compute instances I can always
do a SSH and I can create an instance I
can add and remove metadata right for my
instances by giving a particular Zone by
giving a particular region and if you
would want to do that now here what we
can do is we can basically create an
instance by just giving a name to that
particular instance
and we can then go back to our console
and see what has it done so I can say
here create so that's an option let's
see what does the create do so it says
okay you are giving a create option but
you would have to give a name so let's
say let's call it E1 and that will be
the name of my instance and this one is
an easy command from your Cloud shell
which basically creates an instance you
see the Zone which has been set it is a
standard machine type it is not
preemptable it has an internal IP and it
has an external IP now I have created an
instance and here I can just go back and
then I can just do a Refresh on this
page and that already shows me the
instance which I've have created and
then you can use the same method to
connect to it using an SSH so I have an
instance created from my cloud shell and
what I can do is I can basically look
into instances and see what are the
different options with instance so if we
did a create right you have an option
delete we did a create you have an
option delete you can be then deleting
the instance from the command line or
you can use other options so you can do
a list you can do a stop you can start
so I can basically do a stop and let's
say even let's go ahead and do a stop
come on are pretty easy here to remember
or you can always use the help option
and now I'm trying to stop the instance
and then basically I can go ahead and
delete it so this is a simple way where
I created a instance from the command
line or from the console which I showed
earlier and similarly you can be working
with other options so now I've created
stop the instance let's do a listing to
see if my instance shows up it shows up
right and it says the status is
terminated so you have stopped it it's
in the terminated status and now what I
can do is I can go ahead and delete
it so it says this will be lost are you
sure you would want to continue just say
yes and that should take care of
deleting your instance so this is a
quick demo on creating your instance we
have already seen how you can connect to
these instances using SS mess now that
we have created instances let's also see
how to use Google Cloud's storage
service which can be used to load data
or upload data so for this we will have
to look into your Google cloud storage
options and here you can look in cloud
storage so let's go back here on the top
which shows me different Services which
we have here and let's look into storage
so this one shows me your storage option
now you can click on browser and that
basically shows me your storage browser
which shows me on the top you have
options for creating a bucket now Google
Cloud Storage allows you to store any
kind of data here the easiest and the
simplest way would be by using Cloud
console although you can again use cloud
shell and in that you can use your G g s
util command and GS util basically has
different options where you can be using
say for example I would want to work on
buckets so I can be using MB and then I
can use my command line option to create
buckets I can put in data there I can
browse it and I can access the data from
command line so let's create a bucket
here let's click on this let's give it a
name so let's say my data important
that's the name now I can click on
continue straight away I can look into
all of these options if I'm interested
in so you can basically be looking at
your monthly cost estimate in the
beginning now I can click on continue or
you can say choose where to store your
data and this one shows you different
options so you have region
specific so let's also give the bucket
name with all lowercase that's what is
required yeah so coming back to the
location type you can choose multi-
region which basically allows High
availability so your bucket or your
storage option will be accessible across
regions you can also give dual region
and high availability and low latency
across two regions I can also say region
specific so for our use case we can just
give region specific which can keep our
cost low but in business use cases you
would be going for multi- region now
here you have location and I would again
go for say Europe and let's choose
Europe west3 Frankford it is always a
good practice that when you create your
instances when you create your storage
or you use different Services try to
have a geographical region Chosen and
then you would try to put things or your
services within the particular region
within a particular Zone unless you
would want to make it accessible and
available across regions now I can then
choose a default storage class so when
you say default storage class there are
different storage class and each one is
for a different use case so you have
standard which is best for short-term
storage and frequently accessed data you
have near line so this is basically best
for backups and data access less than
once a month you can also have cold line
so these are basically like your cold
storage or freezing storage which you
might have heard generically as terms so
you can choose one of these storage
classes depending on what will be the
use case for this particular storage
bucket so let it be standard now how to
control access to objects so you can
basically say specify access to
individual objects by using object level
permissions now you can give permissions
to the bucket you can just say uniform
access to all objects in the bucket by
using only Bucket Level permissions so
you can choose that you can also go into
advanced settings and here you can see
different ways in which you can have
configuration set up now you can also
have a retention policy to specify the
minimum duration where that this buckets
object must be protected from deletion
and you can set a retention policy we
will not get into all that we will just
first try creating a bucket so just
click on Create and that should create
your bucket wherein I have my bucket now
I can click on overview to see the
details what is the region which region
it belongs what is the storage class
anytime you can always click on edit
bucket and make some changes here you
can look at the permissions so bucket
uses fine Grand access allowing you to
specify access to individual objects and
then you can basically look at who has
access to this so in my case editors of
the project they basically are the
bucket owners owners of project viewers
of the project right and you can
basically choose what kind of access you
need so for this you can always go into
cloud storage and then you can decide
what kind of access you would want to
give whether that's a storage admin it's
an object admin object Creator object
viewer and so on you can always look at
storage Legacy and for any other
services depending on what apis you have
enabled right you can always control
your commissions so right now it is
storage Legacy bucket reader and that's
fine and this one is bucket owner and
then might be I was using some other
services like data proc which uses cloud
storage and that's why I've given data
proc service agent also so these are
some of the members you can remove you
can view by specific members you can
view by roles so what are the different
roles which have access to this so it
says storage Legacy bucket owner there
are two owners based on this particular
project so these are autocont controlled
but then you can add or remove machines
you can save storage cost by adding a
life cycle rule to delete objects after
the duration of current retention policy
so you can add different policies and
you can basically control your bucket
now my bucket is already created right
so I can go back and then I see my
bucket is already here I can click on
this option
and you can anytime edit the bucket
permissions you can edit the labels the
default storage class you can just go
ahead and delete the bucket you can
export it to Cloud pup sub so basically
if you would want to have the content
from this bucket being accessible in a
message queuing system you can go for
Pub sub you can process with Cloud
functions and you can scan with cloud
data loss prevention so there are
different options which are available we
can always select this bucket and delete
it now I can click on the bucket and
that basically shows me different ways
in which I can upload some data here so
I can just click on upload files and
here then I can choose some files so for
example I'll go in here I'll go into
data sets and I have different data sets
so for example let's choose this one
which is a CSV file and then I'm just
uploading this to my cloud storage right
it's as simple as this so you can drag
and drop your files or you can just just
upload your files and my file is
uploaded here now I can basically edit
permissions for this one right so this
is in the bucket so anyone who has
access to this bucket can basically
download this file it can they can copy
move or rename this you can export it
and you can look at the permissions of
this file so let's look at edit
permissions and it says for this project
whoever is the owner it has access I've
also given a specific user my Gmail ID
and I've given access so at any point of
time you can just say add item and then
you can start giving different kind of
accesses so let's click on cancel here
now my data is already uploaded into
this particular bucket and that's a
simple usage of your cloud storage now
what we can also do is I can basically
select this and I can delete it I can
also create specific folders and then
basically uh load data into it I can
click on this one I can just do a
download and then I can download it
anywhere on my machine so let's go to
desktop and let's download this file so
we not only uploaded some content in the
bucket but we also downloaded that in a
different location which will be
accessible now what I could have also
done is I could have created a folder
here and I could have specified say for
example example immediate immediate
data okay and I'm clicking on this one
so that's my immediate data I can click
on this one and now I can upload my data
specifically to this particular folder
by using the same mechanism you can just
do upload file let's choose air
passengers let's do a open and my file
will be
uploaded so you can always choose what
is the retention expiry date for this
one so as of now there is nothing right
but you can be deleted objects can be
deleted or modified until they reach
their minimum duration you can control
all of that you can basically download
it right you can copy it and you can
move it and rename it so this is a
simple example where I created a
particular bucket right now if for
example you click on this transfer so it
says cloud storage data transfer
products have moved you can now find
storage transfer service on premise data
and transfer Appliance in new data
transfer section right so you can always
go back to cloud storage you can also
look at transfer options which are
mainly when you are using a on premise
service and you would want to upload
data in a Google Cloud right so this is
my bucket here now I can go to Cloud
console and here what I can do is if I
would be interested in working so I can
just say GSU util right and then we have
uh for example let's try a help okay and
that basically shows me my GS util now
you can always go to Quick Start GS util
tool and this is one more way wherein
basically you can do it from the command
line so working with buckets so you can
do a GS util MB minus B and then on a
particular Zone if you would be
interested in and then you can say GS
colon and give a names so my awesome
bucket this is how you will create a
bucket which will show you it is
creating a bucket and then basically you
can upload an image or some data from
internet you can just do a w get
download the file and then you can just
do a GS util copy command and that
basically will pick up the file from
your Cloud shell location put it in your
bucket once you have done that you can
always do a copy right so here you're
are doing a copy from your local machine
that is your Cloud shell machine to your
bucket and you can do the reverse of
that that is you can do a copy and you
can point your bucket and the file and
download it to your desktops so you can
just download that using the command
line and you can copy the object to a
folder in the bucket so that is by
creating a particular folder and you're
pushing the file into a particular
bucket you can list the contents of a
bucket using LS and then give your
bucket name so GS colon so we can just
try this one to be simple and rest you
guys can try so here you can just do a
GS util you can do a LS GS colon SL
slash and then I need to give my bucket
name so in my case the bucket name was
my data important so let's try that so
let's say my data important and I'm
trying to list the bucket and the
content it has right and then you have a
folder and then you can look into the
folder and look into the files so this
is a simple quick option wherein you can
use your Cloud shell you could be using
your Google Cloud SDK from your local
machine or you can be using Cloud
console to create a bucket upload some
data on it download the data see if the
data is accessible and that basically
shows you the power of cloud storage
where you can easily upload any kind of
data now what we can also do is as
you're using a free account or even a
paid account unless and until you would
want to keep the bucket you can select
it and you can just go ahead and delete
it so this will basically ask you to ke
the bucket name and let's say my data
important you need to confirm your
bucket name click on confirm and you
could have done that using GS util and a
delete command from the command line
that is from cloud shell so we have now
created a bucket we have uploaded some
data into it we saw how you can download
it or create a folder and upload some
specific data into it and also you can
do the same thing using GS util tools
wherein you can list your bucket create
your buckets delete it create some
folders into it and do everything from
the command line so this is in simple
way you can use your gcp where either
you can spin up your machines or you can
use cloud storage to basically use a
storage or a easy to use instance on
Google Cloud platform now we're going to
take a brief look at the overview of the
Google Cloud platform this will include
a brief tour of the hardware
underpinnings names that they give to
the various abstractions including
things like what does it mean for a
resource to be Global what does it mean
for a resource to be Regional and and
what does zonal mean these abstractions
live on top of the hardware level and
it's important to understand that there
is a distinct difference between the two
so why choose a cloud platform to begin
with well it's one of the things that
that Google mentioned recently in a
presentation they said that if you look
at the cost of a computer if you look at
over its four-year life that the
majority of the cost is energy and
Google is very very focused on making
their data centers very energy efficient
and they've invested a lot in Security
in extremely high-speed networking and
I'm convinced that companies and
especially small companies just can't
match that investment so there is a
broad movement to the cloud people are
realizing that it's going to be better
to rent instead of buy computers and if
you look at the Google Cloud platform
they've had years and years of
experience building out Cloud platform
for their search for their Gmail for
their V you know YouTube for their
various offerings and they decided u a
while ago that they wanted to make this
available to all of us so they're
offering this so that we can build and
test and deploy applications on their
platform that scale just as the Google
applications scale Computing solution
there is no one ideal way of storing
information so Google offers a lot of
choices several choices in Computing
their choices in storage their options
for Big Data one of the things that
Google is really leading on now is
machine learning so by opening this up
we can work on this highly scaled Global
compute infrastructure and build our own
applications that run alongside of
Google's apps and as you know Google is
in the business for a long time so
they've had all that time to perfect
their
technology
so so there's a couple words here that I
want to Define so that we're all clear a
data center is a facility it's a
building or multiple buildings that have
their own power
substations they have high security
there's perimeter fencing there's all
sorts of codes that you have to use to
get inside then very very few people
actually get inside a data center it's
highly secure and this is where all the
computers are this is where the
networking is this is where you know the
the low-level compute power of the cloud
is is residing they have different data
centers and they're opening many more
we'll talk about that um a little bit
later another really critical thing
about the Google infrastructure is they
have an very well-designed very wellth
thought out networking underneath all of
this they have a global meshed red
redundant fiber optic Network that spans
the globe and I don't know you may have
noticed in the in the news recently that
they announced a connection uh with Asia
new one that they've just put the fiber
down so they're actively building new
connections a point of presence is the
edge of Google and the rest of the
internet so if you're have a computer
and you need to have packets go to
Google they'll Transit from your
computer through the internet and
they'll hit a point of presence and
that's where your packets your
connection will get on the Google Fiber
and find its way into the Data Center
and they have over 110 Edge points of
presence now in 33 countries just a
little while ago it was I think 80 so
they're expanding those quite
aggressively and if you look at
information flowing out from the data
centers to you or your clients there's
Edge caching so these are also residing
right at the edge of the Google file
and they will cach your information to
make it a faster interaction with your
customers and we'll talk about caching a
bit more when we look at uh some of the
particulars of the compute
infrastructure this is actually one of
the more important slides of the whole
session this is the first one where
we're going above the physical so when
physical we talked about actual
computers data centers the fiber cables
the switches the network cables and so
on we're going to leave those behind and
now we're going to raise oursel in terms
of abstractions and the three terms that
are crucial are Global Regional and
zonal so these are essentially the
lowest level of idea that we're going to
be working with so let's start with Zone
and a zone is roughly equivalent to a
Data Center and zones are where you have
your compute power you have your Diss
and so on in terms of designing a system
uh especially for a high availability
system you need to consider that a Zone
could fail so it's best to have compute
power in multiple zones and balance the
request ac across them and and we'll
talk about that particular detail later
the important thing to know is that some
resources in the cloud are anchored in a
zone for example a compute engine
instance is a zonal resource the next
abstraction is region and a region is a
geog graic area and it may it will
contain multiple zones and an example of
a resource that's Regional is a network
load balancer so you can set up Network
load balancer and then it will send the
request to different zones and it will
be aware of the health of all the
computers so if one does fail it will
stop sending requests there and it'll
send it to other computers in different
zones and the third concept is global so
there are some resources that are Global
that spam all the different regions for
example when you create a network it is
a global resource so your compute
engines in a Zone will connect to a
network which is global and essentially
they can talk to any other computer
connect to that Global Network so you
can easily configure a system where
everything appears to be on a local area
network but in fact it's a Global
Network so and that points out another
thing that's kind of important about
moving to the cloud is some of the
things that you know based on your
experience with the real world you know
I say the real world the physical world
of computers and so on some of those
ideas you're going to need to leave
behind because it's different some
things are quite different when you get
into the cloud and I'll be sure to point
those out as we as we work through these
uh these
slides so again let's look at Cloud
regions and zones and global zonal
resources operate in a single zone an
example again is a compute engine
instance and its Associated discs a
Regional resources are in a geographic
area for example us Central or Asia or
Europe and a region will have multiple
zones and then Global is spanning the
whole planet so you may want to have a
single IP address for your uh web
application that would be a global
resource and Google provides load
balancers across regions and you can
have Regional load balancers that
balance things across
zones Google is is really working hard
to Pioneer efficiency and performance in
their data centers they as I said that
they have determined that the majority
of the cost of computing is energy so
they are focused very very diligently on
reducing the cost they've been carbon
neutral since 2007 they're investing
heavily in wind and solar and they have
been they're pioneering efficiency so
they are a really good engineering
company that's one of the things that
you need to keep in mind as you learn
about the various parts of the Google
Cloud platform they're good Engineers
they're very proud of their engineering
and they do incredible jobs with uh what
they're focused on recently they've
applied artificial intelligence to
optimize each Data Center for Energy use
so they will measure ambient temperature
and other factors and adjust all the
parameters for a particular data center
so it has it consumes the least amount
of energy possible there's also a trend
that we are very very aware of and that
is that the price of computing is
constantly going down and Google is very
focused also on passing the savings
along to us and they've come up with
several ways of monetizing the savings
one is sub hour billing so the idea here
is that if you ask for a computer I'll
give you a specific example you can ask
for a 32 core 208 gigabyte computer and
run it for only 20 minutes you know they
don't Ram round up to the next hour and
the cost for renting a computer of that
size for 20 minutes maybe you're
checking out some code maybe you've got
a caching algorithm or something like
that you want to test well that will
cost you about 50s so it's really really
economical uh to use for experimentation
and getting things set up and and the so
and so on on the other side once you get
your software stable and you're ready to
deploy it Google has what's called a
sustained use discount so as you use the
Computing infrastructure throughout the
month they will give you an increasing
discount that basically goes up to about
25% so they're rewarding not just um
temporary use but they're also rewarding
sustained use uh there's another feature
they came out with which is custom
machine type so you can dial in exactly
the amount of CPU power and memory that
you need for your application and we're
hearing reports that that will save
customers about 10 or
15% and the fourth Innovation they've
come up with is what's called
preemptable instances so these are this
is like Scavenging the for free
essentially unused compute power so if
you build a system that that anticipates
a computer going down and your software
can understand that and reschedule it on
another computer you literally can save
50% the price is half of of the same
machine in non- preemptable mode so
again there's four ways that they are
currently providing uh they're passing
on the savings that they're finding from
declining prices of
computers Google has made numerous
contributions to cloud computing in fact
they've been pioneers of cloud computing
since the very beginning all of their
major products including search maps
YouTube and other features like that run
on their own cloud computing
infrastructure they've been running
containers for years and now they want
to provide that understanding that
intellectual property and the ability to
scale applications to Google scale to us
Google's well they're they're focused on
Innovation and what they have learned is
that it's it's to their benefit and it's
to the industry's benefit to make things
open and as they have designed
Innovative Technologies to to support
their own infrastructure they have
released technical papers describing
what they've done so they've had names
like um Dremel and Colossus and things
like that and once they've published
these papers the open source Community
has noted them has read them and
frequently will implement the ideas uh
as as an open- Source uh product and the
the Google has really taken note of that
and in fact they are releasing a a lot
of their new Innovations completely open
source a notable example that we'll look
at later is something called kubernetes
so they've they've learned how to run
containers very efficiently on their
infrastructure and they decided to
rebuild all of that add some new
intellectual property and release that
as a open- source project that we can
all join we can all use
uh open- Source licensing again that
follows with not just kubernetes but a
lot of the low-level uh libraries for
connecting to the Google Cloud platform
they release those open source and again
it it helps everyone it helps Google and
moves the industry
forward the Publications I've mentioned
already for example you can look on
papers on how they've built their uh
their low-level data stores uh what
Dremel is about Dremel is about high
high efficiency querying of
data and because of this
interoperability and the the fact that
they've released things open source we
can now think about even building things
across multiple platforms multiple Cloud
providers so again kubernetes is the
open-source container management
software that Google's released Google
has a product called container engine
that uses kubernetes and adds some
special Google features but you can run
kubernetes on your own machine you could
run it on Amazon you can run it on Open
snack you could run it on digital ocean
you can run it anywhere and so by doing
that Google is opening up the interest
of the whole industry about containers
and Google's gamble I mean it is a
gamble they're they're releasing their
key intellectual property they believe
that they will be able to provide the
best platform the best product for
running containers and by reducing the
risk to all of us by having kubernetes
be open source everybody wins and Google
will be in a good
position Google is not standing still
and this slide is meant to show you a
bit of where their vision is going so
the first wave we've had is was
collocation and I literally on my desk
have a computer that I I sent to a
collocation place a long time ago and
I've since requested it back so
collocation is where you either send
your equipment and that's located in a
managed environment or you rent
computers that are in a managed
environment and you can imagine your
computer sitting in a rack and you can
connect to it and the advantage is that
you've got that vendor security and
you've got their power and so
on the next wave that happened is
virtualization so here we're getting
into virtual machines and we're starting
to get the virtualization of various
parts and this is essentially where we
are right now we're right at the end of
the second wave and we're moving into to
the
third and the third is a completely
Global elastic cloud and once we move
here we'll we'll not worry about virtual
machines we'll just ask for a bit of
compute power and we'll get it you know
and we'll probably get it very very
quickly so we'll be able to scale up
we'll be able to scale down and we'll be
able to match the compute resources that
we consume to match the the needs of our
software as requests go up and the
requests go down
the fact that you can have a Computing
environment that tracks with your usage
is is actually it's it's more
significant than you might think and
from a technical perspective it has huge
benefits from a business perspective
that just think about how you have to in
the old days you'd have to invest in a
large number of servers if you had a
startup company and get your software
ready get it all hosted and you'd have
to size your servers to to the
anticipated Peak load and if you don't
get the peak load then you're basically
wasting your investment but when you
have an elastic cloud and you use
compute resources as you need them
you're only going to pay for those so
from a business perspective you don't
have the initial investment the huge
upfront cost you can just have things
track with your usage and it turns out
to be a much much easier environment to
manage okay in ter terms of
definitions this is another one of those
slides that's significant in terms of
you know kind of defining what is
infrastructure as a service and what is
p platform as a service these are both
completely uh valid things to be using
and you can even use them at the same
time but they're different
philosophically so on the infrastructure
as a service side the main offering from
Google is called compute engine
and this is where you have raw compute
power storage networking and so on and
it's the closest analog to what we're
used to you know on in our physical
world so if you think about a machine a
computer that you've got and maybe
you're building it yourself or you're
ordering the parts or you you order the
complete computer in the computer is the
motherboard is the chip is the ram are
the discs and so on and so compute
engine and infrastructure as a service
is the cloud equivalent of that so you
literally can go and say Hey I want a
particular computer I want to have this
much memory in it and all we're doing is
going to a web page and clicking options
and we were building an abstract
computer this way and because we're
essentially taking things off the shelf
we're saying okay I want a particular
dis it's the size nobody else can use it
it's ours I want a CPU with so much
power it's our CPU and nobody else can
use it we're taking it off the shelf
essentially so the fair thing to do is
for Google to charge you for what you've
requested and so that's the pay for what
you allocate even if you don't
completely utilize it you can build a up
a computer and they'll charge you per
hour or actually per minute for all the
resources that you've requested platform
as a service is a different philosophy
here you are um Supply in your business
logic and Google is taking care of a lot
more of the details they'll give you run
times it's a kind of a Sandbox
environment and they will scale things
for you automatically so the fair thing
to do is to charge you for the resources
you use at that moment so if you need a
100 app engines to support your your
requests or if you need just one Google
will scale that up and down and you'll
only pay for the amount of compute power
and resources that you're using minute
by minute
okay so across the whole Cloud platform
these are the major categories there's
compute power there's storage there's a
bunch of products focused on big data
and the new innovation area and where
Google is working very very hard is
machine learning and we'll we'll learn
about that near the end of the
course okay so talking about compute
here we've even got three options so
we've got app engine we've got container
engine and we have compute engine
app engine is the most constrained
environment you do not have much
flexibility in terms of what you can do
but the benefit is by constraining your
application to only the business logic
you really only write the business logic
Google takes the responsibility for
everything else making sure the software
is updated patching scaling taking care
of all the
infrastructure again on the far right
side this is the infrastructure as a
service you're going to be building your
computers you need to worry about U how
big they need to be and do the scaling
and so on but Google still takes care of
a lot of things they will actually move
a virtual machine to a different bit of
Hardware as it's running in case they
need to do maintenance so there still is
a huge benefit even at this level of you
know defining computers to have it run
in the cloud container engine is kind of
in the middle it's a level above virtual
machines uh container ER engine is all
about very lightweight Docker containers
coming to life very quickly or scaling
up or scaling down so again there's no
one ideal
choice and also in storage you can see
the same thing there's no one ideal
choice for storage we've got big table
we've got cloud storage that we're going
to look at in detail we're going to look
at cloudsql a relational database and
cloud data store a very unique data
mechanism that scal alongside of app
engine on the big data side and again
these are all completely managed
Services there's big query it's
extremely high performance fast SQL
language data processing system it's
great at reading log files and giving
you an idea of what's going on in your
application it's great at processing all
sorts of information and it will even
ingest information as it's occurring so
you can think think of Internet of
Things devices sending information to
Big query and you can be doing near
realtime analysis of all that data
pubsub is a very simple idea it's about
sending messages to people who are
interested in what you're saying and
it's Google scale it'll take you know
million messages per second and it's
also a great decoupling tool in terms of
architecture data flow is very
Innovative this is essentially
generation two of map reduce I'm told
that people at Google don't actually use
map produce anymore they all use data
flow and data flow incorporates the idea
of map produce plus a lot of other
things and again we're going to have
some detailed slides on all of these
coming up data proc is essentially
Hadoop managed by Google the value add
by Google is it can spend a cluster up
in 90 seconds and it can resize it as
your workload is going so it minimizes
your cost and it's designed to be
compatible with Hado processing outside
of the cloud or in other cloud so you
can just bring your Hado processing run
it on data proc and you take advantage
of the Google platform data lab is a
notebook like presentation of big
information so you can have it execute
queries you can do Graphics you can put
it into a notebook like format and then
give it to someone who wants to
understand the results of all this
processing and the Machine learning side
this is really I think this is
particularly exciting we've made some
major advances in machine learning you
probably know that Google has a machine
Learning System that beat the world's
expert in the go go game and what you do
is you build up a set of definitions in
machine learning and then train the
system to do a particular task so Google
has done the training already in some
areas they have a vision API that can
recognize uh things in a picture it can
tell like if your pet is a cat or a dog
which is pretty interesting uh there's
General machine learning so you can
build your own models they designed a
speech model so that we it can recognize
speech and there's another model for
translation between languages so you can
build your own models or you can take
some of these existing ones and
incorporate them in your
application okay so now we're going to
have a
lab this first lab is going to guide you
through the steps to set up a
relationship with Google Cloud you're
going to set up an account and you're
going to create a project projects are
the uh container for everything that you
do in the cloud so these will take you
through the steps you're going to need
to have a credit card and the credit
card is not so that you're going to be
paying for things it's for your so that
Google knows your identity it wants to
know exactly who you are and then once
you do that you will select an option
for a free trial and upgrade your
account you're going to get $300 of
credit that's good for 60 days so the
the course that you're taking now
probably will use maybe two I I'd be
surprised if you more use more than $5
of that 300 so at the end you're going
to have a nice account you'll have money
left and you'll be able to do a lot of
experimentation in the
cloud so I'm going to bring up
another window here
and I'm going to go to my
console okay go to this little icon in
the upper left hand corner with a three
horizontal lines if you click on that
that pops out a
tray the different areas of the cloud
and what I suggest is you go to
billing and you should see that you've
got a billing account
uh see here billing management for
cp300 uh there's it's linked to an
account called Randolph
kale your account your billing account
will be named something
else and you can then manage billing
accounts you can see that there's a
billing account the account ID that it's
active and here it says I've got nine
projects associated with that and I can
say my projects and see exactly what
they're connected to
so uh again I'm already in a
relationship with Google so I have I
don't see exactly what you're
seeing but see if you can go through
those areas and see if it's if it's
active and so on is it necessary to
write down the credit card you need to
enter the credit card yes the credit
card is required by Google not so they
can charge your credit card but it's
used for
identification and you what what you do
is you enter your credit card you set up
you say yes please Bill me that means
create a billing account but then you
immediately say I will accept the free
trial you get $300 of credit which is
good for 60 days if at the end of 60
days and or when you've used up the $300
your credit card will be charged so do
understand that so you may want to turn
things off we'll talk about that how you
can make sure that you're not going to
get charged the easiest way is simply to
delete your project you can just go in
and say I need this whole project
deleted and then there's nothing active
so you will not be
charged okay activating the cloud
Shell let's take a look at that I'm
going to go to my home area on my screen
and the cloud shell there bring here is
this icon right here so you notice in
the upper right hand corner there's a
little picture of me that uh identifies
the account the relationship with Google
so that's me with a particular account I
actually have about five accounts with
Google so I use this little photo to
remind me which one it is and if you go
to the left you'll see this little icon
that's the cloud shell so let me pick um
CP 100 class let me switch over to
that and then I'm going
to oh that's interesting the cloud shell
is not working
okay they they made a major change to
the the user interface yesterday in fact
this D down used to be over on the right
um and I'm not sure what is going on I'm
I'm going to go off mute and see if I
can figure it out
first let me explain what's going on the
cloud platform is comprised of many
different Services Each of which has an
API structure so that you can access it
in fact everything is communicated
through a rest
API and they don't turn on all of the
apis when you create your project and
you first set up set up a relationship
um because they they just want to save
the uh the compute power to set up
credentials and so on so I'm guessing
the thing that you need to do is to go
up here and click on this icon and bring
the tray out and then go down to compute
engine and click on that and what you
should see then is not what I have you
know I see create an instance you will
probably see please wait we're setting
up the compute engine API and so once
you do that they Google will set up the
INF structure they'll set up the
credentials they'll set up a bunch of
things like that so I notice that once I
did that notice my cloud shell is now
open uh that's what's happened they've
made a they've reset some things so you
need to go into the compute engine area
just by going into that area should turn
on the activation of the API it should
turn on the creation of credentials and
then it'll give you the cloud shell that
I'm now running that you can see in the
window
so Dale please try that and let me know
if that
works and I also want to add do not get
concerned about the amount of time we're
spending on this this is an absolutely
crucial lab this obviously gets everyone
set up to run all the other labs so we
will take as much time as required to
make sure that everybody's up and
running you have the accounts properly
set up and so on and we'll work through
the details with you
right so the last thing you should be
doing is is creating a project
we're just creating a project called CP
100 I'm showing you on the screen that's
the last step of this
lab this lab is
overview and then
introduction and then register for the
free trial which is five steps and then
create a project which ends with the
third with step three on the final
slide let me go bring up a console and
show you
so you should be here there should be a
drop down right here notice that uh
first of all there's the the icon that
brings the tray out and then I have some
of these pinned I can tell tell you
about those later but right here I've
got a project and if you click on that
it says create a project and this is
where you put in your your name and you
you get your ID and so on so that's what
you should see let's get started but
before that if you want to learn more
about cloud computing and Cloud
architecture to take your career to new
heights then you can check out our calch
postgraduate program in cloud computing
that will help you master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to become a cloud expert
here we will learn about Google Cloud
web hosting some basics of cloud
computing web hosting service providers
what is gcp and why go for it different
types of web hosting which are possible
a use case such as Lush and a quick
handson on using gcp for web
hosting when you talk about Cloud web
hosting Google cloud has the feature of
hosting a secure and reliable websites
easily it ensures customers and sites
protection the website is a is hosted on
a fast and reliable Network you can do
more work for Less Price with Google
Cloud now when we talk about Google
Cloud it is always good to know some
basics of our cloud computing now when
we talk about cloud computing cloud
computing is basically using resources
which are provided by your cloud service
provider such as Google cloud and cloud
computing basically means using hardware
and software components to deliver a
service on a network now here users can
access files applications from any
device that can access Internet so when
we talk about cloud computing this is
basically using Services which are
hosted on the infrastructure managed by
cloud provider when we talk about
resources which can be used that may
include big data services storage
options your Computing options
networking options and various other
services which a cloud provider
offers cloud computing has various
different service models such as you
have platform as a service software as a
service infrastructure as a service also
these days we talk about containers as a
service and these are your different
Computing service models which are being
offered by cloud service providers which
allow you for automatic integration with
your existing environment or if you
would want to benefit from modernization
by using a cloud providers
infrastructure you have different
Services which are offered some of them
are for auto software integration or
migration backing up and restoring data
scaling your storage capacity that is
going for an unlimited storage capacity
and using a resource provided by cloud
service provider benefiting from
reliability cost efficiency which is
offered by a cloud provider in this case
we are talking about Google Cloud when
you talk about web hosting service
providers there are various web hosting
service providers you have AWS you have
square space IBM Cloud GoDaddy Blu host
and Google Cloud so what is gcp and why
go for
it when you talk about gcp or as we call
it as Google Cloud platform it a set of
Cloud Computing Services provided by
Google that runs on the same
infrastructure that Google uses for it
end user products like YouTube Gmail and
much more when you talk about gcp there
are various reasons why anyone would
choose it for their use cases now let's
look at some reasons when you talk about
pricing gcp has better pricing compared
to its competitors depending on the
services which you would use
whether that would be infrastructure as
a service such as using compute engine
instances and running your applications
on them or might be a managed service
such as data proc or big table or your
big query where you can have your Hado
clusters running or store huge amount of
data or even build your data warehouse
wherein you can store structured data so
there are different services with gcp
offers and pricing has been a better
option in case of Google in comparison
to other competitors when you talk about
Speed and Performance it's very fast and
increases the performance of your
project if you use different services
offered by
Google when you talk about live
migration of apps this is one of the
features which organizations usually
like which none of other computors are
offering when it comes to live migration
of apps
so there are specific features for
example when you talk about computer
engine there is a feature stating live
migration wherein your resources or your
instances which are running applications
would be migrated during say maintenance
from one underlying host to another
underlying host without affecting your
application's performance and you can
benefit from that when you talk about
Big Data Google cloud has various
offerings in Big Data space and that's
one of the advantages of gcp in
comparison to other competitors you have
different services for your big data
needs such as Pub sub for publish
subscribing messaging system or going
for data proc which basically allows you
to spin up your Hadoop and Spark
clusters to run your different jobs and
so on so when we talk about features of
Google Cloud platform it offers High
productivity because you are using the
resources which are based on the same
infrastructure which Google uses for its
own different use cases you can work
from anywhere provided you have internet
connection and you can connect to the
cloud platform and use different
services offered via web you can quickly
collaborate with different teams or
different colleagues working on
different projects which might be
sharing or using different gcp resources
you are benefiting from high security
and different encryption and security
mechanisms with gcp offers now there are
fewer sources or you could say data
which is stored or vulnerable devices
there is high reliability flexibility or
scalability which gcp offers and the
cost Effectiveness really makes it as a
good choice when you would want to
benefit from infrastructure
modernization and using a cloud platform
solution for your use case now when you
talk about different types of web
hosting Google Cloud offers three types
of web hosting you have WordPress now it
is a free and open-source content
management system you might have used in
past or have heard about WordPress where
lot of websites are being created it is
a popular web publishing platform to
easily set up blogs and websites and
thus used by organizations or even
individual users for having their blogs
or running their websites or promoting
their products you have lamp which
stands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP
and lamp stack consists of Linux Apache
HTTP server MySQL and PHP and is used to
host websites and web
applications you also have your option
of building your own website so you can
develop website or web application with
your own code directly on compute engine
now let's look at a use case and
understand what happened here when we
talk about Lush so Lush was founded in
1995 it's you might have seen this brand
somewhere in the streets it is a global
Cosmetics retailer headquartered in UK
it sells a diverse range of fresh
handmade products Lush had become a
global brand with over 930 stores in 49
countries so the challenges which were
faced here was traffic on in day caused
website crash for almost 18 hours and
this is something which had a
devastating effect on their business the
previous platform had no scalability
option what was the solution the
movement of website during the peak time
was easy due to flexibility of gcp
platform with rapid VM deployment on
Google compute engine the environments
were monitored and destroyed in minutes
so the team could test and deploy at
speed by using Google Cloud SQL Lush
took complete control of its
infrastructure and optimize its systems
for Effective scaling overall the
platform resulted in lower cost that led
to a bright future for Lush Cosmetics
now what was the result of all this the
availability during Peak loads was
improved because of Google compute
engines Auto scaling feature the
infrastructure hosting costs were
reduced by 40% streamline Data Center
usage from 5 to 3 with Google's
highquality private Network really
benefited Lush and it provided a
flexible architecture and scalability
for future business growth now what we
have seen here is that your Google cloud
and its web hosting basically offers
users to run their websites or use a web
hosting solution that can benefit in
more than one way the simplest approach
could be seen is by by clicking and
setting up a VM instance by going to
your console for example if we go in to
the Google Cloud platform clicking on
console and here the easiest way I could
test it is by going to my compute engine
VM instances and here I can spin up an
instance I can click on create now in my
previous sessions I have also explained
about how you could create a template
and run an instance from that we can
also click on new VM instance let's call
it new instance I will choose a region
for example Frankfurt I will let it be
general purpose machines let this
machine be one virtual CPU core and 3.75
GB Ram if I'm looking for a heavier
website which might have more users
logging in and so on then I can choose a
higher configuration machine here we
have the option to choose our
distribution so for example I can choose
u 2 and then I can choose a distribution
version so it let it be
16.04 we can choose the dis size to be
20 gbyte and we can use ssds or hdds so
as of now it is standard persistent disk
that is sdd and that should be enough
let's click on select here I will say
allow default access I would say allow
HTTP and
https so that if I have a website
content hosted on this machine I can
access it over HTTP now here you have
management options for your instance you
have security option which basically
allows you to provide a public key if
you are interested in using an external
SSH client to connect now I have used
puty gen and I have already created a
private key which is here I have also
converted that as a pem file and anytime
if I would want to use this ke
all I need to do is click on puty gen
where I had earlier created this PPK
file now I can just do a load and I can
choose the key which I have here and I
can give the pass phas click on okay and
that shows you the public key let's copy
the public key from here let's go into
our instance and I can give this here
that resolves the name so I have the
private key saved on my machine and
public key with which will be pushed
into the machine I can click on Create
and that should create my instance to
which you can connect using SSH from the
console itself or using a external
client such as puty which will then need
the public IP of this instance the PPK
file what we have and you can connect to
this instance what I can also do is I
can just do a simple SSH from here and
that will basically allow me to connect
to the instance what we also need to
remember is each instance what we create
in compute is also having some default
firewall rules now I have connected to
my instance I can click on Pudo Su I can
log in as root and here if I would want
I can install a particular service so
let's say Apache uh let's say appt get
install and then I can say Apache 2 or
httpd that is basically to host your web
app application so I'm installing this
service and here I can check if the
service is running by doing a service
httpd status or I can say service Apache
2 status with says it is already running
that means the Apache web server page
will be accessible from HTTP provided my
firewall rules allow that now before we
look into this we can also for our
instance look at the firewall rules so
here you have Network details now since
we created an instance by default Google
has created some firewall rules which
allow default HTTP
https icmp your default internal access
RDP and SSH access and here it says
these Ingress rules which allow incoming
traffic are allowed from anywhere we can
customize that as specific IP addresses
we can also look at egress which is
basically outgoing traffic and this is
again saying my machine can connect to
the external World in different ways
using different protocols so you can
customize these firewall rules as of now
I'm going to let it be default now we
connected to our instance from the
browser and we were basically checking
how you can use this browser by clicking
on this now what I can also do is here
I'm logged into the instance my Apache
server is running
so the best way to check if the Apache
web server is accessible via HTTP all I
need is my
public IP so let's copy this let's go
here and I will say
HTTP SL slash just give your public IP
and that shows your Apache to web server
page that means the Apache service has
already been run now here it tells if
you would want to host a particular page
what you will have to do is as it says
here it is based on equivalent page on
dbn from which ubu Apache packaging is
derived if you can read this page it
means Apache HTTP server is installed at
this site is working properly now you
can replace this file located at VAR www
HTML index.html before continuing to
operate your HTTP server so this is
where you can change the particular page
and you will be able to host your
website on this particular E2 instance
what we can do is we can check this so
we can go into the browser and we can
look in VAR
www and that has an HTML folder look
into this and as of now you have a
index.html and that basically is the
page what we are seeing now I can click
click on this one and I can see I have a
small HTML page which is basically
showing me what we are seeing on our web
server what I can also do is for now I
can test it out and I can put in a
different HTML page and see how that
works so we had basically the page here
in VAR
www and then we had the HTML folder and
in HTML folder folder what I had was
this index file so as of now I just
moved it and I put it in a different
location so if I look in my H
hdu
index.html that shows me the complete
HTML page what we were seeing on our web
server and here it shows you what this
page would display if you run it on your
HTTP it says aache to window to default
page it shows it works it shows the
content and so on so for just testing I
moved this page out from this location
and what I did was I added a different
page here so that page if you look in
HTML and then look in my page. HTML
section I've just added some basic
details of creating HTML I'm saying body
I'm using Mari and then I'm closing this
with HTML tag now this is a simple HTML
page which I create
and now what I did was once I've done
this I basically did a service Apache
restart so once you do that it will take
up your new page and once you have done
that now you can access that by going to
your
HTTP giv your details and then basically
give your public IP which we can get
from
here and just paste it here now now hit
on this so that shows me there is a my
page. HTML I can click on this and that
basically shows the symbol page which I
created so as of now this is my web page
which I have created and this is hosted
on my compute instance now obviously we
can create a more complex website backed
up by a database use PHP use MySQL to
store the data and then host your
website on a Google Cloud platform
service such as compute where your
actual code is running so we can learn
about your web hosting on compute
instances in further sessions let's get
started but before that if you want to
learn more about cloud computing and
Cloud architecture to take your career
to new heights then you can check out
our calch postgraduate program in cloud
computing that will help you master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to become a cloud
expert hi guys today we got something
very special in store for you we're
going to talk about the best cloud
computing platform available Amazon web
services uh Rahul I think you said
something wrong here the best cloud
computing platform is obviously Google
Cloud platform no it isn't AWS has more
than 100 services that span a variety of
domains all right but Google Cloud
platform has cheaper instances what do
you have to say about that well I guess
there's only one one place we can
actually discuss this a boxing ring so
guys I'm AA and I will be Google Cloud
platform and I'm Rahul I'll be AWS so
welcome to fight night this is AWS
versus gcp the winner will be chosen on
the basis of their origin and the
features they provide their performance
in the present day and comparing them on
the basis of pricing market share and
options the things they give you for
free and instance configuration now
first let's talk about AWS AWS was
launched in 2004 and is a cloud service
platform that helps business grow and
scale by providing them services in a
number of different domains these
domains include compute database storage
migration networking and so on a very
important aspect about AWS is its years
of experience now AWS has been in the
market a lot longer than any other cloud
service platform which means they know
how businesses work and how they can
contribute to the business growing also
AWS has over $5.1 billion of Revenue in
the last quarter this is a clear
indication of how much faith and trust
people have in AWS they occupy more than
40% of the market which is a significant
sunk of the cloud computing Market they
have at least 100 services that are
available at the moment which means just
about every issue that you have can be
solved within AWS service now that was
great but now can we talk about gcp I
hope you know that GCB was launched very
recently in 2011 and it is already
helping businesses significantly with a
suite of intelligent secure and flexible
Cloud Computing Services it lets you
build deploy and scale applications
websit side services on the same
infrastructure as Google the intuitive
user experience that gcp provides with
dashboards Wizards is way better in all
the aspects gcp has just stepped in the
market and it is already offering a
modest number of services and the number
is rapidly increasing and the cost for a
CPU instance or Regional storage that
gcp provides is a whole lot cheaper and
you also get a multi-regional cloud
storage now what do you have to say on
that I'm so glad you asked let's look at
present day in fact let's look at the
Cloud market share of the fourth quarter
of 2017 this will tell you once and for
all that AWS is the leader when it comes
to cloud computing Amazon web services
contributes 47% of the market share
others like Rackspace or Verizon cloud
contribute 36% Microsoft a contributes
10% the Google Cloud platform
contributes 4% and IBM software
contributes 3% 47% of the market share
is contributed by AWS you need me to
convince you anymore wait wait wait all
that is fine but we only started a few
years back and I've already grown so
much in such a less span of time haven't
you heard the latest news our revenue is
already a billion dollar per quarter
wait for a few more years and the world
shall see and AWS makes $5.3 billion per
quarter it's going to take a good long
time before you can even get close to us
yes yes we'll see now let's compare a
few things for starters let's compare
prices for AWS a computer instance of 2
CPUs and 8 GB ram costs approximately
$68 now a computer instance is a virtual
machine in which you can specify what
operating system Ram or storage you want
to have for cloud storage it costs 2.3
cents per GB per month with AWS you
really want to do that because gcp wins
this hands down let's take the same
compute instance of two CPUs with 8 GB
Ram it will cost approximately $50 per
month with gcp and as for my
calculations that's a 25% annual cost
reduction when compared to AWS talking
about cloud storage cost it is only 2
cents per GB per month with gcp what
else do you want me to say let's talk
about market share and options now AWS
is the current market leader when it
comes to cloud computing now as you
remember we contribute at least 47% of
the entire market share AWS also has at
least 100 services available at the
moment which is a clear indication of
how well AWS understands businesses and
helps them grow yeah that's true but you
should also know that gcp is steadily
growing we have over 60 services that
are up and running as you can see here
and a lot more to come it's only a
matter of time when we will have as many
services as you do many companies have
already started adopting gcp as a cloud
service provider now let's talk about
things you get for free with AWS you get
access to almost all the services for an
entire year with usage limits now these
limits include an hourly or by the
minute basis for example with Amazon ec2
you get 750 hours per month you also
have limits on the number of request to
services for example with AWS Lambda you
have 1 million requests per month now
after these limits are cross you get
charged standard rates with gcp you get
access to all Cloud platform products
like Firebase the Google Maps API and so
on you also get $300 in credit to spend
over a 12 Monon period on all the cloud
platform products and interestingly
after the free trial ends you won't be
charged unless you manually upgrade to a
paid account now there is also the
always free version for which you will
need an upgraded billing account here
you get to use a small instance for free
and 5gb of cloud storage any usage above
this always free usage limits will be
automatically built at standard rates
now let's talk about how you can
configure instances with AWS the largest
instance that's offered is of 128 CPUs
and 40 of ram now other than the on
demand method like I mentioned before
you can also use spot instances now
these are for situations where your
application is more fall tolerant and
can handle an interruption now you pay
for the spot price which is effective at
a particular hour now these spot prices
do fluctuate but are adjusted over a
period of time the largest instance
offered with Google cloud is 160 CPUs
and 3.75 TBS Ram like spot instances of
AWS Google Cloud offers shortlived
compute instances suitable for bad jobs
and fall tolerant workloads they are
called as preemptable instances so these
instances are available at 80% off on on
demand price hence theyve reduce your
compute engine cost significantly and
unlike AWS these come at a fixed price
Google Cloud platform is a lot more
flexible when it comes to instance
configuration you simply choose your CPU
and RAM combination of course you can
even create your own instance types this
way before we wrap it up let's compare
on some other things as well Telemetry
it's a process of automatically
collecting periodic measurements from
remote devices for example GPS gcp is
obviously better because they have super
ior Telemetry tools which help in
analyzing services and providing more
opportunities for improvement when it
comes to application support AWS is
obviously better since they have years
of experience under their Bel AWS
provides the best support that can be
given to the customers containers are
better with GCB a container is a virtual
process running in user space as
kubernetes was originally developed by
Google gcp has full native support for
the tool other cloud services are just
fine-tuning a way to provide cubitus as
a service also the containers help with
abstracting applications from their
environment they originally running the
applications can be deployed easily
regardless of their environment when it
comes to geographies AWS is better since
they have a head start of a few years
AWS in this span of time has been able
to cover a larger market share and
geographical locations now it's time for
the big decision so who's it going to be
yeah who is it going to be gcp or AWS I
think I'm going to go for choosing the
right cloud computing platform is the
decision that's made on the basis of the
user or the organization's requirement
on that note I believe it's time for us
to wrap this video up let's get started
but before that if you want to learn
more about cloud computing and Cloud
architecture to take your career to new
heights then you can check out our calch
postgraduate program in cloud computing
that will help you master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to become a cloud expert
now when we talk about Google Cloud
let's understand why Google Cloud
certification what is Google Cloud
certification which Cloud certification
is right for you different types of
Google Cloud certifications you have
certifications which are at associate
level or professional level and user
certification and some tips before
writing a Google Cloud certification
exam the first question which comes to
anyone's mind is why Google Cloud
certification so Google Cloud certified
users feel more confident working on
cloud computing after taking this Google
Cloud certification exam however I would
always emphasize on backing up your
certification with good knowledge so
that you stand a good chance in the
market where people are looking for
cloud computing professionals or
professionals who have good experience
and knowledge on ploud cloud platforms
now when you talk about professional
Cloud architect this certification and a
professional with this certification
ranks among the highest paid
Professionals of 2019 few few of the
Google Cloud certified users took one or
more responsibility or leadership roles
at work now when we talk about
certification that certifies that you
have gained knowledge on Google Cloud
platform services and usage of Google
Cloud platform for different use cases
and that basically creates your profile
as a stronger profile for a position
where cloud computing and and related
knowledge is required certification is a
commitment to a profession and makes you
stand out in the corporate world so what
is Google Cloud certification this is
obtained by passing one or more exams
specified by Google Cloud it is a
certificate of Google Cloud expertise
each certificate has a different area of
concentration now let's learn which
Google Cloud certification is right for
you there are various certifications
which are offered by Google Cloud so so
Google Cloud certification fall under
three categories you have associate or
beginner level certification now this
certification focuses on the fundamental
skills of Google Cloud it is good
starting point for someone who is new to
the cloud and can use it as path to a
professional level usually people who
start learning on cloud computing skills
would want to First certify themsel
using associate certification which
gives them fundamental knowledge and and
also for anyone assessing their profile
and understanding that this professional
has gone through an exam with certifies
and states the fundamental knowledge
equipment of any candidate when we talk
about professional certification this
certification focuses on technical job
functions and assesses many other
Advanced skills it is usually
recommended for someone who has industry
level exposure and familiarity of Google
Cloud platform so people who
successfully clear professional
certifications are the ones who have had
knowledge of Google Cloud its different
Services how different services are used
for different use cases plus they have
demonstrated their knowledge in clearing
this exam which professionally makes
them more capable to work on Google
Cloud platform when you talk about user
certification this is intended for an
individual with G Suite experience so
Google cloud or Google I would say
offers different services or
applications which can be used by users
worldwide for different use cases for
example you have Google Docs or you have
Gmail or you have Google Drive and so on
so this certification determines an
individual's ability to work with and
use the core collaboration tools now
when we talk about types of Google Cloud
certific ations we have various types or
categories here so you have associate
level now this is when a professional or
a person has recommended experience such
as 6 Plus months building on Google
cloud and here the certification is
called Cloud engineer you have
professional level certifications where
the recommended experience is 3 plus
years of working with Google Cloud that
can specifically be on Google cloud
services so here you have different
tracks such as Cloud architect Cloud
developer data engineer devops engineer
security engineer network engineer and
collaboration engineer and when it comes
to user certification this basically
needs an experience or completion of
apply digital skills training course and

hands-on experience working with gcp and
may work on networking or Cloud teams
with architects who design the
infrastructure so here you would be
leveraging the experience of
implementing virtual private clouds
hybrid connectivity Network Services and
security for established Network
architectures so this individual ensures
successful cloud implementations
using command line interface or gcp
platform or gcp console so the
professional Cloud network engineer exam
assesses your ability to design plan and
prototype a gcp network Implement a gcp
VPC configuring Network Services hybrid
interconnectivity and implementing
network security the cost of exam the
format of exam Remains the Same as other
professional certifications recommended
experiences also same and the language
in which this exam is offered is English
you also have collaboration engineer now
this is mainly the user certification
when you talk about so a professional
collaboration engineer transforms
business objectives into tangible
configurations policies security
practices as usually they relate to user
content and integration so these
Engineers leverage their understanding
of organizations routing identity
management secure communication and data
access so when you talk about different
tools which are offered by Google Cloud
platform this individual would be
operating with an engineering and
solutions mindset using different tools
programming languages and apis to

something like Cloud
academy.com you can browse and scan
through different articles here you have
platform related learning paths you have
training library on different topics
you have pricing options look at the
resources such as blogs webinars and so
on one more suggestion would be Google
Cloud related different courses are
available on corsera coursera.org and
then you can search for Google Cloud
specific exams or courses which you can
take here some of these are free and
some of these are paid so at least you
can take up the free exams and then
prepare yourself for different
certifications so what is AWS Amazon web
services or AWS is a comprehensive cloud
computing platform provided by Amazon
offering a wide area of OnDemand
services such as compute power storage
and databases along with Advanced
functionalities like machine learning
analytics and iot it helps businesses to
scale their applications efficiently it
reduces the it cost as it has pay as you
go model its Global Network of data
centers ensures High availability and
security
now what is a database and why is it
important so databases are systems that
store organize and manage lots of data
efficiently they have tables to hold the
data queries to find specific
information and indexes to speed up
searches databases also ensure that all
operations are completed correctly and
keep data secure now there are different
types of databases relational databases
use structured tables and SQL for
queries while no SQL databases handle
unstructured data and are easier to
scale Now using databases in cloud has
many benefits Cloud databases can easily
grow or Shrink based on your needs so
you can handle busy times without paying
for extra resources you don't need they
are also reliable because Cloud
providers manage backups and replicate
data in different locations which
minimizes downtime and data loss
additionally Cloud databases reduce
costs because you don't have to buy and
maintain your own hardware and software
they allow Global access so teams and
applications around the world can
quickly get the data they need now let's
discuss the various storage Services
provided by AWS and identify which AWS
databases use each type of storage so
AWS offers a variety of storage Services
tailored for different use cases first
we have Amazon S3 or simple storage
service which is an object stored
service that is highly scalable durable
and secure ideal for backups Big Data
analytics and content storage it's used
by databases like Amazon RDS Amazon
Dynamo DB and Amazon red shift for
backups and data storage next we have
Amazon EBS or elastic Block store which
provides block storage for E to
instances offering different volume
types for balancing cost and performance
now Amazon EBS is used by Amazon RDS and
Amazon Aurora for database
storage now next we have Amazon EFS
which is elastic file system now it
offers scalable file storage that can be
concurrently accessed by multiple ec2
instances suitable for applications
needing shared access like web serving
and content management next on the list
is Amazon FSX which provides fully
managed file systems optimized for

infrequently Access Data perfect for
compliance and archival
needs now finally we have the AWS snow
family including snow cone snowball and
snow mobile which facilitates secure and
efficient data transfer into and out of
AWS supporting the initial data loading
for various data bases so having known
the services offered by AWS now let's
move on to the different databases in
AWS and discuss each of them with their
use cases so first we have Amazon Dynamo
DB now Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully
managed no SQL database service offered
by AWS it is designed to handle large
amounts of data with high speed and low
latency making it perfect for
applications that need to store and

consistent performance it provides
single digigit millisecond response
times which is ideal for real-time
applications AWS handles all the
maintenance tasks like backups patches
and Hardware provisioning so you don't
have to worry about them so let's see a
use case imagine you are running a
mobile game with thousands of players
online simultaneously each player's game
progress scores and in-game purchases
need to be stored and retrieved quickly
to ensure a smooth gaming experience now
Dynamo DB can efficiently handle this
type of workload by providing quick
access to player data
even when there are sudden spikes in
game activity this ensures players have
a seamless and enjoyable experience
without delays or lag now next we have
Amazon Aurora Amazon Aurora is a high
performance fully managed relational
databas service offered by
AWS it's designed to be compatible with
mySQL and postgre SQL which are popular
database systems but it's much faster
and more reliable Aurora automatically
takes care of tasks like backup software
patching and scaling so you don't have
to worry about there let's see its use
case imagine you have an online store
that handles thousands of transactions
every day you need a database that can
quickly process orders manage inventory
and store customer information without
any slowdowns Amazon aora is perfect for
this because it can handle lots of read
and write operations very efficiently
ensuring a smooth shopping experience
for your customers plus aora can
automatically scale up to meet high
demand during sales or holidays and
scale down when traffic is lower helping
you save costs its high availability and
automatic backup features mean your data
is always safe and accessible even in
case of Hardware failures this makes
aora an excellent choice for running a
reliable and responsive e-commerce
website next on the list we have Amazon
auds now Amazon RDS or Amazon relational
database service is a cloud-based
service that makes it easy to set up
operate and scale a relational database
this means you can store and manage your
data in a structured way using popular
database engines like MySQL postre SQL
Oracle SQL server and Maria DB without
worrying about the underlying
infrastructure now imagine you run an
online store you need a database to keep
track of your products customers orders
and inventory using Amazon RDS you can
quickly create a database that handles
all these tasks RDS automatically takes
care of backups software updates and
scaling so you don't have to worry about
your database crashing during a big sale
or needing most space as your business
grows now next we have Amazon time
stream now Amazon time stream is a
cloud-based time series database service
offered by AWS designed to efficiently
store and analyze timestamp data now
timestamp data is information collected
at regular intervals like temperature
readings every minute or stock prices
every second so the key features include
performance it handles trillions of
events per day with fast query
capabilities now it automatically scales
up or down based on the volume of data
now you only pay for storage and queries
you use with automated data life cycle
management to reduce costs now imagine
you have a network of thousands of iot
sensors deployed across the city to
monitor air quality each sensor collects
data like temperature humidity and
pollution levels every few seconds now
Amazon time stream can efficiently store
this vast amount of timestamp data and
provide quick access for realtime
monitoring and historical analysis this
helps in analyzing Trends predict
pollution levels and make data driven
decisions to improve air quality next on
the list we have Amazon Neptune now
Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph
database service provided by AWS is
designed to work with highly connected
data making it ideal for applications
where relationships between data points
are as important as the data itself its
key features include graph models it
supports popular graph models like
property graph and rdf which is resource
description framework optimized for
quing large amounts of interconnected
data quickly it handles database
management tasks like backups patching
and scaling automatically now one common
use case for Amazon NEP is building
social networking applications so in a
social network users are connected to
each other in various ways friends
followers likes comments and groups now
Neptune can efficiently manage these
connections and quickly answer complex
queries like who are the mutual friends
of two users or what groups are my
friends part of so by using Neptune
social media platforms can provide a
fast responsive user experience even as
a number of users and connections grow
so next we have Amazon qldb now it
stands for Amazon Quantum Ledger
database which is a fully managed Ledger
database provided by AWS it is designed
to maintain a complete and unchangeable
history of all changes made to your data
over time uh think of it like a highly
secure and transparent digital log book
where every entry is recorded and can't
be altered so the key features are
immutable Ledger once data is entered it
cannot be changed or deleted it ensures
the Integrity of your data by allowing
you to verify that it hasn't been
tampered with now AWS handles all the
maintenance including scalability
backups and availability so one common
use case for qldb is in tracking
Financial transactions so imagine a bank
needs to maintain an accurate and tampo
proof record of all the transactions to
ensure transparency and compliance with
regulations so qldd can provide a
trustworthy and unchangeable log of
every transaction making it easy to
audit and verify the history of
financial activities now the last on the
list is Amazon RDS on VMware so it is a
service that allows you to run Amazon's
managed relational database service or
RTS in your own data centers using
VMware now VMware is a virtualization
and cloud computing software provider so
this means you can enjoy the benefits of
AAS like automated backups patching and
scaling without moving your data to the
AWS Cloud so it's perfect for businesses
that want to keep their data on premises
due to regulatory requirements low
latency needs or existing investments in
vmw infrastructure uh for example
imagine a hospital that needs to store
and manage large amounts of sensitive
patient data so due to strict privacy
regulations this data must remain on
site itself with Amazon RDS or VMware
the hospital can set up and manage
databases easily within their own data
centers they get the reliabil and
automation of AWS RDS while keeping
patient information secured and
compliant with local laws so this setup
ensures the hospitals data is always
back up secure and accessible without
the complexity of managing database
servers manually hey there future Cloud

description and pin comments below now
now let's start with the first question
what is cloud computing in simple terms
it's like Outsourcing your computer
needs to a remote Internet connected
service provider so you can explain in
this way cloud computing is a way of
delivering Computing Services like
servers storage databases and software
over the internet instead of keeping all
these resources on your personal
computer or local server you access them
remotely through the internet it's like
renting computing power and storage
space on a massive shared network which
offers benefits like scalability
flexibility and cost Effectiveness you
can also talk about different types of
cloud computing like private public
hybrid and multi now let's move on to
the next question what do you know about
Google Cloud platform here it's
important to demonstrate your
understanding of gcps key components and
its significant gcp or Google Cloud
platform is a collection of Cloud
Computing Services provided by Google it
offers a wide range of services
including Computing storage networking
databases machine learning and more all
hosted on Google's infrastructure gcp
allows businesses to build deploy and
scale applications and services in a
flexible and costeffective manner it is
widely used by organizations of all
sizes across various Industries for
hosting websites running applications
analyzing data and developing innovative
solutions Now list few benefit benefits
and drawbacks of gcp in this answer make
sure you provide a balance between the
benefits and drawbacks that you
mentioned here's how you can approach
some of the benefits are high storage
efficiency stability easy integration
confidential Computing security and
compute globally as per requirement the
drawbacks include complexity support
limitations data transfer costs and
Geographic restrictions now let's see
the next question what are the main
layers in Cloud Computing you can start
by naming the layers first and then
briefly describe them so the main layers
of cloud computing are infrastructure as
a service platform as a service and
software as a service so infrastructure
as a service this layer provides
virtualized Computing resources over the
Internet including virtual machines
storage and networking infrastructure
examples include AWS Microsoft Azure
Google compute engine Etc now platform
as a service offers a platform allowing
developers to build deploy and manage
applications without worrying about
underlying infrastructure it includes
tools and services like databases
development Frameworks and application
hosting environments the examples are
Google app engine adop Commerce Etc now
comes software as a service which
delivers software applications over the
internet on a subscription basis so
users access these applications through
a web browser without needing to install
or maintain any software locally
examples include email Services CRM
systems and productivity suits like
Google workspace or Microsoft 365 now
briefly explain the working of gcp when
asked to explain the working of gcp
briefly in an interview focus on its
core principles so gcp operates by
providing a range of Cloud Computing
Services over the Internet like storage
computing power networking Etc it
functions by hosting these services and
data centers worldwide and allowing you
users to access and manage them remotely
via an internet connection you can also
mention that gcps infrastructure is
designed for scalability reliability and
security enabling businesses to deploy
manage and scale applications and
services efficiently additionally gcp
offers various tools and resources for
developers data scientists and it
professionals to build deploy and manage
their application seamlessly the next
question is what are the services
offered by gcp as already mentioned in
some answers the services include
compute storage networking and databases
you can also highlight specialized
services like machine learning big data
analytics and iot Internet of Things
solution finally emphasize gcps unique
features such as its Global Network
infrastructure and advanced security
capabilities so let's move on to the
next question what is a bucket in cloud
storage so bucket and cloud storage
refers to a container or folder like
structure used to store data within a
cloud storage service such as Google
Cloud Storage think of it as a virtual
storage container where you can store
files objects or data buckets are
typically used to organize and manage
data within a cloud storage environment
they allow users to store and retri data
efficiently and they often come with
features for managing access permissions
versioning and life cycle policies
overall buckets play a fundamental role
in organizing and managing data within
Cloud stored system now let's see what's
the next question how can information in
Cloud be safeguarded so start by
highlighting encryption methods to
protect data both in transit and
addressed discuss robust Access Control
measures like identity and access
management I am to ensure only
authorized users can access sensitive
information mention regular security
Audits and complience checks to maintain
a secure environment emphasize the
importance of choosing reputable cloud
service providers with strong security
protocols in place finally you can
mention the significance of user
education and awareness to prevent data
breaches due to human errors now what do
you know about gke so explain that gke
stands for Google kubernets engine it is
a managed service by Google Cloud
platform for deploying managing and
scaling containerized applications using
kubernets talk about its benefits such
as automatic scaling seamless
integration with other gcp services and
simplified container orchestration while
also highlight your understanding of its
role in modeling Cloud native
application development and deployment
the next question they can ask is what
is the pricing model of gcp so in
answering the question about the pricing
model you can explain that gcp follows a
pay as you go model where users are
charged only for the resources they
consume additionally gcp offers various
pricing options including permanent
billing sustained use discounts and
committed use discounts allowing users
to optimize costs based on their usage
patterns and commitments it's important
to highlight gcp transparent pricing
structure and flexibility in
accommodating diverse business needs now
what is compute engine you can say that
compute engine is a core infrastructure
as a service offering within Google
Cloud platform it provides users with
virtual machine instances running on
Google's infrastructure allowing them to
deploy and manage scalable Computing
resources in the cloud so computer
engine offers flexibility reliability
and high performance for various
workloads ranging from small projects to
large scale applications Additionally
you can also mention its integration
with other gcp services and the ability
to customize instances based on specific
requirements so let's move on to the
next question what is the default bucket
location if we do not specify a location
constraint so when asked about the
default bucket location in Google Cloud
Storage if no location constraint is
specified you can respond by stating
that the default location is a United
States multi- region this means that if
you create a bucket without specifying a
location it'll be stored in a multi-
region location within the United States
ensuring redundancy and reliability
across multiple data centers in that
region now what libraries and tools are
provided by gcp when addressing this
question about libraries and tools you
can mention a variety of libraries and
tools available within Google Cloud
platform some notable libraries include
Google Cloud client libraries for
various programming languages such as
python Java and go which provide
convenient access to gcp Services
additionally there are specialized
libraries like TZ oflow for machine
learning tasks and Apache Beam for data
processing regarding tools emphasize
widely used ones like Google Cloud
Storage for scalable object storage big
query for analytics Cloud functions for
surveill computing and cubet engine for
container orchestration by highlighting
these libraries and tools we demonstrate
familiarity with gcps robust ecosystem
showcasing your Readiness to leverage
them effectively in your project or
tasks now what is a project in gcp and
how to create one so in Google Cloud
platform a project is a container for
resources such as virtual machines
storage buckets databases and more
allowing you to organize and manage your
cloud services effectively so to create
a program in gcp you typically start by
logging into the gcp console then
navigate to the I am and admin section
and select projects from there you can
click on create project provide a name
and optional description and configure
any necessary settings once created you
can begin provisioning and managing
resources within your gcp projects to
support your specific use case or
application now let's move on to the
next question which is what is Google
Cloud SDK you can say that Google Cloud
SDK is like a toolbox provided by Google
it helps developers manage and interact
with Google Cloud platform services
using commands in the computer's
terminal or command prompt it's handy
for task like deploying apps managing
resources and assessing cloud services
now what are objects in gcp so start by
explaining that objects in Google Cloud
platform typically refer to data
entities stored in cloud storage
services like Google Cloud Storage so
emphasize that these objects can be
anything from files to multimedia
content and they are stored with unique
identifiers within buckets which are
analogous to folders also highlight the
versatility of objects as they can be
accessed manipulated and shared across
various gcp Services facilitating
seamless data management and integration
within Cloud environments so what are
the various methods for authentication
of GCE API you can mention several
methods after which you can start
explaining each including service
account authentication so this involves
creating and using service accounts in
Google Cloud platform to authenticate
API requests so service accounts are
associated with projects and can be
granted specifically permissions 2.0
authentication 2.0 is a standard
protocol used for authorization GC API
supports 2.0 for authentication enabling
users to obtain access tokens and
authentication API requests the next one
is API key authentication Now API keys
are unique identifiers that developers
can generate to authenticate access to
GC API end points this method is often
used for accessing public data or
resources that don't require user
specific permissions identity aware
proxy authentication so Google Cloud's
identity aware proxy allows
administrators to control access to GC
API endpoints based on user identity and
context users authenticate through
Google identities and IAP verifies these
accesses before allowing API requests
moving on to the next question what is
load balancing so load balancing in gcp
invols distributing incoming Network
traffic across multiple servers to
ensure optimal resource utilization
minimize downtime and maximize
performance emphasize that gcb's load
balancing Services automatically adjust
to varing levels of traffic helping to
maintain stability and reliability for
application and services hosted on gcp
infrastructure you can also mention that
gcp offers various load balancing
options including https load balancing
TCP SSL proxy load balancing and network
load balancing each tailored to specific
use cases and requir
now coming to the next question what is
cloud Pub sub so Cloud Pub sub is a
fully managed messaging service offered
by Google Cloud platform you can
describe its functionality as a scalable
and reliable system for realtime message
inje and delivery between applications
and services highlight its key features
such as asynchronous communication
durable storage and support for even
driven architecture can emphasize its
role in enabling decoupled scalable and
resilient Cloud native appications
finally mention its benefits in terms of
flexibility scalability and ease of
integration with other gcp services now
coming to our last question what is
Google big query so Google big query is
a fully managed serverless data
warehouse solution provided by Google
Cloud platform it allows users to run
SQL like queries against large data sets
quickly and efficiently emphasize it
scalability real-time analytics
capabilities and seamless integration
with other Google cloud services and
there you are with top 20 gcp interview
