so the most desirable country for
international students that do not speak
English is Germany it is recognized for
its top universities that provide
students with affordable high quality
education
Germany is home to dozens of world-class
universities as well as Lively cities
brimming with art galleries and exciting
nightlife
German universities provide
internationally renowned courses in law
computer science medicine engineering
and social science
with all that things in mind let's
understand how to apply for German
universities
so to apply for German universities you
should start with a basic research on
universities
basic research on universities include
you can begin the University Research in
advance by making a list of topics you
are passionate about and look into
occupations or study areas that are
linked to those topics you can also get
in touch with former students from
German universities you're interested in
which may give you a better
understanding of the curriculum and
academic environment
then there will be certificates as per
universities so every university has a
different requirements which are
mentioned on the website but generally
it contains a certified copy of a
diploma or degree
translation of the course modules and
grades motivational letter Etc
now before coming you can check the daad
that is dead requirement as per country
so the journal academic exchange service
or daad dad is the largest financial
agency in the world supporting more than
1.5 million scholars in Germany and
abroad
using Dad's website you can check the
requirement for your country
now let's have a look at the study
requirements
so the study requirements include
University entrance qualifications
aptitude test required documents and
University requirements
now let's understand each one of them in
detail
so the university entrance qualification
first of all so a school leaving
certificate known as University entrance
qualification is needed
daad provides more than 100 types of
scholarships to International students
for information on the academic
requirement in your nation
and to check that you can visit the daad
website
so before you can enroll at your
University you can take a foundation
course known as student colleague so
student College in Germany is a
preparatory program
non-eu students particularly those from
developing nations without International
School diplomas must complete the
student colleague in Germany and pass
the exam in order to be eligible to
enroll in a bachelor's degree program at
a German University
now next is aptitude test
so an aptitude test known as test as
enables universities to compare the
academic aptitude of potential students
test as scores are mandatory for some
universities
it documents intellectual qualities that
are very necessary for a successful
course of study it does not require any
specialized knowledge it also does not
examine any characteristics of
Personality motivation or Hobbies
German universities can use the test as
a criteria for selection as a result
they are able to recognize individuals
who possess the essential intellectual
credentials for the field of study they
are applying for
now moving on to the next step which is
required documents so before applying to
the universities of the choice student
must have a certain documents in order
so these documents include that valid
photo ID application form then entrance
exam score educational documents
language proficiency test and resume
so these were some required documents
now let's understand University
requirements
so in Germany the majority of degree
programs are taught in German therefore
it is necessary for students to have
some basic German language skills so to
prove your German language skills you
can take up one of the following
entrance exams so first would be dsh
examination
is designed to evaluate your Reading
Writing listening and speaking skills
the test is totally focused according to
the classroom format and as a result the
circumstances you might encounter while
taking the course will be on the basis
of the questions
now the second one would be test daf
so the test daf is a language exam for
international German Learners who want
to study in Germany
the subjects are based on critical
communication challenges in lectures
discussions on working groups as well as
other Universities related activities
now the third one is goeth has
certificate C2 so this exam includes
modules for reading listening writing
and speaking the food modules can be
taken separately or together with four
different module certificates equal to a
single all-around certificate
now coming to the next step that is
learn the German language
both obtaining a student visa for
Germany and being accepted to the
University of your choice requires the
IELTS language proficiency test
so this test consists of speaking
writing and listening Comprehension
exercises
the entire test can be finished in about
three hours once all these steps are
done you can go ahead and apply for Visa
so let's have a look at applying for
Visa
so apply for student visa so visa
requirements for students in Germany are
varied depending on your home country
the length of stay and the purpose of
visit as well so you will not need a
visa to study in Germany if you are from
Norway or Switzerland so these two
countries and some more countries are
there which doesn't require any visa to
study in Germany
so similarly some other countries are
also there now there are two types of
Visas so first is a prospective student
visa so this Visa is intended for
students who have not yet received their
University admissions decisions and are
awaiting the outcomes of their final
application process
second is student visa the student visa
is intended for students who have
already been accepted to a school in
Germany this Visa is only valid for
three months during these three months
you must apply for your residence permit
at your City Foreign registration office
now coming to the last step that is
enrolling at University so there's a
document known as enrollment
confirmation document and its name is
mentioned on the screen you will need
this document in the future as it is a
crucial document the enrolling period is
frequently very brief a student ID will
be sent to you once you have registered
once you have received formal enrollment
status you are eligible to attend
University classes sit for test and get
a degree
