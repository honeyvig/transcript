Ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to add tick mark in
Excel now on my spreadsheet you can see
some employee data so they've been
assigned a task and they want to update
the task status as done and not done
using symbolic statements that is tick
mark and into mugs now how to do that it
is really simple we'll discuss two
different ways the first way is to do it
by conditional formatting so click a
cell on the guitar status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
role yes of course we can use the icon
settings but what we want to automate it
so click on the new root right so here
instead of two color scale select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Market have various types of
them you know the circular Tech Market
let's select the generic tick mark
without any outer circles and into here
generic X Mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than 0
it will be green and when the value is
less than or equal to 0 it will be X and
the reference value is 0 and here also
the reference value is zero everything
is okay click on OK and done
and here you cannot see the logos here
we need to add some formula here which
is equals to F click on Tab to select
the simple and if Cell address C2 is
equals to done
then the value should be 1 else the
value should be 0 close the bracket
enter
right now you can see this particular
logo here now drag the same formula it's
done now you can see we do have numbers
you can eliminate those numbers as well
just edit the rules
and here you can see show icon only
click OK and the numbers will be removed
also I did the second one and there you
go the numbers are gone and only the
symbols remain now what is the second
technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know going into
the options here go to file and here go
to options and here go to Advanced
customize weapon and in here on the
right hand side you will get developer
options click on the tick box and it
will be enabled now go into developer
options and click into insert menu click
on the form controls or active X
controls select the checkbox and now
just place it over here you know you can
edit this particular checkbox delete
everything drag it as checkbox as well
now you can drag the same cell across
all the functions and you will have the
check box as well now you can click on
it and say if it's done or not and with
