information check out the link mentioned
in the description box below so without
any further delay let's start this video
with the importance of projects in data
analytics
finding a suitable job in the field of
data analytics is becoming increasingly
difficult the ideal way to display your
skills is through a portfolio of data
analytics projects
a solid portfolio of projects will
illustrate that you can utilize those
analytical skills in your profile well
projects like sentiment analysis fraud
detection and many more are the best way
to improve your early analytics skills
you may have the knowledge but putting
it to use is what keeps you competitive
so in this video we'll divide the
project ideas into three different
categories which are data scripting
project ideas data visualization project
ideas and Advanced Data analysis project
ideas then we'll look at which project
you should work on to make your
portfolio of projects more attractive so
let's start with data scripting project
ideas in this category we'll focus on
extracting data from various online
sources
web scripting involves automating the
collection of data from websites and
apis we use programming languages like
Python and libraries like beautiful soup
and selenium to navigate web pages
extract relevant information and store
it for analysis
so the first project in our list is an
e-commerce product price tracker in this
project you will develop a web scripting
tool to extract real-time product price
data from multiple e-commerce websites
you will set up automated scripts to
periodically gather data track price
changes and identify discounts or
promotions
showcase your findings you will create
interactive line charts and bar graphs
using matplotlib this project will help
you understand web scripting data
collection and the basic data
visualization techniques the second
project we have is the job market
insights dive into the job market by
building a web scraper to extract job
postings from various job booths you
will analyze Trends in job titles
required salary and salary ranges
with this data you can identify emerging
job rules high demand Industries and
geographical areas with the most
opportunities
present your insights with c bond to
visualize the distribution of skills and
salaries across different job categories
the third project in our list is a real
estate listing analysis develop a data
scripting tool to collect real estate
listings details such as property prices
locations and features from multiple
Real Estate websites by analyzing this
data you can uncover Trends in property
prices based on location property size
and amenities create a coreoplast map
using plotly to visualize the median
property price ranges in different
neighborhoods offering valuable insights
to potential buyers and sellers the
fourth project we have is the weather
data aggregation gather historical
weather data from multiple sources
whether apis websites Etc and create a
comprehensive data set
clean and pre-process the data to
analyze climate Trends temperature
variations and rainfall patterns over
time
visualize this data using line charts
and Scatter Plots with matplotlip to
Showcase long-term climate changes and
seasonal trends
if you also aspire to be a part of this
Digital World consider enrolling in the
postgraduate program in data analytics
this program developed in collaboration
with IBM and in partnership with the
Purdue University offers master classes
and follows an applied learning model
that includes real life projects and
business case studies it's an
opportunity to elevate your career to
new heights ideal for working
professionals this data analytics
program requires no prior programming
knowledge it covers a wide range of
topics including data analysis data
visualization regression techniques and
supervised learning so hurry up and find
the course Link in the description box
for more details
the next category we have is the data
visualization project ideas
data visualization is the art of
presenting data visually to convey
insights effectively in this category
one works on projects that involve
creating graphs charts maps and
interactive dashboards to Showcase
patterns Trends and relationships in the
data so the first project of data
visualization and the fifth project for
the day is covid-19 dashboard
design and interactive dashboard using
plotly and dash to display covid-19 data
incorporate real-time data on infection
rate vaccination progress and Recovery
rates
utilize maps to display Regional
variations and Trends line charts for
time series data and bar charts to
compare statistics across countries
this project will enhance your data
visualization skills while providing a
valuable tool for tracking the
pandemic's impact
the next project we have is the customer
segmentation analysis analyze customer
data from a retail business to segment
customers based on purchasing Behavior
demographics or other relevant features
use clustering algorithms like k-means
and create your visualizations with
ggplot2 to highlight distinct customer
segments this project will help the
marketing team tailor their strategies
to different customer groups and
increase customer engagement the next
project we have is the social media
engagement analysis
get the social media data using apis for
example Twitter's Tweety to track
engagement matrices like likes shares
and comments analyze Trends in user
interaction identify Peak engagement
times and visualize the distribution of
Engagement across different platforms
present your findings using line charts
bar graphs and heat maps to provide
actionable insights for social media
strategy let's understand the last
category which is Advanced Data analysis
projects this category involves more
complex data analysis tasks that often
require machine learning and statistical
techniques you'll work with larger data
sets build predictive models perform
sentiment analysis and gain deeper
insights into the data
so the eighth project for the day is
sentiment analysis of social media data
collect social media posts related to a
specific topic and perform sentiment
analysis to Gorge public opinion
Implement NLP techniques using libraries
like nltk or text blob to classify post
as positive negative or neutral
visualize sentiment Trends over time
using W showcasing shifts in public
perception and identifying key moments
of sentiment change the ninth project
for the day is financial fraud detection
analyze financial transaction data to
detect patterns indicative of fraudulent
activity
pre-process the data extract relevant
features and apply machine learning
algorithms such as random forest or
gradient boosting to create a predictive
model
evaluate models performance using
confusion matrices Roc curves and
precision recall curves
visualize these evaluation matrices to
showcase the model's Effectiveness in
identifying fraud and the last project
for the day is Healthcare data analysis
analyze electronic health records EHR to
gain insights into patients demographics
diagnosis and treatment outcomes perform
statistical analysis to identify Trends
in disease prevalence effectiveness of
medical interventions and potential
Healthcare disparities across different
demographic groups
visualize these insights using plotly to
create interactive graphs that allows
Healthcare professionals to export the
data visually and with that we have come
