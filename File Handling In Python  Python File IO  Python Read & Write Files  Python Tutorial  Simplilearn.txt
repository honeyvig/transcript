hello and welcome to this session on
file handling in python today we are
going to discuss the concepts of how to
handle files in python though this
concept is not new and is
pretty common in languages like java and
c plus plus but we are going to see the
same taxes which are being used in file
handling in python now let's see what's
in it for us today
we will understand what is file handling
we will go through certain file handling
operations
then we will understand how to open a
file in python using various modes which
are pretty important
and then we will discuss the file
handling process
the different types of files which we
can create and advantages of using files
now what is file handling
a file contains a collection of data and
information it is just like a data
storage
so the data can be updated and shared
through files with multiple stakeholders
now file handling in python performs
functions such as creating reading
updating and deleting
so you can perform the basic crud
operations using the file handling
functions and operators
now in python file operation takes place
in the following order
in order to work on a file you have to
first open a file that is the first and
foremost step
and then you can perform any read or
write operation and then you have to
close the file
so these three primary
steps are involved in order to do any
operation on a file
now in python we can work with files
using the open function and it takes two
parameters
the file name and the mode
so here you can see the syntax
if you do not give the mode parameter
then it takes the default values which
we're gonna see in our next slide
but at least you need to give the name
of the file with the extension now what
are the various modes
in which you can perform operations on a
file let's go through them one by one
you can open a file first of all in the
read mode which is the default mode
and it opens a file for reading
but if the file does not exist it throws
an error
right
second is append a it opens a file for
appending creates the file if it does
not exist so in this mode if the file
does not exit exists it gets created
similarly in the write operation it
opens a file for writing and creates the
file if it does not exist so a and w
will create the file x
it creates specified file
returns an error if the file exists so
you cannot create an already existing
file you need to give a different name
then the next mode is the t mode the
text mode which is the default value so
so by default when you open a file in
python you are basically opening it in
default read text mode
and the next mode is the binary mode if
you specify b it means that you are
trying to open an image or any binary
mode related file
which cannot be opened in a text mode so
we will see certain examples of these
modes in our jupyter notebook when we
will run certain examples on a sample
file
now what is the file handling process
right
so in in a plain vanilla process first
of course you will create a file and
then you will open a file update and
close the file so the first thing which
you can do but in the from the function
standpoint like we saw in our previous
slide
even if you have to create a file you
have to call the uh function open then
you have to read it you write in it and
then you close it first thing which you
have to do in order to
interact with the file is always make a
call to the open function
and then
you pass the file name and the mode as a
parameter
now as we discussed there are two modes
there are two types of files in python
text file and binary file
so
in text file the data is stored in
characters and string and in binary file
this data is stored in the form of bytes
but the bytes file which you store you
can store in a different extension
and it can be read by other utilities or
tools or softwares which are meant for
reading the binary files but you can
interact or you can
perform certain functions using the
python operators and the open functions
which are available
text file
is a simple
uh
concept you open the file you can write
append update the data and you can open
the file in your operating system and
see your changes
so we are going to perform our examples
on a text file where we will show you
how you can view your changes by opening
a file real time now there are some
preliminary advantages basic advantages
of using files
your this data is stored
and is permanent basically it resides in
the file and then it is up to you how do
you save the data in the file in the
operating system or you purchase the
data
in some
secure area and that is up to you
and the stored data can be shared
definitely you can mail the data you can
share it in your hard drive you can
share a network drive etc and you can
update the data in the file so you can
append
you can override
you can remove you can delete the file
all those operations all those
possibilities are there
so now
let's
create our
jupiter notebook
with certain examples
so what i have done here is
i have already created certain sample
files
where i have some predefined context
there
so i have a
simplylearn.txt file in which i have
written today's thursday in one line
tomorrow is friday
and i am waiting for weekend
now i'm gonna
read this file
so i'll import the package
in order to read the file
i'll create the file object
now in this i have given the path where
my
file is reciting today.txt
the same content is there
and i am going to be opening it in the
read mode
so it's the default mode but i am
calling it out explicitly for a better
understanding
now
this is the read command
file dot read
this operator this will read the entire
file
so if you see in my file
all the contents are printed
now
if i want to read
the first seven characters
of my file
so what will this do it will read
the first seven characters
of the first line of my file
so in the first command
my file dot read printed all the
contents
but here i have passed a parameter to
the read function to print only the
first character seven characters
so that's what it has done
now
i will
ask
my function
to read
line by line
so now what is the difference between
this and this the difference is that the
file dot read
read the entire file in one go but here
it is allowing me to read only one line
at a time
okay
so this function of read line will only
go
and
read the
line
now
if i have to
read all lines one by one right
now
here i have printed one line now i want
to print all lines one by one
then there is a different
function
which is
file dot
read lines
and it will print an array
and of course you can see there's a
slash an operator because it's a
different line so it will print my diff
three different lines in an array
today's thursday tomorrow is friday and
i am waiting for weekend
now like i gave this example of
file.read seven characters
in the similar fashion
i can also provide how many characters
to read
from the line
correct so from the first line it has
given me the first three characters
and here
in the file dot read it was starting to
reading starting to read the entire file
but i only limited to the seven
characters
now let's take a look
at the
write function
write method
so now in my today.txt file i now pass
the mode w
and
i'll
override it
with my new content which is the sunday
and monday
and say file.close
and run it
now i can go
and check it's been overrated
now
i'm gonna create a new file
let me
create a new file and
add contents to that
i'll create separate
dot txt
and run
and a new file has got created with the
content sunshine
so here i have passed the mode as x
now
i want to delete a file
i will just simply pass
os dot remove
there is no open function to be called
and just give the name of the file
and
my today.txt file is gone
even i can put a check
before removing a file whether the file
exists or not
if it exists then remove
else
print
that the file does not exist
there is no file
now if i want to print line by line i'll
show you one another example
if i want to print line by line
then the example is
import
and
file daughter in the loop and
you print the output
so basically you can if you want to
print the lines in a loop
then you need to
put the for command for loop and put the
read lines call in the loop i hope you
guys had a great learning session and
i'll meet you in my next session thank
you
