through its Advanced capabilities and
user Centric design so before moving on
to how to install DEA here is a quick
info for you if you want to switch
careers with AI anml then try giving
simply Lars postgraduate program in Ai
and machine learning from PD University
in collaboration with IBM this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP computer
vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat GPT and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box and
pin comments so let's get started so as
you can see this is a GitHub page so if
you will go below so these are the table
of contents you can see about key
features system architecture of DEA
quick start how to install so getting
started so here you can see DEA is an
advanced AI software engineer that can
understand high level human instruction
P down okay so these are some demos
pre-recorded by uh the team of DEA right
so as you can see here so it's
pre-recorded see if you have to give
just prompt and it will create the
particular uh UI for you okay or you can
say game whatever you want to build see
how see these are some pre-recorded
demos by the DEA team okay or you can
say stan. AI so these are some key
features of DEA as we discussed already
and system architecture you can see user
interface agent core user interface is a
web based okay chat interface for
interacting with DEA you have to give
some apis so later we will discuss about
that so these are some prequest of to
install DEA okay you have UV python
package manager then bun you have to
JavaScript runtime bun you have to
install then AMA you have to install all
okay if you like don't here it is
written if you don't want to use the
local models then you can skip this step
but if you want to install DEA locally
you have to install this AMA okay a like
simple you can go here and you can
download AMA see Mac OS Linux windows
it's already there you can download it
and install it I have already installed
in my system right so let's start with
the installation okay see here it's
already written DEA requires the
following things as dependencies first
is AMA and second is bun bun bun is the
same process you can go just you can
choose your system MOS Linux or Windows
and then you can copy it and then you
can pay into paste it into your power
shell or command Pro anything right so
now let's start so here we first we have
to clone the DEA repository
right you can clone it from here okay
download it from here or you can just
directly copy
this copy this
code and paste it to your command
PR okay see I have already installed so
it is saying fatal error destination paa
already exist
and it is not an empty directory got it
so what I have to do I have to
change
DEA okay I will change
the ttop
ttop okay now I will paste it see now
it's cloning into DEA
okay so so cloning is done as you can
see done no error is G so now CD DEA
okay CD
DEA okay now we are into DEA
folder okay so if you want to see I will
show
youa as you can see so these are the
repository we got after cloning DEA okay
so now what we have to do create a
virtual environment and install the
required dep denes then UV V andv we
have to
copy and paste
it okay it's
running yeah it's done activated and
then UV pip install our requirement. dxt
or we have to write okay let's copy
first and paste it
here see we are installing the r
requirements uh dependencies
okay
so I will share you this particular Link
giab Link in the description box below
you can take it from there okay so now
yeah it's
done okay so what was that
uh yeah
requirements if we will check
requirements
here where are the requirements
architecture see requirements you can
see see we got all the
requirements okay so what what is the
next oh okay this is already done so
okay play right install D with depths
okay installs Browser in Play right and
there are depths dependen is in if
required okay I will copy it I will
paste it so these are some simple steps
you can
use a VI installing DEA okay so we are
done with this so now the major part set
up necessary API keys and
configuration so now let's see what are
these first okay so you have to set some
storage for the DEA right some API keys
so these will be your personal API Keys
okay so I have done it already I will
show you so there is one file config TL
so this is
how uh you have to set your API Keys
here I have set the open AI API key
right you can use Bing Bing Google any
whatever you want okay as you can see
you can use gini API key Mel Gru netlify
CLA Google search engine ID Google
search Bing you can use any but I use
this open ai1 okay why this is blur
because I can share API Keys you with
you guys okay so this is how you can set
your API key okay into your this config
dotl file
right so after that there is one step
called python
D.P so what I will do I will write here
so I open this DEA folder into this VSS
code so I will write here
python da
py okay I will run
it so it is initializing
DEA
right so it will take time some time it
will take so after that what you can do
you can just simply CD UI then burn
install then burn run there right after
that you can access the DEA web
interface by opening into browser this
is the local the G
after running your API you can simply
write in the web sttp 127.0.0.1
right this is the local IP they gave so
after that it will the DEA will run okay
