hi everyone this is dr. Missouri
windiest conquer today I am going to
discuss few important granulomatous
bacterial infections that means these
infections are associated with the
granuloma formation they are like
tuberculosis syphilis leprosy
actinomycosis so before going into the
bacterial infections usually human fetus
is sterile
but at colonization occurs at birth and
within hours the oral cavity is
accommodated with both alpha non
hemolytic streptococcus so in when East
are also present in the birth and when
you see in the two months of the age the
our oral cavities associated with Viana
FPL and if you see at the six months of
the age that oral cavity the predominant
species are fuse of Actium and
non-pigmented Prevotella species if you
go into 12 months the oral cavity is
predominant with cap no site of failure
species first going into the
tuberculosis this tuberculosis is mainly
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
these are the other species which are
responsible for the tubercle
tuberculosis formation mode of
transmission includes whether it may be
of inhalation or ingestion inoculation
or a transplanted root there are two
types of tuberculosis that is primary
tuberculosis and secondary tuberculosis
if if you go into the primary
tuberculosis this occurs in the patient
who has not not being previously
infected or immunized and you have to
remember one important thing about this
primary - booktuber closes formation of
gold's complex that is goals complex is
associated with the primary tuberculosis
and this bones complex will have a
pulmonary component and a lymphatic
vessel component so this is the gowns
focus which is with primary tuberculosis
and the fate of primary tuberculosis
maybe a fibrosis or a calcification or a
it made
change into a progressive form or it may
end up with Amelia reform that means
including or associating with many organ
service multi-organ involvement so it
may end up with a calcification or a
fibrosis even reactive lesions can be
found like miliary tuberculosis which
including the lungs liver and all the
multi-organ involvement can be seen if
you go into the secondary tuberculosis
here the individual is previously
infected or is sensitized and here the
secondary tuberculosis we can see in the
organs like tank lungs tonsils firings
and small intestine and here the
infection may be of endogenous or
exogenous source and even this fate of
secondary to you by closest maybe a
fibrosis or a calcification on it may
lead into a progress you pulmonary
tuberculosis and finally it means up
with the miliary tuberculosis with multi
system or a multi organ involvement what
are the clinical features of pulmonary
tuberculosis this pulmonary tuberculosis
is associated with prodromal symptoms
like fever Vatican Palace and the
important the point here is the patient
may have in night sweats and along with
that cough and that cough is with a
black color or a blood street's put'em
and even the in these patients they
complains of a chest pain and because of
pulmonary involvement you can see a
track yawn deviation and you can hear
the bronchial breath sounds which are
very dull and extra pulmonary
tuberculosis is nothing but these occurs
in other systems other than the
pulmonary system and the involvement of
cervical and hilar nodes is called as
rocks Rufina scrofula is nothing but a
glandular swelling in front it means a
female with full neck and if you bones
and joints are involved it is called a
supports disease and if the skin is
involved it is Policy lupus vulgaris
this is the important points with
examination so we're coming into the
oral manifestations if in primary
tuberculosis we can see
the most commonly involved thing is
gingiva whereas in secondary
tuberculosis the most commonly involved
is tonguing palate and these oral
manifestations we can see as a ulcer
form or a modular form or a granulomas
form that is granulomas nothing but a I
mean excessive growth or a Clarke type
of tissues so if it occurs on the tongue
the most common sight is the lateral
border you can see in the picture and
other things that ulcer may be of it
having undermined else which is an
important point to note down right you
can see here small granulomas or
ulcerations in the palate or a floor of
the mouth even the lips can show a
granulating ulcers and even it can
involve the bone in bone which may lead
to the formation of cuba color
osteomyelitis and even it can involve
the major salivary glands like parotid
gland followed by the submandibular
gland and these are the investigations
for the tuberculosis that this
examination of sputum and here the OPG
is important because in chronic cases we
can see a soft tissue calcification or a
soft tissue calcification of lymph nodes
they are nothing but a dystrophy
calcification even in the chest a gravy
chest x-ray we can see the
calcifications and these are the other
tests diagnostic tests like FNAC PCR
elisa these are the other investigations
for the tuberculosis going into the
treatment there are two line of trucks
that is first line and second line and
these are the drugs which are used as a
first line or a first choice a mostly
used I guess reform thing whereas the
second line of these are the second line
of drugs which are used in the treatment
of tuberculosis and in the hueber
Colossus we will use the multi drug
regime and that is for a new cases or
cases which again becomes mere positive
and if you see a relapses or a failure
in the treatment so these are the
combination of the drugs used for the
new cases these are the combination of
the drugs used for the cases which have
smear positive and and these are the
drugs used for the relapses treatment
failure and here
you can note the shortcuts of this drugs
which is a cheese isoniazid RS refampin
e S is for streptomycin easy thumb butyl
is a dis Pyrus in amide and T's Thea as
it is own so ii going into the second
granulomatous infection that is leprosy
it is also called as a Hansen's disease
it was given by Hansen and the causative
organism is the Mycobacterium leprae
mode of transmission may be whether a
diet's contact or a maternal fetal
transmission or even transmission from
milk often leprosy patient if we go into
the classification there are two types
one is lepromatous type and cubicle R
type and but now current classification
we are using Posse bacillary and multi
bacillary and these are the Ridley and
shoppings classification there are seven
types in this tubercle ID polar has a
high resistance whereas lepromatous
polar has a low resistance these are the
difference between lepromatous leprosy
and the tuberculoid leprosy whereas you
can see a symmetrical lesions in the
tuberculoid leprosy there is no clear
zone in the tuberculoid leprosy and bass
line the lepromatous leprosy or
e-cigarettes in a pack whereas you when
you compare with the see tubercle I'd
refer to see it is a granular array
beaded forms and again in lepre mean
test is positive for tuberculosis II
where it is negative for the lepre me
leopard mattis leprosy and the reactions
which you can see in the leprosy are of
two types that is borderline reactions
and erythema nodosum type of reactions
and the current classification of
passive are slurry and multi Becerra
type inferencing as Larry it is nothing
but the entire it resembles the
tuberculin pattern of leprosy and here
oral lesions are very rare
then multi pass Larry leprosy here you
can see few oral lesions and you can see
the
multiple macular or a growths or a
papules type of structures on the skin
and the faces which are seen in this
multi basilar leprosy or leonine faces
and hair including
eyebrows and eyelashes often is lost in
multi Valarie leprosy this coming to the
oral manifestations usually only 19 to
60 percent of the cases will have only
manifestations and in their oral
manifestations the most Limon sight is
hard palate along with this other site
can also be in other side also you can
see the manifestations and this affected
soft issues will appear lo2 red and even
in few cases there is a complete loss of
EULA and there is really fixation of
soft palate and this is an important
point
microglia it is nothing but infection of
the lip which leads to Mac vigilia and
faces leprosy if we will see that a
trophy of the anterior nasal spine along
with the a trophy of anterior minds in
the annular Ridge and endonasal
inflammatory changes all these things
will convert into face she slept without
any coming into the dental
manifestations you will see the enamel
hypoplasia of the teeth with short
tapering roots and even the powerful
infections and internal resorption and
necrosis are also common in with this
leprosy coming to the treatment the most
commonly used drugs are rifampin and
Dobson
but in multi battle bacillary will use
clover Zeeman along with this rifampin
and dab zone if these patients are
allergic to refampin we will use clover
semen and minocycline
and this thalidomide is important
because it is used in the management of
complication of leprosy therapies then
the third infection is of syphilis it is
also called as in Lewis what is the
causative organism it is Treponema
pallidum the mores of transmission may
be through a sexual contact or from
mother to fetus or glide transfusion
accidental inoculation or puncture with
contaminated instruments these are the
mores of transmission of syphilis
if you go into the history thief
syphilis has different names in French
it is termed as Napolitan each whereas
in Russians call it as a Polish disease
in Italian it is Modbus Calais and in
real fennel he discovered or coined the
term Lewis in the 16th century
classification is of two types acquired
and continental that is basic
classification whereas aquarius of again
three to four types that is primary
secondary where you'll see a latency
period then it turns into a tertiary
infection and the last basic thing is
congenital syphilis primary syphilis the
most important characteristic feature is
of canker for the primary syphilis and
this KanCare occurs two to four weeks
after exposure to the infection this
canker is nothing but a initial it is a
painless party that it undergoes a
ulceration and develops into a canker
and this because of this ulceration you
will see a regional lymphadenitis
secondary syphilis the characteristic
manifestations of secondary syphilis are
mucus patches you can see here in the
picture
mucus patches or a mucocutaneous lesions
and one more thing is the candle oma
later this mucus patches make me you can
see and mouth fairies and even as a
vagina and even a like it's under eyes
skin eruptions
where is condyloma later this is
condyloma later it is nothing but it
looks like a viral papillomas it mostly
occurs in the dorsum of the tongue and
even this prodromal symptoms are
associated or followed by the necrotic
oscillations which cue the terms Luis
Molina
so mucus patches condyloma later and
Luis malignus associated with the
secondary syphilis
going into tertiary syphilis
here the Lathan actually the patient
after the secondary syphilis will go
into a latent syphilis or a latency
phase and this latency phase is remind
for a one to thirty years then from
latency period this patient will
this patient will go into the tertiary
syphilis so in the tertiary syphilis the
entire multi organ system is involved
and if you go into the baske it involves
a vascular system or a central nervous
system and the important oral
manifestation is gamma it is nothing but
it causes the perforation of the palate
and other manifestations are industrial
glossitis and lowest class sizes cutting
nothing but syphilis involving the
tongue is called a Zulu etic velocity
source vertex traceability it is gamma
in the seashell glossitis and you etic
glossitis congenital syphilis here you
can see the important manifestation is
hutchinson triad it is nothing but a
Hutchinson's teeth ocular in disguise in
the seashell keratitis i8 now deafness
this is important for the exam and
Hutchinson's teeth are in that
screwdriver shaped in sizes and mulberry
molas these are these are the hats
insults teeth this all are the diagnosis
which we can do further examine which we
can may be patient is have it ended
stick to punch link or other alternative
drugs are these are the other
alternative to expected drug of choice
is punched a pendulum then the fourth
one is acting on my mices infection that
is acronym is the causative factor or
equality is of actual versus here the
important form of this acronym is
paralyzed rotation at you know my little
and
former man you can see the oral
manifestations when it has been deck
manifestations and here the organism
enters through the mucous membrane right
it strikes into the foundation soft
tissues or to salivary glands where you
can involve the voice and causes
flooding and in today's market fish and
even this serving may develop into one
or more acid the important
characteristic feature of this is
liberating past sometimes harmful
granules which is associated with acting
oh my my process and you have to
remember
actinomycosis is not a fungal infection
it is a bacterial infection and a
granulomatous infection so here you can
see the first generator with the sulfur
canyons and here with the high doses of
antibiotics that is mostly will use
pencil in with a metal a visual
combination and there should be the
under abscess drainage and excision of
the sinus tract so I hope it's these you
have learned these things and these are
the very important things and you have
to remember all the discussed things are
bacterial infections which are
associated with granuloma formation and
hence they are called as granulomatous
infections and those are very very
important for the me
