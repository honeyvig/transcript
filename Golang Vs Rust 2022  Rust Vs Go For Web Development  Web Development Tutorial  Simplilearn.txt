hello everyone
welcome to this video tutorial on golang
vs rest by simply learn
in this session you will go through a
brief introduction to both languages
colang and trust
both languages provide high performance
and efficient hardware capacity making
them considerable for various projects
by the developers
after knowing the basics you will learn
about the differences between them
and further you will learn about the
cones of golang and trust
so hey everyone i am abhisaruja from
simplylearn and welcome to this video on
golang vs rust but before we begin if

let's start with the introduction to
golank
golenk
it's an open source statically typed
compiled language developed by google it
has a stronger focus on building web
apis and small services that can scale
endlessly
it was designed by robert christmer rob
pike and ken thompson to reduce the
complexity of managing the
infrastructure and code bases within
google
it comes with go routines
strong security and some standard
libraries
which we'll discuss further now we will
get introduced to rust
rust is a multi-paradigm general purpose
and a high level programming language
works well for processing large amounts
of data and other cpu intensive
operations such as executing algorithms
credon hori along with dave herman
brendan h and others introduced the
language at mozilla research
it
got its 1.0 version on may 15 2015.
rusty is focused on safety stability
performance and safe concurrency
now you will drive to compare them
starting with performance
go and rust are both compile languages
and they directly translate the code to
executable machine code
both machines produce efficient code
many big menses use rust to boost speed
whereas co is famous for reducing the
number of responsible servers to almost
a tenth of the original capacity
rust has the upper hand in delivering
output over go due to its great runtime
speed but it lacks at compilation time
on the other hand go is better in
compilation time but lacks at run time
speed
let's do a comparison of the two from
concurrency perspective
go was designed to use cpus efficiently
and handle multiple tasks simultaneously
the purpose was accomplished with the
introduction of go routines these are
lightweight call fewer resources and are
executed independently
they run concurrently with other
functions and have eliminated the need
to create new threads
on the other hand dust was recently
introduced with the native syntax in the
form of async await and guarantees
memory stability
developers prefer to work with go in the
case of concurrency now we will move
ahead and compare the two on memory
management and security
go and rust practice safe access and
memory management with different
approaches making them the choice for
cloud computing go offers various
paradigms such as memory allocation and
automatic garbage collection to handle
possible threats
go gets automated during the run time
and makes developers do not bother to
assign or remove the memory
on the other hand rest ensures no memory
leakage during the compile time moreover
the code won't be compiled until its
memory safe which requires developers to
be attentive and be aware of memory
allocation
let's see the easiness to code and learn
these languages
rest comes with a much steeper learning
curve than go why go is relatively
easier than rust
it has a steeper learning curve than
other languages
like javascript and python go was
designed with a relatively simpler
syntax than rust and was adopted as an
easier alternative to c
on the other hand people find trust
a little hard with syntax as the
language is new and passing pointers
make the codes more complex now it's
time to get to the next point of
comparison
that is development speed
development speed is far more crucial
than performance that is how quest it is
to write software with the language than
to run it
go with its simplicity set some
benchmarks by quicker build speed than a
range of languages in the market
but it has to sacrifice its runtime
performance for it
on the other hand
rust memory safety feature compromises
compilation time and its features take
time to understand
making the developer compensate with
both compilation and development time
now we will move to scalability
both programming languages are used to
develop large scale applications with
their ability to handle multiple
concurrent functions
go is designed for large software
development involving large code bases
and teams
handling enormous amounts of data in
real time it's a great solution for
dynamic organizations where scale and
speed define the development workflow
on the other hand rest has a stronger
inclination toward applications
that favor speed such as game
development web browser components or
real-time control systems
now we'll see companies hiring for golem
and rest
first we'll start with golem
first is american express the american
express company is an american
multinational corporation
primarily known for its credit cards and
payment processing
their payments and rewards platform team
adopted go in 2016.
they focused mainly on microservices
transaction routing and load balancing
use cases and they needed to modernize
their architecture they also published a
case study
american express uses go for payments
and rewards
next is paypal
paypal holdings incorporation is an
american multinational financial
technology company majorly dominant in
operating online payments
their senior director of engineering
developer experience at paypal
bala netrogen said that go provides
channels and routines to deal with
complexity
they were able to structure the code to
meet our requirements
go is a first class language at paypal
and there are currently over 100 go
developers at paper
uber
uber technology's incorporation is
american mobility as a service provider
uber has now preferred go for building
many of uber engineering new services
formerly they were mainly based on
node.js and python
golang helps uber to handle a majority
of high queries per second services at
uber
recently they have written geo-based
services in golang
next is alibaba
alibaba group holding limited
it also known as alibaba is a chinese
multinational technology company
specializing in e-commerce retail
internet and technology
alibaba group container engine
pouch container has written in calling
it can pack deliver and run any
application
it helped all online transactions of
alibaba's smoothly on millions of
containers
now we'll see some companies that are
using rust and they hire developers for
rest
first is dropbox it is a file hosting
service operated by an american company
that uses rust for parts of its file
synchronization engine since the engine
is highly concurrent they choose rust
over any other language
cloudflare incorporation it's an
american web infrastructure and website
security company
that uses just as a core language and
replace c
with rust for its memory and safety
feature
figma it's a collaborative web-based
design
tool for vector graphics and interface
prototyping
due to the rapid growth they chose rust
to rewrite their multiplayer
synchronization engine
trust has helped them drop off the load
from their servers
discord is an instant messaging and
digital distribution platform
users communicate with voice calls video
calls text messaging media and files in
private chats or as part of communities
called servers
discord uses rest in multiple places of
the code base
both on the client and server side
now we will move to learn some cons of
calling
first there is a lack of manual memory
management in goal line
and sometimes it becomes difficult to
handle errors
while using golang
and there are few libraries and
frameworks
there are no major frameworks for golang
developers other languages such as ruby
they have ruby on rails python have
django and php has larval
now we'll move to learn some cones of
trust
learning rest is not easy when compared
to other languages that's why it has a
higher learning curve
low level of monkey patching support
then python and bird here monkey
patching refers to modifying a class or
module at a rental
the next one is the compiler is slow as
compared to some scripting languages
with that we have come to the end of
