Welcome to our exciting Journey where we
transform Chad jpd a powerful text based
AI into a voice activated assistant that
can revolutionize the way we interact
with technology imagine turning the
sophisticated capabilities of chat GPT
into your personal assistant accessible
with just your voice today we will
explore how to make that a reality from
simple commands to complex conversations
see how voice activation can bring a new
dimension to this advanced
we'll start with the basics of
integrating voice recognition features
with chity discussing both the tools and
Technologies you will need then we'll
guide you through the setup process
showing you step by step how to build
your own voice activated system follow
along as we dive deep into customizing
responses defining voice recognition
accuracy and enhancing user interactions
to create a seamless and intuitive user
experience and by the end of this
tutorial you will not only understand
the technical framework but also the

let's get started so let's get started
guys so this is our chat jpt and we want
to make it as an AI assist
so what we'll do is we will use a Chrome
extension that is talk to chat GPD
extension moving onto that we will
install that extension into the same
browser where your chat gbt has been
loged and it's applicable for the 3.5
version of chat GPT and the GPT 4 also
like if you have the free version of GPT
you could also integrate talk to chat G
extension into it so as it has been
installed
we'll refresh the chat gbt and you could
see that here's a dialog box appeared
with the name talk to chat gbt and after
clicking on start you could see there
are options mic volume and this option
is you could skip the message that has
been currently being read by the board
and these are the settings if you unmute
this and talk to chat GPT or give any
prompt it will listen to it and run the
prompt and before that we'll move to to
the settings and here you could see that
we have ai voice and language and in
this you could choose any one of them
and these are freely available you could
use any of them and there are no limit
credits for this so let's have a demo
for this so we'll unmute and we'll ask
Chad jpt to list the difference between
list and tles in Python
so you could see that the chat jpt has
taken our prompt and started generating
the
response so I'll stop this prompt and
moving back to settings first we'll
unmute this as chat jpt will take the
prompt
uh moving back to the settings you could
see here that there are various free AI
voice languages that you can choose from
else we have another option that is even
labs and this is one of the prominent AI
speakers in the market today so we will
get the EM La API key and paste it here
and we'll get some credits that would be
according to the characters and we'll
use them and show you guys how we can
use it and there a voice control system
here if you say the stop word The Prompt
will automatically stop or the response
that would be generating by the chat GPD
that will get halted and this pause word
also if you speak the PA word uh with
the mic unmuted it will catch the POS
word and it will pose The Prompt there
only so we'll save this and we'll search
for even Labs API key so moving to even
Labs first you have to do is sign up and
create a profile here and after that
move to the profile section and here you
would see the API key copy that and get
back to your chat
jpt and in the settings of talk to GPT
extension you have enabled the even Labs
API key and here I will paste it and
I'll make it blur so you guys won't be
able to access it so we have pasted the
API key here and you could choose from
the email lamps voice that would be only
in English or multilanguage and here are
the voice assistants that are available
so we will choose Antony here and save
it so as you unmute this option you
could ask the prompt with the chat jpt
and he will answer and provide the
solution to you so let's try out once so
let's see the output we will ask Chad
jpt what is the difference between list
and doues in Python
you could see that J has it looks like
might have a typo or misunderstanding in
the original question regarding doubles
in Python if you meant tupal instead I
already provided a comparison between
lists and tupal however if you meant
doubles as in a data type for storing
decimal or floating Point numbers the
term double isn't specifically used in
Python like it is in some other
programming languages e G who see your
Java in Python floating Point numbers
are typically referred to just as floats
and they are used to represent both
single and double Precision numbers
depending on the platform Python's float
type typically as you can see that the
chat JT has provided us the response and
it is acting as an AI voice assistant
and here are the voice that you can
choose from and I have one of them that
of Alex and Paul similarly you could
choose any one of them and we have some
of the free credits that you can use
let's move to the subscription plans and
we have 10,000 characters per month free
with the initial plan and if you want to
upgrade the plan here are the
subscriptions and with that guys we have
made chj as an AI voice assistant and if
