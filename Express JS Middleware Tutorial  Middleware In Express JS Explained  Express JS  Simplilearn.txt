hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simplyland this is anubhav and
in this video we will be learning about
express.js middleware but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
channel already make sure to hit the
subscribe button and press the bell icon
so you'll never miss any update from
simplyla
so without further ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you
first we'll see what is middleware after
that
we'll see the functions of middleware
and then we will be creating middleware
in express.js
so let's begin
what is middleware middleware is a
request handler that has access to the
application's request response cycle it
is a function that contains the request
objects response object and the next
middleware function
middleware can also send the response to
the server before the request
the next middleware function is commonly
donated by the variable named next
simply middleware is a function that can
only be applied using routers with the
help of middleware we can access and
modify request and response
now we will see what are the functions
of middleware
middleware can execute any code
it can make changes to the request
response objects
middleware can also end the request
response cycle
it can call the next middleware function
in the stack
we use these functions to modify our
middleware to perform many tasks
like if you want to block our site from
some country or if you want to check the
authentication of a user etc choose from

now we are going to create a simple
middleware
we can create a middleware in a router
file but the best way is to create a
middleware file separately and then use
it
creating and using middleware is very
easy
now we first need to create a basic
express application
but before that
you must have
all the app packages to run
express
you can take the help of our video what
is js the link will be in the
description
you need to install npm express to run
this so coming back to our application
first we need
const
express application
so we'll write constant
express
required
express
now
we'll write constant
app
equals to
express
function
now
to get the data we'll write
dot
get
request
just once
response
function
write response send
welcome to
simpler
i will copy paste this
to get the
home page
the better way is to like
copy paste it
here
here we'll write the extension of the
next page
home will say
and welcome to this lens
this is a very basic middleware
application we are going to create
this
home page
now we'll make it listen to some port so
we'll write
our
dot listen
that arrow function
console
log
write listening
this message will be prompting to us on
the console the terminal
so we'll close this brackets
now
we'll save this file
open your terminal
first we need to go to this folder cd
express
by
run
enter
now we'll write
file name
enter
so it's showing
listening to port 4000 now we'll open
our chrome
local server
type local host 4000 enter
so it is successfully showing us welcome
to simply learn now we'll go to the next
page
we have written their
home
enter
so it's successfully showing
welcome to simply learns home page
now
we'll create a middleware go back to
that
file
we'll write
stent
required filter
request
you can write anything here request
object
spawn subject
and next
the fad arrow function
we'll write
console.log
here
we have right and request
this
request
filter
and save this file
now
we haven't
called our next parameter
in express framework next is a function
what we'll do is we'll call it in the
bottom of our middleware
we'll write
next
option
save this file
again we'll open a new terminal
where we'll go to the card folder
express
by simply done
write
there it is printing welcome to simply
learn will go to the home page
welcome to simply learns homepage with
this we have successfully reached the
