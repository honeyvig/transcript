hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about combined operation in excel
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started so for example uh let us imagine
that you wanted to create one single
cell for all the employees in your
company which stores the
first name second name or last name
including the email ids at one place
right if you want to do so like let us
let us let me show you how it looks like
so let me copy this here
then that's the first name
now it's your second name
along with the email id
now let us imagine that you wanted to
store all the employees in the same way
right so you can do this by using
combine operation in excel now all it
takes is just a simple formula that is
equals to and the first cell address
that is a2
and
you can use an ampersand sign
now you can use the next cell reference
set as b2
and then
colon and the last cell address that is
a2
now press enter
so when you press enter or tab you will
get this particular answer but this data
is completely
in a state where you can't understand it
right the first name last name and the
email id has got
combined all together so you want to use
some spaces right so all you need to do
is just make a little modification to
this particular existing data so you can
press another ampersand and include
spaces
and then you can separate the email id
and the name with some colon
so now we have separated the first two
cells that is the first name of the last
name with the space using the ampersands
and then again we have used an ampersand
to include the colon and see that we
have also included a space between the
colon marks that it gets separated
cleanly
and now let's try to press tab and see
the result
so there you go the first name and the
second name is separated by space and
the email id and the complete name is
separated by a colon now you can use
this to all the cells
and there you go
all the first name last name and the
email ids have been printed here so
that's how you use the combine operation
in excel i hope this session was
