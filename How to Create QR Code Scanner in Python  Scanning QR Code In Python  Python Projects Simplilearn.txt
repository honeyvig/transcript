hi everyone welcome to the simply L
YouTube channel in this session we will
create a QR code scanner using python
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel
like the tutorial and hit the Bell icon
to never miss an
update and before starting our project
let us have a simple question to brush
up on our notes
and please answer in the comment section
below and we'll update the correct
answer in the pain comment and your
question is what is the minimum
decodable size for a QR code
scanner that is QR code only and your
options
are
1.5 by 1.5 CM or 1X 1 cm or 1.75x 1.75
CM or 2x 2 cm
you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section and moving on now we'll start a
project that is create a QR code
scanner for that first we'll create a
folder
and name it
as creating QR code
scanner and inside we
will open the command
prompt and write a command code space
period and press enter to open our ideal
that is I am using the visual studio
code you can use any idle
as you comfortable
with and we'll create a file and name it
as QR Scanner
dopy and now the first thing we will do
is install the modules that we will
require for the project for that we will
open the command
prompt uh the first module we will
install is open CV and and you can
search for the command in the web or if
you know you can just write it down and
press enter for that I'll show you how
to get for the
command you can just type open
CV Python and press
enter you will see the first link that
is open CV
python that is the original
documentation and you can see the
command here just copy it
direct to the command
promp and paste the command here and
just press
enter as you can see that it states that
the requirement is already satisfied I
have already installed the open CV
module you can just type in the command
and press enter it will just install it
for
you and the second one module we will
install is P
bar just open the official
link and you can see the command here
pip install pbar just copy it and
redirect back to the command pront and
paste your command here and just press
enter it will do the work for you as it
is stating that it's the requirement is
already satisfied I already installed
the asbar module you can do that just
writing the command and press
enter now moving to our Visual Studio
code now we'll start with our code and
we first we will import the packages the
first package will import is that is the
CV2 that is the open CV
the next we will import the decode class
from the pisar module so for that we'll
write the
command for de
code now the first thing we will do is
uh we will create a variable and ask the
open C module to make the video capture
function work for us for that we will
create the variable and name it
as
cm and the command would be CV2
dot video capture
now we will set the window this is the
window that would be reflected when we
just make our camera equal to true that
is camera is always defaulted as false
you have to make it true to get it pop
it on your windows
screen and for that we will set the
size cam do
set and first we'll set the width and
we'll set the width as
five and set the pixels as
640 and now we'll set the
height cam do
set and height as six and pixel as same
um or
480 as you wish you can set it as and
now we will make the camera equal to
true as it is a button for a camera and
it's being defaulted set as false we
have to make it
true now while
camera is equal to equal to true
we will read the QR code scanner we will
read the QR code that we will show in
our front
camera so for that we will write the
command when camera equal to equal to
true that is when the camera is
open we would get two things that is
success and the frame
and that would be equal
to cam do
read it will read the frame that would
be shown into our camera and the success
is it will return the Boolean value that
is one or Zer and the frame is it would
read the frame as captured by a front
camera and decode
it now to decode it we will run a r
for
I we will make it as
decode and inside we will pass the
frame that is the frame captured by our
camera
and print the
type that is uh which type it is that is
it's QR code or it's barcode or it's uh
any other code so it will just capture
the frame and it will return or print it
as which type it
is
now we will
print what we will decode from the QR
code for that we'll write the command
code do data what data is stored in
it and we'll use the function
decode and the memory we would be using
is new
have8 oh sorry uh we have taken it as I
and now after we have read the frame and
recorded it we want it to sleep for some
time for that we will just import the
time module and you can install the time
module from the datetime module you can
just write the command pip install date
time or you can just search on the
Chrome or any browser about the datetime
module and python you can just write
datetime space python and space module
you will be just directed to the main
documentation and you will get the
command there and you can just copy and
paste it in the command prompt and the
rest would be done for you as I already
installed it I will import the time
module and now make this Frame
sleep for about 6 seconds
and
now we
want to make or show the
camera uh on a window it should be
popped up and we should be able to see
it for that we will use the open C
module and write the
command I'm sure and we will name the
camera window with our QR code scanner
you can name it anything as you
want so I will name it as
R Ur
underscore code underscore
scanner and the next thing we will do is
pass the frame in
it
and we will just write another command
that would
be weight key
function that would be we using the open
save module and the weight key
function and this would be used to
capture the frame after the 3
seconds so this is our code we'll save
it and make it run
okay we C an
error okay this is due to as I was using
the front camera for recording and it
was not able to capture the
frames so I
have switch off the front camera the
webcam and now we will again save the
file and run
it now you can see that the webcam has
open up and now we will show it a QR
code and you can see that it has
concluded it data as
https ww. simply.com I have created the
code in my mobile
phone and made it available to the
webcam and it has showed us the output
as HTTP wwl.com we can
just press on click
and click on the right button of the
mouse we can we will be directed to the
link
and with that we have come to the end of
