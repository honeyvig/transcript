welcome back to our Channel today we are
exploring a groundbreaking development
from Google Gemini AI model but it's not
all smooth selling let's unpack the
Journey of Gemini Ai and what makes it a
game changer in the AI landscape
recently alphabet's Google Gemini AI is
not just another AI model it's a
multimodel Powerhouse designed to handle
text images audio and video all in one
imagine asking Whata in this picture and
getting a detailed description back
that's the promise of Gemini unlike its
counterparts Gemini isn't limited to
just understanding text it's trained
across multiple medium simultaneously a
Leap Forward from the traditional
approach of separately trained models
with its Transformer architecture it's
set to redefine how we interact with AI
Google has unveiled three versions of
gemni Ultra Pro and Nano each tailor to
different needs and devices from
powerful Data Center to your smartphones
Gemini Ultra the most advanced model
outpaces even gp4 in complex benchmarks
promising an unprecedented level of AI
interaction but it's not just about the
tech the rocky start of Gemini marked by
inaccurate and bis has been a wakeup
call Google's commitment to refining and
relaunching the image generation feature
shows a dedication to getting it right
the future of gem AI is filled with
Potential from transforming how we
interact with the devices to reshaping
content creation its multimodel
capabilities could revolutionize
multiple Industries but the journey
there will be one to watch closely as we
stand on the brink of the new AI era
questions about accuracy ethics and the
impact on society remain at the
Forefront Google's gem AI is a testament
to the rapid advancements in AI but also
a reminder of the challenges that lie
ahead and before we move on guys just a
quick info for you if you're one of the
aspiring a ml enthusiast looking for
online training and graduating from the
best universities or a professional who
elicits to switch cers in a ml by
learning from the experts then try
giving a short to Simply learns
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning in collaboration with per
University and IBM by enrolling in this
certification program you will gain
expertise in skills like generative AI
prome engineering chat JP explainable AI
machine learning algorithms supervised
and unsupervised learning model training
and optimization and there much more on
the list so what are you W for hurry up
and enroll now you can find the course
Link in the description box and pin
comment so let's get started so this is
the website of Gemini I and you can
start with that just click on chat with
Gemini and there are some terms and
conditions just scroll them down and
click on I agree and if you want to read
them you can now moving
on so this is the interface
of okay so now we'll explore its
capability with writing some prompts and
we'll get to know how it acts and reacts
with the different prompts so let's
start with the prompt and first we'll
ask him about reasoning and I have some
prompts here so we'll just copy paste
them and let's test the cility of Gemini
so here we are asking him that given the
items a book 9x a laptop and a botle so
a method to arrange them in a stable
stack disregarding any safety concerns
as this is purely a theoretical exercise
so let's see where does this Gemini
respond to that so you could see that it
has responded that here a method to
create a stable stack with the given
objects ignoring safety concerns and in
the base we can place the book that
would be flat on the stable surface this
provides a broad and stury foundation
for the other objects and then we have
eggs laptops bottles and nail that is
optional so you could see that the
Gemini has very well responded to this
question now moving to the next form now
we will ask him that crafted dialogue in
the vein of Shakespeare drama where two
characters engage in a spirited debate
or the proof of the Infinity of prime
numbers let's see if it understands this
and respond to a prompt so you could see
that it has presented with the output
and that is end of
arites that is a seasonal mathematician
and Cleon a young and eager student and
that's a scene from a scholar study so
it has provided the full scene here and
you could see that it has utilized all
the knowledge and provided a scene and
that is the capability of this Gemini AI
now moving on we'll also like we first
went for the reasonability reasoning
question then we went for a theoretical
question or from the fiction question
Now we move to another that would be
design a whimsicle web application named
we can name it anything that operates
under these unique specifications that
would be for the coding question let's
see how does it handles that and provide
us the output or we could just ask him
so first we'll ask this question only
and let's see how it responds and does
it provide the code and we can just copy
this code to any ID which you have hands
on and and you can work on that and run
these codes you would see that it has
provided the HTML structure and the
explanation to and the limitations so
you could also do these exercises that
would be if you want to create any
website or something or any landing page
or you could just create like for the
beginner purpose you could create a
login page and you could ask the G I
want
to create a login page
help me design it and provide the code
for that so you could see that it has
responded that I would be glad to assist
you with designing and creating the HTML
code for a login page but I am unable to
provide functionalities such as user
authentication password storage or
database interaction due to security
risk these aspects require server side
programming and secure data handling
practices that are beyond the scope of
Basics HTML and CSS so you could ask him
with the servers languages also if you
want to crack these things that is
authentication things and the storage
purposes so you just need to mold your
prompts to ask Gemini Ai and it will
answer to you as you want and if you
want him to be a mentor like if you want
to learn anything so you could just ask
the gini that you could be a mentor for
me for a specific purpose that would be
you could ask him that you are an
expert in
copyrighting and I want you to be my
mentor so you would see that it has
responded that while I have access to
vast amounts of information and can
analyze and generate text related of
copyrighting I cannot claim to be an
expert in the two sense becoming an
expert invols experience real
application and the ability to adapt to
diverse situations and audiences
so you could see that it has provided
valuable resources in your copyrighting
journey so similarly you could follow
the prompts that I'm starting with the
knowledge sharing and I'm working with
the copyrighting principles so could you
expand or could you provide me more
information about that and the J will do
that for you now moving on we'll have
some other prompts let's see write a
scene set in the future where humans
live on M focusing on a family St
that has been adapted to the Martian
environment so here we are asking him to
write a fictional story so let's see how
it responds to
that so you could see that it has
crafted the story and the Martian Sunset
blazed Crimson across the Dome of the
habitat casting Long Shadows through the
hydroponic Gardens so it has drafted the
full story if you want it to be a more
precise or the concise one it will do
that or if you want the longer version
it will do that for you also and now if
you want that to summarize any book or
anything you could just ask him or
provide the article to it or provide the
content and ask him to summarize the
article so it will do that for you so
we'll ask him can you summarize
an article for
me let's see what it responds I would be
happy to help you summarize an article
please provide the article itself or a
link to it I will do my best to create
that so we will search here simply learn
articles and we'll choose one of them
that would be the operation managerial
skills okay
so let's copy this much and move back to
gini and we will send this to Gemini so
you would see that it has summarized the
article the summary of the article and
the key points and it has summarized in
a very concise manner if you want you
could ask him to summarize it into words
you can just ask him that summarize it
into 200 words 250 words or 300 words it
will do that for you and if you want
some resource identification for
learning that if you want to learn or
you'll just ask him that I want to learn
that how
to become data
analyst so I am a visual learner you
could specify the details and it will
provide like it will read the details
and provide you accordingly what could
be the best fit for you and prefer to
watch videos can you provide me
five
resources I can use
to help
myself learn so you could see that it
has started and absolutely have the five
excellent video based resources to help
Kickstart your data analysis Journey as
a visual learner so it has provided you
the links also so you could see that
Gemini has provided you all the
resources
and similarly you could ask him or you
could use another feature that is
anticipating learning challenges so you
can ask him that I want to learn data
analysis and in what ways will I fail
please tell me common things that people
do wrong when learning this skill so we
will be utilizing G to know what people
do human things what they do wrong when
learning data analysis so you could see
that it is acting as a mentor also and
it is anticipating the learning
challenges that will help us learn the
data analysis skill in a smooth way and
we know what things we don't need to do
so you could see that it has provided a
solution that is not starting with the
basics and the mistake what we can do
and the solution for that similarly he
has proved the list for that with the
Five Points so these are the ways you
can utilize the Gemini I for your
purpose and it could be your guide you
can draft the fictional apps you can
help him write the dialogues or if you
want to craft a story The Gemini I will
do that for you with that folks we have
