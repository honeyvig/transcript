hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel
in this session we will be discussing
about programming versus coding
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon so that you can never miss an
update from simplylearn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
discussion
so we have one point agenda today that
is programming versus coding
now both these terms are used as
synonyms to one another if you search
google you'll find the same when you
search for the definition of programming
you can find computer programming is the
process of designing and building an
executable computer program to
accomplish a specific computing result
or to perform a specific task
surprisingly when you search for coding
definition you'll end up finding a
similar definition computer programming
or coding is a process of designing and
building executable computer program to
accomplish specific computing result or
to perform a specific task and it is
also said that the terms programming and
coding can be used as a synonym to each
other yet there is one thin line of
difference between the book that's
exactly what we are going to discuss in
this particular session
so when you consider programming then it
can be said as passing instructions to
your computing device
so what do you mean by passing
instructions anyway
okay to understand the definition let us
go through a small analogy let us
consider that we have a small robot now
programming is something where you tell
your robot to do something right here
you can consider that you are telling
your robot to perform the operation of a
chatbot where you can tell your robot to
search your mails and respond to it
right this is one analogy where you can
consider the programming concept and
again another example is telling your
robot to perform some mechanical
operations where it tries to fix your
machinery okay it is the same robot but
it is performing in a different way or
it is behaving in a different way it is
based on the program you write or the
program or the instruction you give it
right so it is what programming means
let us go through another example where
you tell your robot to perform some
machine learning operations where it
learns new things and behaves according
to them so this is the term programming
now when you get into coding you can
consider coding as an act of designing
and developing a computer device to
perform exactly as per the task it has
been assigned to right
how and
what made the robot to follow all your
instructions right it is one coder who
wrote all the gibberish code inside its
brain to perform the task whatever you
are giving to it right that process is
called as coding
so it was the coder which had written
all the gibberish code inside the brain
of the robot to perform the task
whatever the user has provided it so
this is exactly what the thinnest line
of difference between programming and
coding is programming is something where
you pass instructions to your computing
device and ask it to perform some tasks
and coding is something where you design
the computing device or tell the
computing device or make the computer
device to be capable enough to perform
the task whichever the user is providing
them so with that we have come to an end
of this tutorial where we have discussed
the differences between programming and
coding i hope it was informative and
interesting if you feel that we have
missed out something important or if you
have something important to discuss with
us or if you have any queries regarding
the session then please feel free to let
us know in the comment sections below
and we'll be happy to hear it from you
and our team of experts will be happy to
resolve all your queries until next time
thank you stay safe and keep learning
