's YouTube channel in this session we
will learn how to count colored cells in
Excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple Technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn now without further
Ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is how to count colored
cells in Excel now here on my
spreadsheet you can see some data so
this particular data has some color
markings so we have used color codes to
Mark the designations of all the
employees with different colors so for
example blue for manager purple for
senior and so on right now our duty is
to count the total number of employees
present in a company based on the color
code this can be done using filters but
let's try with color tools now we don't
have a readily available function in
Excel to count cells please run their
colors but we can make inclusive micro
now to make use of macro you might want
to enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar
and you can see this particular option
click on the customize ribbon option and
you will be provided with various set of
options
now on the right side you can see
developer options
so make sure the check box is clicked to
enable developer options and press on OK
to completely enable developer window
right now when you click on developer
options you can see various options here
visual Basics macro Etc now click on the
macro to create a macro now just give a
name to the macro function so I'll give
simply learn
and press on create to create that
particular macro function
so we have already created a macro that
is Count colored says which we will be
using in our current spreadsheet for
counting the colored cells now let us
erase the newly created function now
getting back to the original code so how
does this particular count colored cells
works so let us understand the function
first then we will try to make use of it
in this spreadsheet so the function name
is Count colored cells as you can see
and this particular function will have
two parameters current cell and
spreadsheet area so the current cell
will be the cell address where the color
you want to count is present and then
the spreadsheet area so what is the
range of cells where you want to locate
that particular color and count the
number of repetitions that is the
spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used
colored cell range color code and color
cell count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count
now let us consider color code is equals
to current cell interior color that is
current cell dot interior dot color so
this is the function which will identify
the interior color of a selected cell
let us imagine that initially color code
is equals to the current cells color
code okay now we will have the for Loop
and that for Loop will include colored
cell which is the current cell in the
spreadsheet area and if the colored cell
the currently selected colored cell dot
interior dot color is equals to the
color code that we have selected then
colored cell count the variable which is
used to count the number of colored
cells is equals to plus one initially by
default it will be 0 in case if this
particular if condition is true that is
the current cell color and the color
code given is equals to same then the
value of colored cell will increase by
1. and this particular if Loop will run
as many number of times the condition is
true so let us imagine that the
condition will remain true for five
times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet and once
the condition fails then the latest
value present in color cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how the macro
function works now let's close the macro
window and get back to our spreadsheet
now let us try to make use of the macro
function that we just created so that is
equals to count colored cells press tab
to select the macro function and the
first one is the current cell so this is
the current cell where the current color
has been provided comma this cell range
so our cell range will be from c 2 to
c31
right so this is the range where we want
to count the similarly colored cells
that is sky blue colored cells close the
function and press enter now you can see
the function has identified six
repetitions of sky blue color in this
particular range of cells now you can
drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be
providing the results of the scene so
six senior colors that is pink or purple
color then two repetitions of this
particular color two repetitions of
trainee color five for dark blue and six
for green right so this is how the macro
function works and the key point to
remember here is this particular macro
will work only for manually colored
cells so there are situations where we
have used conditional formatting to
color a single cell let us imagine that
we have used conditional formatting to
recognize the employees with salary
above 30 000 as green color and if we
try to use that particular green color
to be counted by the color count cells
function now it will not happen it will
not consider that color as a feedback or
an input now in future we will also try
to design a macro which can recognize
the colors made by conditional
formatting as well but this particular
function will be exclusively used for
manually colored cells only with that we
have comprehendent of this session on
how to count colored cells in Excel if
you have any queries regarding any of
the topics covered in this session or if
you require the resources that we used
in the session like the data set macro
code or the pbd then do let us know in
the comment section below and our team
of experts will be more than happy to
resolve all your queries at the earliest
until next time thank you stay safe and
keep learning
