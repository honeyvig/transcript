I'm idea conquerors this is dr. Kalyani
from team MDS conquer so today we will
be discussing about gingiva as it's part
2 where we'll be seeing it as
microscopic features and histology so
gingival anatomy has two types are
superficial epithelium which with cells
like this and in a connective tissue
structure so this is microscopic part of
the gingiva epithelium is of three types
again junctional circular and oral
epithelial and connective tissue has its
own elements
this is a box given in carranza remember
hear everything and be given as
individually like bits like which of the
following is a major type of cell type
scene and they will give you options
korat no sir it's Langerhans melanocytes
Merkel so what you will write us
keratinocyte they will ask you the cell
type of cells present in the epithelium
so these are all the various ways they
can give you the questions from this box
okay so keratin proteins we have keratin
as the keratinization and keratin is the
most important part in the epithelium
and here if you see generally you come
across the keratin protein numbered k-19
k 1 k 9 in egg like whites right and
beside that today we have seen that
there is a molecular weight written that
means if you see these molecular weights
so as the number is dis creasing the
molecular weight is increasing that
means they are inversely related okay
as this is less this molecular weight
would be more that is how it's a
relation between keratin proteins they
are non keratin proteins also what are
they they are care to linen and in value
cream our other two types of non keratin
proteins and here you have something
called cornea site they can be bits as
to so what is a cornea side a cornea
site is a differentiated epithelial cell
it is composed for example this is the
cornea side okay this corner side is
composed of lot of these ground
substance
what is this ground
since made up of it is made up of solid
green if you see water's filigree
filigree has from the carrot ohiolink
granules
so apart from pelegrin you can also see
the are these tono filaments so
basically this is corona side made up of
villa green and they are lot of this
tono filaments this is egg board the
cell called corneal sight okay
coming to the moving on me so basically
this structure how it is what our
keratinocytes they are the major type of
a cells present in the epithelium now
what are these desmosomes these decimals
ohms are the ones which connect the
carrot - carrot in to see like this this
Decimus ohm connects to keratinocytes
like this we have a beautiful image in
the next slide I will be explaining you
okay so let's see just make a note of
this point and let's move on to the next
slide so come here let's see see how
desmosomes are present how Hema desmos
impress are present so basically this
more zoom and he may dismiss oh he means
half of that of a desmosomes I really to
remember right okay for example if this
is the entire structure of a desmos Oh
only this part was the part of a he may
dispose on in the very easiest way to
tell you okay now Hema does mozo miss
half of that I told you right all this
is just for you to remember okay and
somehow it is related to the structure
somewhat desmosomes are connected these
are the keratinocytes in the lair though
this is the Hemi disk sorry des Muslim
connecting itself now you see here they
are Hemi desmosomes
they are connecting the keratinocytes to
that of the external basal lamina so
again two concepts
external basal lamina internal basal
lamina what are this see if you see
internal basal lamina
given in the color of blue what is it
holding cementum and enamel that is it
is holding the tooth structure here if
you see
spin color that means it is holding the
connective tissue MATLAB the external
basal lamina is towards connective
tissue internal basal lamina is towards
that of the tooth structure okay so how
many bits we are covering him with an
image so if you see that external basal
lamina is connected to keratinocytes
with the help of hemi desmosomes these
desmosomes are interconnected to each
other with the help of desmosomes so the
keratinocytes which are connecting to
internal basal lamina also through hemi
desmosomes so everything is clear in
this image if you see properly okay
further there is something called if you
see there's a basal membrane these are
the basement membrane there is lamina
lucida and diamond are denser layers so
directly if this layer is laminar lucida
you can see that the heavier desmosomes
are attached to her lamina lucida layer
of the basement membrane hope it is
clear okay so let's see okay now what is
it is we have various strata or layers
in a epithelium in this there all the
various cells are there and various cell
organelles are there so for example
these are our various cells so we have
this mitochondria which is the
powerhouse of the cell
okay the art they want to present and
they want themselves to be more in the
deeper strata
okay and when so they are all the
mitochondria and they come up they are
only hardly one two like that okay so
because the mitochondria are more what
is mitochondria it is the powerhouse of
cell so our mitochondria the hero is
more present in the lower layers that
means lower layers are very active and
ready to participate in all the kind of
reactions so we have lot of this aerobic
glycolysis actively oxygen related like
Hollis's seen in the lower layers
hence the energy production and more
active are the supra basil and supra
basal layers ok so upper layers less
mitochondria
but they have to perform something
something right so they upon they
perform the Pinto shunt which is an
alternative of pathway of glycolysis you
might have studied all this in your
biochemistry
so with this ultimately all of this can
produce the keratinization of the
proteins a keratinization process so
once the keratinization process happens
through the cells called karat no zooms
okay they are also called as odd land
bodies which are what are they they're
modified lysosomes the enzyme called
acid phosphatase is important here and
it is c2 seen mostly in these organelles
okay coming to Medellin melanin is
important and its production is
important so basically this is tyrosine
ok this tired Wilson to dopa tyrosine is
converted to dopa that is dihydroxy
phenylalanine through the enzyme called
as ty Rosen is the enzyme tyrosinase
converts I was into dopa and because of
this further this is converted to
melanin and you see these melanin
pigmentation okay and we have different
layers again based on the arrangement
like this I will show you you can see
there is junctional epithelium southla
reptilian oral epithelium coming to the
cells okay
the cells most important the hero cell
is keratinocytes other cells are this
one so our two important mantras to
remember are proliferation and
differentiation our cell has to
proliferate that means it should produce
lots of number of other cells so other
cells are produced then they have to
differentiate that means you should get
one particular type of a cell say if you
want to get one kirat know either it has
to be a keratinocyte
or it has to be a melon or four or a
Langerhans cell whichever it is it has
to differentiate right so that's what
the process of proliferation happens
through mitosis and I told you my talk
on
hero is present in the lower cells that
means the cell action will be more in
the lower so it you can see it more in
the basal layer differentiation after
they differentiate you see there are
three layers I am explaining you the
terms very clear further will be
application of this thing so when they
come I will be flipping my slide soon
you just have to make note of all the
points ortho keratinized okay it means
it is a fully keratinized epithelium a
beautiful keratinized epithelium which
have a stratum corneum which have a
granule Oh some proper grand Lausanne
layer you see there are no nuclei here
okay it is a well keratinized tissue and
if you see this ok next if you go
they are para keratinized that means it
is an intermediate keratinized tissue
here you will see some pic nautic nuclei
ok little little not like that and you
see they are granules okay
dispersed granules are seen but when you
come to non-keratinized here you will
have no granules here but you will see a
proper viable nucleus that means you
understand it as ortho keratinized para
que recognized and non-keratinized is
like a sequence of characterization okay
you also have non correct no sites where
you have melanocytes and melon o in
melanosomes
okay so these is an image showing you
melanocytes these are the other kind of
cells where all of them are presented
they are functions
okay Langerhans cells make a node
Langerhans cells can be asked as bits so
Langerhans cells located among the
keratinocytes ad Supra basal layers okay
so basically based on the function of
the cell they are present in various
layers okay for examples use if you see
kirat know site they are present towards
the epithelium okay if you see
Langerhans cells there intermittently
present in between that of the
epithelial cells melanocytes melanin
production so if you see the cell based
on you have to use your common sense if
they I will ask you which cell is
present in which layer you have to think
okay if it is a carrot
it might be present in a superficial
layer so I'm are accordingly mark the
answer it is simple if you understand
the concept okay so if you see this is
the Langerhans cell and these are the
bits regarding this is a star
characteristic shape of the Langerhans
cell and these are the barbecuin
granules which are present in the
Langerhans cell they have an important
role in the antigen presentations okay
coming to melanocytes
they are they produce melanin and they
are present in stratum basale and
stratum spiral some layers as you can
see okay and they're Merkel cells which
have some sensory no fibers that is how
they have been tactile perceptions and
then they come into the microscopic
features second part that is that of the
epithelium okay here
epithelial I told you are off outer
animal epithelium sorry or outer
epithelium then you see sulphur
epithelium and junctional epithelium so
our outer epithelium is present in the
outer layer having all the four layers
our stratum corneum stratum granulosum
stratum spinosum and stratum basale and
below it is connective tissue okay if
you see this is how the stratum
stratum granule that is outer enamel
epithelium is present okay here the
keratinization is more so if you see in
the next slide further these are all the
keratin proteins you can see the
differences okay I told you though how
ortho keratinized Baraka Ratna is
non-keratinized are what are the
differences between them you can
appreciate in this light make a note of
this light yeah so I wanted to tell you
this is keratinized and this is
non-keratinized
and how they are differentiated if you
see this carotene granules and is this
keratinized layer they are all seen in
the superficial layers when compared to
non keratinous you don't see any of them
okay coming to sulk Loretta thulium
other type okay here it is
thin and this is non-keratinized that
means you have no character no set it
look like this one Sal Clara petty Liam
will look like this
oral epithelium will look like this
clear it extends from the coronal
limited okay I will show you the
expansions in my further slides enzymes
these two enzymes are star enzymes
please remember and make a note of this
thing coming to junctional epithelium
okay so this part here this is the oral
epithelium along the sulcus you see
this'll clear epithelium at the junction
it is junctional epithelium okay here
they have described how the junction
epithelium is there what are the
different types and the range so
junction epithelium is very important as
you can see see here is the junction of
epithelium okay
it has some keratin proteins like this
make a note of this lysosome sort out
all the kind of lysosome like bodies are
present but karate knows ohms are absent
okay now again the junctional epithelium
has three parts
so basically oral epithelium sulker
epithelium junction epithelium is
present right again in junction
epithelium if you see there is a pie
calzone middle zone and coronal zone so
this is a coronal part of it is having
great their permeability coming to the
middle part it has a adhesive property
okay apical zone have germinated
property
so from here lot of cells are produced
and they keep going to the eggs outer
layer so every zone has its own property
again this is a replication of that
image I told you this is discussed to
surface how it is connected color to
tissue okay make a note so this is how
the decimals woman keratinocytes
structure is so what is dental general
unit it is the union of junction of
epithelium and the gingival fibers so
this is the importance of Junction depth
ileum it's a very dynamic structure it
has a beautiful turnover that is the
reason why where is any injury to the
epithelium junctional epithelium has the
best turnover and keeps forming cells it
also have a host defense it is active
against the bacteria
so these are all the good points about
it come let's come to the connective
tissue come at connective tissues also
called as lamina propria it has
papillary and reticular part papillary
means the papillary part like this
reticular means my finger net like
appearance so coming to connective
tissue you also have cells and fibers
okay so fibers are what are they dental
gingival a your gingival that means they
attach the dent mclubbe tooth to gingiva
alveolar gingival born to gingiva
circular fibers then the periosteum
fibers again tooth to the periosteum
transept l from one septa to other of
the tooth okay this one image where all
the I tried try to combine all the
various fibers in one location if you
see how they attach see from that of the
bone our tooth to the bone then again
CDE please have a look out of all these
fibers yes here are the secondary or the
minor collagen fibers where they are
very austere gingival inter papillary
trans gingival into circular into fringe
Evelyn semicircular fibers so coming to
the ground substance it is mainly made
up of water proteoglycans and
glycoproteins what are the different
type of proteoglycans it has hyaluronic
acid and chondroitin sulfate and
glycoproteins are fibronectin laminin
other fibers non-core largeness can be
okay apart from collagen the reticular
oxy Talon and elastic fibers I told you
already that the fibroblasts are
important cells which produce the
collagen fibers for these are the
structures of fibroblasts
they are the other type of inflammatory
cells which are present like plasma cell
lymphocytes PM ends and in these are the
inflammatory cells okay so thank you so
much for your page
