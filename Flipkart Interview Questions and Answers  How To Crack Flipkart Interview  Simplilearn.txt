interview process for sde intern
positions
round one
online coding round that comprises two
coding interview questions to be
completed within 60 minutes
flipkart interview experience holders
state that both questions are based on
basic data structures and algorithms
round two and three
online coding ground these interview
rounds assess a candidate's proficiency
in problem solving data structures and
algorithms including coding problems on
arrays less graphs trees dynamic
programming recursion linked lists
queues trees maps etc
candidates can put up questions to clear
doubts
talking to the interviewer while coding
and conveying your approach is
recommended to earn extra points
round four hiring manager round an
engineering manager of the team you are
interviewing four will use several
behavioral resume based and scenario
based questions to evaluate soft and

the hr round focuses on understanding
how well a candidate can fit into the
flipkart culture
interview process for full-time sde
positions

around past work inside and some
critical thinking questions related to
the job position you're being
interviewed for it is conducted over the
telephone or google map
round two machine coding
the candidates will be given a problem
and they will have to come up with a
complete working code including error
handling mechanisms within 90 minutes of
duration
there will also be a detailed discussion
on the candidate's approach to solving
the question so the total time devoted
to this session will be two hours
approximately
round three problem solving and data
structures candidates should be prepared
for flip card coding questions on
various data structures
the most commonly asked concepts include
string manipulation bit manipulation two
pointers searching sorting backtracking
and dynamic programming
round four
system design round
this round is only for senior software
development engineer positions it lasts

round five
manageable round team and culture
fitment
this round aims at assessing candidates
group fitment based on their experience
interests and skills exhibited in

answering the questions
topics to brush up before the interview
a software developer should be well
versed with following crucial concepts
programming or coding practicing writing
the code in an object oriented language
that has good libraries for parallelism
and concurrency
level design
practice coming up with a logical view
and a process view
next data structures and algorithms
list linked lists arrays graphs trees
queues dynamic programming hash map heap
and others
followed by that we have design patterns
and principles and lastly system
architecture and its components
now you will come across some famous
flip card coding interview questions
number one gas station
given integer arrays a and b each of
size n
there are n gas stations present along a
circular route
the amount of gas at station i is a of i
suppose your car has unlimited gas tank
given the cost of gas to travel from
station i to the next station i plus 1
as b of i
if you begin the journey from one of the
gas stations with an empty tank then
return the minimum starting index of the
gas station when you can travel around
the circuit once else return one
starting at i and ending up at the same
completes the circuit
assume that you can only travel in one
direction that is i to i plus 1 i plus 2
and so on n minus 1 0
1
2
input format the first argument given is
the integer array a the second argument
given is the integer array b
output format return the minimum
starting index of the gas station when
you can travel around the circuit once
else return minus 1.
second distribute candy
given n children are standing in a line
and each is assigned a rating value
you are supposed to distribute candies
to these children as follows
each child must get at least one candy
children who are assigned a higher
rating get more candies than their
neighbors determine the minimum candies
to be given
input format
the first and the only argument contains
n integers in an array a
output format
return an integer that represents the
minimum candies to be given
now the third problem
minimum sum path in matrix for a given
2d integer array a of size m cross n
find a path from the top left to the top
bottom that minimizes the sum of all
numbers note you are only allowed to
move either down or right at any time
input format
the first and only argument is a 2d
integer array a of size m cross n
output format return a single integer
that denotes the minimum sum of a path
from the cell 1 comma 1 to cell m comma
n
fourth problem
merge k sorted lists
merge the given k sorted linked list
return the sorted list as one sorted
list
for example the list are
1
to 10
to 20 4 to 11 to 13
3 to 8 to 9
they will result in the following list
1 3
4
8
9
10
11
13 and lastly 20.
now the fifth question
design a twitter-like system
the system design round is open-ended
and the candidate can explore various
options
there is no fixed or standard answer
however candidates must ask the
interviewers questions to discover the
subparts of the question and their
expectations
now the sixth question
first non-repeating character in a
stream of characters
for a given string a that denotes a
stream of lowercase alphabets make a new
string b to find the first non-repeating
character every time a character is
inserted into a stream and append it at
the end to b
if no non-repeating character is
discovered append hash at the end of b
problem constraints
1 should be
less than or equal to the length of the
string which is less than or equal to
1 lakh
input format the only argument given is
a string a
output format return a string b on
processing the string of lowercase
alphabets a
now we have seventh question meeting
rooms for a given two dimensional
integer array a of size n cross 2 that
denotes time intervals of different
meetings find the minimum number of
conference rooms needed for all meetings
where a of i
0 equals to starting time of ith meeting
a of i
1
equals to end time of ith meeting
problem constraints 1 should be less
than or equal to n which is in turn less
than or equal to 10
0 should be less than or equal to a of i
0
which is less than a of i comma 1 which
is in turn less than or equal to 2 into
1 not 9.
now the input format
the only argument given is the matrix a
output format return the minimum number
of conference rooms needed for all the
meetings
now the eighth question
pair with given difference a is the
given one-dimensional unsorted array
containing n integers
also given an integer b
find whether the given array has a pair
of elements voice difference is b
if there is any such pair present return
1 else return 0
input format
the first argument is an integer array a
of size n
the second argument is an integer b
output format return 1 if any such pair
is present in the array
else return 0.
