I'm back here to discuss one more
important topic okay that is about the
classification of studies okay so we
know that the studies are classified
into three main types one is the
descriptive second one is analytical and
third one is experimental okay the first
one is descriptive so so descriptive
basically helps in formulating a
hypothesis
okay descriptive basically helps in
formulating a hypothesis whereas the
second one that is analytical basically
helps in testing the hypothesis and the
last one is a very simple that is well
known as experimental experiment means
you are going to do an experiment you're
going to do an experiment or a study
which helps in confirming the hypothesis
okay which helps in confirmation of
hypothesis so let's learn clearly the
main aspect of descriptive studies
formulating a hypothesis the main aspect
of analytical study is testing that
formulated hypothesis and the main
aspect of experimental studies is
conforming the hypothesis which is
tested okay so they're related
formulating testing and confirmation I
hope you are very clear so we are going
to talk about each and individual
subtype is already we are already done
with this so which studies they comes
under analytical analytical the
following studies are going to come
under analytical one is cohort study
there are many other names
okay cohort studies also called as
follow-up study the second one is the
case control study is also called as
case reference study the third one is
cross-sectional study cross-sectional
study is also called as prevalences
study and the fourth one is
ecological study ecological study is
also called as co-relationship study
correlation study so again the most
commonly asked question at this area is
they're going to ask the individual unit
in each study so if you talk about the
individual unit either in the cohort
study or case control study or cross
sectional study the individual unit is
an individual an individual whereas in
the ecological study okay in the
ecological study or the correlation
study the individual unit is a
population the next comes is the
different types of experimental studies
so the different types of experimental
studies are your RCT that is a
randomized control trials or your
clinical trials or your field trials or
your community trials all these they
comes under the experimental studies a
very simple question is which of the
following is an analytical study which
of the following is an experimental
study is the most common and an
individual or an easy question that is
asked all of the following or
experimental studies except so such
simple questions are regularly asked in
the examinations okay so I hope we're
you're very clear the descriptive
studies they talk about formulating the
hypothesis and analytical study this
they talk about the testing the
hypothesis and experimental studies they
talk about conforming the hypothesis
okay so when you talk about studies
nowadays they're going to give a
scenario and they're going to ask would
study it is or what study it is used or
they're going to give us in audio and
they can ask you which of the following
study is the best for this particular
study these are the regular questions
they're asking in the examinations so
among the list
okay among the list as many of you
including you me or anyone we are more
familiar with the case control and the
cohort studies okay the case control
cohort studies are most familiar and of
course experimental studies are again
the most commonly asked but
most of your questions will be around
the cohort study case control study and
the experimental studies you may get
confused what to be opted so it is
better you learn a good number of n
number of examples or n number of
conditions or by just analyzing that
analyzing the case whether the case is
moving forward or the case is moving
backward so basing upon which you can
easily differentiate whether it is a
cohort study or a case control study
with the given data in a particular
question which we will be learning in
the next level ok so most of your
questions will move around cohort study
case control study few questions on
cross-sectional studies and all these
the the experimental studies are very
very important in examination point of
view ok I'll be discussing each and
every aspect or every study with some
examples in further videos in the class
ok
so for now signing off from team MDS
