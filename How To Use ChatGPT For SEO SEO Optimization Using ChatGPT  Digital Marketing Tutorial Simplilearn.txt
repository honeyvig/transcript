extension click on enter so this is the
first link basically we'll click on
it and this is aipm for chat gbt don't
get confused with any other extension
this is this looks like this and now
we'll click on add to
Chrome and then add
extension and that's
it now let's just click on allow
and it is integrated I
believe
yes so as you can see it is also showing
a quick start tutorial select a prom
template enter the word or more send
message so we'll click on get if you
want to view tutorials you can click on
this otherwise you can get started with
airm so as you can see the whole layout
the whole interface is changed there are
lot of things over here let me explain
to you guys what all these things are
all right so there are various Options
under public and on from which you can
filter prompts by uh topic as you can
see or
activity and then uh prompts can be
sorted by top videos trending as you can
see and uh there are actually 4892
prompts available and uh you can see the
first 12 on this page as you can
see and some examples of prompts here is
like you can say us SE optimized content
writer human written 100% unique SE
optimized article so these are the
examples of prompt now first of all
we'll ask Chad gbt to write a blog post
for us on let's say Fitness all right so
we'll ask J
gbt Fitness in everyday
lifestyle all right uh let's click on
this so we haven't used any prompt till
yet so let's just first put this input
and let's see what CH GPT gives
us all
right so as you can see this is the
topic name importance of everyday
Fitness simple strategies to incorporate
Fitness then we can see subtopic are
also
there all
right and here's the conclusion all
right so this is basically our blog post
so now let's say we want to optimize
this blog post and we want to do SEO on
this one sh so let's first just copy
this we'll copy this and paste in
our
document all right so this is our
document and we have p pasted this all
right now let's go back over here and
let's say we want to write it in a more
familiar or you can say friendly tone
and in a more explanatory tone you can
also use so let's just write
this don't worry about the spelling guys
uh Chad take care of this all right so
let's see
what are the changes in both of these
block
post let's just wait to finish
it and here's the conclusion so this is
the second block post so let's
understand the difference uh in between
these two first we'll first check out
for this one start small begin with
manageable changes all
right as you can see here it is begin
with manageable changes take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destinations or stand and stretch
during work breaks these small efforts
can add up over time all right let's
just see what is written over here in
the second block Post in the second
block post it is written begin with
manageable changes that fit seamlessly
into your daily routine for example or
for instance choose to take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby by destination instead of driving
or stand and stretch during work breaks
these small efforts can accumulate over
time and contribute to your overall
Fitness so if you want to take the
second one which is a few changes it is
more bit explanatory uh compared to the
first one we can just copy paste this
this one as well so you can uh write a
second prompt as well in which if you
want to write in a friendly tone or in a
formal tone you can write like that all
you have to do is to just write the
prompt in chat gbd let's just copy paste
it and replace it with the First with
the second
one all right so now we are back in chat
gbt so now basically we have the blog
post content basically we have the
content of it now we want to polish it
we want to select the best title out of
it and many more things so for that
let's just make use of prompts instead
of writing all these prompts by yourself
you can make use of the prompts that is
that comes with aipm chat gbt prompts
all right so let's just say we want to
write about the title we want to select
a perfect title for this blog post so
what we can do is we'll go over here and
first of all we'll select in topics
we'll go and we'll select copywriting
because we want to write about the as
optimize title we want the best title
we'll select
copywriting confirm
all right now after this you can just go
for prompts what whichever you
like I'm going to go for this one blog
post title generator as you can see also
if you didn't get what you wanted then
you can go for the search engine over
here you can just type let just say if
you want to uh want to if you're writing
a script basically and you want a
perfect title for it then you can write
a script generator or something like
that over here automatically whichever
prompts that are relevant to it will
come all right so we have selected this
one blog post title generator because we
have to create a title for our blog post
we'll click on this and now all we have
to do is to write the name of our blog
post the name of our blog post is we'll
select everyday Lifestyle Fitness in
everyday lifestyle let's just select
this
one all right now as you can see see you
can select the titles to write it is
five let's just select 10 all right now
the language you can select English and
many more languages are there we'll keep
it in English itself tone emotional or
default let's just be default itself
poetic default default itself we'll keep
it like this all right
now click on this let's just
see so according to chat gbta brm prompt
these are the 10 best title that we can
Implement in our blog poost now what we
want to do is select one best title out
of it all right so these are 10 we have
to select one out of it so for that
we'll go to Google Keyword
Planner so this is Google Keyword
Planner we'll click on this find your
campaign keywords we'll click on this
visit Keyword Planner now you guys might
be thinking what is Google Keyword
Planner so let me explain to you
guys so this Google Keyword Planner is a
free tool that helps you find keywords
for your online content it shows you how
often people search for certain words
and phrases and how much competition
there is to rank for those keywords this
way you can choose the best keywords to
Target in your ads or blog post or
website to attract more visitors and
potential customers so it'll give you
the numbers BAS basically which are
mostly ranking and having the
competition all right so we'll click on
discover new
keywords and let's select where it is
we'll select the first
10 go to Google Keyword Planner and now
here we will paste
it so all 10 of them are pasted now what
we'll do is we'll click on get results
so after clicking on get results as as
you can
see so this is average monthly searches
this is competition the we want the
maximum monthly searches Fitness healthy
lifestyle and low in competition so
according to your preference you can
select from here and whichsoever this is
100k to 1 million and many more more
topics you can select from here which
has low competition so as you can see
this treadmill has more uh average View
100K to 1 million but the computation is
also high so we should keep the
computation low as well so we should
keep in mind so we can select our best
title from it so whichever
suits all right after selecting the best
title we can go
to our what we call this blog post to
change the title so this is the new
title let's keep it like
this all right so now our is done now
let's go back to chat
GPT and here is a chat
GPT and now let's go to
the its layout now here we want to write
the content regarding that regarding
that title so what we'll do is basically
we'll go over here and we'll select
SEO and once we have selected it we'll
go we'll select this prompt human
written 100% used s optimized article
now based on that title that we have
generated we'll write a complete content
on it we'll use the help of this prompt
so as you can see G gbt 3.5 turbo gbt 4
gbt 40 we'll select
this and paste our title this is our
title transform your life how everyday
Fitness can boost your health so now
this promp will generate the content
based on this title all right now let's
see as you can see transform your life
how every day fitness can boost your
health this is the content
outline the article outline you can
say so this is the introduction what is
everyday Fitness then physical fitness
benefits and it keeps on
writing I believe it will it'll be a
long article or
blog so you don't have to write too many
prompts for this you can just do this
and the whole thing will take care of it
all as you can see fig are also being
generated by this prompt otherwise we
would have wrote another prompt for the
fq and many things are there that should
be in there in the article or
blog so yeah now we can select our
article or blog we can
say so we have the title we don't want
the outline let's
say we'll take it from here from the
introduction it's a long article I
believe as you can see this last
question is not completed but you can
click on continue generating and it will
complete that we don't want the last
question I think three questions or four
questions are sufficient for us so now
as we have copied it first of all we
need to make sure that our content is
unique it is not plagarized because we
can't publish or use the plagarized
content so we have to be sure that we
are using the unique content for that
we'll have to go to this site known
as duply checker
we'll click on this first link and now
as you can see here we can copy and
paste it paste we can just exclude this
last question as I told
you all right now our content our
article is pasted now we will check the
plagarism
all right first of all we'll have have
to tell them that we are not a robot and
then we have to click on check
lism all right so it is showing maximum
thousand words allowed per search all
right so let's just do one
thing we'll do it because if you want to
do thousand words you'll have to go for
their pro version or the premium version
so we now have
to use some part of it not the complete
part it's actually a long article so
from the role we'll take
as you can see number of words is 5
not5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
12% uni all right so blackism is uh 3% I
think that can be that can we can
neglect it and now let's check for the
rest of this
one all
right all right here we'll copy and
paste it
check
lism as you can see number of words 671
0% plagarism 12% unique so I don't think
it'll be a problem so it is good to go I
believe and now we just copy and paste
it
so
let's take it from
here till
here all right so this is our content
now so our content was not larized but
let's just say if it is plagarized and
is not unique so what should we do then
we can simply put a prompt in chat gbt
that make it non- plagarized or make it
unique or rephrase it but let's say uh
that plagerized Checker the duply
Checker mentions the particular lines or
where there is plagarism so you can
select that line put into chat gbt and
ask them to rephrase or make it
plagarism free by doing this you can
make make the complete content plagorism
free it is very easy or else you can use
a prompt from aipm as I told you all you
have to do is to just type plagarism
free content writer and a particular
prompt will come you can just put your
content in that prompt and the rest chat
G will take care of all right now to
boost your SE strategy you must focus on
eat that is expertise authora liveness
and trustworthiness
and keep that human element strong use
chat GT to improve your content with
interesting verified facts and relevant
examples create a FAQ section to answer
common questions and look for any
missing information to fill in these
steps will help you make high quality
content that connects with your audience
and ranks better in search engines so
for that we'll write a prompt to chat
gbt to include the what we we call FAQs
and the uh statistics we want to uh make
use of statistics and FAQs and include
it in our content so how should we do
that let's just understand it let's come
to our chat GPT again now here what
we'll do is we'll write a simple prompt
saying no no no first we go to the new
topic now here because otherwise it will
keep on writing that prompt itself all
right we'll write
please add to what we call
stats or you can write
statistics and one
analogy and a fa
AQ
section with
answers to
this content
draft to
increase
engagement all right now you want to uh
if you want to paste a particular
section of your content you can also do
that or else you can paste the entire
content it's as per your choice so let
me just paste a particular
section let's just paste this one and
all right let's
see all right so as you can see
statistics studies show that engaging in
just 30 minutes of moderate physical
activity each day can reduce the risk of
chronic disease like heart disease so
these are the statistics and these are
the analogies and this is the FAQ
section
that you can include in your content or
a particular section of the content
usually these statistics are included in
the introduction part to make it more
interesting so you can make use of it
and do that all right moving forward
let's understand the Chad gyy prompts
for meta titles and descriptions so
crafting meta titles and descriptions is
essential for drawing readers attention
so it is necessary that we should use
that all right so uh now we'll be
writing a particular prompt for it for
that for the content part I'll be
leaving the
space content here

create a meta
description and title for this content

including the keyword now here we'll

focus keyword or the primary keyword you
want to include it in all right and

can you have to use the entire content
but I'm just showing showing you so you
can use this one itself it will be more
than enough don't have to worry about it
and the focus keyword
is
