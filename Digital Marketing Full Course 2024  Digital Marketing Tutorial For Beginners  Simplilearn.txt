Sanders and today we're going to talk
about what is digital marketing so
thanks for joining us here simply learn
and let's get started let's start
talking about why digital marketing is
important so let's start there on the
why so if we're just a fly on thewall
and we're in an office environment we're
looking at two friends having a
conversation about digital marketing so
really if we're listening in everybody
every marketer is using digital
marketing for his or her business now
digital marketing's become more popular
than traditional marketing that's not a
surprise so in response hey over the
past few decades digital marketing has
evolved at a rapid Pace these days a lot
of people spend most of their time on
the internet so what happens in the
internet every 60 seconds well a lot
happens every 60 seconds so according to
Social Media today I mean there's a lot
of snaps there's a lot of clicks there's
a lot of texts there's a lot of videos
watched there's a lot of pictures being
taken there's a lot of voice activated
activity going on a lot of tweets emails
swipes there's a lot going on here in 60
seconds so there's a lot of activity on
the internet a lot and so the one
gentleman says hey can you also mention
a few differences between digital and
traditional marketing systems and then
the expert responds of course I can
certainly clarify a few differences
between digital and traditional and so
he goes on to say what the differences
are between traditional and digital and
let's look at that okay so on
traditional marketing we're talking
about print radio billboard newspaper TV
anything that's not on your mobile or
laptop so we know traditional marketing
reaches limited with digital marketing
reaches maximum and what we mean by that
is hey when you print something you're
printing it for x amount of people if
you're trying to promote an event and
you basically create 1 th000 Flyers okay
you figure it's going to a th000 people
maybe they'll share it so you're looking
about 2,000 people maybe just to be
generous well digital marketing we're
promoting an event we can promote it to
a whole lot of people depending on the
platform so 2000 is nothing when you're
targeting an audience on Facebook or
Google search traditional marketing non
versatile and with digital marketing
very versatile so again going back to
our flyer print an 8 1/2 by 11 okay
that's it you know with with digital
marketing you're running display banners
get 468 by 60 200x 200 250 by 250 300X
300 I mean the list goes on on the types
of different display sizes not to
mention text ads not to mention video or
multimedia uh so there's a lot you can
do to get your message out there okay
with traditional it's always delayed
communication okay so meaning if you're
trying to get that TV spot there might
not be a spot open until 1: in the
morning okay well with digital marketing
there is no hours okay you can certainly
get your point out there and have people
see it instantaneously so with
traditional marketing there's a lack of
real-time results I mean this seems like
it's obvious but you you know digital
marketing that's one of the biggest
benefits instant realtime results
instant okay nowadays go to analytics
you can look at real time reporting okay
so we could see real time results okay
traditional marketing can be very costly
I mean if you're not only doing
postcards and printing postcards but you
have to mail those postcards so there's
postage fees where with digital
marketing it's very very very cost
efficient I mean meaning you could pick
and choose CH who you want to Target
when you want to Target where you want
to Target what you want to Target and if
you're doing search you can put your
bidding in place you can put your hours
in place you can really control how much
you actually spend so that to me is one
of the biggest advantages to digital
marketing not only do you get real- time
results but you can control costs and
then obviously optimize based on the
amount of cost you're spending based on
those real-time results with traditional
marketing it's difficult to reach a
target audience you know with digital
marketing it's easy to reach a target
audience I mean you know I don't want to
bash traditional marketing too much I
mean if you're going to put a TV ad in
place you know you're going to do it on
a TV show that tends to gear more
towards your target audience but that
doesn't guarantee anything here we can
simply go to Facebook or Twitter or
LinkedIn and just pick and choose
specifically who we want to Target when
we want to Target them so it just
becomes a lot easier to reach targeted
audience on a digital marketing platform
and then with traditional marketing poor
campaign measurement with digital you
have easy to measure and optimize
campaigns and what we really mean by
that is because you get instant time
results because you can control cost
because you can reach your target
audience more easily all those are
result of okay you can measure and
optimize based on what our audience is
seeing and how much they're spending to
see it we can quickly make adjustments
in order to optimize the campaign for
better performance so that's generally
that means that's a culmination of
pretty much everything that we've listed
as a benefit for digital marketing okay
so now why digital marketing's been
answered with all the benefits that it
carries let's talk about the what is
digital marketing so you know that you
know you want to do digital marketing so
how do we go about that what what is it
exactly well let's just Define it
digital marketing is just the act of
promoting a company's product or an
individual's product or service with the
help of a device or technology and so
obviously when we talk about device
we're talking about maybe a laptop we're
talking about a mobile device and when
we talk about technology it could be an
app it could be you know a cloud-based
platform okay it could be a piece of
software okay so a lot going on on the
digital side in terms of variations and
what you can do but that's in a nutshell
what digital marketing is you're really
just using technology to promote your
product or service so we know because of
the benefits in digital marketing you
can promote your campaign on different
platforms okay so all those benefits we
mentioned about instant realtime results
cost efficiency optimizing campaigns you
could do that on search you could do it
on social via email on mobile apps Etc
so that's what we mean by with the help
of digital devices and Technology well
these digital devices and Technology
come in the form of search engines and
emails and mobile apps Etc so when we
want to go and promote our product or
service using a campaign we have
different options so there are different
types of digital marketing channels that
we can choose from and let's just go
through that list of digital marketing
channels and the first one
is what I consider the king of them all
and that's SEO so SEO stands for search
engine optimization there's search
engine marketing there's email marketing
affiliate marketing social content
mobile and then we can get into subsets
of each of these digital marketing
channels but really we'll start with SEO
because that's the king and to me that's
basically increasing the quality and
quantity of relevant organic traffic on
the search engines including including
Google so depending on where you're
located in the US market Google tends
has a large market share so you want
your pages on your website to be found
and clicked on organically and so that
means if somebody types in a keyword you
want that relevant page to show up first
on Google so somebody can click on that
link okay and we know that milons of
people specifically in the US but
worldwide you search on a daily basis so
if you're ranking for those relevant
keywords you can imagine how much
traffic you can get okay so that's SEO
okay and here's an example so you type
in online shopping well you can see the
first listing here is a paid search ad
and we're going to get to that in a
minute the second organically is Amazon
okay so online shopping you think maybe
Walmart you think maybe Alibaba or
you're thinking probably Amazon okay so
no surprise Amazon's ranking for the
keyword online shopping and so if
somebody clicked on their listing that's
traffic for Amazon let's move on to
search engine marketing you know known
as sem or pay per click or cost per
click or PPC or CPC or sponsored search
or Google ads I mean there's a lot of
different names synonymous with sem so
search engine marketing is really just
using paid ads on search engines just as
we saw at the previous example if you
want to be found for keyword you don't
have to worry about organic if you're
willing to pay for it you just bid on
that keyword and voila you have the
opportunity to appear number one in the
search results at the top of the page
for that keyword now when somebody
clicks on it you have to pay Google if
it's Google you're advertising on but
that's the beauty of search engine
marketing you can bid on keywords and
appear at the top of the search results
for that keyword example here if we go
back to online shopping well my
us.com is bidding on that keyword online
shopping so they're actually appearing
above Amazon's organic listing but
that's what they want to do they want to
be found for that keyword so if they're
not ranking for it organically well
they're bidding on it and if somebody
happen to clicked on that listing then
my us.com is going to pay Google some
something depending on what the cost per
click is and so that could be anywhere
from one penny to $100 it depends
depends on the keyword depends on who
else is bidding on the keyword depends
on the location depends on the time of
day depends on quality score there a lot
of factors involved and regarding what
you pay however the benefit of sem is
visibility and getting traffic to your
website for keywords you're not found
for so that's why sem such a popular
choice for a lot of companies okay let's
talk about digital marketing that's a
traditional type of digital marketing
channel it's been around a long time you
know we all send emails on a daily basis
and we probably all receive emails on a
daily basis just is an effective way to
capture leads and convert them to
customers because with email you can
personalize your emails and you can send
your emails to a segmented audience okay
so if you have emails from females who
are 35 years of age to 44 that live in
say this southern part of the United
States you can segment that send them an
email and cater that email directly to
that audience and of course you can put
some nice call to action in there you
can design it really snazzy and you can
track it just like you can any other
digital marketing channel so email is a
very effective way to really reach a
Target on because everybody for the most
part has a functioning email account so
basically here's an example of an email
that could go out if you're selling a
product and the product's promotion is
about to end well you know get that
email out to your target audience let
them know hey you have until tonight to
purchase product and if you purchase it
you're going to get 30% off and you can
put the coupon code right in there with
a nice call to action and you can
measure how many people click on on that
email go to that web page and purchase
the product using that coupon code so
that's an example of email marketing
okay we have affiliate marketing so
affiliate marketing is an effective way
for digital marketers to basically
create a sales force of people so
basically what you're doing is you're
getting Merchants to promote your
products and services and you using
usually a third-party broker like
Commission Junction or cj.com as an
example to introduce you the the person
selling the product the merchant with
the affiliate so that affiliate could
likely be a merchant him or himself and
they can basically be a good partner of
yours by publishing your product or
service on their website so that they
can sell in order to get commissions so
it's all based on a commission so you
basically are going to use a third-
party affiliate like CJ get all these
Affiliates to work for you they're going
to promote your product or service if
they do sell your product or service
you're going to pay them a commission
that's more or less how it works with
affiliate marketing and you know with
affiliate marketing to me it's a good
way to you know really promote your
product or service and you can pick and
choose the Affiliates or the Publishers
of whom you want to work with so here's
an example of affiliate marketing at
work okay you basic basically see a
banner basically you could see earn up
to 12% advertising fees with a trusted
e-commerce leader okay so if somebody
clicked on that purchased for example or
joined you could pay out that commission
okay let's turn our attention to social
media marketing so social media
marketing you know I wouldn't say it's
fairly new I mean if I think about it
we're in
2019 and I remember talking about
Facebook back in 2006 so you're talking
about 13 14 15 years of social media
it's definitely evolved over the years
and but the concept Remains the Same it
involves creating different types of
content depending on the platform okay
so you could be on Pinterest or
Instagram and be dealing with photos or
you could be on Twitter tweeting out
certain characters up to a limit okay so
it really depends on the social media
platform uh that really drives the type
of content you're going to promote but
we know social media can be effective
because because people use social media
I mean Facebook is one of the more
popular platforms and if you want to get
your product or service out there you
could certainly pay to have an ad on
Facebook or you could just post your
content organically okay that's the
beauty of social most of your Social
platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter and
Facebook and Pinterest and Instagram
they all have a paid form of advertising
that you can use to promote your product
or service or you can go to the organ
organic route and you know post content
organically in hopes of driving traffic
back to your website so with social you
do have two options here but social is
interesting because there are a lot of
different social media platforms out
there it really depends on your product
or service okay so an example of social
media marketing especially on Facebook
with Facebook you got mobile and desktop
and you obviously have the opportunity
to post something organically and have
that liked or commented on or shared or
you can post an ad and get that liked
commented or shared or clicked and have
people go back to your website and
fulfill the goal of what you want them
to do so moving on to content marketing
so content marketing is really an
effective way of really Distributing
valuable content online and when we talk
about content marketing you know talking
about different types of assets so it
could be simply text in the form of a
blog post or it could be a video or it
could be an an infographic or it could
be an image okay there are lots of ways
to create content these days especially
in digital marketing and the great thing
about content marketing is you're
writing content for a targeted audience
so if you're trying to Target an
audience on say Instagram then you know
who who your audience is and you know
what the type of content you're going to
post on there so it could be in the form
of a video or infographic or just a
graphic and so that's the beauty of
content marketing really putting
yourself out there um and depending on
the platform putting yourself out there
with various types of content so for
example we look at YouTube you could see
this video here about digital marketing
certified associate well hey you don't
need to always write the content you can
produce the content in the form of a
video and post it on YouTube this is a
form of content marketing so that's
content marketing and then let's talk
about mobile marketing so content
marketing again different types but if
we go now to mobile marketing you can
kind of segue from content to mobile
because the only difference here is with
mobile it's strictly on mobile phone
it's not desktop so mobile marketing is
really a strategy on its own that helps
you the company promoting your product
or service to reach your target audience
through a mobile device and that
includes tablets and how you could do
that is via messaging you could do it
via email or you could be do it via an
app okay so you have different ways of
getting your content out there to people
okay so as an example you can use
basically SMS or instant messaging via
mobile devices to promote your product
or service here's another example of a
mobile marketing via app install and so
you can even compound that by running a
say Google ad as an example and running
your Google ad on say just mobile you
could do a bit adjustment just for
mobile and the goal could be app
installs okay so and you can even do a
mobile or app extension so there's lots
of ways to really promote your app or
your product or your service Via mobile
marketing okay let's talk about the
customer life cycle so we know why we
want to do digital marketing we want to
know we want we know what the digital
marketing channels are because we just
talked about them from SEO to social to
affiliate to mobile to content to sem
okay you have a lot of different digital
marketing channels at your disposal so
now how do we go ahead and approach our
customers so that's what we're going to
talk about first so we're going to talk
about different stages of the customer
life cycle okay and the first one is the
awareness stage so we need to get our
customers aware of what we're selling or
what we're promoting okay so the
awareness stage is really what product
does your brand offer that's a question
we want to get out there and we want to
answer okay what does a customer need
your product or excuse me why does a
customer need your product that's a
question we want to answer with digital
marketing okay what solution does your
product provide okay that's an answer to
a question we want to make sure people
understand so these are questions that
we want to be able to answer in the form
of digital marketing whether that be
mobile or content okay so getting our
information out there that answers these
essential questions and if we could do
that then somebody's going to become
aware of our product or service okay so
what product is brand offer why does a
customer need it and what solution does
it provide okay those are some key
questions that people tend to ask
themselves when they look at a brand
okay and when they look at a product hey
do I really need this is it going to
help me in my life okay and who who is
selling this I mean who was this brand I
mean that's those are just things that
run through people's mind intuitively
that with the right messaging the right
channel the right type of asset the
right targeted audience you can quickly
make somebody aware of your Brand's
product or service in this stage it's
help potential customers discover your
brand with the help of these different
marketing channels so in the awareness
stage you know content is key so it's to
me if we have a website we need a Blog
because if somebody does come to our
blog from say organic search SEO then we
can write about that product or service
via blog and and talk to our customer
Custer talk directly to our targeted
audience through that blog and if we're
not ranking organically we can use paid
search to promote it because paid search
on Google for example basically we can
be right at the top of those search
results and so somebody can actually see
it when they do a search because we know
millions of people you search on a daily
basis you could do social media
marketing okay so you can publish that
product or service on Facebook while
you're building your community and you
use affiliate marketing to help get the
word out by using cj.com as an example
build up a Salesforce of people these
Publishers that are going to put your
product or service out there so to me in
the awareness stage these are the the
digital marketing channels you could
focus on now I will say one thing about
display ads display is part of search
engine marketing you could use display
because you can reach a large number of
people so even though it's list here low
priority in the awareness stage display
ADS mean that if you're go on Google's
Display Network you could pick and
choose your sites your demographics
keywords topics an audience you can
focus on all those different
demographics to really attract a large
number of people so low priority but
it's probably also good to focus on in
the awareness stage so content marketing
you must create a high quality content
that people searching for without
content it's hard to get found and so to
me this is you know where the blog comes
in SEO take that content get it
optimized okay ASM if we're not ranking
organically we can make sure we're the
top of the paid search results or the
the search results for particular
keyword we want to be found for and then
social media marketing using different
channels depending on the channel we're
selling you know training like simply
learn does you know LinkedIn is a good
platform for us okay and then affiliate
you know basically building up a nice
network of Publishers to get the word
out so these are all good channels that
we can focus in on so traffic sources
may include paid unpaid social referral
display email or direct so they they
they could come in the awareness stage
from all different types of channels
even though you're focused on content I
mean you could still get traffic from
mobile or email so now that we got the
word out via all these different
marketing channels there's that
consideration stage so you know people
are aware of us now they're considering
us and that's kind of the next stage in
the process okay so a few essential
questions to address on the
consideration stage hey what features
make your product valuable to others and
how will I increase customer engagement
towards my product so those are answers
to questions you want to ask okay what
features make your your product valuable
you want to basically separate yourself
from the competition basically that's
what you're trying to answer okay so if
you're promoting your product or service
on paid search and other people are
bidding on the same keyword how are you
going to stand out and then how will I
increase customer engagement towards my
product so for example if you're on
Facebook okay and you're trying to get
people over to your site to purchase
your product then how you going to
improve that engagement you got to
create something really snazzy or really
it's going to be attention grabbing or
something that's going to get them to
become aware of it that's going to
separate your post from all the other
posts that are in somebody's Facebook
Newsfeed okay so you really have to work
hard to really convince somebody to get
their consideration towards your product
or service so in this stage your
customer considers your product so help
them understand how your product is
valuable okay to me email works really
good here because if you have a targeted
audience this gives you the opportunity
to really answer this questions in that
particular Channel email you could
support that with a promotion and
display I think display is a good option
here too because even though you know
people are trying to become aware you
know you can really hone in and really
get them to take that next step okay
with display you can even do remarketing
so if somebody's been to your site
because they're aware of your product
they're curious you can cookie them and
remarket to them via display so display
to me is a good a good channel to use
here okay so you have email mobile
display you know semm these are all you
know good channels to use on the
consideration stage especially on search
because somebody's looking for something
and they're aware of your brand then you
have the good opportunity to get them to
click on your ad especially if you're
offering a promotion and get them to
convert the goal here is to increase our
engagement so people are aware we're
moving them further along the funnel
with email marketing we have the
opportunity to promote the product by
sending an email directly to our
audience so with this stage plan your
campaigns around welcom emails
newsletters we can talk about product
descriptions add ratings and reviews in
the email you know we really just want
to encourage people to purchase the
product that's we're trying to sway them
over so email is a good source to allow
us to do that so with mobile marketing
we can promote the products by sending
relevant messages to our target audience
display again retargeting because we can
retarget an audience that has been to
our website already did some research
about our brand our product or service
and now we're going to reach back out to
them to sway them so remember we want to
encourage customers to buy a product by
creating detailed articles about the
product that always helps and that's
content okay we want to opt for a
customer testimonial okay that helps
sway people and add some guest blogging
okay we can have ambassadors blog on our
behalf or we can go out and blog on
somebody else's site okay so blogging
works both ways it's ways of of showing
yourself and telling people hey we know
you're looking for this product here's
why you want to choose us okay moving on
from the consideration to the purchase
stage so they're aware of you they're
considering you and now we're on to the
purchase stage so the questions we want
to really make sure we address here are
how are my prices compared to my
competitors and is my brand more
credible than others okay so they're
considering you but that price point and
it may not even be the price it could be
the shipping for example the price could
be good but the shipping cost could be
high so you really want to do some due
diligence and research on what your
competitors are doing credibility that
goes back to the consideration stage and
testimonials you want to make sure you
have reviews and testimonials to really
Elevate what you're trying to tell
customers and that that is hey I have a
good brand I have a good product I have
a good service come buy my stuff come
buy my product and service but you
really need to support that claim you
just can't go out and say it and so
supporting that comes in the form of
what other people say and that could be
reviews that could be comments on a
social media platform it could be you
know stars on say Yelp or Google my
business you know make sure you do you
due diligence and make sure you get
people to you know review you or provide
testimonials because people are going to
do their due diligence before they
purchase especially if it's on Google my
business or Yelp or Trip Advisor or
whatever it is you're trying to sell
they're going to be able to see those
reviews and so do your due diligence to
get the reviews and if it is a negative
review hey that's okay you can't please
everyone you're going to get them that's
the world we live in just make sure you
show your upper hand and respond even to
the negative as well as the positive
reviews that you get that actually
bodess well to some people because hey
it shows that I made a mistake and
you're willing to correct it and so
people actually see that that could be
the Tipping Point to getting them to
purchase say look hey this brand really
cares because they're really responding
to people they're not ignoring
negativity okay just the small things
that can get people to change their mind
now with the purchase stage according to
e consultancy 83% of the online audience
require encouragement to complete a
purchase encouragement what does that
mean well could mean providing a promo
giving them that extra incentive you
know if you don't offer promo consider
it especially on the email and the
example we looked at earlier sending out
an email means that if the promo is
going to end at midnight send that email
out and tell people they have until
midnight and if they purchase today
you'll leave it increase it to 20% and
email is a good channel for that mobile
can reach a lot of people through sms
okay social media reaching people
instantaneously and then you know with
the purchase stage it gives Pro
Prospects an offer to help them make
that purchase so you have plenty of
channels to choose from in fact most of
these channels the only one really that
doesn't fit the instantaneous mode is
SEO but you can really focus on
affiliate even though that's a little
priority here you can really you know
coordinate with your Publishers who
especially those Publishers that have
proven their worth and have sold your
products in the past you know get them
to help promote it and incentivize their
audience so let's move on from the
purchase to the P post purchase stage so
this is after somebody
purchases okay so some essential
questions we want to be able to address
here so what additional product could my
customer buy now that they're my
customer what else could I sell them
what you know without being too pushy
could if they buy a coat will a hat work
or a pair of gloves or you know a blouse
you know you want to be able to you not
push a product on a customer but think
about how you can complement that
purchasers that purchasers or customer's
product and then how to improve the
customer buying experience so again this
goes back to you know what we just said
about reviews get somebody to offer a
review and if they don't give you a full
compliment of five stars they only give
you three in a half stars then you know
what that's great feedback because then
you can learn from that and then the
other question is will the customer
refers to others and if so why so that's
definitely something you want to be able
to address in the post purchase stage so
let's take a look here so with post
purchasing stage you know to me emails
at the top of this list because if
somebody purchases something you can
send a nice thank you email because if
they purchase they're giving you their
email in return because you're likely
going to be sending them the receipt via
email so email to me is a nice Channel
sending a nice message even you know
social media you know you can thank your
community for supporting you on this
recent campaign that you ran you know
even throw in an extra five or 10% on a
future purchase as a thank you and
that's easily done on social media you
know you could even post a blog you know
promoting you know the success of a
product and then offering a promotion
okay so there's a lot of things you
could be doing here on the post
purchasing stage so to me even looking
at content again you could even you know
put a survey together you could even put
a survey together for your Affiliates
okay you could even post a poll on
Facebook so it's just working in with
these different channels to get some
feedback about your product and service
so with email mobile you can engage
customers with followup emails or
customer care content you know with
mobile if you have somebody's mobile
number hey text them a simple thank you
goes a long way you know you could say
hey look if you're satisfied let us know
give us a call you can even in the E
mobile text message you can put a link
to a survey send emails to active
subscribers give rewards for customer
feedback so if somebody does provide
feedback give them an extra 10% off you
know you want to be able to reward
loyalty loyalty comes in the form of a
partnership if you're giving somebody
discounts and you have a good product or
service then they're going to recognize
that they're going to say hey look I
really like this product and they're
giving me 10% I'm going to go ahead and
purchase from these guys again so give
those discounts to those active
customers or on the affiliate now or
give referral opportunities to your
customers so if it's an affiliate
publisher hey if they're getting people
to your site you know reward them or if
it's an email and you put a for to a
friend get an extra 10% off it doesn't
hurt because you're incentivizing people
to help you sell your product so with
social display and content use those
banner ads or use that content that you
display on social or the blog you're
going to write to give customers advice
in order to maximize the value of the
purchase so again you can use these
platforms to also enhance uh what they
purchased so hey you just purchased this
product thank you very much did you know
you could do this this and this with it
and so that's the idea of a post-p
purchase stage is to maximize these
channels to be able to answer those
essential questions about what else
could they purchase you know do they
like how do I be get these people to
become loyal customers okay so with the
first purchase stage if a customer has
bought a pair of sports shoes for
example running shoes you can recommend
cross product sale a cross sale it could
be a pair of shorts or a water bottle or
an accessory with an exclusive discount
so that's another example what you can
do on the postp purchase stage so in
today's world everywhere you go it's all
about digital so today lecture is going
to be about all the different marketing
channels available piece them together
kind of put together a little digital
marketing course for you so first off
before we get started we're going to
talk about what is digital marketing and
really digital marketing covers a lot of
areas it's very Broad and really what it
refers to is just marketing that a
company does a person does an individual
a group an organization and they do it
in the form of an electronic device or
with the aid of the internet that's
really what digital marketing is it's
just having something digitally not
something tangible like a billboard or
newspaper or TV and with that there are
lots of places where you can apply
digital marketing and and so electronic
devices we think of mobile devices and
so you could certainly use mobile as a
form of digital marketing or to help you
with your marketing efforts digitally
okay you can create apps you can run
advertising on mobile you can
communicate with different people your
target audience via different devices
like WhatsApp and messaging okay uh
there's also search engines search
engines is where a lot of people get
their information from at least start to
do their research to get information you
got social media lots of different
social media platforms all the way from
you know tweeting to blogging to social
sharing to social content okay so a lot
of of platforms under the bucket social
media you also have traditional forms of
digital marketing like email you can use
different email platforms to send out
emails so lots of different ways to
communicate your product your service
your message to a large number of people
that are really targeted to your efforts
how is digital marketing useful well we
know it provides different metrics why
do we know it provides different metrics
because it's all digital okay so anytime
you send out an email or post something
on Facebook you're going to get data
back when you get data back you could
take that data to determine how well
that post or that email performed and if
it didn't perform up to expectation you
can make changes to improve performance
that's called optimization okay so
that's the great thing about digital
marketing it's useful in that we get
data in some cases instantaneously and
we're able to make changes in order to
optimize that campaign we can also you
know provide personalized user
experience so meaning if we know who our
targeted audience is on say Twitter or
LinkedIn or Facebook we can really cater
our messaging to that group probably
most importantly is that digital
marketing compared to traditional forms
of marketing allow us to really reach a
global audience very easily very easily
at a very low cost that's the key so if
I want to Target people in India or or
Nepal or Pakistan I can certainly do
that and I can do that with the snap of
a campaign and I can get data back and
based on the data I can tailor that
experience even better really just
allows us to really hone in on a
particular audience anywhere in the
world very quickly so these are just
three of the main reasons why digital
marketing is useful some other
experiences or uses for digital
marketing again it provides a coste
effective alternative to traditional
marketing so you know for those that are
familiar with purchasing advertising on
say TV or radio you have to pick a spot
you have to pick a program and then pick
a time slot associated with that program
so somebody's watching a program and and
that program tends to draw in a specific
target audience then you want to show
your ad around the time when that
program is slotted to air on TV uh
because you know you're likely going to
reach your audience however to purchase
that time slot could be competitive and
could be very costly where there are
forms of of advertising and paying for
advertising digitally and those forms
are cost per click or cost per
impression and so using a cost per click
or cost impression model allows you to
really go head-to-head in kind of an
auction style format where you could
control how much you pay and potentially
get that Prime spot in front of your
target audience so it really does become
cost effective and it allows you to make
small Investments to get a really
substantial return on Ri so let's just
say your cost per click is only 10 cents
but you're selling a product for $10
well all you need is one click and one
sale to generate a very substantial
return on investment and so knowing that
you get metrics back on a campaign you
could slowly or quickly optimize that
campaign towards a very positive Roi
then another use for digital marketing
it just enables targeting users based on
their actions and preferences so again
we can really hone in on who we want to
Target it really depends on the platform
but if you take Google ads for example
and you want to Target the Display
Network well we know we have
demographics we know we have topics we
know we have interest we know we have
retarget audiences in segment audiences
we have age we have gender so you have a
lot of options available to choose from
to really hone in on who you want to
Target and and we talk about remarketing
is another form of digital marketing so
you can set up a remarketing campaign so
if somebody comes to your website and
does not purchase the product or service
that you're offering you could take
action on that behavior so I can
retarget a group of people who didn't
purchase that's retargeting or you can
do it via remarketing and basically
that's the beauty of digital marketing
allows you to really Target users based
on on their actions some other uses for
digital marketing it helps build brand
awareness and reputation of your
business so when we say brand awareness
if you're just launching a company and
nobody knows who you are if we use
Google ads as our preferred method of
digital marketing and establishing
campaigns we can choose that Display
Network that Display Network on Google
ads reaches a large amount of people so
you can really get your name out there
and really Target your tended audience
and allow that targeted in tended
audience to really understand who you
are because they're going to see your ad
in the form of a banner or in the form
of a video or in the form of text and so
that's the beauty of digital marketing
you can really reach a lot of people and
a lot of people who might be interested
in your product or service and then
digital marketing provides a platform
for you to be interactive with your
audience helping you stay relevant and
competitive and the best example I can
give here is YouTube and so YouTube's a
really it's a search engine for videos
but it's a video sharing platform and so
if I upload a video then I can entice
people to comment on that video or like
the video or share the video and I can
really interact with that Audience by
responding to their comments or you know
putting together a playlist or giving
them more videos okay so I can read
really interact with my audience and I
could do that on multiple platforms not
just YouTube and video I can blog and
and interact based on somebody's
comments I can have a website and have
live chat and interact with my audience
so there's lots of different ways to
interact with an audience and that's
what digital marketing provides so I
already mentioned a few examples based
on the uses of digital marketing I
mentioned Google's Display Network I
mentioned YouTube and blogging and
social media platforms like Facebook
well there are lots of different types
of digital marketing channels out there
and we're going to talk about a few of
them today we're going to start with
search engine optimization and so search
engine optimization as you probably know
from the name involves search engine and
it involves really making your site
relevant in the eyes of that search
engine so if you're in the United States
you know that Google has a large market
share meaning a lot of people use Google
on a daily basis so we want to make sure
we do everything we can to optimize our
site in order to make our site relevant
for those coveted keywords now why do we
want to make ourselves relevant for
those coveted keywords that we want to
be found for on search well because a
lot of people use search and when a lot
of people use search and you're found
for those keyword queries then it's
going to increase the flow of organic
traffic to your website so the high
higher you rank in theory the more
traffic you're going to get and so when
we talked about optimization okay how do
we optimize our site in order to be
relevant in the eyes of Google well it
really comes down to a two-pronged
approach you have onpage SEO you have
off-page SEO onpage has everything to do
with your website in order to make it
relevant off-page has everything to do
with your website but not on your
website it means that how can we become
relevant by linking to other websites
for example how can we become relevant
by getting our content on other
platforms so we become relevant in the
eyes of Google so that's off-page SEO so
SEO is always going to be two-prong what
you do on your website and what you do
off the website to make sure your
website your domain whatever that domain
is.com or.org is relevant in the eyes of
Google and so let's take a look at on
page SEO first so like I mentioned it
involves optimizing your website and
when we say optimizing your website
there's a lot of things you can do on
your website to make it relevant in the
eyes of Google and we can look at the
content okay we can look at the source
code and so there are a lot of different
components to be looked at here so you
have the header tag you have the meta
description you have the alt tag you
have how fast your page loads you have
internal linking you have a sit map you
have a lots of different things going on
here and so for me one of the first
things you should do when you create a
page on your website is to make sure the
title tag is unique and includes those
keyword so if we look here at this
example the title tag is important
because that's what shows up in search
results here you can see the title tag
on Google is up to 65 characters so you
always want to include that key word in
the title tag then you have your URL and
then you have what you call a meta
description so that's underneath the URL
underneath the title tag and again this
is in search results so organic search
results somebody types in a keyword you
want to be found and you want your title
tag to stick out and you want your meta
description to specifically describe
what it is you're offering okay so again
if somebody's looking for stock imagery
then you want to make sure that you know
that person who's looking for stock
imagery can come to your website and
they can in this case search for
millions of royalty free stock images
photos videos and music and so you want
your description to really get that
person to click on your listing an
organic search that's the whole point so
that's the point of a title tag and a
meta description is you really want to
be found for what somebody's searching
for and you want to be able to show them
that you have what they're looking for
you have something here underneath your
organic search results called site links
and site links are just other or links
to pages on your website and so
unfortunately this is not necessarily in
your control this is in the control of
Google so if Google wants to offer up
site links underneath your title tag and
meta description they will add them and
it's based really on the amount of
content you have and that goes with site
search so you can see also there's site
search there underneath the meta
description all of that is contingent
upon your website do you have a lot of
content and if you have a lot of
relevant content then Google will
naturally add in site links underneath
your organic listing to links to other
pages on your site so that's onpage SEO
and now we're going to look at off-page
SEO okay so off-page SEO involves using
promotional methods Beyond just optim in
your site for example optimizing your
title tag and meta description might not
be enough to get you to rank for that
coveted keyword query so we need to do
some link building we need to get our
name out there on other websites okay so
we need to be able to establish some
external links or back links from high
quality relevant sites to our site and
it may not just necessarily have to be a
link CU Google recognizes link l
backlinks so just having a reference on
a high quality site may be good enough
to get you in the eyes of Google to
become more relevant okay so that's
off-page SEO in definition so really
what we want to do is we want to
establish a way to get links from other
websites to our own or references on
other websites to our website we want to
build those links to help us gain in
ranking so there's lots of ways to do
that you have social media again you
have social content sites like Reddit
medium Kora you have blogging okay
there's lots of ways to establish
yourself out there on the internet you
just need to make sure their quality sit
and you need to make sure they're
relevant and so when you do get a link
on an external site pointing back to
yours you want to make sure it's a
follow so you want to make sure that
Google knowes to follow that link from
that site to yours so if you're out
there establishing content on a third
party website or another website and
they're going to link back to you just
make sure that it's a follow do follow
not a no follow okay and I'm going to
show you an example of what that looks
like here so if you're not sure what the
difference is here I'm on backlinko
docomo follow versus a do follow is
simply in the H rep so so in the href if
you don't have anything in there other
than the link then the search engines
are going to follow that link from that
external site to yours and if you have a
no follow in that link then the search
engines are going to ignore the link so
you're not going to pick up the back
link or external link to your site and
that's simply that site just adding the
re equals no follow okay so if you see
that in the link pointing to your site
from that external site then that means
you're not going to get credit for that
backlink so you always want to shoot for
a do follow link because that means
you're going to get credit for the
backlink okay so again do follow links
allows search Eng and crawlers to follow
the link and if they can follow it
you're going to get what they call link
juice and that's going to establish some
reputation to your domain a no follow
link basically doesn't allow the search
engines to follow that link so it
doesn't pass on the link juice now again
search engines like Google are smart
enough to pick up the association
between a website that talks about your
website and your website so meaning if
you don't have a link and you don't have
a if you have a no follow link on that
site don't fret because you know Google
has come a long way they're not
necessarily focused on on links though
it does help so for example if you are
on a very prominent site and there's no
link then you still may get credit
because Google does recognize linkless
backlinks and that's what they call a
linkless backlink is just having a
reference on that site but you always
want to try and get that follow not the
do not follow okay so here you can see
an example of off-page SEO okay like
Trip Advisor would be a good example a
link that redirects from Trip Advisor to
you know the OA magazine as an example
so the opra magazine is going to get a a
back link from Trip Advisor to the site
so if Google crawls Trip Advisor then
they're going to be able to see this
link and if it's a follow link they're
going to give the oer magazine that
domain credit from Trip Advisor so for
SEO because there's a two-pronged
approach involved you have on page and
off page there a lot of tools here a lot
of tools so let's take a look at some of
these tools we're going to look at
Google Keyword Planner we're going to
look at M HRS look at some tools that
will help you with both on page and
off-page SEO so let's start with
Google's Keyword Planner so why are we
using Google's Keyword Planner because
we want to find keywords okay so we
can't do onpage SEO we can't optimize
our title tag and metag description
without a good keyword that we want to
be found for so what we want to do is we
want to go into Google ads now that's a
payperclick platform okay so if you want
to be found via paid search you're going
to use Google ads but for an organic
search perspective we can use Google's
Keyword Planner so we need a Google ads
account if we have a Google ads account
then all we need to do is go to tools
then we need to go to Keyword Planner
and the Keyword Planner is a good tool
because it allows us to find those
coveted keywords so we can discover new
keywords and that's exactly what we're
going to do so for example we're going
to find you know use the keyword mail
delivery if we have a a business that
delivers meils to people what keywords
do we want to optimize for so we're
going to be in Google ads we're going to
go go to tools we're going to go to
Keyword Planner we're going to discover
new keywords and we're simply just going
to type in a keyword so we're going to
click get results and Google's Keyword
Planner is basically going to give us
some information so the key word we
chose was mail delivery and they're
telling us that on average over the last
12 months there's
22,200 search queries on average over
the last 12 months okay so I could see
if I click hover over the graph here I'm
going to be able to see the average over
12 months okay so here I could see the
average over 12 months from July to June
2019 so here what do I want to do I want
to look for Trends because you here I
can see the averages go up and down a
little bit but 22,200 is the average
over 12 months and then Google's Keyword
Planner also tells me how competitive
that keyword is so if it's highly
competitive but it's got a lot of search
volume it could be a keyword I may want
to cover it but the beauty of the
Keyword Planner is that they also give
you other keywords to look at okay so
mail delivery service is
49,500 okay so here you got some other
ones best food delivery service
99,900 again some of these are very
competitive but some of them aren't and
so you want to be able to do your due
diligence do some analysis and figure
out what keywords work best for you that
aren't going to be competitive but at
the same time
give you some search volume so if you do
rank for that keyword you should expect
x amount of clicks on that keyword based
on the volume so that's Google's Keyword
Planner alternatively you can use a tool
like moz.com so if I log into Moz they
have a tool called keyword Explorer and
so here I can just type in that same
keyword mail delivery targeting the
United States in English
and Moz is going to give me some
information on the keyword so here
they're going to give me a range in
terms of the monthly volume and they're
going to give me a difficulty score so
they're going to tell me how difficult
this keyword is so out of a score of 100
it's 53 and they're going to tell me
what my expected click the rate could be
if I'm ranking for that keyword more
importantly they're going to give me
some other keyword suggestions just like
Google's Keyword Planner so here I can
see prepared mail delivery mail delivery
service mail delivery companies so there
are a lot of different suggestions of
keywords that I can choose from and if
we scroll down we could see basically
some Mansions we could see the analysis
who's ranking for these keywords so we
can really get some insight as to who's
ranking how much volume how difficult it
is what my estimates could be if I'm
ranking Etc so a lot of information
built into mz's keyword Explorer tool so
maz's keyword Explorer tool could be a
good option for you if you don't have
access to Google ads and Google's
Keyword Planner so if you're working on
SEO for a website and you're curious is
about what the off-page SEO situation
looks like well you can use a tool like
HRS it's a free tool you can go here if
you're working on a specific domain and
you're focused on off page you could
simply type in that domain here here and
then you can check the back links for
that domain okay so I'm going to go
ahead and type in my my domain and now
I'm going to get a sense of what my
backlink profile is for my domain so
here I can see the number of back links
the total back links and notice 85% of
them are due follow links so Google is
able to recognize those links and then I
can see referring domains so I have
124 different domain
pointing to my website and so here I can
get a snapshot of the top 100 backlinks
pointing to my website and so this just
gives me a snapshot of what's going on
with my off-page SEO performance again
it's a free tool it's good to use
because it gives you an idea of what
your off-page SEO situation looks like
okay another tool you could use is
pingdom okay you can set up a free trial
here it's good for 14 days and it allows
you to you know look at page speed it
allows you to monitor the site itself in
terms of you know visitors maintenance
Etc so you can use pingdom as well uh
however it's only a 14-day free trial
but it does give you some good insights
into SEO now page low time is one of
those on page SEO factors and so if
you're doing on page SEO for domain you
certainly want to go into Google
analytics and you want to measure the
page load performance of the pages on
your website and so here if I go to
Google analytics and then I go to
behavior and I go to site speed and I go
to speed suggestions here I could see
the pages how many pages I've received
over a period of time and then the
average page load time now if you see
the average page low time is slow and in
my opinion anything over 2 to 3 seconds
is going to be slow you need to be able
to take action and so the great thing
about Google analytics the page low time
reporting is it actually gives you some
suggestions so page speed suggestions so
all you need to do is click on the link
here in this case this particular link
or URL on my website has seven
suggestions if I click on that then page
speed insides is going to open up and
what's going to happen is Google
analytics SL pagee insights is going to
analyze this page and give me some
feedback on how the page is performing
not only on desktop but on mobile as
well and so here I can see if I analyze
this page I can see some of the
opportunities to improve the page load
time on desktop and again on mobile here
so here you could see a lot of the
opportunities and a lot of the issues I
have that I can address now if you're
going to manage SEO for a website then
you're going to need an SEO platform so
again m is a good example because we
showed you the keyword Explorer but they
also have many other tools available
built right into the platform for
example rankings okay you can get crawl
information so when the Bots crawl the
side what kind of errors are coming up
here I can get some page optimization so
I can choose a keyword and I could
choose a page and Moz is going to be
able to give me feedback to see what
more I could do to improve my on page
SEO performance okay we mentioned
keyword explore in terms of looking for
keywords okay you also have something
called link Explorer as well so if I go
back and choose link Explorer from my
list here then I'm going to go to a link
Explorer and I can type in any domain
again just like on the H reps except
mods goes a little bit deeper here okay
so they're telling me how many linking
domains and what my keywords are ranking
okay and then I have some other reports
that I can leverage for off-page SEO I
can look at spam scores for certain
websites that are linking to me because
you can disavow yourself from being
associated with those sites here here
you got a link intersect tool so you can
compare one domain against another to
what links are pointing to that other
website so a lot of different reports
and tools available to you for off page
SEO under moz's link Explorer so Moz has
a lot of different tools available and
again my recommendation if you don't use
Moz there's sem rush there's bright Edge
there's a lot of SEO platforms out there
to use but if you're to focus on SEO you
are going to need an SEO platform now if
you have any more questions on SEO you
feel free to go to Simply learns YouTube
account you'll be able to find a video
there for SEO tutorial for beginners you
know take a look at the video it goes
really in depth about everything we just
covered about onpage and off-page SEO so
take a look at the video and if you have
any comments about everything we covered
with se50 free to comment underneath
this video here and we'll be sure to
respond accordingly uh especially if you
have any tips and tricks that you do for
SEO so let's move from search engine
optimization to content marketing and so
content marketing is a form of marketing
that involves simulating interest in a
Brand's products or Services by creating
and sharing online material so when we
talk about online material that can come
in many forms or assets say some
examples are blogs videos
infographics case studies white papers
ebooks all of this is content generated
it's just in different forms and so you
want to be able to take any one of these
forms of content and be able to
distribute that in some form or fashion
okay so for example blog can be part of
your website a video could be something
you upload to Youtube an infographic
could be something you actually share on
LinkedIn so all these other assets could
be integrated throughout they could be
shared or used on your website okay for
people to grab and share and use and
comment on okay so that's what content
marketing is you need to be able to push
out content so that people have a better
understanding of your product or service
the process of content marketing is you
really want to decide what goal you want
to achieve with your cont content
marketing campaign you want to Define
your buyer personas to determine the
audience best suited for your content
okay so what are you creating who is it
for and then you want to run content
audience to determine the best type of
content that can be used and when we
talk about content audits we're talking
about you know content that's already
been posted are people sharing it are
people downloading or people viewing it
and so you want to be able to understand
over time what people are reacting to so
that you can reuse or continue to use
that content that seems to resonate with
your target audience so you want to
choose an appropriate content management
system so if it's a Blog you want to use
WordPress maybe so you want to start
brainstorming for ideas for new content
ideas so in my opinion maybe put
together a Content calendar and jot some
ideas on that content calendar then you
want to settle on a particular type of
content you want to create and then you
want to be able to publish and manage
your content so some to popular tools
use for Content marketing you you have
buffer you have Buzz Sumo follower Wong
cotu so let's go ahead and take a look
at an example of a Content marketing
management system and we're going to use
WordPress and so if we go into WordPress
here on the back end we're logging a log
in and so the reason why we use
WordPress is because we post blogs so in
WordPress if I go to post here I'm going
to be able to see all the different post
that have been posted over a period of
time and the great thing about WordPress
is you can optimize it for SEO so if I
go in here and look at this recent blog
post that has been posted I can go ahead
and edit it and when I edit it okay I'm
going to be able to look at this blog
post in a visual format and and I can
also look at it in HTML form so notice I
the great thing about WordPress is I can
use imagery I can insert videos I can
insert
infographics I can attach a white paper
case study to it and then again we have
something called y SEO plugin so we've
installed a plugin here so that'll help
us with optimizing that particular blog
post for that particular keyword we're
trying to Target and so here you can see
our Focus keyword is remarketing and
retargeting okay so we have that in the
title tag okay we also want to make sure
it's in the meta description and so here
we have an internal link we have it in
the
introduction okay we have it you know
spread throughout the content so Yos
does a good job of allowing us to make
sure we're integrating that keyword into
our blog post but the key to blog
posting is we want to again follow the
process we want to be able to choose
content for our intended audience and in
this case with a blog post we can write
up to you know 500 to 3,000 keywords and
the whole point is we're trying to
introduce our audience to a particular
topic that resonates with our product or
service and so that's the great thing
about blogging that's the great thing
about WordPress is that you know very
easy to use uh you can integrate it with
SEO you obviously have commenting you
have different plugins that you can add
in there uh very easy to edit and so
there a lot you can do here with
WordPress and blogging so another
example of content marketing is video so
with video you have the ability to
upload this video to popular video sites
like YouTube or video and you can
optimize that particular video with
title tags and and hashtags and
descriptions and you could see the
interaction here so you can see how many
views how many likes shares the ability
to share the ability of people for
saving it and there's just a lot of
interactivity when you have video you
can also use video as I mentioned on
your blogging platform if it's WordPress
you can also use video in social media
platforms like Twitter link in and
Facebook so video is a very popular form
of content marketing lots of good video
tools out there to create a video a high
quality video is what you want to put
your product and service in the best
Forefront okay so that people can react
they can share they can comment they can
follow they can like okay so that's what
you want to do is think about video
because video is very versatile and
Powerful in terms of getting your
message out there so let's move from
content marketing to social media
marketing and social media marketing
really involves creating content if it's
that blog if it's that video that you
created for Content marketing and really
using different platforms to increase
your visibility whether that be traffic
whether it be engagement whether it be
brand awareness or any other marketing
goals that you have that's what social
media is good for because social media
will take that content take what you're
trying to get out there and really allow
you to hone your marketing goals against
that okay so if it's Facebook and you
got some videos that you want to post up
there okay what's your goal is your goal
to then post a video to get traffic to
your website or to build brand awareness
or to just get people to react by
sharing or liking and so that's what
social media is good for it's really
good for taking content and really
Distributing it to your target audience
okay so uh sharing content allows you to
you know generate user generated content
or it allows you to create interactive
content and again you can use
infographics or you can apply content
with imagery or post videos or do things
that are interactive like polling and
contest so a lot of flexibility in terms
of the content that you could share on
social media and so you want to
establish a process for social media
marketing so this is the digital
marketing course of it so you want to be
able to have a process and you want to
be able to set up goals that you want to
achieve with your social media campaign
because just posting content for Content
sake is really not going to generate
anything for you so you want to set up
those goals ahead of time then you want
to understand what content would be best
suited for your target audience so if
our goal is to generate brand awareness
then maybe an infographic is what we
want to do okay maybe that's the best
choice of asset for our target audience
based on the platform with social media
we also want to research what the
competition is and find out what works
for them so it's very easy to do on
social so if you already have a
competitor on Facebook you can always go
to your competitor's website and you can
always see you know what they're posting
and what kind of reaction engagement
they're getting for a particular post so
it doesn't help before you go live to do
some due diligence about your
competition you can also conduct a
social media audit and again what we
mean by audit just like on the content
side we want to be able to see what's
worked and what's not worked in the past
and with digital marketing recall you
can get instant metrics back so if you
posted something last year and you're
thinking about posting it again you
probably want to do an audit to see oh
over the past year what posts have
worked and have not worked for you then
you want to pick and choose the social
media channels or platforms and to find
a strategy for each of them because if
you have a video then the video may work
on say YouTube or Instagram but they not
necessarily work for LinkedIn and
Twitter and so you want to be able to
pick and choose the asset the strategy
and align it with the appropriate
platform then you want to take big
inspiration from case studies and other
famous Brands so again continue to learn
I mean that's the beauty of social media
marketing most big companies
medium-sized companies even smaller
companies that have performed well are
out on social media so take a look at
some other companies that inspire you or
some other companies in your industry or
even again your competitors and see what
they're doing and what they're posting
and what kind of Engagement they're
getting so you should always you know be
able to seek out what others are doing
on social and to me this is important
create a social media content calendar
and this isn't necessarily the very end
of the process this goes back to the
beginning of the process so when you're
establishing goals and you're
establishing what kind of type of
content you want to use that should all
be part of a social media content
calendar and I'm going to show you an
example one here shortly and then again
you want to be able to test evaluate and
adjust your strategy because again
you're getting metrics and if you post a
video on Facebook and it's taking off
then meaning in terms of likes and
shares you probably want to consider
maybe doing another one that complements
that so here's a broad example of a
Content calendar again it's in a
spreadsheet Again by no means do one
size fits all but just to give you an
idea if we're blogging what we want to
do is we want to pick our Target on
audience maybe that be country or
particular demographic and you want to
come up with some topics ahead of time
here and you want to maybe put the
status up there of you know it's just a
draft or an idea or when it actually
does go live you want to turn it on live
you want to pick your date add some
comments okay create your content and
you know what's good about a Content
calendar you can also work in SEO so you
can assign keywords and then you could
add those keywords theas for ranking uh
you can create your title and meta
description then you can carry that
content forward and choose a particular
social media platform to post to so
that's the beauty of a social or excuse
me a Content calendar is it allows you
to think about things up front and then
prepare the content accordingly so you
can optimize it for organic search and
post it on social media for off-page SEO
and for social media marketing and and
so you just want to get organized ahead
of time using a spreadsheet in this case
Google Sheets to lay out the topics
ahead of time so you can write the
content for your intended audience that
to me is the way to go now remember
there's lots of different forms of
content that you can use with social
media marketing here we have video so
you can see this video could be posted
on YouTube or LinkedIn or wherever and
the whole point is you want to be able
to measure engagement here you can see
this is just an image it's just a file
and this has been posted on Facebook so
here we can see how many likes and
comments and then shares and so you want
to be able to leverage different forms
and different assets across social media
to see actually what works and what
doesn't work and again look at what
other companies have done whether they
be competitors or not see what type of
assets they're posting and what's
working for them now when it comes to
social Med media marketing there are
lots of tools available okay you got
buffer Hoots s sprinkler post planner
later Sprout social I mean the list of
social media marketing tools is endless
and just like SEO you will need a
platform to work with so with SEO we
showed you Moz as the SEO platform with
social we're going to show you sprout
social because with Sprout social if you
have a Content calendar if you have a
lot of different assets you want to be
able to organize those assets and
content across multiple channels and the
great thing about using a social media
calendar is yes you can publish and
organize your post accordingly you also
have most social media platform tools
have listening so you can listen in on
keywords and audiences different brands
and industries and conversations that
are being had about a specific topic
okay and again most social media
platforms if not all have reporting and
so this is important because you can
actually see you know what how your post
or different assets are performing in
terms of Engagement and so to me that's
important if you're going to focus on
social media as a platform as as a
channel you want to have a social media
platform tool that will help you
organize your content publish it
accordingly listen in in and get that
report to help you figure out what's
engaging and what's not engaging again
so that you can you know react to the
content that you're using and sharing so
that's Sprout social as an example but
you will need a social media platform
now the other benefit to social media is
in some cases you could actually pay to
have your post out there and so for
example on Facebook we could set up a
paid camp campaign to Target our
intended audience and so with Facebook
Facebook owns Instagram so you have the
ability to really put your content out
in front of your target audience on
Facebook and Instagram and so what you
need to do is go to Facebook ads manager
and simply just create an account or
campaign um you want to be able to
create a campaign and by creating a
campaign that means you're going to have
to go through a particular process here
so if we first we want to do is choose
our objective okay so you always want to
have an objective for your campaign so
is it going to be brand awareness is it
going to be to drive you know traffic is
it going to be to drive conversions so
you want to choose a goal or objective
if you're advertising really on any
platform then you want to be able to
choose your audience so who are we
trying to Target so with Facebook you
know you can Target any specific age
gender demographic based on interest and
behavior so you can choose specific
placements and you can assign a budget
okay and then on the ad side you have
different types of ads that you can use
you can do single image or video you can
do a carousel okay meaning you can
rotate different images as a collage or
different videos as a collage and again
you can choose exactly where you want
want your ad to be shown for example
desktop or mobile Newsfeed Facebook and
stream video you got Instagram feed you
got even messenger so you have a lot of
options available to you on where your
ad or video is going to be shown and
then you can support that with a
headline description and you can send
that traffic back to your website you
can even test call to action buttons
okay so you can pend your
add with a call to action button and so
you can do a lot here this is just
Facebook you can really do a lot of
specific targeting now with Facebook
advertising it's a cost per click model
so anytime somebody does click on that
ad you're going to pay but it allows you
to really get your content out there in
front of your intended audience if
you're not doing it organically meaning
you're not posting on Facebook on a
regular basis or maybe you want to
supplement those organic post then doing
this is a good way to really get your
brand out there if it's awareness if to
drive traffic or to convert Facebook is
a good option LinkedIn Twitter all these
social media platforms offer that up
that option up to do paid advertising
now if you want more information about
social media we have a great video on
YouTube already how to start social
media marketing it really goes into the
details about organic social and what I
just covered with paage social
specifically on Facebook so take a look
at that video and again if I missed
anything on the social media side feel
free to comment or add in your best
practice whether that be part of the
process or a different platform that you
use for social media okay let's switch
to our next digital marketing channel in
search engine marketing so search engine
marketing is an advertising model that
is good for driving traffic to your site
because you're paying each time someone
clicks on your advertisement now how is
that an equal trade well because you can
advertise on channels like or search
engines like Google or Bing or adroll
which has a a big Network that includes
Google you can actually pay your way to
the top of search engine rankings and so
if you're at the top for paid search and
and somebody searches something like uh
shoes or something to that effect your
ad can appear at the very top even above
local search even above organic search
and so the visibility is there it's a
good way for you to then get that
traffic that uh that you you covet for
certain keywords and because you're
getting traffic or the potential to get
traffic you're going to pay each time
somebody clicks on these ads so you have
multiple choices on the type of asset
you want to use including text image
video Etc so there's more to it than
just Google Bing ad roll I mean you have
LinkedIn you have Twitter you have
Facebook you have lots of different ways
to advertise and get your ad in a more
prominent position you just have to pay
for it and I just showed you that under
social media marketing Facebook you can
create an ad have your R targeting your
audience and in return you're going to
pay Facebook works the same way for most
of these networks okay so when you
actually set up a campaign like anything
you do when you set up a campaign you
want to determine the goal you want to
achieve for the campaign you want to do
that upfront especially when you're
talking about paying per click if you're
paying per click then you definitely
want to make sure you determine what
your goals are so you can measure them
accordingly then you want to choose in
in this case a relevant list of keywords
you could do it for your brand meaning
you could choose your own brand keywords
you could choose keywords related to
what your brand is trying to offer
whether that be a service or product and
once you choose a relevant list of
keywords you can finalize those keywords
and then bid on them so once you start
bidding on them then what you're going
to do is align those keywords with a
headline so it's all done within the
framework of any platform you're
advertising on really the key here that
I want to really emphasize is when you
establish a campaign or set up a
campaign you need to establish what the
goal is because when you actually choose
your keywords and write your ads and
launch the campaign and start paying
Google or Bing or whomever it is you're
advertising with you want to be able to
measure those goals so that's really the
important part here because regardless
of where you advertise you're going to
be able to monitor campaign results and
so with Google you can even import
conversions into the campaign so for
example if I go to Google ads for
example if I go to tools okay you can
see I'm running campaigns what am I
trying to accomplish with these
campaigns well in this case I'm trying
to get donations people click on
donations so I can go to tools click
conversions and then I can see what
conversions are added to my account and
that way I can measure my campaigns
against these conversions okay if I
don't see a conversion here I can
certainly create one or import it from
in this case Google analytics so that's
the important thing you want to be able
to measure your campaigns with your
conversions and then just as important
you want to be able to optimize your
campaign because if it's not performing
if you're running a campaign you're
running up cost and you're not getting
conversions you're probably not going to
be continuing to run those camp
campaigns so you want to optimize your
campaign and retarget potential
customers so retargeting is always a
good option retargeting is targeting
someone who that went to your website
and basically acted in a certain way
meaning they went to a certain page or
abandoned a card or actually purchased
or downloaded something okay you define
what action you want that audience to
take in order to retarget to them okay
so the whole point is you can configure
your retargeting campaign based on
certain behavior on your website and the
whole point there ret targeting is
you're pulling people back to your
website so in addition to optimizing you
know search campaigns you can one of the
benefits of search engine marketings you
can run retargeting campaigns so here's
an example of an ad okay so here you
could see it's a good ad in the sense
that it's using everything available to
it so for example
here I could see three headlines so
Google in this example allows you to add
in three headlines so here you can see
simply learn official site get certified
get ahead then you can see simply
learn.com so they're taking advantage of
three headlines and then here you can
see two description lines and so each
description line you're going to have up
to 90 characters and so you want to be
able to take advantage of what Google
gives you the more information you can
add the better well here you can see
some other types of ads here you can see
a banner ad for slack okay here you can
see betterment.com running an ad okay so
this looks like an ad that is on YouTube
so because you could see after a few
seconds you can skip the ad okay so
here's a video ad here's an image ad
here's a text ad so depending on what
platform you advertise on you have an an
option on what type of asset you want to
use you know the one thing I like about
Facebook is they offer up multitude of
options in terms of assets so you can
run a single image ad you can run a
carousel meaning you got a multiple
images you can run a video you can run a
combination video image you can
obviously run text okay with a thumbnail
so you have a lot of options in terms of
the type of AD you can run so before we
move into our next Channel let me just
show you an example of you know how an
ad actually looks on a particular
website so here you can see I'm on but
feed news.com okay here you can see
Volkswagen Golf is running an
advertisement in Spanish on this
particular site so they're either using
Google or some other platform and having
that platform if it's Google post their
ad on this particular site so here you
can see it's a banner ad and if we're in
Google ads and you're setting up a text
ad let me just run through you what that
text ad looks like remember you want to
always take advantage of what's offered
to you because especially text ads you
have very few characters and with very
few characters it's hard to get your
message across so with Google you have
your final URL which is where people are
going to go to after they click on your
ad but you have one not one not two but
three headlines that you can take
advantage of so we're talking about help
end child hunger help today you know you
can always add in visit our website for
more info I mean you want to take
advantage of what's available to you now
again here you can see in this example I
have only allotted 30 characters and so
if you go over then your ads not going
to get approved so you really have to be
cognizant of the character counts and
getting your point across because
writing text ads is not the easiest
thing to do when you're limited to
characters now with Google you have what
they call display path so after the
domain you can add in a couple of
keywords in there and then you have
description line one and description
line too so again take advantage of
what's available if you're not sure what
copied right grab some from the website
and paste it in there you want your ads
to be healthy and to have as much
information as possible and then the one
thing I will say about Google ads is
they also have extensions so extensions
are exactly that they're extensions to
to your text ad so here you can see I
have four extensions these are actually
site links so Google ads offers up
something called add extensions so it
could be call outs site links could be
location extensions app extensions they
have a number of different extensions
that they can append to your ad so take
advantage of that as well remember the
whole point of ads is to make a
compelling case for your product or
service so that somebody can click on
the ad and go to your website and then
perform the action you want them to
perform now if you have any more
questions about Google ads feel free to
check out our indepth video about Google
ads it covers everything a toz on Google
ads you know we also have videos on our
simply learn YouTube playlist for
Facebook uh Twitter social media
marketing so if you're curious to know a
little bit more about SE marketing you
know check out any one of these videos
that we have listed on our YouTube
channel okay so let's move over to
affiliate marketing now and so with
affiliate marketing really it's
interesting and unique and that
affiliate marketing involves paying out
commissions and who are you paying
commissions to well you're paying
commissions to website owners or
Publishers or people who have websites
with lots of content or people who have
websites that attract a lot of users and
so the whole point is you you want to be
able to find those websites to advertise
your product or service okay these
people who are selling your product or
service on your behalf are going to get
commissioned or incentivized based on
whatever action you put out there so it
could be registrations just getting your
Affiliates to help you with getting
people registered or signing up for your
email or you know for a lot of you
conversions you're trying to sell a
product so you want help in selling that
product or it could be subscriptions
okay signing up to something okay so you
determine what it is you want to
incentivize your Affiliates for you also
determine how much you're going to
incentivize them and that's the great
thing about affiliate marketing it's
it's no different than having a sales
team um to support you what are the
stats for affiliate marketing well you
need to find a platform there are lots
of different affiliate platforms out
there you know Commission Junction or
cj.com
comes to mind because these platforms
are going to help you find these
Affiliates or Partners okay so they're
the broker and all this and so once you
set up your platform you're going to
establish rules guidelines post images
and Banners and assets for those
Affiliates to use on their websites and
more importantly again you're going to
establish the commission so the
commission doesn't have to be the same
for all Affiliates it could simply be
you know you know your top Affiliates
get a higher commission as opposed to
just some other Affiliates who get a
starting commission you establish
everything on the platform the affiliate
platform that you choose now Affiliates
apply to advertise on your behalf so
they're going to say hey I'm interested
in selling your product or service so
you're going to use that platform if
it's Commission Junction to approve or
disapprove the Affiliates request to
advertise on your behalf
and really what you want to try and do
is leverage the platform as best as you
can a lot of these Affiliates are out to
make money and some of them are really
good you need to be able to choose the
affiliate that is going to represent
your brand product or service the best
so it's simple customer clicks on an ad
or link okay on that affiliate website
and they go to your website and they
perform an action so that could be a
purchase a registration a subscription a
download an email sign up you determine
that and the great thing is these
affiliate networks the CJs commission
Junctions of the world will record
everything they're Tracking not only
traffic from the affiliate website to
your website but they're also tracking
the conversions the transaction is
validated and credited to the affiliate
by the broker and then the affiliate is
paid his or her commission so that's how
it works so the more the affiliate sells
or converts on your behalf
the more they're going to make and
that's the beauty of the affiliate
Network so here's an example of
affiliate marketing okay here you could
see uh an advertisement here okay so you
could see profit from our experience
earn up to 12% advertising fees with a
trusted e-commerce list leader so
somebody clicks on that link joins and
then this person is going to get a
commission based on somebody joining for
free again mentioned Commission Junction
there are also some other affiliate
marketing tools out there uh ma Amazon
Associates Awin trade doubler Max Bounty
I mean there's there's there's a lot out
there cj.com is the one I've used in the
past but you know give some of these
other platforms a chance okay it doesn't
hurt to even be on multiple platforms
you have nothing to lose okay when
you're on a platform basically the
platform again is acting as the middle
person they're introducing you to
affiliate and so every time you actually
pay an affiliate a commission they're
going to get their cut of it so they're
going to get a small percentage as well
so just keep that in mind but you know
give it a try try one or two of these
Affiliates if you find you're getting
quality Affiliates that are selling your
product or service great if you don't
then you know feel free to change you
know affiliate networks it's that simple
but the key here is find the Affiliates
you think are going to best represent
your brand product or service because
because those Affiliates are likely
going to be the ones to convert for you
and if you're small business starting
out and you need some help affiliate
marketing is the way to go okay let's
move over to Native advertising okay so
native advertising so native
advertisement means that your ad is
showing up next to content that
basically naturally fits so these are
advertisements that are featured on a
platform alongside the content okay that
isn't paid for okay so for example here
you can see a paid post okay this is by
Spotify okay this paid post okay was on
BuzzFeed this particular post was
probably on a news article related to
music because they're talking about you
bands that probably wouldn't exist
without Le Zeppelin okay so for Spotify
you using native advertising allows them
to put their ad next to content related
to their ad here you can see another
BuzzFeed article okay 11 great Amazon
deals that will be music to your ears if
you're audio file here you could see an
advertisement next to the article so you
could see the ad about Le Zeppelin and
here you can see the actual article is
about music so the whole point about
Native advertising is making sure
there's a connection between the ad and
the article so Spotify is advertising
okay their product and service on an
article on BuzzFeed which happens to be
about music so a good example we used
BuzzFeed just a second ago so if we go
to BuzzFeed here you can see I'm in TV
and movies and here you could see got an
ad here if we scroll down uh keep
scrolling down we can see another ad
here for HBO and so this ad makes sense
because it's placed on TVs and movies so
people who go and read the content are
going to see an ad related to that
content so that's generally what Native
advertising is you need to be able to be
able to place the ad on the right pages
okay so you're going to need an ad
Network for that so we talked about paid
search advertising we talked about
Google ads so Google ads has the ability
to place your ad natively on particular
pages that are relevant to that ad so
that's really what Native advertising is
all about making sure that your ad is
placed next to content that's naturally
relevant so if you need more information
about affiliate marketing feel free to
visit simply learn's YouTube channel we
have a nice uh indepth video about
affiliate marketing so you get more
information about the platforms how it
works and all the tips and best
practices about how to run a successful
affiliate marketing campaign so let's
turn our attention to email marketing
now so email marketing very traditional
form of digital marketing it's been
around the longest it's kind of the
grandfather of all digital marketing
channels so email marketing really is
used to personalize emails in order to
convert that recipient or that
perspective user into a customer and so
like all the other digital marketing
channels we want to follow some type of
flow or process or methodology and the
first step in email marketing is you
have to identify your target audience
okay when you identify your target
audience you're going to create a
segment okay so in other words you don't
want to send one email to everyone
because not everyone is going to be
interested in that email so in order to
get somebody interested you need to be
able to send an email tailored to that
audience okay so that audience can
respond and react accordingly so once
you target that audience and create
segments email segments you're going to
create the campaign and set up an
appropriate call to action one note here
is when you create the campaign and set
up that appropriate call to action that
call to action is going to be align with
your goal so what is the goal of the
email campaign is it simply to get
people to click on something and
purchase or is it simply to get people
to click on something and sign up or
watch something or submit some
information or download or whatever the
case you need to establish that up front
just like you would with a search engine
marketing campaign or any other type of
campaign you want to run so there are
lots of tools out there just like with
affiliate marketing you want to choose
an appropriate email marketing tool
there are plenty to be Had Each work in
a very similar nature some offer
different pricing models meaning you
know you can send an email to ex
recipients for flat fee or or you pay a
small amount per email address each one
is slightly different in terms of how
they price but in terms of the features
they all work in a very similar fashion
and we're going to show you an example
of one here shortly so when you choose
that email marketing tool you're going
to test your emails before you send them
out and then when you test your emails
you're going to use that email marketing
tool to actually send the campaign after
it's been tested okay so you want to
send the campaign you can immediately
send them out or you can schedule them
now a best practice with an email is
when you actually send one out you're
sending an email out to your targeted
audience you want to create probably two
emails per segmented audience why
because you want to add an attractive
subject line and copy to the email but
if you send two emails to the same
target audience then you want to test
the subject lines you want to be able to
see what subject lines going to T
somebody to open the email okay that's
the beauty of email marketing is you can
do that okay so you can set up your a
design based on your target audience but
it's always the subject line that people
see first so you want to write an
attractive subject line and copy that's
going to entice somebody to open the
email so wantet send two emails to each
target audience that way you can see
what email subject line works best so
that's the whole idea about perform
pering AB test to test out different
ideas it doesn't necessarily have to be
a subject line it can be the same
subject line two emails but the
difference being the body of the email
it's totally up to you but the idea here
is to always split out your emails per
target audience and just like any other
channel whether it the affiliate or
search engine marketing organic search
you want to analyze performance and in
the case of emails it's always about
open rate how many people are opening
then how many people are clicking and
then how many people are actually
responding are they converting or
downloading or whatever it is you want
them to do you need to be able to
monitor the behavior because for example
if your open rates don't work or they're
low then you know something's wrong with
your subject line so you want to be able
to make an adjustment so here's an
example of an email from Airbnb it's a
simple email okay they're just simply
trying to get somebody to click on that
call to action to take the survey okay
that's really all it's about here with
this particular email so who's their
target audience well their target
audience could be somebody who's already
stayed at a Airbnb property or it could
be somebody who used the app probably
Airbnb has already targeted this
audience and they're sending this survey
to a particular audience so that they
can get the best results okay so that's
a good example of a targeted email with
a good call to action that's getting
somebody to take the survey so they're
probably measuring many people opened it
how many people clicked on the CTA the
call to action and then how many people
actually filled out the survey so you
need to follow each step and track each
step accordingly okay so again some
popular tools used in email marketing
let's take a look at MailChimp here uh
but I will mention like maretto is a
good marketing automation tool now owned
by Adobe maretto allows you to send
those drip campaigns so if somebody
doesn't purchase right away you can send
up follow-up emails like say one day out
or seven days out or 14 days out so
HubSpot Works in a very similar fashion
you want to be able to methodically plan
out your emails that's the point I'm
trying to make here so let's take a look
at MailChimp so if we go over into
MailChimp very easy interface okay okay
here we go under audience we can
actually see who our audience is and we
can break out our audience into
different groups you can have a simple
test list you can have people who
purchase people who subscribe to
something okay so you can break out your
audience into different groups okay when
it comes to campaigns you can see
campaigns that are already been built or
you can create your own campaign okay so
in the case of mail champ we can
actually see what campaigns have been
dropped or sent out already and then we
could see the opens the clicks and then
the conversions so MailChimp has some
nice reporting so you want to be able to
measure the reports or how well the
campaign performed so here we can see
specifically how many people open
clicked how many people bounced or email
addresses bounc and how many people
unsubscribed from the list and here we
can see you know the top links that have
been clicked
okay the subscribers with the most opens
did anybody perform any social media
activity okay what locations open the
email okay so you can actually see a lot
of good information here right in
MailChimp and you want to be able to
react to the emails you sent out so if
an email is not performing okay you want
to learn from that so you don't make the
same mistake again great thing I like
about MailChimp too they have a lot of
nice templates to use so if you're
trying to create a template here here
you got some templates that you can
leverage so that's MailChimp kind of in
a nutshell MailChimp you can pay up
front buy credits and with those credits
you could send out emails to a number of
people okay so that's how MailChimp
Works they do have a free trial so you
can set up an account using the free
trial now if you need any more
information about MailChimp or email
marketing in general take a look at the
email marketing webinar we have set up
on our simply learn YouTube account now
let's finish up with online PR or press
releases so we talked about SEO and
social and search and affiliate and
email marketing and and content native
advertising let's talk about online PR
here because with online PR it really
does involve working with digital
Publications or blogs or other content
related websites for example content
related websites ites could be newspaper
digital newspaper sites like the New
York Times okay the whole point of
online PR is you want to try and get
some publicity on those on those
websites publicity means awareness for
the brand it means traffic to the
website and eventually some loyalty
future customers and conversion channels
that can be used to maximize your online
PR efforts for example you can connect
with reporters on social media to
develop a relationship so you can just
follow some reporters see if they're
covering specific uh Industries or
verticals and if they are similar to
what you're offering then it's probably
a good idea to reach out to them you can
use engaging user reviews to help
humanize your brand or you can respond
to comments that help generate
productive conversations so those are
all certain things you can do to
generate awareness and Buzz for your
brand so really the one thing I want to
point out about online PR is basically
you can also hire a PR firm and they can
do some of the heavy lifting for you or
like I said you can reach out to
different reporters or different
influencers even to help push your
product or brand now if you're trying to
go at it alone on the online PR what you
could do if you don't reach out to
reporters or influen ERS or you're
active in trying to build your brand
through a conversation you can always
use a thirdparty service like pr.com so
pr.com allows you to you know basically
create your own profile you know submit
content to your own profile or even
submit press releases if you submit
press releases then other news agencies
are going to Pi pick up on those press
releases so it's a good way to get your
press releases out there likes of
yahoooo and Google might pick up those
press releases and give you some you
know much needed visibility you can also
use other tools like you know PR
newswire for example so Works in a very
similar way again it's a press release
distribution Network so you can go ahead
and sign up for an account get that
press release out there and they do the
distribution for you or you can also use
aggregation sites so there are lots of
different aggregate sites out there and
so what aggregate websites do is they
help disseminate and distribute your
content so here you could see some of
the new aggregator websites of 2019 you
got feedle Panda Tech Mimi Metacritic
escience news the morning news so you
have a lot of options available to get
your content out there okay so what
these sites do is basically pick up
articles that fit their website fit
their theme fit their target audience so
you do have options in the form of third
party tools as well okay so if you don't
hire a PR firm which could be expensive
you can certainly go at it alone by
signing up for any one of these
particular products or services today
we're going to talk about digital
marketing tools so fast in your seat
belts and let's get started so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at some of the
best digital marketing tools for not
only 2019 but ones that have performed
well in the past that are popular and
ones that we foresee as being the go-to
tools for the future so past present and
future digital marketing tools is the
way to look at this uh with a good focus
on a lot of different marketing channels
here so we're going to focus first on
SEO talk about some of the tools related
to on page and off page we're going to
switch over over to paid search talk a
little bit about paid search tools we're
going to talk about email marketing and
some of the email marketing platforms
and the tools within those platforms the
center of it all is web analytics so
Google analytics is the tool we'll be
taking a closer look at in today's
webinar and all that it has to offer
affiliate marketing we'll talk about
some of the tools available to you in
for affiliate marketing we'd be remiss
if we didn't talk about social media and
all that it has to offer and all the
metrics and tools available all the
platforms available so we'll hone in on
a couple of examples there and then
we'll also talk about some competition
tools available for you so there's a
whole Suite of tools the one caveat
being hey if you have your favorite tool
continue using it in fact if there's a
tool that we didn't mention in today's
webinar feel free to mention it in the
comments box below this video we'd love
to hear what you're using to manage your
particular digital marketing channel
okay and so the goal for today's webinar
is hey we hope you get something out of
this in terms of using new tools there's
some tools that I use some tools that my
colleagues use everybody uses different
tools so it'll be good to kind of see
what else is out there so if you have
something to share share it by all means
what we're trying to do is share what we
think are you know best practices and
some of the most popular or most used
tools out there in the industry so
that's what we're going to do the goal
is to get you to better understand some
of the tools we're using a little bit
more detail and what we're going to do
is start out with search engine
optimization okay so search engine
optimization or organic search we have a
mixture of paid and free so there's a
lot of different platforms but if you're
focusing on on SEO you certainly need to
use an SEO platform so there's sem Rush
okay you also have Google search console
which is free so if you don't have a SEO
platform you definitely need to be using
Google search console and so we'll take
a closer look at that there's Google
Keyword Planner which is actually
situated under Google ads and so if
you're running Google campaigns on
Google search Network or even the
Display Network you have access to a
great tool called Keyword Planner and if
you know anything about SEO you'll know
that using Google's Keyword Planner is a
good tool so we'll take a look at that
MZ is a premium tool meaning they have a
free trial that you can sign up for to
test drive it but it's another SEO
platform and it does cost money got a
great tool in screaming frog that's a
paid version again not too expensive
we'll talk a little bit more about that
and then we have you know tool in HRS
that help us with all aspects of SEO
primarily focusing on off page so these
are just some examples that we're going
to hone in on but this is just a small
subset of what really is available out
there in the market so let's go ahead
and dive a little bit deeper and
understand why we use some of these
tools well the first reason when we talk
about SEO is to find relevant keywords
not only do we want to find relevant
keyword we want to find relevant
keywords with high volume and low
competition okay we wouldn't want to
find non-relevant keywords with high
competition low volume that wouldn't
make sense so we need a tool to kind of
help us put it all together and so the
tool of choice for us is Google's
Keyword Planner and Google's Keyword
Planner helps us hone in on keywords we
may be interested in optimizing for
because not only one are they relevant
but two they're going to have high
volume and low competition so let's take
a look at an example in Google's Keyword
Planner so here I am I'm in Google's
Keyword Planner and as I mentioned
before Google's Keyword Planner is
situated under Google ads okay so you
have to have a Google ads account to use
Google's Keyword Planner and so when
you're in Google ads you simply go to
tools and then under Tools you're going
to select Keyword Planner so what we
want to do is look for keywords we're
focusing on organic search not
necessarily paid search so organic
search we want to hone in on some
keywords so let's just use one of the
examples that Google's given us here
mail delivery so we're going to just
type in mail delivery and get some
results so notice I can enter a domain
as a filter and so in other words hey I
could say look hone in on keywords
related to this website if I wanted to
but I'm asking Google hey just give me
something closely related to mail
delivery cuz that's my business so I'm
going to click click get results notice
I can add another key to if I wanted to
but I'm just going to stick with one
keyword but there are certainly other
keywords that I can certainly hone in on
if mail delivery is my business and so
let's just tone in on that one keyword
mail delivery we want to be found
organically for that keyword so what
Google Keyword Planner does is not only
give us the key keyword and other
keywords relevant to that but it gives
us the average monthly search volumes
and this is an average over the course
of the last 12 months and notice here I
get a column for competition so I'm able
to see whether that's a very competitive
keyword or not and then just to give you
an extra Edge when you're choosing
keywords you can get a sense of what the
keyword May cost if you wanted to bid on
that for paid search so for mail
delivery I can see it's anywhere between
$746 and at the top of the page high
range
$16.61 so that should alert me to the
fact that hey if I'm going to try and
optimize for this keyword I know it's
competitive because not only Google is
telling me it's competitive by telling
me high competition but I know that the
cost per click seems a little bit high
and what is a little bit High well you
know I can see some other keywords here
that you know a dollar to $3 okay I
could see some other ones that are even
lower than the $7 they're suggesting so
that's a indication that the keyword is
highly competitive so the idea here
using Google's Keyword Planner is one we
want to get an idea of what other
keywords are out there that are relevant
so it helps stimulate some ideas for
relevancy two we can get an average
monthly search volume so we want to know
on average over the past 12 months how
many search queries I can expect from
this keyword and then three I can get a
sense of the competition how competitive
is this keyword so if I try to optimize
for this keyword and I want to rank for
it organically is it competitive if it's
competitive then it's probably going to
take me a bit longer to be found for
this keyword on page one of Google so
that's the whole idea behind Google's
Keyword Planner and note that you could
change some of the settings here so if
you want to choose a different language
okay you can hone in on a longer or
shorter period of time you can even
choose a specific location so I chose
Texas I can certainly choose the entire
United States to get a sense of what the
volume would be for the total us so you
have settings that you can change and
manipulate to get you the data you need
to choose keywords so that's the whole
idea behind Google's Keyword Planner to
find relevant key wordss high volume low
competition now alternatively I can
certainly use another tool to find
keywords so I have a Moz account so I
logged into MZ and MZ has a tool called
keyword Explorer so if I use that same
keyword I used in Google's Keyword
Planner mail delivery I'm going to ask
MZ to give me some data on that keyword
so this is for the entire United States
and again I can change that if I wanted
to okay okay so I can hone in on a
specific country or different country so
what Ma is telling me hey for this
keyword in the entire United States I'm
looking at anywhere from
115,000 to 30,000 on monthly volume now
what MZ does is they give you a
difficulty score so a difficulty score
is a score between 1 and 100 and so I
can see this is pretty much right down
the middle in terms of difficulty Okay
so if it's zero it's an easy keyword if
it's if it's 100 it's very difficult and
then that means you have a lot of
competitors who are optimizing for this
keyword that are ranking for this
keyword and so Moz gives us the volume
they give us the competition and they
just like Google's Keyword Planner gives
us some other keywords that we can
potentially hone in on so here I could
see keyboard delivery plans delivery
services Etc so I can see a lot more
suggestions than what's listed here so
Moz delivers a bunch of other analysis
uh related to the keyword you know they
also give you some good keyword
suggestions so Moz is a good alternative
tool and we'll be coming back to Moz
related to SEO for some other of its
features but for now if you don't want
to necessarily use Google's Keyword
Planner because maybe you're not running
Google ads you can always use Moz now
remember Moz has basically a freemium
version meaning you can can sign up for
a free account and you could sign up for
a free account as a test trial and you
could test it for a period of days and
leverage its tools during that free
trial to get a better sense of how these
tools work so we want to be able to use
mods we want to be able to use Google's
Keyword Planner not only to search for
all those relevant keywords available to
you but we want to be able to choose
keywords with high volume and low
difficulty low competition we also want
to select primary and second keywords
wisely so remember when you optimize
you're optimizing a page for more than
one keyword so you want to be able to
have a nice portfolio of diverse
relevant keywords with high search
volume and low difficulty and then you
want to be able to identify those
keywords that your competitors are
ranking for so MZ gives you that
information and so we want to be able to
leverage the tools available to us to
choose the right keywords so if you need
any more information on this we got a
nice webinar on keyword research for SEO
so take a look at that video on YouTube
uh to get more specific details about
using SEO tools for keyword research and
all about keyword research in general
for SEO so let's talk about some other
reasons under SEO why would would use
some of these tools available to us well
we want to be able to understand the
search Eng engines and how they crawl
and index our site okay we also want to
check the correct format of the site map
and we want to monitor backlinks okay we
also want to analyze linking to our web
page okay which ones are good which ones
are not good okay we also want to
perform some competitor analysis so
these are some of the reasons why other
than keyword research why would would
use some of these SEO tools so we have
tools available to us and Majestic HRS
again M let's take a look at Google
search console and I want to hone in on
Google search console because it is free
and it's a must if you're going to work
on SEO you need to be working in Google
search console and so the whole key
behind Google search console is you have
a website and you need to get that site
verified once it's verified once Google
can recognize that you are are
associated with this website then you're
going to be able to see some important
information so here I'm looking at a
website and what am I looking at I'm
looking at something called coverage
under index so what does coverage mean
well going back to what we just said we
want to be able to understand how
Google's crawling and indexing our pages
and so what Google does is through this
platform search console is they're
letting us know once they go to our
website and start crawling it and they
pull these Pages back to their server
they're letting us know if we actually
have any issues so here I could see I
have some issues with 112 pages and some
of those issues are listed down here so
there could be a crawl issue a 44 you
know redirect okay so you could see
there's some five unique issues across
112 pages so here I can see submitted
URL marked no index there's a hundred of
those pages we have some redirect errors
there's seven pages that you know fall
victim to this error and so we can
really hone in on what the eror is and
address the error okay so if Google's
telling us hey this is an issue and you
want that page indexed by Google then we
should probably address the error and so
that's the great thing here about going
into Google search console is you can
under index go to coverage and get a
sense of what Google's indexing and what
they're not indexing so these are the
errors I can see they've certainly were
able to crawl an index
9,115 Pages uh they were able to crawl
okay and they excluded
54,000 plus pages and then we also have
some pages with some warnings so this is
kind of an overview of what Google Sees
when they crawl our site so when they
say crawl they're coming to our site
they're following links on the site and
every link they follow they're either
going to index that page or they're
going to report to you an error or an
issue that they found if we want these
Pages index we need to address the
issues the errors and so that's the
beauty of this report here is Google is
telling us firsthand what the issues are
so we also want to take a look at the
sitemap so you have an opportunity to
submit a sitemap and a sitemap is just a
formatted file that includes all your
website URLs and so you're going to have
this file sitting in your root directory
and you're probably going to call it or
should call it sitemap.xml XML being the
format so once you have this file you're
just going to let Google know that that
file exists so you're going to enter in
the sitemap URL so if it's in the root
directory all you're going to do is type
in sitemap.xml and click submit so once
you've done it just like this site is
done what Google's going to do is say
hey look we see you've submitted this
and we last read it a couple days ago
and we could see that we discovered
1,419 URLs so I can go back under
coverage and I can see some of the
issues that they found but if I go back
under sitemaps I can see that these are
the URLs they discovered via the sit map
and so the whole point of a Sit map is
we want to be able to get and push the
URLs to Google not have Google come to
our site and discover them so this is a
quicker faster more efficient way to
communicate with Google all the URLs
that you have on your site that you want
Google to index and so that's the beauty
of search console now while we're in
search console we might as well take a
look at some of the other features it
has and so one of the most important
features under search console is this
mobile usability report so Google is a
staunch believer in mobile first so
nowadays most people start and finish a
lot of their searches a lot of their
behavior on mobile so they begin it on
mobile and they may end it on mobile so
if they don't end it on mobile then you
know perhaps they'll go into a store or
perhaps they'll go via desktop but
Google is a staunch believer and
definitely a lot what's going on today
starts with mobile so they want you to
understand how your site fars Via Mobile
and when I say fairs Via Mobile is it
mobile friendly is it responsive is it
loading quick enough you know is it
formatted to Google standards and so if
there are any issues Google's going to
let you know what those issues are so
here I could see Google's recognized 206
pages with four different issues okay so
here I can see what those issues issues
are just like the coverage issues we can
see specifically what they are and so
here I can see for 206 Pages text too
small to read click elements too close
together the viewport not set to device
wi and then content wider than the
screen so there's 10 pages that fit
under this error and if I actually click
on it the error I can see what those 10
pages are and so when we're done we can
actually when we address the issues we
can actually have Google validate
whether the fix has been made so you can
definitely use this as a means of
communicating directly with Google
telling Google look I see what the
issues are I'm going to fix them and
then I want you to validate them okay so
this is important because if you can
communicate with Google and let them
know hey we do recognize the errors we
are fixing the errors please validate
them you know it's going to draw
Google's attention Google's going to
validate them and get these Pages index
quicker um so if you ignore the issues
and the errors especially for mobile
then you stand the chance of your pages
not getting index so the mobile
usability report to me is an important
report because we want to better
understand whether Google's picking up
issues on mobile and if they are we want
to address them get Google valid them so
Google can index them quicker now
there's another report that is of
interest to you or may be of interest to
you in Google search console and that's
the links report so the links report in
Google search conso shows us what pages
have the most links okay so here we can
see the homepage say 26,000 plus links
if we hone in on interior Pages we can
see the links to those pages okay so we
can get a sense of what are the topped
link pages from external links meaning
links on other websites pointing to
these pages I can also see internal
links so Google's recognized
links from within my website from one
page to another so external links
internal links both factors for SEO when
ranking so then I can see top linking
sites what sites are linking to my site
and then I can see top linking text so
Google search console is giving me kind
of an overview of what my linking
structure looks like okay so externally
I want links from other websites
pointing to various pages on my site and
I certainly want my pages linking to one
another on my site and so I'd be able to
better understand what that structure
looks like using Google search consoles
links report okay there's one more
report that I think's of interest in
Google search console and that's the
performance report so the performance
report is a report that actually you can
link up with Google analytics so you
could see the same report and analytics
if you're able to link up Google search
console with with analytics and you
should be able to do that all you need
to do is make sure you use the same
email address that you use for analytics
and search console so it needs to be the
same email address you could certainly
link up the two and have this data
imported into Google analytics so what
is this data that we're talking about
well it's called performance so what we
can actually see is the queries the
actual queries people are typing in to
Google so when they're typing them in to
Google we can actually see how many
Impressions the keyword queries received
and how many clicks the keyword queries
received and then I can see click the
rate and average position okay so here I
can see for this particular keyword on
the first line I could see over the
course of the last 3 months it received
29,029 Impressions so what does that
mean that means this keyword was used at
Le were typed in as a query at least
that many times and that's how many
times my listing appeared in the Google
search results Pages based on this
particular query and so as a result of
somebody typing in this query 29,000
plus times this site received 120,000
plus clicks so to get a sense of the
click theid all you would need to do and
Google can obviously do this for you is
you would simply just divide the the
[Music]
2092979267
so over half of the clicks occur when
this listing appears for this keyword
okay so we can get a sense of the click
the r for each one okay and you can
simply just use the filtering here now
we can also see average position okay so
we could see a little bit more than that
too we can go from queries to Pages we
can go from pages to countries so we get
a sense of how many Impressions and
clicks I'm receiving by country and
importantly we can see by device so here
I can see a majority of the people who
conduct a search related to my website
primarily do it on desktop now I
mentioned the beauty of the Google
search console performance report is
that you can link it up to Google
analytics and when you do that all you
need to do then is go to acquisition
Google search console and then from
there you could choose landing pages
countries devices or queries so I could
see the same data that I see in search
console but this time I'm looking at it
in Google analytics and so here I can
see what my search queries are my clicks
my Impressions my click the rate buy
search query and then the average
position so that's the the great thing
about that performance report is that
when I link up Google search console
with analytics I'm able to see that data
in analytics so that's an added bonus so
to speak now let's talk about some other
reasons why we are going to use these
SEO tools available to us and so we
already listed a number of different
reasons ranging from sit maps to keyword
research but we also want to hone in on
you know what domains are driving links
to our site so I showed you an example
in search console we also want to hey
maybe identify and disavow poor
backlinks so search console is a great
tool for that because if we don't want
to be associated with the particular
website we can certainly disavow that
link we could track a number of follow
and no follow links okay we could track
our website's rankings we can measure
clickthrough rates and Impressions just
as we did with search console we could
track keyword ranking for desktop mobile
cross locations just as we just did with
the search console performance report we
can identify top performing gaining and
losing keywords again the performance
report so we could certainly look at the
Google search console report but if you
have a platform like MZ you can
certainly also look at a lot of that
data available so for example rankings
so if you have a Moz account we can
certainly go into rankings okay and we
can see for the keywords that we've
chosen that we want to optimize for we
can certainly see where they rank the
great thing about MZ is it's a great
tool not only for rankings and onpage
optimization but for off-page
optimization as well so if I go ahead
and take a look at a domain for example
I'm just going to type in this domain
I'm going to be able to get what they
call a domain Authority so a score out
of one and 100 I'm able to see how
authoritative my domain is and how
authoritative a domain is is based on
the quality of links pointing to it so
Moz gives me some good insights as to
how many linking domains how many
inbound links I have ranking keywords
and it goes into detail as well so here
if I click on the linking domains I'm
going to be act able to see the actual
domains pointing to my site as an
external link and not only can I see the
domains I can actually see the domain
authority of those domains so if there's
a domain for example that doesn't have a
good domain Authority and the site
appears a bit scammy per se then we can
disavow that so I can certainly look at
all the domains that are linking to me
and then I can highlight the ones that
have poor domain Authority what Moz even
takes it a step further
they also give me a Spam score so Moz is
able to measure how spammy a website is
so if I have a combination of say a low
domain Authority and a high spam score
then I probably want to disavow myself
from that site and so I can use this
report here you could see here as I keep
going down for example I can see this
particular website has a domain
authority of 26 and it has a spam score
of 16% so not a good combination this
should alert me to the fact that hey
this particular site because it has so
many links pointing to me or it has at
least one link pointing to me that I
probably want to disavow myself because
it's probably hurting my own domain
Authority so that's the great thing
about this linking domains report is I'm
able to hone in on not only who's link
linking to me meaning domain but how
many linking domains does that domain
have what's the spam score of that
domain what's the domain authority of
that domain and then I can get into a
little bit more detail and I actually
see you know all the links pointing to
that domain so it really goes into
detail about backlinks domain Authority
spam Etc everything you need to use in
order to measure off-page SEO so that's
the great thing about m is they have not
only on on page SEO tools but off-page
SEO tools and Moz is a premium so to
speak so here you can see if you just go
to
mod.com free-- tools you'll be able to
use some of these tools available to you
not just for SEO but also for local SEO
as well so here you like some of these
tools you can start your free 30-day
trial so I use and lean on Mo a lot for
all that it has to offer from choosing
keyword
to rankings report to checking issues on
my website to even checking who's
linking to me so this fits in the mold
with everything I need to do for SEO so
in addition to that keyword research
video you could certainly lean on some
other webinars that we've done in the
past on SEO so we've done a webinar on
SEO tools and we've also done a webinar
on SEO tips and tricks so if you want
any more information about the tools we
covered or SEO in general take a look at
those two videos and check them out and
that should kind of complement what we
talked about with using some of the
tools Google's Keyword Planner uh MZ and
Google search console okay let's switch
over to email marketing tools and so
with email marketing tools we have a lot
available to us in the form of reporting
in the form of platform forms in the
form of you know tools that really help
us go from A to Z on our email choosing
you know what email to send out to
creating a list to measuring how the
email campaign went and so we could
start with MailChimp because mail Champs
a premium version whenever we say
premium meaning they have a free trial
available then you're expected to
upgrade but you know MailChimp to me is
a tool I use I like the interface very
easy for beginners so we're going to
take a look at MailChimp but there are
certainly many others available you know
Mar is a good tool you know Mar is a
good tool because if you have a business
and you're trying to funnel people
through your pipeline so to speak
meaning they they sign up as a lead and
you want to nurture that lead from the
beginning to the end meaning at the end
they're actually going to turn around
and purchase well Marcato is a good tool
for you to use because you can then set
up DP campaigns or also known as email
campaigns you know so that you're
talking and communicating with that
particular Prospect through every point
in the funnel so that's the great thing
about maretto it has drip campaigns
available along with some other features
there's HubSpot is a very powerful tool
it does a lot from creating landing
pages to AB testing to social to you
know email so this is another premium
tool that you could use you have another
premium and send in blue email platform
and then you also have convert kit
another email platform there's more
Dimension that we can't even fit on this
screen now if you have a favorite email
marketing tool that you use Constant
Contact vertical response there plenty
out there Emma you know feel free to to
note that in the comment section below
this video I'm curious as to how many
people actually use you know different
tools because there are so literally so
many email marketing tools out there why
because email marketing has been around
probably the longest amongst all the
other digital marketing channels and a
lot of people use email on a on a daily
basis so it's no wonder why there's just
so many tools available and so with
these tools you could certainly send
bulk emails now in the case of marato
you could send emails to a segmented
audience and so that's a actually what
you want to do as a strategy is always
send emails to a segmented audience you
know you want to use a tool where you're
going to be able to create campaigns
then send those campaigns to again
segmented contacts and then be able to
design your email around that particular
audience so you know you have a good
tool when you can do that when you can
really segment for your audience okay
you want to be able to use an tool
that's going to be able to segment your
users you know use transactional emails
meaning hey look if somebody go ahead
went ahead and purchased can you follow
up with an email and creating workflows
just like I mentioned with maretto you
want a workflow set up where a if
somebody does this you're sending email
B Etc so you want a email marketing tool
that's flexible enough to handle what
your business strategy and goals are
okay so you want to be able to also use
a tool that you know has various email
templates available okay you don't want
to be stuck with just a vanilla template
again you want to be able to customize
an email for your audience you want to
be able to manage your list
appropriately meaning if you have 10,000
users or emails in a list you want to be
able to manage them accordingly you know
break them up or or have sublist so to
speak and then most importantly you want
to make sure you have a platform that
not only does its tracking on its own
but will give you some detailed insight
meaning you know what percentage of
users opened your email what percentage
of of recipients clicked on your email
what links they click on you know which
which emails bounce so you want some
detailed insights right in the platform
that you're using it just makes it more
simpler and easier and more effective to
manage you certainly want to create the
smart automated campaigns meaning you
don't even have to send out the email
and then you want to be able to have
some flexibility to set up email deliver
based on a specific time and day so
these tools also allow you to you
sigment contacts based on geolocation
you want to be able to use a tool that
allows for multivariant testing again
you want to analyze performance and
optimize campaigns you want to trigger
automatic responses somebody purchases
something are you using a tool that will
automatically send that email out so
these are all the reasons why you would
use an email marketing tool so let's
dive in and take a look at an example
and we're going to use MailChimp as our
example today so let's dive in and take
a look at MailChimp so with MailChimp
once you log in you know you're going to
be able to see some historical campaigns
that you sent out or you're going to be
able to create your own campaign and so
this is kind of under campaigns you can
kind of see an overview of the ones
you've sent out or if they're in draft
mode you'll be able to see they're in
draft mode so you can go ahead and edit
them so here we have one that was set up
on August 26th and it's still in draft
mode so we can go ahead and edit that so
if we just click edit you know we have
the flexibility to you know pick and
choose who we're sending this to who
it's from what the subject line is and
then we can certainly design the email
so if we click design email again this
is important because with email
marketing you want to be able to cater
your email to your your intended
audience so if you're selling men's
shoes your audience should be men okay
so you don't want men to receive an
email about women's shoes it sounds like
it's common sense but the point being
you want to be able to use an email
platform that's going to be able to
allow you to put two and two together
the message and the design with the
intended audience and so here you can
see MailChimp allows us to do that okay
you can see some of the layouts here
okay you also have themes that you could
choose from okay you could search for
different themes or you can even just
code your own so you can just paste your
code in or you can import it so
MailChimp allows that flexibility you're
not stuck with one of their templates
and so if we go back to the dashboard
the one thing I like about MailChimp
though is the reporting okay so yes it
is easy to choose a template and map
that template to your audience
but I really like the reports that they
have to offer so you know here you could
see there's some list that we've sent to
and we choose one of our audience list
then we can see some really detailed
reporting here and so here I could see
this email that was sent out in June I
could see it was sent to 95,000 plus
subscribers okay of the subscribers that
saw 2,000 plus open it and 157 clicks so
I can view this report in more detail
just by clicking on view report so again
we want an email platform that's going
to be able to give us some detailed
information about how that email
campaign performed and so I can get down
really to the nitty-gritty I can
actually see you know on the content
what was clicked and what wasn't clicked
so here I sent two different subject
lines so I'm able to compare the two
against one another okay so I can really
go into detail about one of them here so
if I click view report I can
specifically see what the average for
this list is so here I'm able to compare
against the list average and it's 16% I
only had an open rate of 2.5% so the
industry average is 18% and so here I'm
able to see the list average for the
click rate and the industry average for
the click rate as well so then I can see
some specifics about it how many people
unsubscribed
then I could see a graph I could see the
top links that were clicked okay the top
subscribers with the most opens I can
link social to it if I want to and then
I can see geographic information so the
point being is MailChimp really goes
into some nice detail here about the
email campaigns and how they performed
so the great thing is too with the
mailchip you can link it with Google
analytics you can link it with
e-commerce okay okay so if you have an
email and you're you're selling products
and somebody purchased that product
MailChimp is able to integrate in with
your shopping Commerce platform for
example woo Commerce so if somebody did
purchase you can send out that thank you
email MailChimp even goes a step further
and if somebody did click on a link go
to your shopping cart add something to
the shopping cart and then abandon the C
you know mailchip allows you the
opportunity to retarget them via email
so MailChimp is flexible and that's what
you want in a email marketing platform
you want something that's flexible that
you can cater to your audience you can
manage your audience list and you can
get detailed reporting on your different
campaigns for that audience so that's
MailChimp in summary and so most email
platforms do a lot of the similar
features or have some of the similar
features but that's what you ideally
want to look for in an email marketing
platform so here's a tool that doesn't
get talked about enough when it comes to
email marketing and that's Google's your
ra Builder and the reason why we're
going to talk about this tool today is
because most people in the US use Google
analytics as their web Analytics tool
and the one thing about Google analytics
is it allows you to track different
campaigns so if you're doing
pay-per-click campaigns outside of
Google you can certainly track the
performance right in Google analytics
and email is no different so if you're
using Google analytics and you're
sending out an email let's just say on
mailchip or any other email marketing
platform you want to be able to append
your links with what we call UTM
tracking so for example if I have a URL
that says visit Florida and I'm going to
send out an email I have up to five
parameters that I can use okay so here's
my email or URL that I'm using in the
email so I have up to five parameters
that I can use to track this particular
email so let's go through some of those
parameters so the first one is campaign
source so what's the source of the
campaign well we could certainly
identify MailChimp if we're using mail
champ as the source now the the thing
about the URL Builder you always want to
use lower k case because Google
analytics is case sensitive so as a rule
of thumb just stick with a lower case so
our source is going to be MailChimp cuz
that's the platform we're using if
you're using you know Constant Contact
or vertical response or you know some of
these other one convert kit then go
ahead and put in that platform as the
source now for the medium which is the
means in which we're driving traffic to
the site let's go ahead and put in email
because that's what we're using a drive
traffic to this particular page now
what's the campaign name well we're in
summer so we're going to call this the
summer promo so the summer promo here is
visit Florida beaches okay so we're
going to send this email out to the
masses and particularly not only the
masses but the masses in the north
because we're going to say hey look come
to Florida for the summer come visit our
beaches that's the point of the campaign
so that's what we're going to use for
the campaign name is whatever the
campaign is it's a summer promo now
notice I got an asteris next to these
particular parameters so Google's asking
us hey these are mandatory so go ahead
and put something in there now for
campaign term and campaign content we
could certainly leave them blank because
they're not mandatory but since we're
talking about email I would certainly
recommend that you use the campaign
content parameter and why do I say that
because if we're sending an email out to
say you have 10,000 recipients I want to
be able to split out the email into two
segments one segment that's going to get
subject line one and one segment that's
going to get subject line two so in this
case I'm going to put whatever subject
line one is in the campaign content
field so now I have four parameters and
once I've entered in my variables in
those parameter Fields I now have a
revised or pended your URL so my
original URL was visit
florida.com
USFA bees. HTML my original URL I've now
appended that with some UTM parameters
and now I see my original URL appended
with the UTM parameters based on those
variables so I can copy it just by
clicking the copy URL I can go to my
browser I can paste that URL in there
and I want to check to see if it works
so here I could see this particular page
loaded Florida beaches with my UTM
parameters appended to the URL so that's
for the first subject line that's for
the audience that's going to get the
first subject line I want to do another
one for the second subject line so now
I'm going to change my campaign content
parameter to subject
Line2 I'm going to copy that URL I'm
going to check it
okay so I can see that the page loads
with those UTM parameters and so now
what I'm going to do I'm going to use
the first URL and the second URL in my
email okay so any link that I have in
this case I'm using subject line two so
for the email with the second subject
line going to that segmented audience
this is the link I'm going to use in the
email so if you have one or two or three
links in the email this is the URL
you're going to use because when
somebody clicks on that link you're
going to be able to see that that click
in Google analytics so if I jump over to
Google analytics after I sent out my
email I'm going to go to acquisition I'm
going to go to campaigns I'm going to go
to all campaigns now based on the
variables I put into my parameters
meaning Source medium campaign name
content or term that's what I'm going to
look for in Google analytics so we could
start with source and medium so if I
click on source and medium as my primary
Dimension here I can see MailChimp and
the actual date was used as part of the
variable for for source and then I what
can I see the medium being email so now
I can see for this email that was sent
out in mail champ in May I could see how
many users how many sessions and more
importantly how many conversions so we
could certainly hone in on that
particular email if we wanted to if we
choose some of the other parameters
available to us so here I could see the
campaign name okay so I can see exactly
what campaign what source what email
drove in traffic and conversions and if
I'm doing subject line testing I can
choose content as my parameter so here
here I'm going to change it to content
and now I can see the subject lines in
this case if I go back to my source
medium I'm going to be able to see what
subject lines from my emails generated
the most traffic and not only the most
traffic but also conversions so that's
the whole point behind using the URL
Builder again you're taking a URL that
you're going to use an email and then
you're going to pan that URL with
different parameters campaign Source
campaign medium campaign name and then
optionally campaign content or campaign
term okay once you've entered variables
into those parameters you're going to
get an appended URL which you can then
use in your email so when the email gets
sent you're going to go back over to
Google analytics and you're going to
look at the results of that campaign of
that source of that medium of that
content IE subject line and so that's
why the URL build is so important
because MailChimp gives us some good
insight as to how the email performed in
terms of open and click rates but what
we really want to see is how that
campaign performed once it drove traffic
to my website so that's the whole idea
behind the URL Builder you're using
Google analytics you'll be able to use
the URL Builder
with whatever email platform you're
using so let's move on to web analytics
tools and this is an important section
because web analytics TOS kind of the
central focal point of all digital
marketing and it starts really with
Google analytics Google analytics is a
premium meaning that they have a free
version that you can use there is also a
paid version of Google analytics but
given the Advent of Google popularity
especially in the United States a
majority of users are using the free
version of Google analytics so it's a
very popular tool especially for
marketers but there are also other tools
available so it's not just Google so we
have Adobe analytics which is also
fremium you have kiss metrics you have
spring metric you have YouTube analytics
which is part of Google but YouTube has
its own separate anal analytics insights
so a lot of these as you can see are
free to use they're available no reason
why you should not be using uh an
Analytics tool to measure your marketing
campaigns or website behavior and why
would we want to use these tools again
well again we want to really measure
Behavior we want to measure what's going
on with our website so we want to be
able to identify the location of where
our website visitors are coming from
from and a lot of these analytics tools
use IP address to identify the location
of a website visitor so if you're trying
to Target a specific country then you
want to be able to see that the visitors
to your website are coming from that
specific country or location we also
want to measure the engagement of our
website Behavior so we get traffic to
the website what are they doing how long
are they staying what pages are they
visiting so this is the overall nature
of really why we want to use web an
Linux to to measure how successful our
website is at treating our website
visitors with the same courtesy you
would if you had a brick and mortar
store somebody comes into your store you
want them to find what they're looking
for quickly you want them to be happy
with their experience you certainly want
them to pay for the products very
quickly and easily and efficiently and
you want them to come back and that's no
different than a website so we want our
website to perform in a manner that's
going to suit our audience and that's
why we want to track engagement so why
else well we want to really look at
who's coming are they returning visitors
or new visitors you know ideally you
want a nice mix between 50% new and 50%
returning because you know returning
visitors are loyal there's some loyalty
to that they already know your brand
they're coming back to your website new
visitors are curious and you want want
new visitors cuz that means more traffic
so you want a nice balance between that
analytics tools will help you measure
that you want to be able to measure
organic traffic whether you like it or
not whether you know it or not but
Google and other search engines or index
in your pages and your pages are being
found via the search engines and so you
want to be able to measure how much
traffic you're actually generating from
those search engines we talked about
this with email marketing UTM tracking
so if you set up email campaigns or non
gooogle campaigns you want to use UTM
tracking and Google analytics and other
analytics tools but specifically Google
analytics will help you see the results
of your campaigns if they're tracked
with UTM tracking so that's another good
reason why to use a a web Analytics tool
probably most importantly amongst all
these bullet points is our goals our
website conversions we want to be able
to see how much traffic is coming to our
website and not only the engagement of
the traffic but how much of that traffic
is actually doing what we want them to
do I.E are they converting and we want
to optimize our sites and channels
performance so the whole idea of
collecting all this information is that
you can turn around and improve
performance so if your bounce rate is
high well how do you lower bounce rate
well we need to do something about that
and analytics tools will help help us
identify what's not working from our
site perspective and from a channel
perspective and we can take action to
improve performance so that's the whole
idea behind optimizing our sit's
performance so let's jump into Google
analytics and let's take a look at
everything we just talked about in those
bullet points so about improving website
performance measuring engagement looking
at our goals and conversions measuring
campaigns with UTM tracking all all
those good things that we can get in a
good Analytics tool so Adobe mix panel
spring metrics you know they all work in
a similar fashion in that they're really
measuring website behavior and so if
we're in Google analytics really what
we're doing is we're measuring the
performance of our website broken down
into four components audience
acquisition behavior and conversions so
what do we want to do well we want to
look into each one of these sections so
let's start with audience and so
audience in Google analytics tells us
who is coming to our website now they're
not going to specifically tell us hey
Rob Sanders came to your website but
they are going to say that somebody from
San Francisco California came to the
website and these are the pages they
looked at and this is the language and
they came from this device and they're a
returning user so they're painting a
picture for you okay so they're not
giving you a list of names that would
not be legal but they are providing you
with a good picture of who is coming and
when I say picture we have to paint that
picture and so if we look at say
demographics for example and I got a
demographics overview here's a picture
I'm painting well I can see that 25 to
34 year old are the majority of the age
group that is coming to my website okay
I can see on the gender side of it I can
see that 63% of my traffic and again
this is year to date that I'm looking at
is coming to my website so 2/3 of my
traffic is female 1/3 male and they're
between the ages of 25 and 34 so I'm
painting a picture about you know gender
and age coming to my website well I can
also look at Geo so where specifically
might these people be coming from so if
I go to
under go I'm going to be able to see a
breakdown of country or I can even hone
it down to city or specific location and
here I can see United States is the
primary driver but not by much so we
have 16 almost 177% from the US and then
16% from Argentina 133% from Mexico 10%
from India so we have a nice mix of
traffic from different locations in the
world coming to our website so that's
Gio but more importantly let's take a
look at mobile so if we go to mobile
overview how are people coming to our
website are they on a desktop or laptop
are they using their mobile device are
they using a tablet and so Google
analytics breaks it down very nice for
you and so we could see percentages and
actual numbers by device category and so
in this case I can see year to date I
can see 62% % are coming from desktop
35% are coming from mobile and so that's
important because most people start
their Journey from mobile and that is
growing and that's going to continue to
grow so you want to keep an eye on
mobile so to me this is one of the more
important reports under audience because
people who come from Mobile have a
different not only experience because
the website should be responsive to the
mobile device but their mindset is going
to be different they're actively looking
for something they're probably going to
either then follow up on their desktop
or follow up in person at your store or
they're probably looking for directions
or they may just call you so the
experience is a lot different on mobile
so we want to hone in on the growth of
mobile okay so to me this is one of the
more important reports in Google
analytics especially under audience so
let's move on to acquisition so
acquisition reporting tells us how the
traffic was driven to the website so if
audience tells us who is coming to the
website acquisition tells us how that
traffic got to the website and so really
what you want to do is get a sense of
what channels what marketing channels
are driving traffic so remember we
talked about organic search well those
search engines are indexing your pages
well how much of that traffic from the
search engines is actually coming to
your site and I'm a Believer in if
organic search is the primary driver of
traffic then you have a pretty healthy
website because that means the search
engines are indexing your pages people
are searching for something related to
your business you're being found you're
getting clicked and that represents a
majority of the traffic so that's always
a good thing so here we could see it
broken down by Channel if I go to all
traffic channels report I can see in my
Dimension that organic search represents
72% of my traffic and this is year to
date then I can see paid search then I
can see direct which means Somebody went
directly to the site I can see referral
email social then I can see more paid
search broken out so these are the
different marketing channels now
analytics allows you to look at a
specific source and medium so the source
would be the actual website or search
engine in the medium would differentiate
how that traffic actually got to the
site so if we're talking about a search
engine did they come to the site via
paid search or did they come to the site
via organic search and so all we need to
do is change our primary Dimension from
default Channel grouping to source of
medium and we can see specifically the
breakout of the different sources and
mediums driving traffic to the site so
here I can see Google organic at
71% and then Google CPC or C per click
at 15 16% of our traffic so then I can
look down I could see email in here
being organic I could see some referring
sites I could see some social in terms
of mobile Facebook okay so we could see
a mix of the different sources of
mediums driving traffic to the site okay
so you don't always have to look at
Channel per se you can look at it via
source and medium and if you're running
Google ads under acquisition analytics
has a whole section of Google ads
reporting so if you're running campaigns
on Google ads remember we looked at the
Keyword Planner in Google ads so if
you're running campaigns on Google ads
you can certainly see the performance of
those campaigns just by clicking on
campaigns we can also see campaigns
other campaigns that we're running so
remember the UTM tracking that we set up
for email
well we want to be able to track the
performance of email and any other non
gooogle campaign with UTM tracking so
when we do that we'll be able to go to
campaigns all campaigns and we'll be
able to see the campaign performance if
we look at source and medium we'll be
able to see what campaigns drove traffic
to the website so here I can see
vertical response email as a driver of
traffic so that's the campaign reporting
and then also if you have search console
so we looked at search console earlier
when we talked about SEO tools well
remember I said you can link up search
console with Google analytics well
here's search console and we could see
queries devices landing pages countries
so all the performance metrics that we
could see in search console because we
have it linked up with analytics we
could see it right here so this gives us
a nice
snapshot of what keywords are driving
traffic to the site organically I could
see The Impressions I could see the
clicks then I can see the click theay
and then the average position so in
theory the higher something ranks the
more traffic you're going to get so
that's the idea behind it we want to
make sure that we're ranking for our
coveted keywords and if we are we want
to be able to measure how many times our
listing was seen and how many times it
was clicked so that's the great thing
about you know Google they have a family
of products and those products tend to
talk to one another in the form of
Google search console and Google ads you
can connect them directly to Google
analytics so let's move from acquisition
to behavior so here in Behavior we have
a number of different reports so
Behavior tells us once the traffic
actually arrived at the website how are
they behaving and so really what I would
do is from there go to site content all
pages and so this gives us an idea of
how many pages were actually viewed so
site content all pages tells us what
page and how many times it was viewed
during a period of time and again we're
looking at year-to dat so I can see
engagement related metrics associated
with a page so this particular page here
on line one I could see how many pag P
Unique page use which is equal to
sessions so I can have a session come to
the website and look at a page multiple
times in that session I could see the
average time the person has spent on a
page and I can also see the balance rate
so a balance rate indicates that they
arrived on the page and didn't go any
further they left the website from that
page that they arrived on and so I can
also see percentage of exits meaning
what page did people exit the site from
so these are all engagement related
metrics so here is where I want to react
and optimize my website performance so I
if I see a page not performing well
meaning it has a high balce rate or
maybe low time on page then I'm probably
going to optimize it meaning test it or
change it to improve performance so
these are all pages but I could
certainly look at landing pages okay so
landing pages tells us the behavior of
the page when somebody landed on it so a
landing page means that somebody came
from organic search or Page search or
another Channel landed on this page so
here I could see this particular page on
line one had
4,970 sessions okay and I can also see
the performance of that page so
measuring engagements against pages is
definitely important because page isn't
performing in terms of bounce rate or
time on page then we want to be able to
make changes to that page to improve
performance okay there are some other
great reports under Behavior so we want
to go to sight speed we want to look at
how fast or how slow our Pages load so
this is important from an SEO
perspective because if a page isn't
loading very fast then chances of it
getting ranked in Google are not very
good so Google's organic sech search
basically takes page load time seriously
so if a page doesn't load very fast then
we need to be able to fix it so we can
go to page timings I can get a good
sense of the average page low time of a
particular page and what Google does
here is under speed suggestions they
actually will give me some ideas and
speed suggestions on how to address a
page that's loading very slow and so
when we load up the speed suest
suggestion report what Google does is
say hey we know that this page is
loading very slow the average page load
time is 15 seconds here's some
suggestions we're going to give you
seven suggestions so if you click on
that what's actually going to happen is
you're going to go to another tool
called page speed insights and Page
speed insights is analyzing the page as
you could see here and when it's done
analyzing the page it's going to give
you some feedback on how to improve page
load performance not only for desktop
but for mobile so here I can see if I
scroll down this is desktop and these
are some of the opportunities that I can
address when trying to improve the page
load time of that particular page so
here I could see there's some server
response time issues image sizes
probably need to be resized I can remove
unused CSS okay so there are a lot of
different things I can do to improve the
page lad time on this particular page
okay this is for desktop I can also see
mobile so mobile a lot of the same
issues so if we address these these
opportunities then we could see a lift
in page low time when you see a lift in
page low time we're going to probably
see a lift in organic rankings or even
user engagement because if a page takes
a long time to load a user is probably
not going to stay on that page very long
so to me sight speed is an important
report under Behavior now one more
report here that I want to point out
under behavior is events and to me
events are important so if you're trying
to measure engagement on your website
you need to make sure you have event
tracking set up and when we talk about
event tracking we're talking about
measuring things that analytics doesn't
measure by default so if you have a
button on your website if you have a PDF
download if you have a submit button on
a form submission if you have a
subscribe button if you have a video if
you have an external link anything that
is going to trigger engagement on your
website you need to measure with event
tracking and event tracking is simply
set up by breaking out the event into a
category an action and a label and so
here we could see for our particular
website we have Cate C is already set up
for event tracking so here for example I
can see on line six video I can see how
many people actually watched our video
okay so here's the action video Start
okay so over this period of time I could
see I had 49 unique events 50 total so
that's how many people actually watched
the video and you can always revert to
label and that'll tell you what page
people watched in this case the video so
event tracking is important because we
want to be able to measure engagement so
if you go to events under behavior and
you don't see any events listed you
probably need to get that set up and
that is set up through Google tag
manager so what you want to do is you
want to be able to set up your events
through Google tag manager which is
another Google platform but you
certainly want to do that so that's
where you set up your events when you
set up your events for your website with
a category and action and label you'll
be able to measure those events in
analytics under Behavior under events
and the important thing here is you'll
be able to measure engagement so I'll be
able to see how many people came to the
site and how many people clicked on a
button downloaded a PDF uh submitted a
form uh played a video did whatever we
wanted them to do so events are
important so let's move from Behavior to
conversions and this is important
because we want to be able to measure
conversions on a website so analytics
has four types of conversions so if I go
to admin down at the bottom and then I
go to goals I could see that I have four
different types of goals that I can use
now right now I have event related goals
setup for the website for this
particular website so we just talked
about event tracking so if you're
measuring a button click on your website
you can certainly turn that into a goal
and so all you need to do is tell
analytics hey this is the particular
category this is the particular action
so for example if I click on this
particular goal and take a look at it I
can see that we have a category set up
that anything that resembles donate now
okay or donate go ahead and fire this
event as a conversion okay so event is
one type of goal another type of goal is
destination so if somebody goes to a
specific page like a confirmation page
we can turn that into a goal so here I
could see if somebody goes to donation
dasc confirmation then analytics is
going to fire that goal as a conversion
and we're going to see a conversion
against a different metric or different
dimension like Channel or audience okay
so destination is the second type of
goal the third type of goal is duration
so how long did somebody stay on my
website so in this example if they
stayed at least 1 minute and 30 seconds
or more then analytics is going to count
that as a goal conversion okay so
duration is the third type and then the
fourth type is pages per session okay so
if I look at this example here if a user
came to my website and looked at more
than three pages in that particular
session then analytics is going to fire
a goal conversion so four types of goals
you don't have to set up all four
different types my recommendation is at
least to have one goal set up if you're
not sure what goal to set up then at
least set up a duration or pages per
session okay so at least you can measure
how long somebody stays on your website
or how many pages they went to okay so
when you actually do have these goals
set up you can go back into conversions
we can go back into goals we can go back
into overview and we can measure our
goal completions over this period of
time so here I can see 313 goal
completions total with a goal conversion
rate of 1.88% and then I can see it
broken down by go type so remember the
only goals I have available and set up
are event related goals so 69 newsletter
signups 156 donate click buttons I have
32 contact form submissions 37 email
click completions and then 11 phone
number click completions so I can
measure engagement as a goal and so
goals generally are important to the
business so you want to make sure that
if you have a goal for your website then
you want to be able to set that up as a
goal in Google analytics so that way
when you're looking at example channels
if I go back to my channels report I can
then measure Channel by goal conversion
so these are all goals but if I want to
look at for example how many people from
organic search clicked on the Donate Now
button I could see that I could see
year-to dat 10,880
seven users which meant 11,000 sessions
76 clicked on that donate Now button and
that's comes out to
65% conversion rate okay so that's
important so you want to be able to
measure any Dimension whether that be
Channel Source medium keyword campaign
mobile device could be
demographic uh gender or age you want to
be able to measure any dimension against
the goals you have set up so you can
measure performance and that also
includes Pages or landing pages as well
so that's a quick overview of what you
can expect to see in Google analytics
again audience acquisition behavior and
conversions there a lot of data in
Google analytics but you want to be able
to take advantage of the data in order
to improve website performance now let's
jump over to YouTube analytics because
if you have videos on YouTube if you
have a channel set up some playlist
you'll be able to get some really good
insights as to how your videos
performing and so here I could see I'm
in YouTube all I did was I went to my
account then I went to the beta the
studio version of YouTube and then from
there I went to analytics so my account
YouTube Studio analytics and analytics
here is going to give me all sorts of
information about my videos okay so here
I can see over the last 28 days my
videos produced over 8,600 views my
watch time in minutes totaled over
177,000 and I've netted 48 subscribers
and this is an overall okay so I can
actually see when I publish videos and I
can see the date they were published and
here I'm looking at you know total views
over this particular date range I can
also see specifics on a particular video
so I could see the top video in terms of
minutes here I could see this particular
video had 602 minutes over the last 28
days so here I could see views on a
particular video so this is just an
overview I could certainly look at some
other information if I click on reach
viewers I can see the total impression
so how many times my video was viewed or
how many people looked at it okay and
then the click theough rate so here I
can see the different traffic sources so
29% came externally okay here I can see
25% came within YouTube itself I could
see how many times a video was viewed
and played via playlist via suggested
videos so I could see different ways in
which the traffic found my video and
actually watched it here I can see
externally
how people were able to find my videos
and I could see 46% found it via Google
search see some lots of information here
uh about sources of traffic how the
traffic got to these videos so I could
see then once the traffic found my
videos how many times they actually saw
it and viewed it and then watched it so
that's how many times I was able to
reach viewers via different sources and
then their reaction to that how many
times they saw it and watched it here I
can click on interest viewers so again I
can see the top videos in terms of watch
time I could see the top playlist so
here I could see my partner playlist
with the top playlist so I can see some
interest here in terms of average view
duration and then here we have build an
audience so we can look at specific
audiences if we have them built in
YouTube to see how many people actually
watch my videos so here I can see 88% of
the people who watched my videos over
the last 28 days were not even
subscribed so that tells me a lot of
people are finding my videos spending
some time watching them but they're not
subscribe so we're trying to get them to
subscribe to our channel so they can
watch more so a lot of information here
in YouTube itself about how our videos
performed again this is good Insight
because ideally what you want to do is
you really want to take a look at a
specific video see how it's performing
so if I just click on one particular
video I can actually see the audience
retention over the course of the video
itself I could see the ways in which
people found the video okay again
externally or via YouTube search I could
see how many people liked it or disliked
it I could see all sorts of information
on a particular video itself or an
overview of my channel so that's all
available to you in YouTube analytics
under YouTube studio so take advantage
that so if you're publishing videos on a
regular basis you want to cone in on how
your videos are performing so if you
have any additional questions about
YouTube analytics or YouTube in general
take a look at our video that we created
earlier this year about how to create a
YouTube channel we go into some indepth
insights into YouTube itself especially
YouTube analytics so take a look at that
video and if you have any other insights
about YouTube analytics or analytics in
general go ahead and put a comment below
this video so let's turn our attention
to competitor spine tools very important
to keep tabs on what the competition's
doing and there are a lot of tools out
there so when it comes to social we can
use a premium tool like Sprout social to
listen in on our comp comp itors we can
use another freemium tool social blade
there's a popular tool out there called
spyfu that's freemium as well MZ we
looked at Moz earlier for keyword
organic Moz is a great tool for also
leveraging our competitors in terms of
backlinks and Buzz Sumo so that's
another freemium tool get there are lots
of tools out there these are just
examples of some of the tools that we
use here at simply learn I use
personally and profession
to get a sense of what our competition's
doing so why would we want to use a
competitor spy tool well it may sound
like a very straightforward question but
there are lots of reasons why and so
let's look at some of these reasons and
the first reasons we really want to
identify you know our competitor's
backlinks and monitor changes in their
ranking so the reason why we have this
is the top bullet point is because SEO
organic search is a long-term strategy
on page off page website very technical
and creative there's a lot going on with
SEO a lot going on and sometimes it
takes a long time to rank for something
and a lot of SEO does depend on
relevancy relevancy being how many
quality back links are linked to you so
it's always good to leverage what your
competitors are doing so you can see how
you stack up and so that's why this is
up there as number one we want to be
able to really take a look at what our
competitors are doing another example
would be hey how much uh traffic a
competitor is gaining on certain
keywords this could go either way for
paid search organic search what are
competitors bidding on are they really
getting traffic from those keywords so
there are tools out there that help us
leverage what our competition's doing
okay we can also identify our
competitors top performing content for
Relevant topics okay we can determine
what our competitor's website refer PE
traffic is okay we can pull our
competitor's data and compare it with
our own campaigns so lots of tools out
there to help you do this and we may
want to track the total amount of clicks
a competitor receives and how much they
pay for each keyword so let's go and
take a look at a few examples how we can
leverage all these bullet points that we
just discussed and so we're going to
start out with Sprout social and Sprout
social is a tool I use it's a social
media platform there's a lot of things
you can do with Sprout social definitely
generate reports for your social media
platforms you could set up post that get
published at a certain time and day but
there's also one particular tool in here
called listening and so what we could do
is we just put in for example RV rentals
in Twitter so what we're doing is we're
actually listening to see who else is
tweeting about RV rentals so we could do
this for Twitter we could do it Facebook
some other social media platforms the
whole idea here on Sprout social is to
get a sense of what our competitors are
doing so we could have easily put in a
brand name we're just going General here
because we want to rank for the keyword
RV rentals and so here we could take a
look at you know what some of these
particular brands are doing like go RV
rentals Cruise America RV we could see
just scroll down and we can get a sense
of in particular what people are
tweeting about what other companies are
tweeting when it comes to this
particular keyword RV rentals now if I
want to hone in on a particular
competitor I could just really refine my
search for that competitor's brand name
so RV share so here I can take a look at
you know what they're doing when they're
posting TW or tweeting how long ago the
time of day get an idea of what they're
actually saying what campaigns they're
promoting okay I can get a sense of
everything about this tweet and so here
I can scroll down and I can see what's
been shared by other people for this
particular brand and I can see a lot of
people are as an example retweeting this
particular giveaway and so to me it just
gives me a sense in this particular
example on Twitter as to what are
competitors doing okay let's turn our
attention to SEO so remember at first
bullet point we want to get a sense of
what our competitors are doing doing
when it comes to backlinks and so Moz
has a great tool called link Explorer
and Link Explorer there allows us to
actually compare link profiles so for my
domain I can go ahead and put my
competitor's domains in there and
definitely get a sense of you know how
many links my competitors have external
in internal I can get a sense of the
domain Authority I can get a sense of
page Authority linking domains so I can
really do a a comparison across my
domain and my competitor's domains to
get a snapshot of how I compare against
my competitors so this gives me an
overview of everything I need to know
organically now Moz also has another
great tool under link Explorer called
link intersect and I like link intersect
I use it a lot because if our
competitors really have a number of
external links and domains pointing to
their site and they have a better domain
Authority and Page Authority then you
know I want to be able to you know see
what they're doing where they're linking
who's linking to them I want to get be
able to get a snapshot of why is their
domain so much better than ours in terms
of authority and so the link intersect
actually allows me to do that so I can
go ahead and put my competitor's domains
in there and then I can find
Opportunities and so you just click on
opportunities and you could see where my
site intersects with their site and if
it doesn't actually intersect then I
have an opportunity to actually try and
get a link on that particular site so
that's what the link intersect report
does it allows me to see where my links
intersect with my competitors and if it
doesn't intersect then I have an
opportunity to generate a back link so
that's ideally what the L link intersect
tool is in mod it allows me to really
get a sense of you know where I'm
linking and where my competitor is
linking now what we can also do is also
take advantage of another report under
moz's link Explorer and the discovered
and lost report so we could put in our
domain or we can put even our
competitor's domain in there and we can
get a sense of what domains were found
and linked to them so really within mods
we can get a good snapshot of what web
sites are linking to our competitors we
get a good snapshot of the overall links
to our competitor sites and specifically
what sites so the whole idea is if it's
good for our competitors meaning they're
linking from a site that has good domain
Authority and low spam score then it's
probably a site I want to be able to
tackle as well okay so you have
discovered and lost okay you have
comparing link profiles and you have
link intersect so those are three good
reports you can leverage right in mz's
link Explorer tool now there's one more
report we can leverage in MZ and that's
the inbound links report and so we can
go ahead and type in our competitor's
domain here and again we can get a
snapshot of what their domain Authority
is Page Authority for the homepage but
really this is what we're after linking
domain so this particular domain has
over 9,000 linking domains so what we
can do is actually go through and see
BAS based on domain Authority I could
sort by domain Authority where these
pages are being linked from and so here
I can see reddit reddit reddit so a lot
of Reddit here which is a good site for
backlinking New York Times so you know
there's a lot of different uh sites here
Washington Post so I can get a good
snapshot of my competitor by seeing
every link that's pointing to them now
of course I don't want to go through
9,000 links I can really just tone in on
a specific link Source or link type or
link state so I can really filter it if
I wanted to I can export the report and
do some further analysis but really the
whole idea here as I can see what URL is
linking to this particular competitor
site what the anchor text is what the
page and domain Authority is so this
gives me a really really good Insight on
all the backlinking that my competitor
has and again if I'm trying to catch my
competitor it's probably not a bad idea
to look at what they're doing and even
copy what they're doing in terms of
backlinking so if we're not on Reddit
then we probably need to be on Reddit
because if that's where our competitor
is and they're getting good link juice
from Reddit which has a domain authority
of 90 then hey if it's good for the
goose it's good for the gander so they
say so inbound links is just another
good report you can leverage in MZ under
the link Explorer reporting tool now if
I want to get a good snapshot as to what
my competitor is doing on search exactly
well look no further than spy Fu so
spyfu is a another tool that you can
leverage from a PPC SEO perspective you
know from an SEO perspective you got
some backlinking data as well just like
you did in Moz from a PPC perspective
you can get some good keyword insights
and so here I just went ahead and typed
in the domain and what this is going to
do is just give me an overall snapshot
for my competitor's domain so here I
could see you know how many organic
keywords they're found for the estimated
monthly SEO clicks they're getting based
on the volume of those keywords okay I
can see here the keywords their top
competitors also rank for the rank
history 12 years so this particular
domain's been around a long time okay so
that's on the organic side I can flip
over to the paid side and I can see that
there are doing paid search I could see
5,000 plus keywords they're bidding on
he based on that what they're actually
paying and then I could see you know
some of the other competitors listed
here from a paid perspective and an
organic perspective I could see the
shared keyword overlap and now again you
can pay for this cuz it's premium and
get some really good insights as to how
your domain compares to your competitors
so I'm using the free version and here
the free version spy fu is just giving
me some overall data on the specific
domain I entered in and so I entered in
my competitors you can certainly enter
in your own domain to get a sense of
organic keywords and paid keywords so
you can see top keywords top paid
keywords okay this is Google ads okay so
this is what recommendations as to what
to purchase okay here you can see some
even some Google ads history I could see
exactly what ad copy my competitor
actually wrote and for what keyword and
then I can see some organic ranking
history here as I keep scrolling down
this overview report so I can see for RV
rent where they rank and then I can see
inbound links just like I did in mods
spy fu is providing me with some insight
as to hey what links are pointing to
them and what the domain strength is and
how many clicks they expect to receive
so this is all free data take or leave
it but it's all free data available to
you under spy so spyfu gives you kind of
an overview for free some really
in-depth analysis if you actually pay
for it and it just really hones in on
what your competitors are bidding for
paid wise and what they're ranking for
organic wise and so spy fu is a really
good tool to leverage if you just want
to get a snapshot of how your competitor
uh overlaps with you so let's turn our
attention to Google Analytics because in
Google analytics under audience I can go
to benchmarking and basically the
benchmarking reports allows me to see
what the industry as a whole is doing
compared to my own website now the cavat
here on this particular report is that
it's all Anonymous data so I can't
exactly see what competitor is doing
what in this report but if I hone in on
my industry in this case Auto and
vehicles and I hone in on a specific
country or adjust the size of the daily
sessions that I get then I can see hey
analytics in this case in this example
is sharing
8,863 web properties okay so they're
sharing the data for over 8,000 web
properties and I can compare those web
properties against my own so we're all
in the same industry it gives me a sense
here as to how I stack up against the
industry as a whole in this case as it
pertains to channels so you can see here
red not good green is good so in the
industry we're not doing as good as
others in the same industry who are
receiving the same amount of sessions
now we could certainly adjust and we can
adjust our local and if we do that
Google's going to be able to adjust how
many web properties are actually
contributing to the report and so so
when analytics makes that adjustment
we're going to be able to see in this
case just New Zealand so we're going to
adjust for New Zealand and we're going
to go with
4,999 and so we could see there are
about you know 300 something web
properties contributing 47 web
properties now contributing to this
report so if we're focused on the New
Zealand region and this is the amount of
traffic we get we're now comparing us
against 47 other Anonymous web
properties so now if I go back to the
report after I've honed in I'm looking
at channels and I could see how many
sessions we're getting by channels and
how I compare against the competition I
can also measure up against percentage
of new sessions new users pages per
session average session duration bounce
rate but that's just channels I can also
do location and devices so the whole
idea behind this report is yes you're
not honing in on a particular particular
competitor but you're honing in on your
industry so you're getting a good idea
as to how you comper against your
industry just by making some adjustments
in the benchmarking report you obviously
want to make sure you're looking at the
same industry adjust for your country or
region adjust for the site size meaning
how many sessions you actually get on a
daily basis and then analytics will do
the rest they'll compare you against
those in your industry and so I find
this to be good tool because it allows
me to stack up our site against those in
the industry and obviously if we're not
driving as many sessions especially say
from organic then we have our work cut
out for us okay so that's the whole idea
behind the benchmarking report now if
you want to get some good insight as to
what the competitors are doing and you
don't want to use a tool well look no
further you can always go to google.com
Okay so this is how we used to do it
back in the day before all these tools
became available you just typed in a
keyword and we're going to type in RV
rentals and now we're going to be able
to see who's bidding on that keyword so
we could see we have a number of
different uh companies bidding on the
keyword we're interested in okay here I
can see some featured Snippets okay and
then I can see some organic search
results okay if I scroll down I'll be
able to see some other companies bidding
on that sinky word meaning they're
paying for RV rentals so if I clicked on
somebody's link here they're actually
going to pay Google for the click and so
this just gives me a good sense of you
know how many people are actually trying
to rank for this keyword or trying to be
found for this keyword so that's all I
did I just did a search now from an
organic perspective if you really want
to hone in on your competition you can
always do the syntax all and title colon
and then hit enter so now I could see I
have have 163,000 results and what does
that tell me that tells me that I have
163,000 websites with RV rentals in the
title tag so if you're trying to
optimize for the keyword RV rentals as
an example then you know that you have
163,000 different listings ahead of you
that you need to jump over in order to
rank for the keyword RV rentals so using
the All entitle syntax and the keyword
right after that actually just gives you
a more accurate picture of how many
sites are actually ahead of you for
particular keyword so that's the whole
idea so if I get rid of the syntax and
you can see for RV rentals I have 132
million but that's not really accurate
because not all these listings have the
keyword RV rentals in the title Tag and
Title tag if you're working on organic
search is one of the key important
factors for ranking so you need to have
that keyword in the title tag so that's
the whole idea behind using the All and
title syntax it gives us a good idea as
to what our competition's doing and how
many sites we have to jump over to get
to number one on Google Now if you're
running Google ads just as we did with
RV rentals we went up there and we saw
we typed that in as a query and we saw
how many advertisers there were for RV
rentals now if we are running our own
campaigns Google ads actually has a good
report that I really like it's called
auction insights and so you can get to
auction insights just by clicking on
campaigns and then from campaigns click
on auction insights and what auction
insights allows us to see is what
competitors or domains are bidding on
the same keywords we are and so what
Google does here is it allows us to
actually see where we stack up against
our competition for all the keywords
we're bidding on and so here I'm looking
at year to date and here we can see us
and I can see our competitors okay so I
can see impression share so for if we're
talking about one key word every key
word has 100% impression share how much
of that impression share are you getting
and when we say impression share meaning
eyeballs when we talk about eyeballs are
we getting a majority of the eyeballs or
are competitors getting majority of the
eyeballs so we can see our average
position I can see how often I overlap
with my competitors okay I can see how
often I'm above a particular competitor
I could see what percentage I'm at the
top of the page versus my competitors
the absolute top of page rate and then I
can see how often I outrank my
competitors and vice versa how often my
competitors outrank me so I can see all
this good insight as to what competitors
are bidding on the same keywords I am
okay so this is if you're running Google
ads okay so if you're running Google ads
okay you can just click on the auction
insights report you can find that the
top navigation just by clicking on
campaigns and by doing so you'll be able
to gain some insights as to where you
stack up from a paid search perspective
against your competitors so let's turn
our attention to paid marketing tools so
if you're doing some advertising on
Google B LinkedIn you probably want to
work within those platforms as the tool
of choice so you know if you're doing
PID search on say Google search.com or
display you could be doing display
advertising on you know a network like
ad roll or Google or you could be doing
social media paid ads say on Facebook so
whatever it is you're doing you probably
want to work within that platform itself
to get the ideal data that you need okay
so here are some of the tools some of
the places you can go of course if you
work in Google ads you also have Google
ads editor that you can leverage okay
and I'll show you that in a couple
minutes you have Google ads Keyword
Planner of course both of these are paid
if you're running campaigns okay so Bing
if you're running campaigns on Bing okay
you get all this good data that you can
digest through some reporting okay you
also have some third party tools out
there that you also have to pay for in
word stream Okay so word streams a
thirdparty tool that you can leverage
Bing and Google are actual advertising
Network so you would advertise on the
platform itself and get all the data you
need right in the platform and leverage
a lot of the tools that they have
available in the platform as I mentioned
you could also use Google ads editor uh
so Bing also has their own editor as
well so and as well as Facebook so you
can use an editor type version and I'll
sh that here in a couple minutes but
let's talk about why we want to use the
tools in the platform itself well we
want to be able to monitor how our ads
performing so which ad receives the most
traffic as an example we want to
identify keywords that are performing
for us okay so are keywords converting
not converting are they cost us a lot of
money and not netting a high enough
return for us so we want to keep an eye
on that okay so we want to monitor our
cost okay across different locations and
devices not only cost but we want to
also monitor how our ads are performing
across different locations and devices
keywords across different locations and
devices so we want to be able to measure
by device okay so we also want to
analyze competitor's data and as we
showed you in the competitor section
Google as an example has auction
insights reporting analytics has
benchmarking so Google itself does
provide some information in the case of
auction insights as to how uh your
competitors are performing against you
on Google search so that's on the paid
search side then you have display okay
so display advertisements okay you're
across a different network so they're
different types of networks out there
for example ad roll okay you have ctio
SRA is another paid vers version of or
paid tool you can use in wide orbit so
these are some of the paid marketing
tools you can leverage of course I like
to stay if I'm advertising on Google I
like to stay uh in Google ads and
measure my display performance that way
but if you're on ad roll for example
then you want to leverage ad rolls
reporting platform and some of the tools
they have to offer so if we look at
display why do we want to leverage some
of these tools well just like search for
example where we want to look at keyword
and AD performance same kind of concept
here we want to be able to monitor
whether we have the right keywords and
right customer engagement so when when
it comes to display we want to be able
to make sure we're choosing the right
audience of course that means looking at
not only audience insights but our
Target insights as well are we reaching
the Right audience when it comes to
display and Google has a good breakdown
that I'm going to be able to show you
here in a couple minutes okay so we want
to improve our campaigns by monitoring
our competitor's display ads as well so
there are tools available that'll help
you do that and that's on the display
side and if we look at Social okay why
what tools can we use on social well you
got Facebook ads manager okay you got ad
espresso qu tweey you got all these cool
paid search tools again I usually stick
with where I'm advertising so so if I'm
advertising on LinkedIn or Twitter I'm
going to leverage that platform but just
know that there are other tools
available for you so with social like
display it's all about targeting our
audience so for these some of the tools
like on Facebook we can review and
relaunch or ad campaigns based on target
audience we can measure conversions and
gain insights in this example about
Facebook users how are our users
interacting with our ads and then we
want to Target People based on their
activities such as purchase intent
device usage travel pre preferences Etc
so social allows us to do that and then
with Facebook as an example we can
monitor any AB test we run for example
if we're running call to action test we
can measure the results of that right in
Facebook and I'm going to show you an
example of that here shortly so let's
jump right into Google ads and look at
some tools available to us from the
search side of the house so if we're
running search campaigns right in Google
ads we could see campaign data we could
see keyword data we could see ad data so
for example if I want to see what ads
are performing I'm just going to click
on my ads and extensions okay and here
are my ads and now I could see what ads
are performing in terms of clicks click
through rates Etc and so that way I can
go ahead and pause it ads activate ads
so that's right here in the Google ads
uh platform itself now if I want to look
at specific keywords I can do that so I
can see what keywords are driving
traffic and clicks here I can just sort
by clicks and now I could see not only
what keywords are driving clicks I could
see what the click the rate is I can see
the Impressions how many people actually
viewed my ad after click typing in a
keyword query that I'm bidding on
I could see how much I've paid by
keyword and more importantly I want to
be able to see conversions or conversion
rate and then with Google ads you have
quality score so we want to be able to
measure quality score so this is a
Google ads keyword reporting and so the
great thing about the keyword reporting
is that there's some other features
available to me here so here I can add
negative keywords okay okay just by
clicking on negative keywords I can also
see a Search terms report and so when it
comes to search terms I can actually see
what specific keywords people typed in
and based on the keyword that somebody
typed in as a query I can see what match
type triggered that particular ad and so
if I see a keyword query that I don't
particularly care to be shown for or
want my ad shown for then I can go ahead
just select it and I can add it as a
negative keyword okay so that tool is
available to you right in Google ads
okay and then you have the auction
insights so we' reviewed the auction
insights when we're looking at
competitive analysis and so here if we
look at the auction insights we'll be
able to adjust our date range and we'll
be able to see basically you know who
else is bidding on the keywords and what
the impression share is what their
average position is what their overlap
rate is position above right top of page
absolute top of page right now ranking
share so once we have Google has data
then they'll be able to share that
information with you okay so that's just
keywords but there's a cool tool that I
really like and I leverage it for SEO
and paperclick and that's Google's
Keyword Planner so if you click on tools
and then you click on Keyword Planner
we'll be able to Leverage The Keyword
Planner and the whole idea behind the
Keyword Planner is do we want to
discover new keywords or for the
keywords we have selected we can get
volume and forecast on that so here
let's type in a keyword mail delivery
and if I click get started okay so
Google's going to give me some other
keyword ideas and they're going to give
me what the average monthly searches are
for that keyword they're going to let me
know the competition they're going to
give me a range in terms of how much I
can expect to pay for that keyword so if
I happen to click on that keyword I can
add it to a plan and then once I've
added to a plan then I can go ahead and
look at that plan and measure what kind
of volume I'm going to get and how much
I can expect to pay so now once I've
added my keyword to that plan I can go
ahead and see how many clicks and
Impressions and costs and click the rate
and average cost per click I can expect
to spend so and this is based on a
maximum CPC of $2 so I can go ahead and
adjust my plan accordingly if I want to
in order to see basically how much I can
expect to spend so that's the whole idea
behind the Keyword Planner in terms of
choosing new keywords and once you
choose keywords you're interested in
bidding on you can actually do a
forecast to see exactly how much you can
expect to spend how many clicks how many
Impressions you can expect to get and if
you have have conversions set up how
many conversions you can expect to
receive so that's all part of Google's
keyword plan that's viewing forecast as
well as choosing keywords so there are
so many different tools and features
within Google ads we need a whole whole
segment just on this so really I'm just
going to highlight some of the more
important tools and features so I
mentioned the Keyword Planner I
mentioned the campaigns keywords and ads
reports another thing I would look at in
Google ads again we mentioned this as
one of our key to finding why would we
use it bullet point and that's because
of devices so we mentioned devices why
would we use Google ads reporting tool
because we want to look at devices and
we want to be able to see what devices
are driving traffic from what campaign
and then the cool thing about Google ads
is right in Google ads platform you can
go ahead and do a bit adjustment so if I
increase my bid adjustment for example
on mobile phones then my particular ad
in this particular campaign is going to
show more than on computer so I can
always decrease it for example do a bit
adjustment on computer and that means
I'm going to show my ads less so I can
go ahead and do bid adjustments based on
device that's the cool thing of working
right in Google ads platform is you can
make adjustments right here in the
platform form based on devices well you
also have locations too so we mentioned
that as one of the reasons why we want
to use some of these tools and if I see
a particular location I'm not interested
in advertising well I can always select
it and I can always just pause it or
remove it so or I can change the bid
adjustment on a location as well so I
can make a lot of different changes
right in the Google ads platform for
those season in search advertising paid
search advertising especially on Google
ads you can always use Google ads editor
all you need to do is just do a search
for Google ads editor you can download
it so basically what Google ads editor
is it's a it's a tool it's the software
that you work your C with your campaigns
on locally so you're making changes to
your campaigns on your computer and
basically when you're done making
changes you can always upload them to
Google ads to the account on Google ads
in the cloud so to speak so that's the
whole idea behind Google ads editor it's
a great tool for you to use if you want
to make household changes really quick
for example I'm looking at an account
with a bunch of campaigns so now if I
click on one of those campaigns I could
see the ad groups here okay so for
example I just want to turn off all
these ad groups I can just highlight
them all and just click status enabled
to pause and I can rever back if I want
to okay so you can make household
changes so here I could see the campaign
the add group level if I choose an add
group then I can see some keyword and
again I can make changes at nauseum here
I can copy I can paste I can delete okay
so I can make a lot of changes really
quick right in Google ads editor and
that's the whole point of editor is to
go ahead and work locally while somebody
else is working working locally on the
same account you could both be working
simultaneously and being more efficient
on getting things done in the campaign
now if you are working with somebody
else on the campaign you want to make
sure that you get recent changes so if I
say get recent changes to all campaigns
what Google editor is going to do is
contact Google ads in the cloud and
download all those changes so here I can
see the changes being downloaded in
editor from Google ads and when it's
done it's going to highlight all the
changes that have been made and so once
I'm done reviewing those changes I can
go ahead and click done and now I know I
have the recent latest changes in editor
so now I can go ahead and continue to
make some changes and when I'm done
making changes I can go ahead and post
them so that's the beauty of Google ads
editor Bing has a version Facebook has a
version it allows you to again go at the
keyword level the add group level okay
you can look at ads itself and make
changes to the ads okay you could do a
lot of different things right an editor
in fact you could do pretty much most of
what you can do in Google ads you can do
in Google ads editor and so that's
Google ads Editor to me I would
recommend it if you're experienced with
Google ads again it's software you have
to download it you're going to use it on
your computer as software but when you
make changes all you need to do is post
those changes or get recent changes that
have been made on Google ads and so
that's Google editor ads editor in
summary now let's go back into Google
ads and talk about display advertising
because display is a different network
but the platform is still the same and
some of the same tools are available
from the search Network as well as for
the Display Network writing Google ads
so if I want to take a look at a
campaign and AD group on the Display
Network I can just click on that ad
group and can look at the ads that are
running for that particular ad group on
the Display Network so here the
difference being on the display network
is you can use image ads on the search
Network you can only use text ads so
here I can look at image ads and I can
see how they're performing in fact you
could even go a step further and use
responsive display ads so Google has
responsive display ads meaning it's
going to respond to to what's performing
best okay and so now I could see clicks
Impressions click theate Etc right on on
my ads and extensions report in Google
ads platform now this happens to be
retargeting campaign so if we click on
audiences we'll be able to see what
audiences we're targeting here okay so
when this report loads when you run
retargeting campaigns you're targeting a
specific audience and so we want to be
able to see okay of the audiences we
have set up what audience is performing
best okay so here I can see a Breakout
by audience again I could see the same
metrics I could see on the search side I
could see clicks Impressions click the
rate more importantly I want to be able
to measure conversions okay so that's
the whole idea when you're in these
platforms and you're paying for ads is
you want to be able to measure against
conversions and you can also measure
against cost per conversion conversion
rate okay so those are some key metrics
to measure up against whether it's
audience keyword add whatever the
dimension is so here on the Display
Network we can get a sense of
demographics okay so unlike the search
Network the Display Network allows us to
see demographic data and so now I could
see an age breakout or an age range
breakout that Google provides us and I
can see again based on on the age range
breakout which age range has the most
clicks Impressions Etc including
conversions so you also have the
opportunity on the Display Network to
add keywords you have the opportunity to
add topics and you have the opportunity
to see placements or run placements so
here if I click on where ADS have shown
I can actually see where my ads have
shown up for this display campaign and
Google ads allows you ability to go
ahead and you can exclude it from the a
group or exclude a specific placement
from a campaign so you could take action
on a specific placement and I can see
the type of placement whether it's a
mobile app whether it's a site I can go
ahead and see exactly where that
placement was so that's the placements
report you have demographics you have
audiences you have keywords you have all
these different reports available to you
on the Google ads platform so before we
jump over to social media paid search
advertising I just want to remind you we
do have you know a nice tutorial on
Google ads okay so take a look at the
Google ads tutorial we have set up on
YouTube okay if you search for Google
ads tutorial 2019 this is a good uh
tutorial on everything related to Google
ads so check out this video because in
today's webinar we're just mentioning
tools across the board and if you are
advertising on Google ads as most people
do then you you could see just how
powerful it is and all the different
features that are available so take a
look at the video it's a nice
complimentary video to this one this
digital marketing tools and this will
give you a nice in deeper insight into
everything that's available on Google
ads and if you have any tools or
features on Google ads whether it's the
search Network or whether that's the
Display Network then feel free to
comment below this video happy to hear
your comments about what tools and
reports and features you specifically
use in Google ads so let's move into uh
Facebook ads manager and show you how
the platform looks when you're running
ads on Facebook so we can look at all
the different tools and reports
available here so here we could see if
we're in the Facebook ads manager
we could see our campaigns we can see
our adsets and we can see our ads so
just like on Google ads you have less
side navigation so we can drill down so
if we want to see ad sets for example we
could just click on ad sets that are
showing up in this particular account
and here we can see we have two ad sets
that are live so if I click on one of
these ad sets I'll be able to see an
actual ad that's running here and so for
the actual ad that's running I can then
see the results of that ad and how it's
performing for example you know how many
clicks it's received what the reach is
what the impressions are so Impressions
similar to Google ads how many people
are actually looking at the app and then
I can see the cost per click here at $1
as an example and so now I can go in and
I can go ahead and look at the ad
performance and go ahead and change out
that ad if it's not performing to my
expectation so if I click on more tools
and then creatives I can just simply
click on creatives and then I can
actually see the creatives I actually
have running for that campaign I
selected so now I can see all the
creatives that are running and I can see
the results of those creatives so
Facebook ads manager also has uh
different reporting so if I click on the
reports pull down menu you could see
here I could see some stand reports by
ad add set age and gender and then I can
see all reports here listed out by
placement by placement and device time
of day country Etc so if we just look at
age and gender we'll be able to get a
breakout age and gender here so you can
see by campaign I'm looking at all
campaigns here and I'm looking at just
age and gender I can certainly deselect
one of these and I can look at a
specific time range so now I could see
who's looking at my ad specifically so
here I could see 35 to 44 female I can
see the reach Impressions and how often
they're actually seeing my ad now this
is key for Facebook because if
somebody's seing your ad a lot they're
probably going to tune out to it so
that's what makes the frequency metric
so important on Facebook because then we
can go ahead and you know turn off off
that particular age and gender if we
needed to and we could see how much we
spent so this just gives you some idea
of the type of reporting that's
available in Facebook ads manager now
the great thing about Facebook uh
reporting an ads manager is you know I
can group or ungroup uh my Dimensions if
I needed to I could change the view and
arrange columns and can get rid of
columns just as you would in Google ads
reporting very similar stature here so I
have a lot of flexibility here on how I
review the reports you know you got
different metrics that you can pick and
choose as well okay and you got lots of
different flexibility when you're
looking at the reports on how your
campaigns are performing now here I can
pick and choose I can choose campaign
adset ads objective again I can choose
different demographics so I have a lot
of options available to me in terms of
how I want to you know view the
performance of my campaign view the
performance of my adset or my ad now
remember if you're in Facebook you can
always go in and edit the campaign you
can edit the adet remember in the adset
that's where a lot of your decisions are
going to be made including how you want
to drive the traffic okay what your
budget is okay you can basically choose
your audience here so you're going to be
able to choose what type of campaign
it's going to be and based on that
campaign you're going to go ahead and
choose the kind of audience you want to
focus in on you're going to be able to
choose the location the age range the
gender so all of this is going to be set
up in the ad set or the campaign or the
ad if you go ahead and edit an ad
remember you can do AB testing as well
so you have a lot of different options
and features available to you write an
ads manager when you're managing your
paid search campaigns on Facebook so if
you want some more information about all
the different features and tools and
Facebook ads manager check out the
Facebook ads tutorial
2019 uh webinar that we did earlier this
year in addition you can also look at
another one that we did on Facebook
called Facebook advertising tips and
strategies so that should give you some
sense of of everything related to
Facebook ads and how to take advantage
of the Facebook ads manager platform so
if there's anything on social that we
may have missed or that you use feel
free to add a comment below the video
we'd love to hear your feedback okay
let's talk about some affiliate
marketing tools let's turn our attention
affiliate marketing lot of filium
marketing platforms out there the number
one probably is Commission Junction also
known as CJ they're an affiliate
platform they have an fremium model
meaning you can have a free trial but
basically you're going to have to move
on and pay for the platform likewise for
house offers you have volume you really
when it comes to affiliate marketing a
lot of platforms out there click Inc A1
so a lot of these are Brokers per se and
when I say Brokers like for example with
CJ you as a merchant or you as a
publisher can get in touch with a
merchant you as a merchant can get in
touch with a publisher meaning CJ helps
bridge the gap between you finding
somebody to build your network with okay
so that's what really affiliate
marketing is and you need really need a
platform to kind of put it all together
and and a lot of lot of affiliate
marketing platforms we're actually going
to take a look at CJ and go through some
of the features in the platform here
here shortly but let's just take a look
at why we need these affiliate marketing
tools well these affiliate marketing
tools identify you know Affiliates influ
employees other Advocates you want to
partner with so again you could be on
the merchant side you could be actually
selling a product and you're going to
want somebody to help you sell that
product somebody with a website who's an
influencer who drives a lot of traffic
to their own site who you know does sell
reputable brand Etc so you need somebody
to help you introduce you to these sites
okay so CJ and some of these other
marketing platforms affiliate marketing
platforms do that okay so these tools
are there to do the introductions the
brokering the relationship so the other
benefit here is you can contract with
Affiliates and track the traffic and
conversions well what do I mean by that
well if you do use cj.com by no means my
only endorsing that platform there are
plenty others out there but whatever
platform you use you're going to want to
be able to set up terms and conditions
with that particular affiliate so you
could set up a terms and conditions for
say 10% off all sales as an example okay
well you're going to need a platform
that will help you broker that contract
okay contract terms or program terms
furthermore you're going to need a
platform to help you track hey is this
affiliate helping me drive traffic or is
this affiliate driving traffic to my
products and is this affiliate helping
me sell so these platforms help you do
just that okay so you can gain High
website rankings with the help of your
affiliate meaning that hey your
affiliate can be promoting your product
and if they're promoting your product
you have a chance to show up via paid
search organic search off other websites
so social so you have a lot of benefits
to working with affiliate marketing in
itself and the tools available will help
you gain website rankings as one example
we want to be able to track certain
metrics okay so an affiliate Mark and
you have earnings per click EPC as an
example most platforms measure EPC from
a 7day period to a 3month period okay
you can also figure out what the actual
cost per click is just like you do on
say Google search you can actually
measure that in affiliate okay you want
to eliminate fraudulent clicks
Impressions and conversions so any
affiliate platform worth its weight is
going to help you understand you know
how many Impressions and clicks and
conversions you're getting and help you
manage that in terms of fraudulent
clicks or hey if you're getting a lot of
Impressions and no clicks that's a
problem too so these platforms are
really built on helping you make man
manage your relationship with the
affiliate by offering up all sorts of
reports and tools you know the other big
benefit here to affiliate marketing tool
is hey we can influence our customers
throughout their buying Journey so we
could set up different promotions based
on hey did somebody go to the website
did somebody see our product did
somebody click on our product did
somebody go into the shopping cart with
our product that somebody purchase our
product so there's all sorts of steps in
the funnel so to speak and hey you can
work with an affiliate a publisher to
influence your customers throughout that
purchasing funnel throughout that
Journey so let's go ahead and log in
here so when you log in like any other
digital marketing tool any other
platform you're going to have your own
settings and whatnot so really the whole
idea behind any affiliate marketing tool
is really there to manage your
Publishers who do you want as a
publisher who do you want selling your
product you obviously want somebody
who's relevant somebody who's going to
be able to sell the product somebody who
has a targeted audience that's similar
to yours okay so we go into cj.com we're
going to log in and here you can see a
Publishers link so we're going to click
on that Publishers link and remember
when you sign up Publishers you have to
have program terms and so if we click on
Publishers program terms we're going to
be able to see all the different program
terms of available so here we could see
the different program terms we have set
up for certain Publishers so we just
click on that we'll be able to see
that's default program term so remember
you could set up your own program term
for any publisher so as a best practice
if you have Publishers who are actually
performing well who are selling your
products maybe you want to offer them a
little bit more on the commission side
maybe you want to sweeten the deal maybe
you know these guys these Publishers get
better program terms versus say other
Publishers who don't and so here we can
see the program terms basically you
could see what the terms are the action
and the different policies here so
everything you need to do to manage that
publisher in terms of payment is done
under the program terms now if the
program terms are met the publisher
actually sells your products CJ is the
broker they're the ones who are going to
initiate the payment based on on the
program terms so be careful on the
program terms you want to be able to set
them appropriately CJ has templates CJ
has some default program terms that you
could use and offer up to different
Publishers So based on the program terms
that's how your Publishers are going to
get paid and so here you can have as
many different program terms as you want
There's No Limit here you want to be
able to align and reward program terms
again based on performance and so here
we can see what Publishers are under
what program terms so again if your
publisher is performing well sweeten the
deal offer them a better program terms
and so you can align Publishers with
different program terms and so that's
the whole idea behind program terms is
you want to be able to align Publishers
with that so when you sign up a
publisher they're going to get aligned
with a program term meaning what are
they going to get paid for selling your
product now if we want to manage by
status instead of by program terms we
could see all the different
organizations we have in our Network
these are our Publishers we're the
affiliate we're the ones selling the
product we want to know who's selling
who's not selling and so we can look at
all our Publishers by program terms or
by status Okay so basically you could
see here the term status whether it's
active or not earnings basically what
they've sold over the last basically 7
days or 3 months so you could look at
basically how your Publishers are
performing just by clicking on manage by
status here in cj.com so when you're
looking at reports in cj.com or really
any other affiliate program you might
see the acronym E PC this stands for
earnings per click actually it's a
little misleading it's actually earnings
per 100 clicks so basically CJ
calculates you know how much your
publisher is actually making per click
you know just like paid search we're
paying Google X amount per click it's
the same thing here we can't or these
Publishers can't make any money if they
don't generate clicks so that's why you
have an EPC model or metric so to speak
so you can measure earnings per click CJ
does it over a 7day period and over a
3mon period so you could sort based on
7day or 3 month to see who's earning the
most per click in terms of Publishers
now you can select under Publishers
groups now you can group your Publishers
okay so if you have say a group of
Publishers in a specific region like the
United States or India or if you're just
focused on the United States and see
have Publishers in different states like
Texas California Missouri Arkansas well
you can group those Publishers into
different groups and you can look at
your different group names here so here
we could see Canada and so we have our
Publishers grouped into a group called
Canada why because they're based in
Canada makes sense so you want to be
able to organize your Publishers because
the whole idea behind affiliate
marketing CJ is you want to be able to
get the best Publishers available for
your network and so as you get more
Publishers for your network you'll be
able to basically start grouping them
where it makes sense now the example I
gave you is by geography you could do by
geography or you could do by publisher
status meaning my best performing
Publishers go into a group if they're in
a group then they get aligned with
certain program term so you could group
your Publishers Any Way You Want by
status meaning they're selling more
these are best performing Publishers or
by region or you know by promotion I
mean how you group your Publishers is
totally up to you however take advantage
of the option to create publisher groups
because the whole idea again I'm going
to repeat it is you want to get
Publishers and you want to start
building your base of Publishers because
the more Publishers you have the more
chance you are to sell your product
remember if nobody clicks on your
product then nobody's going to buy your
product so if you have Publishers who
are promoting your product for you then
you have a good opportunity to sell it
so the more Publishers you have on board
the better the opportunity so now once
you have Publishers you can start
grouping these Publishers accordingly to
whatever makes sense it's a business
decision just know the options of
available in CJ to group Publishers
let's turn our attention to social media
marketing tools social media always a
great topic to talk about so we're going
to finish up all our digital marketing
tools with social media we talked about
SEO paid competition affiliate email you
know web analytics it's just appropriate
to finish up a social media because
social media has so many tools available
so many okay the first one I can think
about here is hoot hoot site is a great
social media marketing tool to use okay
it's a premium okay you can set up a
free trial here you basically a base
account and then uh you can use hoot
Suite to do a lot of things anything
from setting up landing pages to
actually publishing content to listening
who tweet to me is one of the most
powerful social media marketing tools
available you got buffer buffer is a
paid version but you can actually set up
a low cost or free account actually on
Buffer and then move to a paid account
okay you got tweet deck been around a
long time that is actually free and I
would recommend tweet deck and we're
going to take a look at that here in a
couple minutes okay and then you got
Sprout social Sprout social is another
social marketing platform similar to
hoot week do a lot of reporting a lot of
publishing you can a lot of listening
and so we're going to take a look at
Sprout social today as well before we do
that that let's go over why these tools
are important to us from a social media
perspective you're pumping out a lot of
content so you need to be able to
smartly efficiently you know schedule
and manage your post okay so you're not
just working likely with just one
platform like Facebook you're probably
on a number of different platforms
depending on your business depending on
your bandwidth depending on what you're
selling your products Etc your audience
obviously has a lot to do with it you
know it could be Instagram Pinterest you
want to be able to consolidate all that
and manage it in one place and that's
what social media marketing tools do
they allow you to manage everything in
one place so if you can manage
everything in one place then these
social media marketing platforms need to
be able to make it easy for you to add
and manage different accounts okay so a
lot of them have the ability for you to
add you know not just one Twitter
account but multiple Twitter accounts
and not just one social media platform
but multiple social media platforms and
a good social media marketing tool worth
its weight will help you monitor the
results so monitor social media posts
that help Drive leads and sales in other
words you're going to have a lot of
different metrics associated with each
social media marketing platform okay
which one is actually doing its job okay
so you want to be able to easily manage
these platforms applications and
websites very efficiently okay so
instead of having to log into each
platform you just log into one place get
a sense of what's been posted what the
engagement is did they purchase Etc and
what you want to do is be able to
individually customize every social
media post across different platforms so
it just makes it a lot easier to do that
in these social media marketing tools
okay you don't want to send out a
blanket message across different
platforms you want to be able to go
ahead and customize a post depending on
what that post is depending on what the
product is what time of day what target
market what target audience so
customization is a lot easier using
these social media marketing tools you
want to be able to engage with brand
Advocates so listening is a good thing
with social media marketing tools using
the listening functionality so you can
actually see who is a brand Advocate
who's not a brand Advocate who's an
influencer who's not an influencer and
then of course you want to analyze the
behavior of your audience and optimize
individual post on Real Time data so if
for example you post something using one
of these social media marketing
platforms and you see it go viral then
you want to be able to react to that in
real time so you're going to be able to
see that in real time on these social
media marketing tools these platforms
like Sprout social and HootSuite and
then you're going to be able to react to
that behavior and then of course
monitoring website traffic and
conversion rates that's key we always
want to monitor conversions based on our
kpis our business goals so there are
also a few important digital marketing
tools that can help you in different
ways okay so without further Ado let's
jump in and take a look at what's
available in terms of social media
marketing so just a quick reminder if
you are running ads on Facebook or
you're posting on Facebook as an example
or any platform in general that platform
is going to have its own metrics if you
will so for example Facebook has
something called Facebook Insight so
you'll be able to actually see you know
what's been posted based on you know the
last seven days in this example how many
page views you're getting engagements
recent post so just to let you know yes
you can go into any one of these
platforms on its own and look at metrics
just like you can do if you're running
Facebook ads and you can go right into
Facebook ads manager and view data there
okay so the whole point here though on
using a social media tool is that you
can measure all that in one place so if
we log into Sprout social I can set up
these accounts right into Sprout social
so I don't have to log in in Twitter
individually or Facebook individually I
can link them up all with Sprout social
and then I can go to reports just like I
can with Facebook insights and then once
I'm in Facebook excuse me once I'm in
Sprout social reporting then I can go
ahead just like I can in Facebook
insights except it's all right here for
me I can jump into you know Facebook and
dig a little bit deeper as to what's
going on with my account so I don't have
to log into Facebook directly I can see
you know the Impressions the engagement
the clicks over a period of time I can
see my audience growth I can see my
publishing Behavior how often am I
publishing I can see the top post
individually I can see Impressions by
day you know a lot of this same material
same information is already in Facebook
Insight so if it's available in Facebook
insights you know you're definitely
going to have it available in a tool
like Sprout social so you want to be
able to just efficiently log in and jump
from one platform to the other so here
you know I can go to Instagram you know
and look at Instagram data or I can look
at Twitter information so you want to be
able to efficiently jump from one
platform to the other using in this
example Sprout social now as I mentioned
as part of one of the benefits of a
social media tools that you can publish
content you want to be able to publish
content because you want to be able to
organize and schedule accordingly you
don't want to be submitting and
Publishing content right after one
another okay you want to be a able to
spread it out efficiently and
effectively and so here we could see you
know we could publish and schedule
content accordingly so all we have to do
is Click compose select a profile write
whatever we need to do can schedule it
for tomorrow at a specific time and
there you go voila scheduled so this is
on Twitter okay so you know we could
choose another platform here it's just
that easy to schedule so you want to be
able to schedule accordingly because
because again when you schedule
something then you want to be look at
the behavior of it so it's just as
simple as going from publishing to
reporting and then based on once
something got published you could see
the reaction of it and react to it so
another thing here that I like about is
spot social huite a lot of these other
platforms do it really well you got
listening tools so you can listen in on
conversations that are being had for
example uh mail delivery you know if we
do mail delivery on Twitter search will
be able to see what's been tweeted about
mail deliveries you know if that's the
business we're in we can refine our
search and choose a specific location a
radius to hone in if we're local okay so
this is Sprout socials example of
listening here let's take a look at
another example I'm in later.com so
later very similar to sprout social in
that it does a lot of the same things
you can actually schedule content on a
particular platform and one thing I like
about later here you can actually see it
visually you can see a calendar and
what's been scheduled so I can see today
I have scheduled something scheduled at
1:15 local time and again I have five
profiles set up for this account so I
can pick and choose the profile that I
want to publish to so it just makes it
that much easier and I can visually see
it and that's important so here I can
click on media library so the one thing
about later
is that you know you have a library of
images that potentially you can reuse so
if I click on this image here okay I can
get a sense of when it was used and I
can view it on a calendar I can add a
label for it so that's another benefit
to later is that they have this media
library here they have conversations so
I can actually connect to a platform and
listen in on conversations that are
being had similar to The Listening tool
in Sprout social and they have analytics
so you can actually see right in
later.com how your particular social
media platform is performing so I can
see it here over seven days I can see
the number of followers have increased I
could see the growth rate I can see the
number of Impressions that I've received
okay so I want to be able to see how my
particular platforms performing over a
period of time so I can look at reach
the laot profile views website clicks
okay so I can get a lot of good insights
here right in the analytics platform of
later you can look at specific post
performance so we posted something I
could see basically how many likes it
received how many comments Impressions
the reach and then if I want to do I can
click on details and get more specific
information on it engagement rate okay
Discovery actions comments saves Etc so
later.com goes into some nice detail
about post performance they even have
date on hashtags so if you use an
hashtag you can actually see how many
times the hashtag has been used or saved
how many Impressions it's received okay
so they really go into some nice detail
here about how your post and how your
accounts are performing and here's a
tool I really like I've been using for a
long time and that's tweet deck so what
tweet deck does is connect with your
Twitter account so you can see in a
different visual so to speak of how your
Twitter account looks in terms of your
feed here I can see this is my feed here
okay I can see some notifications I can
see specific messages then on this
column I can see activity okay so I can
add different columns here if I wanted
to and basically by adding columns you
could see I can look for what's trending
as an example so I'm going to add in a
column that says trendy and so now I can
go in and see okay these these are all
the different things that are trending
on Twitter uh so you can actually add a
column and pay attention to something
really specific okay so for example
search okay so right now I have men's
health but I could type in let's just
say World Cup okay so I could see the
you got the Cricket World Cup you got
you know the soccer football World Cup
going on so you know we could pick a a
particular topic to follow if we want to
too so again here I'm following Men's
Health so I can now see you know
everything that's been posted on men's
health now if I click on for example one
of these hashtags here that's trending I
can actually see who's tagging or using
that hashtag Friday feeling in their
tweets and so the whole idea behind you
know tweet deck it it serves up a
interesting overview so to speak of not
only your account but you know a
specific topic IC or what's trending or
you know other things that are being
said so if you really want to pay
attention to your brand or something
really specific like you know your
competitors or a specific product then
you can just do a search on that and so
that's the great thing about tweak deck
it allows you to kind of just look and
listen in on everything going on in
Twitter now we do have a good video out
here on YouTube how to start social
media marketing so if you haven't had a
chance to look at it take a look it goes
over some of these tools that we cover
today like sproutsocial later.com you
know Facebook insights so it does cover
in more detail some of what we covered
on these social media marketing tools so
take a look at how to start social media
marketing so we covered a lot of
different marketing Tools digital
marketing tools everything from SEO to
email to social to paid to affiliate to
competitor but there's also a few other
digital marketing tools that you can use
in different ways like video SEO for
example so vid IQ you know we want to
use vid IQ to get a good sense of how
particular video is performing so here
if we go into YouTube you can see vid IQ
is a browser extension or browser
plug-in if you will so I can go and take
a look at a specific a specific video
and see how many hours it's been watched
how many views minutes watched
subscribers Etc you know the great thing
here I can look at the entire entire
account so I can get good insights into
my video or my entire account here just
by adding in the vid IQ extension into
my Chrome browser so vid IQ actually
does give you some really really good
insights into not only your account but
the video and so recommend vid IQ
because it's good for video SEO okay
there's also related to content
optimization so you know if you're doing
SEO and you have a lot of content on
your site well you know what we want to
be able to use a tool maybe a third
party tool to give some objective
reasoning as to what more we can be
doing so you got tools like SEO site
checkup or site analyzer these are PID
tools but you know if you're really
heavily invested in SEO then they may
pay dividends for you you want to be
able to make sure your cont content is
fully optimized to the fullest according
to you know Google's algorithms and so
you maybe you know want to invest in
that third party tool so these are good
tools to use for Content optimization
you know there's also other key Reddit
but you know there's keyw planner uh in
Google there's also uh word stream
there's a lot of different keyword tools
out there so you may not have a Google
ads platform and so if you don't have
Google ads then you may not be able to
gain ACC access to Google's Keyword
Planner so having a thirdparty keyword
tool will pay dividend as well because
those dividends pay off in the form of
not only payperclick but also SEO and if
you're heavily invested in content
heavily invested in Social then you may
want to take a look at the keyword tool
keyword it and it's primarily used for
Reddit we talk about page load time so
we looked at that in Google analytics we
know that it heavily impacts SEO so
there are other tools available you you
got a third party tool here that's free
solar winds pingdom you actually have
page speed insights by Google so these
are free tools that you could take
advantage of in determining how you can
improve your page load time my favorite
topic conversion rate optimization so
you got a couple in here crazy egg and
zaret okay so I'm going to show you
another tool called hot jar so here if
you L into hot.com you can set up an
account it's actually free and with a
free account you can have hot jar
measure the heat map not only the heat
map but the click mapping the scrolling
of a particular page and so here you
could see we're looking at a particular
page here so hot jar allows me to you
know see on that page where people are
clicking um I can also see where people
are moving I can also see you know the
scrolling of a particular page okay so
you could see here on the page I could
see people are moving over here to the
right that's where they're clicking Mo
mostly if I switch over to move mode
then I can see on that particular page
where people are actually moving their
Mouse and then I have my scroll analysis
so I could see you know how far down
people actually scroll on the page and
so again with a paid account you can
measure up to 10,000 pag with the free
version you can measure up to 2,000 pag
VI and so 2,000 pag VI allows you to get
some insight as to what people are
clicking on or where they're moving or
how they're scrolling on a particular
page and so I definitely recommend hot
jar they also do funneling they also do
forms polls lots of other tools
available in hot jar so hotjar.com is a
tool I would recommend as well so one
final tool and I'd be a remiss if I did
didn't mention it and that's Google
optimize so Google optimize is a Google
platform that allows you to AB test and
so AB testing means that you have an
original page and you're changing one
element on that page to see which one
performs better and so with Google
optimize it's just very easy to set up
to run and the whole point of Google
optimize and AB testing is to improve
website performance so here you can see
I have an account set up optimize you
can see we're running one test here and
we're just testing one element versus
the original so we move photos to the
top of the page the original didn't have
the photos to the top of the page and so
we can go into reporting here Google
optimize does all the heavy lifting and
so here you could see we can look at
bounces or we can look at you know
basically a measure the test up against
a metric that's important to our
business and again the whole point point
is to improve website performance and so
definitely take a look at Google
optimize we'll have another webinar in
the future on the topic but you know to
me Google optimiz is free you can run up
to five tests okay and if you can run up
to five different tests then that means
you have the ability to really improve
website performance okay so Google
optimize is a tool that I would
recommend today we're going to talk
about why you would want to rank using
SEO and SEO is search engine
optimization also known as organic
search you also may as hear us say
organic listings but we're going to talk
a little bit about why you would want to
rank your website in organic search okay
what is search engine optimization then
we're going to follow that up with how
does Google rank websites so why does it
rank one website over another and how do
we get our website to rank number one
then we're going to talk about the
different types of SEO or search engine
optimiz ation techniques so you can get
your website ranked number one and then
we're going to finish that off with the
dos and don'ts of SEO so let's get right
to it and talk about why SEO so we're
going to use a basic example and let's
just say you have a Blog you're a food
blogger you're passionate about food and
your Niche is ice cream and let's just
say you have a lot of ice cream recipes
you want to get traffic to your blog you
want people to read your blog and you're
curious why am I not ranking for my blog
blog why when people type in ice cream
recipes and say Google my blog posts
don't appear at the top of organic
rankings and there's a number of reasons
why you wouldn't be ranked for your blog
post or your ice cream recipes and the
main reason would be your competitors so
there could be somebody else out there
who is also passionate about ice cream
and has been blogging a long longer than
you and they have more content and more
blog post and more pages for Google to
rank so that's usually the number one
reason the other reason is improper
usage of keywords and we're going to
talk a little bit or actually a lot more
about you know keyword usage in your
content so what kind of keywords do you
want to rank for that's really what
we're talking about when we talk about
usage of keywords what keywords do you
want to rank for and how do we work
those keywords into the content another
reason is Port link building practices
and really that means are other blog
posts or other websites linking to you
also are you linking to other pages on
your website and so it's all about link
building and with link building it's
internal linking so are we linking from
one blog post to another and it's
external linking our other websites of
high quality linking to us and so that's
what we talk about when we talk about
link building and then another reason is
web page load time so you could be
running your blog post on say WordPress
for example and your blog post isn't
loading fast enough well if you look at
it this way think about it if you're
Google would you really want to rank a
website or blog post in this example
number one on Google rankings if that
particular page loaded very slow no you
wouldn't because when somebody clicked
on that link in organic search and went
to your website they're going to have a
bad experience because the page is going
to load slow so Google doesn't want
their users to have a bad experience you
don't want your users to have a bad
experience and so that's why web page
low time is a critical factor for
ranking so we need to make sure that our
web pages load fast and then your user
experience is not good enough so Google
again based on my example about the web
page load time Google wants people to
have a good experience when they go from
their search engine to your website and
there's a lot at play there specifically
web page low time but also you know
Google doesn't want any spam content
Google doesn't want any popups or
overbearing ads on the web page they
want people to are searching for
something in particular let's just say
ice cream recipes and they want to find
a relevant website that has ice cream
recipes they want to be able to click on
that link and read some good content
about ice cream recipes it's that simple
and that's really what Google's trying
to create in their environment and
that's you as an end user as a website
owner you want your users to have a good
experience and then last but not least
your website is de-indexed by mistake
and really what we mean is de-indexed is
Google needs to be able to index all the
pages on your website so if you have a
Blog with a 100 recipes you want Google
to have access to all 100 recipes so
we're going to talk a little bit later
about how to get your pages ranked or
indexed on Google organic search so
let's move on to what is SEO so sticking
with our ice clean Blog theme really SEO
search engine optimization really is the
practice of increasing your pages that
Google has indexed up the rankings so
the end result is we want all our pages
to be ranked number one for particular
keywords so if you want to be ranked for
ice cream recipes well there's certain
things you need to do so that's
generally how it works we need to apply
search engine optimization to increase a
page for keyword we want to be found for
so let me give you an example so let's
just say there's 100 students that
participated in an essay competition and
so the competition in this particular
case is evaluated on the basis of is the
content relevant are they using suitable
titles for their essay do they have
structure when they're participating in
this essay or talking about the essay
and do they have a suitable synopsis and
is the content neat and readable these
seem all logical for an essay
competition well guess what they seem
logical for SEO because that's exact
exactly how SEO works it's exactly all
those points I just m mentioned about
structure logic readability organization
title all those things are what's
important in SEO and so we need relevant
content we need titles for our Pages
Google needs to be able to see structure
we need to have synopsis of what the
page is about and that's called a metad
description and then again the the
content needs to be readable and that's
important and so in order to be readable
again we're going to talk more about
sight speed because sight speed is
important okay and when we talk about
responsive design when I say responsive
design that means your site your page
needs a load both on desktop and also on
mobile and so all these things are
important just like an essay competition
Google is the judge and they need to be
able to determine what page is best to
rank number one number two number three
Etc on Google Search and then link
building remember mentioned link
building a moment ago well link building
internally and externally also plays a
vital role and so we're going to talk
about that a little bit later in the
class when we talk about off-page SEO
how does Google rank website and
basically Google follows three basic
steps to rank a website they need to
crawl your website they need to take
what they crawl back to their servers
and when they take it back to their
servers your your web pages they need to
you have them available for indexing so
so when somebody actually types in a
keyword into google.com it'll be
available to be found on organic search
so that's what indexing is all about and
then Google's job when somebody does
type in a search query is to basically
rank th those pages that they've indexed
from number one to Infinity depending on
how many pages are relevant to that
search query so really it's about
crawling indexing and ranking so
crawling is simply a process done by
which Google has box
and what these Bots do is they go to
your web server and they're going to
crawl every page that they can find and
how did they find these Pages well they
basically follow links you might have
heard the term spidering but that's what
they call search engine spidering so
basically what Google's doing is they're
building a web so to speak all the links
that they're following and so when they
can follow all these links on your
website they're going to be able to
crawl them and when they crawl them
basically they going to take that
content and store it on their servers so
it's available in their index So based
on this method Google finds out which
websites have relevant content and which
ones don't based on certain keywords
that are typed into Google because if
they can't crawl your website you're not
going to be found and if you can't be
found then you're not going to show up
for Relevant keywords so we need to make
sure your sit's available be crawled and
we'll talk about that a little bit later
okay but let's show you an example so
let's just go to Google search search
and if I type in the keyword simply
learn okay I could see I have 1,10,000
results okay and that's how many results
are showing up for simply learn okay now
they may not all be simply learn pages
but nonetheless simply learned is rank
number one here organically and there
are
1,10,000 Pages related to the keyword
simply learn now when it comes to
organic search uh we don't want to get
it confused with paid search so any time
you see paid search you're going to see
something that says add next to it okay
so we could see that there are paid ads
here but when it comes to organic search
those are generally below paid ads and
so that's where Google counts the
1,10,000 results and so that's the whole
idea behind crawling and indexing
Google's able to crawl simply learns
website and based on all the pages that
they gather they're going to make those
pages available in organic search so if
you type in a keyword and your web page
is not available for indexing then
you're never going to show up for that
keyword so that's why it's important to
make sure your website is available for
crawling and indexing and so when a user
types a query on search Google search
the most relevant websites that are in
Google's index are going to appear in
the search results so in the example I
gave uh with simply learn well simply
learn is the brand name of the company
simply learn so there's 's a lot of
relevancy there so that's why you see
simply learn show up here organically
number one like we mentioned about what
is SEO and Y SEO we talked about that
user experience so there's a lot of
factors that go into ranking relevancy
being one of them so in the simply learn
example simply learn is relevant to a
lot of the simply learn Pages because
that's who they are simply learn however
simply learn also needs to make sure
that you know for their Pages the page
load time is fast meaning these Pages
load very fast for the end user and
Google also takes into account other
factors like how long someone is staying
on a website or are they bouncing
meaning are they going to one page that
they land on and then leaving the
website okay and so the user experience
is very very important there are other
factors also like language and location
and so for example location if you do a
search say in India the results are
going to be a little bit different than
say the results in the United States why
because Google is indexing as many web
pages as they can find so if somebody's
doing a search in India their results
may be a little bit different than the
results show up in the US because Google
has different Bots and these Bots are
crawling different pages at different
times and so Google's index is updating
continuously but it's not real time
syncing so if you do a search in index
IND you may not see exactly the same
thing because both search engines the
Google in India and the Google in the US
are may not be exactly synced up so an
example would be you know if you're
looking for Cafe so if you search a cafe
and say San Francisco you're going to
see different results now if you do a
search for cafes in Mumbai you're going
to see different results there's going
to be local search here at the top there
may be some paid search but again you
may see different results because one
location but two Google search engines
in India and United States google.com
aren't exactly synced up exactly at the
same exact time you do that search so
location is important language is
important and relevancy is important
along with user experience so all those
are important factors in how Google
ranks websites okay so we're going to
talk about the types of SEO now so if we
want to rank for a particular keyword on
Google we're going to have to apply
search engine optimization and so
there's two strategies to search engine
optimization onpage SEO and off-page SEO
so first we're going to talk about
onpage SEO so onpage SEO is nothing more
than optimizing your own website and so
when we say optimizing your own website
there's certain elements on your website
and on your web pages that we need to to
take into account and so some of those
elements are headers meta descriptions
title tags linking so all of those
elements are something we can control as
an end user who wants to rank our web
page and our website on Google and
before we do anything with our website
the first thing we need to do is
understand what keywords we want to rank
for in order to understand what keywords
we want to rank for we need to do
keyword res research and if you do
anything in SEO keyword research is the
most important activity that's the most
important thing you can do for SEO and
why do I say it's the most important
because you need to understand if you
choose a keyword that you want to rank
for you need to understand how much
traffic you're going to get from that
keyword if you're ranked organically say
number one on Google so how much traffic
will you get if you're ranked number one
on Google so you need to understand what
the volume is and then number two we
need to understand what the competition
is for that keyword that you want to
rank for so if you choose a keyword and
there's not much competition for it then
chances are you can rank for that
keyword for a web page on your website
quicker than say a keyword that has a
lot of competition so we need to
understand those two basic factors
volume and competition before we choose
a key word and it's it's simply the
practice of going through the motions of
getting your volume and getting your
compet competition data so you can
choose the keyword you want and then
once you choose the keyword you want
then you can go and apply on page SEO
you can change the title tag The Meta
descriptions the headers all those
elements can be changed but first you
need to choose your keywords and so
again the primary components we're
looking for are how much traffic you can
get or the search volume how much
competition there is for that keyword
and of course relevancy okay you need to
be able to choose keyword that's
relevant to the web page you're trying
to rank for and so let me show you
example how to go through this so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
use a tool and the tool I would
recommend is Google Keyword Planner and
why do I choose Google Keyword Planner
because if we're trying to rank on
google.com or Google search engine we
want to be able to get the data right
from the source so Google's going to be
able to give us information about how
much volume a keyword has and how much
competition it has so let me show you an
example so if I want to use Google's
Keyword Planner and I want to rank for
the keyword how to become a digital
marketing specialist then I'm going to
type that keyword into Google's Keyword
Planner and what Google's going to do is
they're going to give me some Trends
about how much volume this particular
keyword gets over the course of a year
and so for that particular keyword I can
see that there are trends that that
appear for both desktop and mobile so
mobile is important because people start
their search process a lot of times on
their mobile device so we want to be
able to get data from mobile as well as
desktop and so we could see a trend here
that for each particular month over the
last 12 months we can see how much
volume this particular keyword how to
become a digital marketing specialist
gets per month and so on average on
average over the the past 12 months I
could see how to become a digital
marketing specialist is averages 30
searches a month and this is on
google.com and so Google gives us the
volume what they also give us is the
competition and so here I can see Google
says for that particular keyword the
competition is medium and so in the
Google's Keyword Planner what they also
do is give me other relevant keywords
that I might think about optimizing for
because you don't want to optimize for
just one keyword so how to become a
digital marketing specialist they're
going to also offer up other types of
keywords that are relevant so just
digital marketing specialist social
media marketing specialist so for those
keywords I can see the volume so for
example digital marketing specialist I
can see the average volume is 1,000 per
month on average of the last 12 months I
can also see the competition is medium
but for some other keywords I can see
the search volume being high like
digital marketing course at 2,900 per
month but also the competition is high
and so what I would recommend as a best
practice is to collect all your relevant
keywords okay and put all your relevant
keywords in a spreadsheet and when you
put all these relevant keywords in a
spreadsheet you want to get the data on
those keywords and the data I'm
referring to is the volume and
competition so in this case we have
volume from Google planner Google's
Keyword Planner and I have competition
from Google's Keyword Planner and so if
I go into AE spreadsheet and I put all
that information in here I'm going to be
able to see the volume and competition
and so that's important however one
thing to note here is that Google's
Keyword Planner if I go back just gives
us low medium and high and if I want to
compare numbers to numbers maybe I want
to be able to get exactly the
competition number for the the keyword
how to become a digital marketing
specialist what I can do is go into
Google and I can type in that keyword so
if I type in the keyword how to become a
digital marketing specialist I can see
there's 76 Million results so I can see
76 Million results 76.1 actually and for
the keyword how to become a digital
marketing specialist now that's a whole
lot of results for this particular
keyword especially when the volume is
only 30 uh per month on average and so
what I want to do is get a a more clear
picture of the competition and so what
you could actually do is type in the
syntax all in title and then colon and
then your keyword how to become a
digital marketing specialist and when I
do that I get a different result here I
can see only
136 listings for how to become a digital
marketing specialist but that's not just
136 that's 136 with that particular key
word that we want to rank for in the
title tag okay so the title tag is what
you see when you type in a keyword or
search query in Google search and the
title tag is what you see at the top of
every search result and so now I can see
I typed in how to become a digital
marketing specialist with the all
entitle syntax and now I can see every
listing every one of these
136 results have that particular key
word in it so I could see every one of
them how to become a digital marketing
specialist and why is that important
because now that tells me I only need to
climb over
136 listings to rank for that keyword
how to become a digital marketing
specialist and so the idea here is you
want to get your volume from Google's
Keyword Planner but you want to get your
competition from Google search and again
that's simply typing in the the syntax
all in title and then your keyword in
this example how to become a digital
marketing specialist once you get those
two numbers you're going to plug them in
to your spreadsheet and then once you do
that for a number of different keyword
queries and these keyword queries again
have to be relevant once you do that
then you can go in and pick the keywords
you want to optimize for and that's
important because again if you're not
sure about a keyword then you want to do
the keyword research so you can be sure
of how much traffic you can get and how
much competition there is those are two
important important factors in starting
the process for onpage SEO okay you want
to create content for say a keyword like
digital
marketing but digital marketing may seem
a little bit broad so you want to
probably stay away from broader keywords
because broader keywords tend to have a
lot of volume which is great but they
may also tend to have a lot of
competition but that's the whole point
of doing the keyword research maybe it
doesn't maybe there's more volume than
competition that's what you need to find
out when you do the keyword research you
need to find those keywords that are
relevant to your content that have a lot
of volume and low competition and then
once we identify those keywords then we
are free to go in and start optimizing
our web pages for those keywords and the
first place we want to start is the
title tag so if you remember my example
going back here to our search how to
become a digital Market marketing
specialist we saw that every one of
these listings had that keyword in the
title tag and the title tag is important
because that's what users who use Google
search see first when they type in a
query and get results so they're going
to see the title tag so the title tag is
the most important element for on page
SEO it's the most important factor
because that's what people see and so
ideally when we choose our keyword we
want to make sure that keyword is in the
title tag because that's what shows up
in gole go search and that's what makes
that particular web page relevant for
that keyword query so the idea behind a
title tag it's between 50 and 60
characters and so we want to make sure
we stay within that limit no more than
60 characters because what happens if
it's beyond that then Google will
truncate the title tag so if I go back
to my search you could see here on this
particular title tag Google truncated it
meaning they added the ellipses after
the title tag because it exceeded the 60
character limit so you want to stay
within those character counts and so the
title tag is the first place you should
start when optimizing your website
because when we have the right keyword
in the title tag and somebody types in
that keyword then chances are it's going
to be relevant they're going to see it
and they're going to click through to
your website and that's the whole idea
behind ranking we want to get clicks so
that's how the title tag appears so when
you optimize it you're going to update
the title tag and this is how it shows
up it's going to show up at the top of
your listing okay and it's going to be
bigger and Bolder than anything else
Google displays so the second thing you
want to optimize is the meta description
and The Meta description is simply just
a brief description up to
155 I would say about 155 to 60 160
characters but probably no more than
that and so the meta description is
nothing more than a summary of the web
page page itself so if I go back to my
Google search results I see my title tag
and I see the page that this particular
listing belongs to and underneath that
is where I can see my meta description
so in this keyword query how to become a
digital marketing specialist I see the
meta description an ultimate guide on
how to build a career in digital
marketing and the skills required to
become a digital marketing specialist
note that it's a well-written
metadescription
within 155 characters and it includes
the keyword digital marketing specialist
so we're trying to rank for how to
become a digital marketing specialist
and here you can see become a digital
marketing specialist so there's a lot of
relevancy between not only the title tag
in the keyword but the metad description
in the keyword so when you're optimizing
a keyword you want to start with the
title tag but you also want to update
the meta description because if you
don't update the meta description and
you leave The Meta description blank
lank then you're leaving it to Google to
add in copy that they deem relevant and
so for onpage SEO we want to take
control of the copy and we want to
optimize it for the keywords we want to
be found for so the metad description is
a powerful tool at our disposal it gives
us more characters to work with it gives
us more to talk about so for that
particular page and so if the title tag
is only 60 characters maximum it's not a
lot of information to try and get to
click so the meta description helps us
in identifying what that page is about
in order to get the click so the two
working in tandem will hopefully
increase your click the rates so when
you're found organically we want to get
the click and then the third element
that's important is the URL and URL
stands for uniform resource locator and
why is the URL so important because
that's what people see so if I go back
to my search result how to become a
digital marketing specialist notice that
the URL also includes how to become a
digital marketing specialist article
okay so it's very relevant the URL is
very relevant one we can see it in the
search results but two you know it's
relevant to the keyword query and that's
important for the end user and Google
Google wants to know hey is this the
page that's relevant to the user's query
and if it is then this user is likely
going to have a good user experience
after they click on the listing so the
URL is an element that helps not only
with the clickr rate but with ranking
and having a poor URL structure doesn't
help at all because not only does Google
not recognize the URL as being relevant
but the end user may not want to click
on that page given the the way the URL
looks so you want to try and avoid a
poor URL structure so the rule of thumb
is this if you don't understand what the
URL is then Google is likely not going
to understand what the URL is and so we
want to try and keep our URL structures
clean and when I say clean ideally you
want to make sure that whatever keyword
you're trying to optimize that's the
keyword that's included in the URL
nothing included that is not
understandable so again going back to
our example how to become a digital
marketing specialist it's very clean the
title tag is the keyword The Meta
description is cleanly written has the
keyword and then the URL is the other
element that the end user can see and
that URL includes the keyword in it so
after we've done those three elements
the title tag the metad description and
the URL then we want to start optimizing
the page itself so ideally when we say
optimize the page itself the page
remember needs to be structured and when
we say structured it needs to be
structured in terms of you know headers
and subheaders and organized in a manner
in which the end user can read the
article read the content clearly and
concisely without being confused and so
that's the job of headers they add they
add basically an organizational
structure to the content and with
headers there's a hierarchy so you have
anywhere from H1 which is the top of the
hierarchy to an H6 and so you're free to
use any one of those headers when
building out a page in order to organize
the content but ideally you probably
want to stick with an H1 or an H2
because those are at the top of the
hierarchy and what those do is they
actually stress to Google that hey this
header with this particular keyword in
it is important so if you use an H6 with
the keyword in it it's telling Google
hey this is an H6 but it's not as
important so an H1 and an H2 tag show
importance and so let's look at an
example of what that is so here you can
see an H1 is going to be at the top of
the high so that means it's going to be
bigger and Bolder then you have an H2
which is going to be bigger and Bolder
than an H3 but not as big and bold as an
H2 so with headers not only are you
organizing the content accordingly but
you're also signaling to Google how
important that particular header is and
of course the header needs to include
the key word we're trying to rank for so
let's take a look again at that example
so if we go to how to become a digital
marketing specialist if I click on on
that page I can look at the content and
I can see that there are headers in here
so the headers are there to organize the
content and that's what we want we want
to be able to organize the content and
if you look at the other example I'm
showing here how to become a digital
marketing specialist uh learning paths
explored you can see that's an H1 but
below it's a subheader the growing
digital marketing job market so that's
an H2 and so we're not stressing to
Google that that's in more important
than an H1 but nonetheless we're
stressing at Google that it's important
nonetheless so we want to be able to use
headers we want to be able to use
keywords in our headers in order to
stress to Google what's important and
also to organize the content because
Google likes content organized okay the
next element we want to focus on is
internal linking and so internal linking
if you remember uh earlier in the
presentation is basically links from one
page on your website to another and so
here we can see on this particular
article how to become a digital
marketing specialist there's also links
to other pages on simply learns website
and so for this particular content it
also links to sco specialist PPC
specialist social media marketing
specialist and digital marketing
specialist so the whole idea behind
internal linking is to link from one
page to another where it's relevant and
in this case it's relevant because we're
talking about how to become a digital
marketing specialist that's what the
whole content is about and so what
simply learns doing here is offering up
other pages on their website that are
relevant to becoming a digital marketing
specialist and so this is a best
practice when you're optimizing a web
page so you want to be able to have
internal linking on your site and the
whole idea behind internal linking is it
also allows users to navigate through
the site naturally so when I say
naturally they don't always have to
refer back to the top navigation they
can naturally and seamlessly go from one
relevant article or page to another and
so that's the whole idea behind link
building and internal link building it
allows Google to identify you know pages
that they want to crawl in index because
they're linked to one another but it
also helps the end user because it
allows the end user to go from one page
to another and it's signaling to Google
hey this particular page is linked to
this page so we're going to also index
that page and so that's the whole
important part of internal linking it's
about the end user experience and it's
about allowing Google to find the pages
on your website so they can crawl them
and index them so you can be ranked for
them and so also in addition to internal
linking we want to be able to use
natural language and so what what do I
mean by natural language or natural
language processing so what Google does
is in terms of natural language
processing they're looking for the
content and the keyword it needs to be
relevant so when your website is about
digital marketing you don't necessarily
want to rank or try to rank for the
keyword digital marketing one it's too
broad two there might be some
competition but three you're probably
not going to write something as broad
like digital marketing so ideally what
you want to do is you want to to other
relevant related keywords that's going
to be more natural and so that's what we
mean by natural language processing we
want to choose keywords that are more
natural to the content you're writing so
instead of the keyword digital marketing
maybe we want to talk about the types of
digital marketing or digital marketing
examples or what is a digital marketing
strategy or how to become a digital
marketing specialist so those are all
relevant key wordss to digital marketing
and more relevant to the content because
if you try to rank for the keyword
digital marketing again it's probably
going to be a little bit broad probably
more competition and not as relevant to
your content and as a result probably
not a good user experience so think
about some other keywords that you could
optimize and rank for and that goes back
to the keyword research that's why the
keyword research is so important because
it allows us to identify other keywords
and the natural language process what
keywords are more relevant for the
content and then another element to
onpage SEO is the sitemap and so with
the sitemap it's basically a list of all
the pages on your website and the whole
idea of listing all the pages on your
website in one document is it helps both
users and search engines understand the
structure of your website so there two
types of sitemaps one's an HTML sitemap
and that's designed for humans so if you
have a website with a lot of cont
content at the footer or the bottom of
your web page you probably want to have
a link to sitemap so if somebody clicks
on that sit map they're going to be able
to see all the pages on your website
structured in an organized manner well
an XML sitemap and XML is just a
different format it's designed for
crawlers and so the whole idea remember
is Google likes to crawl content when
they craw content they bring it back to
their servers and index it and so we
want to be able to create create a
sitemap for Google or other search
engine crawlers and so XML is the format
so let me show you example of how that
looks so if I go to Simply learn.com and
simply type in say sitemap.xml just as
an example I'm going to get this
particular page and this particular page
displays two XML sitemaps so these sit
maps are there for Google to go ahead
and crawl and nothing more than a list
of all the page pages on your website
and so this is a quick and easy way for
Google to get a hold of all those pages
so that they can index them and that's
the whole idea behind SEO you want to be
able to have Google index all the
content you want to be found for for the
key words you want to be found for so it
all starts with the sitemap so let's go
from onpage SEO which in recap is
basically optimizing certain elements on
your website so that you are relevant
for particular keyword and that meant
updating the title tag The Meta
description the URL the headers choosing
the right keywords to put into the
content having internal linking and also
updating the sitemap well those are
elements that you can do on your website
so we're going to switch gears and talk
about a different strategy off-page SEO
because without on page or off page you
can't have a page ranking so the two
work together so you can do is as much
as you want on on page but you still
need off-page SEO and you could do all
the off-page SEO you want but you still
need onpage so both of these strategies
have to be in full effect in order for
you to rank so let's now switch gears to
off-page SEO and so off-page SEO is
simply the process of linking or
promoting your website using link
building and so if you remember I talked
about this earlier on there's two types
of links internal and external link
and so for onpage SEO we used internal
linking for off-page SEO we're going to
talk about external linking and external
linking allows us to improve our
websites recognition or relevancy or
credibility and why do we want to
improve our relevancy and credibility
and trustworthiness and Authority
because we want Google to know that our
web page is trustworthy it is recognized
by other websites and it is relevant for
a particular keyword and so if we can do
that using off-page SEO methods then
Google's going to rank our web page for
the keyword we want to be found for so
it's really off-page SEO is synonymous
with link building and there's plenty of
opportunities to do link building and
just comes down to creating a strategy
so again some of the benefits to off
page well we talked about you know being
credible and trustworthiness and
relevant we need to do that in order to
rank but there's some other benefits
there so if we're have a link on another
credible website then it's likely going
to increase the traffic to our own
website it also creates high domain
Authority and so what I mean by high
domain Authority is if we have basically
links to other web pages pointing back
to us then basically our domain
Authority is going to improve and when
our domain Authority improves other
websites are going to want to link to us
so the higher authoritative we are for
our website then other web pages going
to want to link to us and so the more
external linking we have the higher the
domain Authority so it all starts with
linking to other high domain Authority
websites so linking to a high domain
Authority website for example having a
link on Wikipedia that points back to
our web page creates high domain
Authority for us and it helps Drive
traffic so some of the other benefits of
off-page SEO are in credibility so if
we're linking from Wikipedia to our web
page it does create credibility for us
it also helps us increase our page rank
so remember that external linking helps
build domain Authority helps build
credibility trustworthiness and it's
going to in turn help us rank for that
particular page and then certainly not
last having a good off-page SEO link
building strategy increases our brand
awareness because if we're on other high
Authority websites wiip Media or say a
social platform it's going to increase
our brand awareness and increasing our
brand awareness increases our
trustworthiness and so if somebody is
looking to say become a digital
marketing specialist then likely instead
of typing in digital marketing
specialist on Google they may type in
our brand name in this case simply learn
and so these are all the benefits to
off-page SEO so it's nothing more than
having links on other websites that are
pointing back to ours and again there's
lots of benefits it's drives helps Drive
traffic and increases our Authority so
those are things that we want to take
advantage of when we want to rank and
the key behind off- page SEO or link
building is always going to be content
so from an onpage SEO perspective having
quality content allows that content to
be optimized for Relevant keyword and
ranked but also from an off-page SEO
strategy having high quality content
allows us to have other sites and it
doesn't necessar have to be a website it
could be a social platform or it could
be another blogging platform or blogging
website linked back to ours why because
the content is original it's natural
it's well structured it reads well and
so that's the whole idea behind off page
you can't have links on other websites
if you don't have quality content so one
of the ideas behind off-page SEO is not
only do you want to create good content
but you probably want to spend a lot of
time or a bit of time on others websites
so remember the example I used earlier
in this presentation about having an ice
cream blog and ice cream recipes well it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to say
spend some time on other blogs related
to desserts related to cakes related to
food in general related to vegetables or
other items that people could link from
so the whole idea is understanding who
else is out there who has relevant
content that you could share so you
could share your content with them they
can share their content with you and
generally that's how it works naturally
anyway in the web spere if somebody
likes your content they're going to link
to it they don't necessarily have to
wait for you to ask them but it might
not be a bad idea to understand who else
is out there that has content similar to
yours so that you can you know get a
link on that particular website or blog
post and so some other ideas behind
having external links pointing back to
your website is social media so social
media is not just Facebook or Twitter
but it expands beyond that there's
there's core there's medium there's all
sorts of content generated websites like
Reddit so the list goes on and on you
just need to find what's relevant for
your content if it's relevant for your
content then it's worth putting or
trying to get the external link on that
social media platform and then again
going back to my ice cream blog recipes
blog post yeah if you find a particular
blog that you want to have an external
link on there's nothing wrong with
reaching out to that particular blogger
you know in some cases very flattering
but in other cases if the content is
relevant then why not it's only going to
help your end user experience if you add
somebody who has say a Blog about cakes
having their link on your blog post so
there's nothing wrong with it because it
also adds to the user experience and if
you're going to ask somebody to put an
external link on theirs you might want
to be open-minded and make sure that
you're are able and willing to put an
external link on your blog post or
website pointing to their content that's
how the web Works especially if the
content of quality relevant and of good
nature okay so let's move on and finish
up with the dos and don'ts of SEO so we
talked a lot about why SEO what is SEO
you know how do we rank for SEO you know
what is on page SEO what is off-page SEO
and so let's just wrap up with some of
the things you again want to do to rank
your page for particular keyword and
some of the things you don't want to do
so the first thing on the list is
optimize for white hat techniques and
what I mean for opting in for white hat
techniques is basically everything I
just mentioned today you want to do
keyword research you want to choose a
natural language processing form format
so you could choose keywords that are
going to be relevant natural to the
content and you don't want to opt for
black hat techniques and black hat
techniques are probably not even worth
going into detail but one example is
choosing a keyword arbitrarily like say
digital marketing and just stuffing that
keyword into the content so that's
probably not something you want to do
cuz again it's not going to be good for
the end user user so stay away from
black hat and focus on some of the
techniques we talked about in today's
presentation the other du we want to do
is get backlinks from relevant sites so
that's off-page SEO again it's what I
mentioned earlier it's about linking
your quality content to another person's
website that also has quality content we
don't want to have a backlink from an
irrelevant site why because it's not
going to be relevant and it's also going
to hurt our Authority because if it's on
site that's not of good quality then
Google's going to look at us and say
well this site is linking to your site
but it's not relevant so therefore you
know we're not going to look at you in
the same way as if you were on a quality
website we do want to use our keywords
naturally because title tags are what
people see first on organic search but
you don't want to use the same title tag
on every page of your website so we want
to stay away from doing that so you want
to have a unique title tag for every web
page on your website and ideally what
does that mean that means using our
keyword research to choose one to two
keywords for page and optimizing your
web page for those one to two keywords
so you ideally what you want to do is
have one to two different keywords for
every page on your website we definitely
definitely definitely want to write
engaging content so the content should
be engaging remember user experience we
want users to stay on our website we
want them to enjoy the content that
they're reading and we want them to go
from one page to another naturally we
definitely don't want to leverage or
plagiarize or just copy content from
others websites because it's not one
probably going to be relevant to what
you're writing about two it's duplicate
content and it's somebody else's so
that's a black cat Technique we want to
stay away from I can't emphasize this
enough we need to do key word research
first before you do anything else you
need to find relevant keywords and not
only that you need to understand the
volume and the competition for each of
those keywords okay you don't want to
choose a keyword that has low volume
High competition you want to choose a
keyword that has high volume low
competition but above all you want to
choose keywords that are relevant to
your content we want to avoid keyword
stuffing so don't take a keyword and
just stuff it everywhere on the page
it's not going to be natural and
Google's going to be able to pick up on
that so we want to maintain some level
of quality with our content and quality
with the keywords that we choose so
reminder when you have quality content
it's always going to link internally to
another page on your website with
quality content but it's got to be
natural and don't just build sitewide
backlinks meaning don't just have an
internal link to the homepage or don't
have every page on your website linking
to just one page so internal linking
should be natural naturally linking from
one page to another not only does it
help Google understand and crawl all the
web pages on your website but it's good
for the end User it's good user
experience and certainly last but
something I didn't talk about does take
time to rank your content so remember
the process you're going to write your
content you're going going to choose
keywords you're going to change the
elements on that page for those keywords
and all the while you're going to make
sure Google can crawl that content and
when they crawl it they're going to
index it the process takes time
especially if you choose a keyword
that's competitive so just be patient if
you have quality content and you've
optimized for onpage SEO and off-page
SEO then you will rank for that keyword
and then make sure your website's
userfriendly and mobile friendly so
talked about responsive content earlier
so remember most users today start the
process of search on mobile so we want
to make sure your websites are mobile
friendly search engine optimization
starts with the keyword because we want
to be found four relevant keywords and
so the first step in search engine
optimization is always going to be
keyword research so it is the most
important step and so what is key
keyword research all about well it's
process of identifying keywords we want
to be found for on the search engines so
millions of people use search engines on
a daily basis we want to be found for
those keywords that people type in that
are relevant to the content we want to
be found so going back to the Italian
restaurant example if we're writing a
blog post about Italian restaurants if
somebody types in the best Italian
restaurants or Italian restaurants in a
specific City we want to be found for
that content if it's relevant to what we
wrote about so keyword research should
be done based on two factors really it's
F based on the factor of how much
traffic or volume a particular search
engine query has and it's based on
competition and really the underlying
Factor here is that all keywords in your
keyword research should be relevant so
you need to understand what those
keywords are so are they relevant to the
content that you want to be found for if
they are then really the two factors you
want to look for is the volume how much
volume or traffic each keyword has
associated with it and then the
competition how many other websites are
trying to be found for the same keyword
so those are the factors involved with
keyword research you always want to
choose relevant keywords and then once
you find or choose those relevant
keywords you want to be able to find out
exactly how much volume and how much
competition is associated with each of
those keywords and so when you look at
keywords you're always going to choose
relevant keywords but there are two
types of keywords there are short tail
keywords and there are longtail keywords
and we're going to talk about both of
these here so let's start with short
tail keywords so short tail keywords are
generic keywords generally they're less
than three words in a keyword phrase for
example Italian restaurants so short ta
keywords generally have very high search
volume that means that if somebody types
in Italian restaurants then there's
going to be a large amount of volume
with that meaning that generally a lot
of people type in the keyword Italian
restaurants however with high volume
always comes High competition so if you
want to be found for Italian restaurants
know that if you are ranked number one
or number two or even on page one of
Google you're going to get a lot of
traffic however to get to page one of
Google or even position one or two it's
going to take you a while because there
probably a lot of websites who are in
front of you who want to be ranked and
found for the same keyword so the whole
idea with short tail keywords is it's a
lot of visibility it's a lot of traffic
a lot of volume but also a lot of
competition and generally the underlying
Factor here is that if you are ranked
for a very broad or short tail keyword
like Italian restaurants then chances
are it's not going to be as relevant so
if you get the traffic to your website
then chances are the conversion is not
necessarily going to happen because we
don't necessarily know the mindset of
somebody typing in a very short tail
generic keyword like a tiean restaurants
they could be doing research on Italian
restaurants they could be a chef who's
trying to get recipes for Italian food
it could be a tourist looking for
Italian restaurants in a different city
or it could be a person just looking for
Italian restaurants near their location
or where they're living and so there's a
lot of different factors with short tail
keyword so you just don't know because
it's so generic and because it's so
generic if you do get the traffic for
that generic keyword then the chances of
the conversion are going to be lower
than say if it's a more specific
relevant keyword so let's take an
example of a short tail keyword let's
just stick with Italian restaurants so
I'm going to go to a tool called Moz
well Moz has a tool called the keyword
Explorer and within MZ so if you go to
moz.com and then use their keyword
Explorer you can get an idea of how much
volume and competition are associated
with a particular keyword so in this
example we're using Italian restaurants
it's a very broad keyword we could see
that the monthly volume is between
70,000 and 118,000 per month okay so
that means for a particular keyword in
the United States on a search engine
you're going to get about 70,000 to
118,000 people who type in that keyword
and so if we were look at the difficulty
of that keyword you could see that it's
fairly difficult because out of one to
100 it's got to score 43 so it's fairly
difficult however if you notice the
clickthrough rate's very high so Moz
estimates that we'll have a 40% organic
click the rate for that keyword if we're
ranked for it so if it's relevant to us
and we want to get some visibility to
our site then yeah we want to use that
generic short tail keyword however if
we're interested in conversions then we
really want to turn our attention to
longer tail keywords however if you want
the visibility then you want to use
short tail keywords if you want the
conversion then you want to switch over
to longer tail keywords so longer tail
keywords are more specific they use it
consist of more than three keywords so
Tian restaurants very generic if we add
a few more keywords that keyword phrase
it then becomes longer tail so compared
to short tail keywords longer tail
keywords are generally less competitive
and the search volume is not as high
case and points if we go back to MZ and
then we look at the keyword Explorer and
we'd actually type in Italian
restaurants and let's just say Orlando
Florida mod is going to generate some
monthly volume for us and they're going
to allow us to understand how difficult
that keyword is and so here you could
see very very little search volume in
fact so little volume there's 11 to 50
okay so that means on average that this
keyword generates 11 to 50 queries a
month so very low compared to our
short-tail keyword Italian restaurants
the difficulty here didn't necessarily
lessen but it is less uh competitive so
if you're interested in conver vers and
you have an Italian restaurant in say
Orlando Florida then this is the keyword
you may want to use so there's a
tradeoff between longer tail and shorter
tail but when visitors land from longer
tail keywords they're usually ready to
make a purchase they're usually more
specific intent there's more intent
involved with a longer tail keyw so best
restaurants in it in Florida branded
choose in Florida something very
specific is going to generate probably
higher conversion rate than something
more generic so that's the tradeoff and
so when to use longtail keywords well we
want to use longtail keywords and for
targeting pages with a product or
specific article so if we're interested
in that particular conversion then
longer tail keywords are likely more the
way we want to go versus something more
generic which means if you're using a
generic shorter tail keyword you're more
interested in the visibility and the
traffic not necessarily the conversion
today we're going to talk talk about SEO
tips and tricks so let's get started and
throughout this series we're going to
have a few tips to share with you and
we'll start out with tip number one opt
for smarter ways to do keyword research
and so if you listen any of our SEO
tutorials in the past you know that
keyword research is the first step but
the most crucial step in starting SEO so
when we do keyword research we want to
be able to basically find keywords that
we feel are relevant to our business
that we want to be found on search for
and so here are a few tips that can help
you do that research in a more efficient
manner the first thing we want to do is
identify a list of keywords that are
relevant so we only want to focus on
relevant keywords for our business
that's a given so what I would suggest
is as the best practice maybe you know
put down some of those keywords in a
spreadsheet so think of them as a theme
of keywords because when you do research
you're going to want to include a theme
of keywords related to one another so
you can pick the best ones out of that
theme and so as an example if we have a
company that sells dried figs in a
spreadsheet as an example if I show you
a spreadsheet maybe we want to focus it
on just dried fig and maybe we want to
focus it on dried fig recipes so go
ahead and put those in a column you know
some of these keywords that you know you
want to be found for so that's really
the first step they need to be relevant
so put them in a spreadsheet so that you
can build keywords around that list then
we want to choose keywords and when we
choose keywords we want to have some
criteria around choosing them and so we
always want to choose keywords with a
lot of volume and what I mean by volume
I mean how many people on average type
in that keyword or a related keyword per
month the second criteria is the keyword
of product fit meaning you know is the
keyword relevant you always want to stay
true to relevancy the third is
commercial intent what is the intent of
the keyword is it trying to get us a
sale is it answering a question so what
is the intent of that keyword and then
last it's difficulty so we want to
definitely take a look at how difficult
a keyword is to rank for on organic
search so that's some of the criteria
you may have some additional criteria
that you want to use but this is the
criteria basically for choosing key
wordss so again we want to prefer
keywords with high volume you want to be
careful of seasonality so remember
seasonality and this example Christmas
tree you're only going to have a spike
you know during the winter or excuse me
the October November December months so
be careful of seasonality when choosing
high volume keywords and again keywords
that are relevant to your product even
though it doesn't have much search
volume relevancy o trumps uh volume or
any other metric commercial intent so we
want to look at keywords that for
example have Buy in them they may have
low search volume but if somebody's
typing in that keyword then we can
insinuate that the consumer who typed in
that keyword is ready to make the
purchase so we want to look at what the
intent is of that keyword and then again
the difficulty always opt for keywords
that have low difficulty or competition
and so in order to get these metrics we
can use third party tools and I'm going
to show you a couple of examples of
third party tools you can use that will
give you some of this information so the
first tool I'm going to show you is
Google ads Keyword Planner so if I'm
having a Google ads account I could
simply go to tools and then choose the
Keyword Planner and from there I want to
find new keywords so if I choose the
keyword dried figs because that's the
keyword I put in my spreadsheet that I'm
interested and optimizing for and then
maybe drive fig recipes that was the
other keyword theme so if I enter those
two keywords in just to begin with
basically what Google is going to give
me is the average search monthly volume
so here I can see dried figs I have an a
average monthly search volume 8,100 that
means on average over the last 12 months
that's how many people have typed in
that keyword here I can see a little bit
of a trend I just hover my mouse over
that graph I could see again for
seasonality impact if there is any
season ality what the volume is on
average per month then I can see the
competition is high and because this is
Google ads because it's paid search
they're going to give me a sense or an
idea of what I should be bidding on the
keyword now that's another topic for
another day but it's good information to
have because if you're not ranking for a
keyword you could decide to bid on it
for paid search so don't discard the
bidding information go ahead and put it
in a spreadsheet for later use but for
now we're focused in on keywords that
are relevant how much volume how much
competition okay so once I get this
information here I can simply go back to
my spreadsheet and put that information
in there what's the volume for dried fig
what is the competition now for
competition notice that Google ads gives
us a higher low now if we're trying to
measure ratio between volume and
competition we want to get an actual
sense of what that competition is so
what I always do as a best practice is
is go into Google search if I go to
Google Search and I type in dried figs
I'm going to see the actual volume is 34
mil 500,000 so I could see that's the
actual search volume for this particular
keyword however if I add a syntax called
all and tile before that keyword with a
colon space and then hit enter Then I
could see the actual volume reduces to
31,000 and basically with this tells me
is that 31,000 listings or results have
the keyword dried figs in the title tag
so if a web page has dried fig or
targeted keyword in the title tag then
ideally we can insinuate that that page
is trying to rank for that keyword so
therefore in order for us to rank number
one on Google we have to jump over
31,000 results so we want to be able to
include this information into our
keyword analysis so if I go into our
keyword analysis here and I go ahead and
enter in that information so what's my
keyword my keyword is dried figs okay my
volume was 8,100 my competition was
31,000 and so that gives me a ratio of
81 / by 31,000 if I make that into a
percentage basically 26% so that's my
keyword Effectiveness index or Ki or
ratio between volume and competition and
so that's an a way that you can gather
information is by using Google ads enter
the information into a spreadsheet and
then sort all your data by Kei you could
sort it by volume you could sort it by
competition all these metrics matter
alternatively as another tool you can
use MZ so MZ has a keyword explore tool
okay so if I type in the keyword dried
figs focusing on the United States I
could see that Maz says hey look there's
anywhere between 4,300 and 6500 in terms
of volume out of 100 the difficulty is
41 and so I can expect a clickthrough
rate of you know 41% and so basically
the great thing about moz's keyword
Explorer tool is I can also look at the
surf analysis search engine results
Pages what surf stands for and I can
analyze the Ser for a particular keyword
in MZ so I want to be able to understand
my competition's doing so here I could
see if I really want to try and optimize
for that keyword I could see what the
other pages are ranked for that keyword
and the on page one I can also see what
local results show up for that keyword
so here I can see that we have a number
of different sites listed here so if we
want to be number one these are the
sites that are basically above us that
we need to climb over to be number one
on Google so I find that the keyword
explore tool in Moz is very helpful for
understanding your competition as well
as getting a alternative check on volume
and competition or difficulty if you
will and so remember we want to identify
a list of keywords that are relevant I
can't stress that enough we want to
choose keywords based on difficulty we
want to choose keywords based on volume
on Commercial intent and more important
relevancy we can also identify Trends
from a site search query like Amazon and
know what your competitor are ranking
four so we can also go back into Moz and
we can see just by typing in some of the
keywords we're focusing on we can see if
our competitors are ranking for the same
keywords just by using that keyword
Explorer tool and then another thing we
want to look at is LSI or latent
semantic indexing so that's a fancy word
which basically means we want to find
keywords related to the topic of the
page you're trying to optimize so if
there are other keywords on that page
then you could Sway and that direction
and so when it comes to choosing
keywords you want to choose always a
primary and secondary keyword and so if
we go back to our spreadsheet it doesn't
necessarily always have to be just one
keyword it doesn't necessarily have to
be dried figs we could choose another
keyword that has a good volume to
competition ratio so we want to choose
keywords that are always relevant and if
we're analyzing nothing but relevant
keywords then we want to be able to
choose keywords that have a good ratio
between volume and competition so you
always want to choose at least two
keywords per page we could also stay up
to date on industry news as will help
you learn new jargon so it doesn't hurt
to subscribe to sites like search engine
watch or search engine land they have
lots of good tips so here I'll show you
what that one of those sites look like
if I simply just go to searchengine
watch.com I find this is a good resource
to stay up on the latest news when it
comes to search engines here we could
see the Y SEO and frontend developers
are the perfect search marketing team
another article about optimizing your
channel YouTube channel five easy steps
so there's a lot of information here on
search engine watch that pertain to SEO
and keyword research we could also look
at other third party sites like
Wikipedia Reddit and Kora for example so
if I go to Kora I can do a search for
dried figs and I could see what's being
written about that topic so that should
give me some ideas to build a keyword a
list around so for example the health
benefits of dried figs okay are dried
figs safe for diabetes best ways to eat
dried figs so those are all good keyword
themes that we could build a keyword
list around and I did that simply just
by typing in dried figs on Kora so
that's a a good tip for you to leverage
when you're trying to build out a
keyword list okay let's uh talk about
tip number two which is publish high
quality content to get more traffic to
website so it's all about content so
we've already done the keyword research
we still need to kind of merge the two
but when we talk about merging the two
it's not just building content around
those keywords it's much more than that
when it comes to SEO and so that's why
we always talk about high quality
content so let's talk about some of the
tips that can help you create high
quality content so first tip is we want
to be able to publish longer and
engaging cont content longer an engaging
content tends to rank hire on Google why
because you have more content to work
with and when you have more content to
work with you can optimize it you can
structure it you can insert different
assets like videos and images and by
keeping it long you're going to likely
keep it engaging and so Google tends to
lean in favor of content that is well
organized structured and long because it
is more likely to be engaging for the
end user we definitely want to include
those Target keywords so you want to be
able to you know insert those keywords
into those metat tag descriptions into
those title tags into those alt tags but
you want to work them in naturally you
don't want to force anything content
should be naturally written because if
it's naturally written it's going to be
engaging so we want to use LSI keywords
in the content so LSI or basically
latent semantic indexing basic Bally
just means uh different terms and
concepts related to your target keywords
so feel free to use terms that are
similar to what you're currently using
these keywords can definitely be used
for SEO because they can create more
visibility and potentially higher
rankings because it gives you an
opportunity to use keywords that are
natural and work for different
variations and let's look at an example
so if you're optimizing an e-commerce
category page and and your keyword is
one mix shoes for men so we want to use
keywords closely related to one mix
shoes for men for example running shoes
for men or sport running shoes for men
outdoor sport shoes or air cushion shoes
let's take a look at example of Amazon
so if I go to Amazon I could see the one
mix shoes for men page and if I look at
this page I can see a lot of product and
each product has basically some content
associated with
I.E the title of the particular product
and so you want to be able to use
different descriptors for this
particular product for example men's
running shoes or breathable lightweight
gym sport shoes or lightweight casual
sneakers or walking casual sneaker all
of these are LSI related keywords
they're similar to what we're trying to
optimize for so you don't necessarily
always have to be brand heavy or stick
with one key word you could definitely
show variation especially on the
e-commerce side if you're dealing with
different product so we want to make the
content readable with the help of
visuals subtitles and bullet points so
if you're e-commerce you want to make
sure that page is laid out properly easy
to read you here I could see the
descriptor along with the title all kind
of merged together and so there's no
breakout of okay this is the product
name this description it's kind of one
allinone which I like it just makes it
more natural sound in okay and you can
see these are all broken out uh pretty
well laid out page and Amazon is more or
less you know consistent in terms of how
their pages are laid out so make it
readable add visuals add subtitles add
bullet points it helps break out a lot
of the content especially if you have a
long amount of content or large amount
of content so the use of subtitles
bullet points and visuals will help
break it out structure it and make it
more engaging for the end user you
definitely want to write an effective
and organized content in order to reduce
the balce rate so there is correlation
between engagement and balce rate the
more you structure the more you add
visuals the more you had subtitles the
more engaged somebody's going to be the
less likely they are to balance from the
page we also want to share customer
reviews and ratings so if you have a web
page you sell products even if you don't
sell products it's always good to have
testimonials or some type of customer
review so if we go back to our example
Le on Amazon and we clicked on a product
uh one of the running shoe products we
look here we can see the image we could
see kind of the description well I may
not be so interested in buying this
product I want to know a little bit more
about it well that's where the breaking
point comes in that's where the decision
Factor comes in where if I read other
reviews then I can possibly have my mind
made up to buy this product so here I
could see that not only there reviews
but but there's testimonials so I could
see that here you could see that there's
a lot of stars and you can see the kind
of the review title these running shoes
are very comfortable and lightweight so
you have a lot of different feedback and
so reading custom reviews is always
helpful because even though you're
making the decision it kind of will help
sway you in one direction or another at
least it does for me so that's the the
beauty of a customer review and a rating
we want to be able to use those to our
advantage and then you want to be able
to update your content on a regular
basis so and that goes for testimonials
and reviews you want to make sure you're
always getting reviews if you're always
getting reviews then that's just adding
to the particular product and so if
you're always updating your content on a
regular basis as well then Google's
going to be able to see that and Google
likes fresh content okay we also want to
include the benefits of the product so
if you're selling a product any product
you always want to include the benefits
you want to do as much as you can to
make your product engage into to the end
user enticing so that they can buy it so
in addition to customer reviews or
adding content about the product you
want to include benefits so if we go
back to Amazon here we could see Amazon
list a lot of the benefits or one mix in
this case list a lot of the benefits so
here you could see all the descriptors
about the particular product it's got
rubber so it's got a breathable textile
lining you get free hot quality socks
with every shoe so these are some of the
features and if we continue to scroll
down we could see some of the details
about the fabric type specifics about
the fabric and there's a lot of
information on this product page even a
sizing chart so a lot of different
features that will help the end User
make the decision so don't hold back at
as much information as you possibly can
as much information as you have
available it doesn't hurt because in the
end what you're trying to do from a
product perspective is sell the product
and you can't really sell it unless you
have information that's going to
convince the user that this product is
what they want to buy so include the
warranty size recommendation return
policy and some offers so it should all
be listed on the page easy for the end
user to see so can't stress it enough
provide as much product information as
possible I go back here here it has a
size and chart what colors are available
again some of the descriptors if I
scroll down here I can see some more of
the benefits you know waffle rubber
outsole soft deodorant insole again
fabric type it's got all sorts of
information it's got images about the
fabric itself the shoe itself how it's
structured so a lot of information about
this and it even does a comparison and
so there's a lot of information about
this particular product so don't hold
back add as much as you can to convin
the end user so so in the case of the
one mix on Amazon you know they had a
sizing chart you know they had an FAQ
they had additional information what
other products did customers view from
one mix and then testimonials so these
are some of the basic bits of
information you want to add on your page
if you don't have customer views it's
okay add FAQ in its place again the end
result is to convince the customer to
purchase the product and then build a
comprehensive internal linking structure
of web pages so every product page page
should link to similar products so if I
go back here here I can see other
products from one mix so you should
always have a linking structure so that
if the end user doesn't want to
particularly buy that particular product
then you have links available so they
can go to another page and then add
different varieties and related short
videos of the product so if we go back
to our product page you know they have
different varieties that they're
showcasing here they have the size chart
they even have have a size convertible
chart so if you're dealing with metric
you can go over to us metric fee vice
versa you can add a video you know show
a video of if you're selling running
shoes show a video of somebody working
out you know it doesn't have to be a
full-blown commercial per se but it
could be a short 30 second video of what
the shoe looks like on somebody else's
feet so that they could see somebody
walking with those shoes on so video
doesn't have to be a big production you
can do it right from your phone so
review your content before you publish
this goes without saying you want to do
that just you make sure you include
everything possible because when the
content does get published remember
Google's going to index that content
when they index it it's going to show up
in the search results so we want to make
sure we have all the information readily
available not only for the end user but
for Google as well we want to be able to
analyze our metat tags and URL to
improve click through rat so this is
important because the meta tags I.E the
title tag in The Meta description and
the URLs what shows up in Google search
results so if we have title tags step
first that's the first important element
that's what shows up in the search
results so what we want to do is we want
to optimize the title tag and when we
optimize it we want to use modifiers and
when I say modifiers I mean you know
feel free to use the word best or cash
back or free shipping or discount so for
example if you're selling running shoes
25 best sneakers or up to 70% off or
free shipping or buy shoes on discount
very action oriented but you know it
includes these modifiers that are going
to help somebody click on that link so
some tips for optimizing the title tag
in addition to the modifiers we want to
watch the title length and we want to
include those Target keywords in the
title tag so remember you're likely
going to have two keywords to work with
you want to have at least one of those
keywords words in your title tag so with
the modifier you know up to 60 to 65
characters in length with that targeted
key word should get you a good title tag
that's going to get somebody to click on
it so let's look at an example so if I
typee in the keyword best recipes for
dried figs you know here I could scroll
down here's my title tag stands out my
URL is right underneath that and
underneath the URL are is the meta
description and so here I can see some
modifiers 100 88 best Autumn dried fig
recipes or 25 fantastic fig recipes or
10 best cooking dried fig recipes so
these are all modifiers that going to
help somebody get the click get them to
click on your link and go to your
website so when you don't hit the 65
character limit if you go over that
Google's going to cut off the title text
so we want to avoid that at all possible
so the whole idea is you know like 10
best cooking dried fig recipes by yly
that's a good enticing title tag okay
takes to encounter modifier includes the
targeted keyword and is under the 65
character count some additional tips for
writing meta description we always want
to provide a unique description for each
web page of the website so no duplicate
meta tag descriptions every page needs
to be unique then we also want to be
specific about what we're offering so if
you have say you're selling headphones
and you have a particular set of
headphones from a diff specific brand
include that in the meta description if
you have that particular product from
that brand on sale include that in the
meta description so you want to be as
specific as possible the whole idea
behind a meta description is to describe
the page but also to get the end user to
click on your link so here's an example
of using modifiers and describing a page
if we look at Amazon again we could see
this example here and if we look at it
on Google search results so if I type in
Amazon Bluetooth headsets $10 are on
sale here we can see a lot of Amazon
listings in Google search here you can
see the use of modifiers in the title
tag and also in the meta description
here we could see that you know this
particular headset Bluetooth headset is
on sale 50% off so if something's on
sale feel free to include it be
descriptive about the pay page let
people know where they're going and use
those modifiers don't be afraid to use
numbers in The Meta description even if
it's the price itself even if it's not
on sale but it is the price included
it's not going to hurt the more
information you can include in a meta
description the better chance you have
of somebody clicking on that link use
numbers symbols you know percentages off
always help use catchy words like
discount or cashback you're competing
with other listings on the page so if
you have something on sale if it's on
clearance list that it's on clearance
here I can see they even included the
coupon code so feel free to list as much
specific information about that page as
possible the whole idea is you're
competing with your own web pages but in
other cases with competitors so the meta
description along with the title tag and
the URL helps separate out you from the
rest of the listings on search engine
results and we don't want to keyword
stuff we want to keep it within 160
something characters or 160 65
characters because Google will break off
the metad description just like they do
with the title tag and so we want clean
natural written metad descriptions that
separate you from the competition so
that means including the keywords but
making sure those keywords are naturally
included in the meta description so if I
go back again to Valley fig.com and I
can see the meta description hey Welcome
to the best resource online for dried
fig recipes Savor is sweet snacks or
healthy dried fig recipes we've got it
all they start cooking with figs and so
it's natural sounding it does include
the keyword it's not keyword stuffing
it's natural sounding that's hopefully
going to get that person to click on
this particular website let's turn our
attention to the URL so we want to make
sure that the URL is basically taking
into account best practices so if we
take a look at this particular URL here
it doesn't necessarily look as
attractive as we would like so first of
all I don't understand some of it so
that makes it unpleasant boring and
messy to say the least so you want URLs
that you know basically are clean and
understandable so in other words we want
to make them SEO friendly because if
they're SEO friendly somebody
understands the URL then they're likely
going to click on it so the old rule of
thumb is if you can read the URL then
the search engines can read the URL so
here are some tips for creating friendly
URLs for SEO make it readable you want
to include the target keyword in the URL
so if it's dried figs the URL should
include dried figs if it's dried fig
recipes make sure it's dried fig recipes
now avoid using too many subdirectories
in the URLs so we want to keep it as
close as possible to the root directory
and match the URLs to titles most of the
time so let's go back to our example
here here we could see this is Valley
fig.com recipes not necessarily dried
fig recipes but recipes nonetheless it's
in the root directory okay so at all
cost now this is in some cases
unavoidable given that you may be
dealing with an e-commerce website
that's calling you know content from a
database so if it that is the case
you're going to have some Dynamic
parameters in the URL which is fine just
make sure you avoid having too many of
those Dynamic parameters it's
understandable at parameters but the ru
of th generally is no more than two
different parameters in the URL so
prefer to create short URLs that's
really the way to go the shorter the
better is the rule of Thum and you know
if you're going to break up the URL then
use hyphens instead of underscores it's
just cleaner it's a more understandable
search engines tend to read it a little
bit easier if it's hyphen so here's what
a friendly URL looks like for search you
got your domain you got a subcategory
broken up with a hyphen and then the
product so that's a just a clean URL for
a particular e-commerce site that has
categories and subcategories so again we
got amazon.com your category can be
Electronics your subcategory could be
earphones and your product could be boat
earphones it's that simple let's start
with talking about rich Snippets this is
tip number four so we want to add Rich
Snippets to improve your website's
visibility on serers so tip number four
is all about rich Snippets so let's
start out by asking ourselves what is a
rich snippet so rich snippet is simply
just a term used to describe structured
data markup that you as a website owner
can add to your HTML so hypertext markup
language or HTML is what is basically
constructs a page so if we can add more
more information to that that will
internal all search engines like Google
to better understand the information
that's on that web page so the more
Google understands about that web page
the more they can put into the search
engine results page so rich niit bits is
basically some structured data markup
that we can add to our existing HTML and
so if we want to add Rich Snippets to
search engines then how would you prefer
your products to be displayed well if we
have products then we want to make sure
that maybe we have reviews or maybe we
have so other information in there like
uh links to our site okay so there's a
lot of different types of Rich Snippets
that you know we can add that Google can
recognize and add to the search engine
results so if you have a product then
there's a lot of things we can add like
specifically product reviews so we want
to be able to add more in information to
the search engine results by working in
some rich nippet so basically the whole
idea is to set up the rich nippit to
drive targeted traffic okay so because
the more information in the Ser the more
likelihood you're going to get the click
and the more likelihood that click is
specific traffic so some of the benefits
of structuring the data for Rich nippet
are as a mention increasing click rates
you know also increasing conversion
rates so when you get the traffic from
from organic search to your website if
somebody's looking for specific product
and you have a number of different good
reviews showing up let just say five
stars out of five stars and you have 100
reviews showing five stars then you know
somebody's probably going to send take
some trust in your brand and your
conversion rate probability is going to
go higher it also helps improve your
search engine visibility because you're
adding more information so in other
words the more Google knows about your
page the likelihood it's going to rank
that page page and it's more likely that
that information that's contained in
that rich nippet is going to get
featured in either the knowledge graph
which is that graph on the right side or
any featured snippet which usually shows
up at the top of search engine results
so in other words the more information
you give Google the more they can use
that information on their search results
page and there's no disagreeing that the
more information that you have in your
search engine result the likelihood of
getting more tra trffic increases so for
Rich Snippets you could always start
with images so some of the common
properties that you can add to your
product page if you have a product page
just a page itself is an image you can
always start there you can always add a
description you can always add in
ratings and you can always add in
reviews so these are some of the most
common attributes you can add as a rich
snippet so if you add that Google picks
it up it's going to include that
information in the search results okay
some others or offers prices site links
links to your site and product
availability so all the information
could be conveyed to Google Google
understands what you're trying to pass
along it's going to include that in the
search results so did you know that
according to HRS over
99.58% of featured pages that have
structured data already rank in the top
10 list of the Google search results
page so in other words if you have Rich
Snippets in your page your chances of
ranking in the top 10 of a Google result
is going to be very very very good okay
let's talk about tip number five
optimize your site structure for great
user experience so let's go over some of
the tips that you would do for planning
a good website for SEO and so tip number
one is you want a Ural structure that
follows your s's navigation hierarchy so
obviously home page interior pages so
depending on what type of site you have
obviously the navigation needs to follow
that sites navigation that site
hierarchy and it all starts with a
homepage you want to optimize your
homepage to drive traffic to your
product pages so the homepage is nothing
more than a doorway into your website
and so the s's navigation should link to
all those different products so if you
have a e-commerce site with
subcategories or categor sub categories
then you want to be able to make sure
your navigation reflects that you want
to build a comprehensive structure for
internal linking as well because when
you're from the homepage obviously you
want to be able to easily navigate to
other Pages however when you're on other
Pages you want to be able to have a link
pointing back to relevant pages and not
necessarily the homepage so this serves
two purposes one for the end user
obviously you want the end user to
navigate through your website seamlessly
right second for the search engines
their following links they want to be
able to understand how your website
flows and links together so you don't
want a scenario where it's a oneway
street from the homepage to Interior
Pages you want basically homepage to
Interior interior to other relevant
interior pages and that could be a
lateral or that can be a situation where
it's a hierarchy for example homepage
category subcategory category Etc you
want to be able to make sure your site
is constructed in a manner in which the
search engine can read it so CSS or
cascading stylesheets or hypertext
markup language HTML are your two most
common languages that's basically what
browsers load that's what search engines
like to index it just makes it easy for
them to understand what your page is all
about remember we talked about rich
Snippets in the previous tip Rich
Snippets are nothing nothing more than
supplemental HTML to describe what the
page is all about so that the search
engines can understand that page and
include reviews or include site links in
the search engine results so this is all
based on HTML so the more you provide
the search engines in a more structured
manner via HTML the more the search
engines are going to understand the page
adding breadcrumbs to your product pages
is also a good practice if you have an
e-commerce site and you have a category
then a subcategory then a sub
subcategory then a product page well
it's probably not a bad idea to make
sure you have a breadcrumb so that was
that way somebody can easily go right
back from the product page to say the
category page or to the subcategory page
directly without having to hit the back
button or having to go through the
navigation some good examples I think
Amazon does a good example of using
breadcrumbs giving the amount of
products they have on their site so go
check out Amazon if you want a good
example for breadcrumbs and then
canonical tags we want to make good use
of canonical tags and that's in order to
avoid duplicate content so a canonical
tag is nothing more than a link element
basically or an HTML element that
basically prevents duplicate content
issues so in other words if we have a
canonical tag as a metat tag basically
we're telling the search engines this is
the preferred or canonical version of a
web page so use this web page so it
signals to the search engines which page
they should basically index and pay
attention to and avoid all the other
pages that have similar content so
that's the idea behind a canonical tag
so that's a good best practice and then
optimize your site for desktop and
mobile I can't stress the mobile part
enough most users begin their Journey on
mobile so if you're not sure about what
the search engines like or don't like
you can always refer to Google search
console for an example so if you go to
Google Search console they have a report
called mobile usability so if you click
on mobile usability you can see what
pages they like what pages they don't
like from a mobile perspective and if
you have errors they're going to tell
you what those errors are so if your
website has text that's too small to
read They're going to tell you that
these are the pages with this error and
so that allows you to go and address
those errors because from a Google
perspective if you have if a page has a
mobile usability error then Google will
not index that page so leverage Google
search console to get a sense of what
type of Errors your site has from a
mobile perspective you also want to
prefer to keep your checkout page simple
so again from an e-commerce perspective
you want to keep the checkout page as
simple as possible for obvious reason
you want the end user to have a good
experience and you obviously want the
conversion so when I say keep a checkout
page simple really now with today's
technology you can create a onepage
checkout process you want to optimize
your site map so when we talk about
sitemaps we want to make sure that it's
a file an XML file that basically
includes all of our URLs and we can then
turn around and give that site map to
the search Eng ions so if you have a
sitemap in XML make sure you go to
Google Search console so if I go to
Google Search console and I click on sit
Maps I can just simply just tell Google
where my sit map is located and when
they recognize that sit map they're
going to be able to basically index the
URLs from that s map so we could see
here how many URLs they discover and how
many they index so make sure you create
the sitemap in an XML format submit the
sitemap via Google search console and
then you can go back and see how many
pages they've indexed versus how many
you've submitted and you want to make
sure that sitemap is dynamic meaning
anytime you publish a URL that URL is
added to the site map fixing broken
links so broken links is not something
you want but it's something every
website has it's unavoidable you know
people publish Pages all the time
there's test Pages there's all sorts of
reasons why a site has broken links you
want to be able to address those and
again going back to Google search
console we can basically see just by
looking at some reports what pages have
broken links and which ones don't so we
could certainly look at search console
to get information about basically what
pages are broken which ones aren't and
then we want to prefer predicted
searches and integrate product
typographic errors on your search bar so
basically have a search bar that's a
best practice but anticipate knowing
what people are typing in so that means
maybe going into Google analytics and
looking at the Search terms report so we
can go into analytics and look at Search
terms uh to get a sense of what people
are searching for but you know when we
talk about integrating product
typographic errors we're talking also
about fonts so we want to make sure
we're using the latest fonts so that we
don't run into any issues on our website
uh people not being able to read based
on a specific font that you're using and
then as a best practice what I found and
and this is not necessarily for everyone
but using a live chat widget sometimes
helps in fact that would even go beyond
sometimes most the time again depending
on your business but I see most
businesses now have live chat enabled
and so basically having live chat
enables somebody who has a question to
immediately reach out to somebody versus
picking up the phone versus sending an
email it's just instantaneous
gratification in some ways so inserting
life chat on a website is more common
practice than not nowadays given it it
lends to a better user experience tip
number six improve your page speed and
reduce the bounce rate so let's talk
about page speed and how page speed
correlates with higher bounce rate if
it's a high page load and so according
to Crazy page speed is an important over
SEO tactic because for every second
delay and Page load can result in 11%
fewu page views 16% decrease in customer
satisfaction 7% decline in conversion
rate so you know you could see here
regardless of how specific the numbers
are when you have a page that loads slow
you're going to have lower user
engagement and a poor user experience
so you have to pay attention to page
speed and so since 2010 Google has been
using page speed as a factor for page
ranking in the search engine results so
here are some tips to focus on making
sure your pages are optimal in terms of
speed so enable browser caching okay you
can reduce plugins if you're using
Wordpress as an example you know
disabled plugins you're not using
getting using a simple website design
going back back to tip number five stick
with CSS and HTML don't do anything
fancy in terms of Technology because
it's only going to complicate matters
optimize your code Minify files meaning
hey if you're not using any code just
get rid of it because code has to
execute and that slows down page low
time so if your website has numerous CSS
and javascripts files basically Minify
and combine them and there that's what
we're talking about there you know you
don't necessarily need a lot of you know
JV script on your page you can leverage
Google tag manager or you know other
features that help minimize the number
of JavaScript files you have and so you
can also get some of these ideas by
going into Google analytics so in
analytics under Behavior under sight
speed under page timings you can
basically see how quick each page loads
and then if you click on speed
suggestions right below page timings
what happens is Google's going to
actually give you some suggested ways to
increase speed so if we lit this report
load we'll be able to see some speed
suggestions per page and so here you can
see for example the homepage has an
average page load time of 4.89 seconds
you can see right next to that we have
page speed suggestions seven total so if
we click on that basically what it's
going to do it's going to launch another
Google product called page speed
insights and what page speed insights is
going to do is is going to analyze the
page in question whether that be the
homepage or an interior page and what
they're actually going to do is not only
analyze the desktop version of your
website but also the mobile version and
so now we could see opportunities to
improve our page speed by making sure
the images are properly sized making
sure server response time is changed
again defer unused CSS not using CSS
that's or getting rid of CSS or
minifying it so there's lots of things
you can do and again this is desktop and
mobile so on the mobile side we could
see some of the other issues too that
are causing High page load so analytics
sight speed reports page speed insights
are good ways to get an idea really
excellent ways to really address page
loow time issues so again these are just
some of the common issues with page low
time there could be other fact so
leaning on those page speed insights
reports will definitely help reduce page
low time so basically according to
Google a website should have you know
time to First Bite lesser than 200
milliseconds milliseconds is very very
fast so in case your website is slower
than 200 milliseconds such as 500
milliseconds or more you need to improve
it so you don't even have to measure it
by milliseconds you can even go by
seconds which is what most of us count
time and again you could see that simply
going into the speed suggestions report
in Google analytics so ideally in terms
of seconds you want something that's
about you know 4 seconds or less 3
seconds or less obviously as fast as
possible so case study Walmart Walmart
reported the following results so
Walmart experienced a 2% increase in
conversions for every 1 second of page
speed Improvement so think about that
there's definitely correlation
between page load time and speed so in
conversions and user engagement so the
quicker your page loads the higher the
engagement so with that Improvement they
also experienced an increment in Revenue
so meaning the pages load people had a
better user experience they were able to
check out easier and that led to more
Revenue so they were able to measure
Revenue against milliseconds and that's
something you can certainly do in
analytics you can correlate Revenue with
balce rate you can correlate Revenue
with PHP tip number seven build quality
links and increase their domain
authority of your website so Google's
top three search ranking factors
includes link building so you need to
have quality links from quality sites
pointing to your site and so that's a
factor in terms of ranking so that's
falls under off page SEO you need to
build reference es and links on quality
sites and so building quality links to
your content can give your product or
category Pages or even content or blog
post a boost in the serers so it's all
about quality over quantity so it's
always building quality links not
quantity so let's talk about what kind
of strategies you should Implement so if
you implement these strategies then
you're going to likely see a lift in the
serps so earn backlinks from relevant
and authoritative web pages so what's
authoritative well authoritative is
subjective to some degree but it's also
measurement in others so you could use
Moz as a good tool to measure page
Authority or domain Authority so if I go
into MZ MZ has a page and domain
Authority score between 1 and 100 and so
you can actually see what sites have
good domain or page Authority just by
ENT ing in the domain so relevant you
obviously want to rank to something
that's relevant so if you're in the food
industry something food related you want
to promote your content regularly on
social media so social media I always
considered a lwh hanging fruit when it
comes to backlinking you know there's so
many different social media platforms
available Facebook LinkedIn Twitter
there's so many varieties from images to
Pinterest and Instagram to video being
YouTube so there's lots of ways to get
your content out on social media that
will allow you to not only promote your
band build a community but also
establish a reference back to that page
you can opt for guest blogging okay so
you can reach out to another blogger and
blog on that platform it could be
reciprocal as well a blogger can
certainly you know blog on your platform
and have a link back and it works both
ways influencer marketing so influencer
marketing is working with somebody who
has a large amount of followers who can
influence those followers to you know
mention you in a hashtag link to your
particular product or brand or even
drive traffic to your site so you want
to take advantage of social media
platforms and start your own page as
well so Facebook's a good example it
could be having a YouTube channel if
you're into video you can certainly set
up a YouTube channel build a following
around YouTube as well so always start
your own page if that's the platform of
choice the last thing you should do is
set up a page on social media and not
keep it updated you could certainly
participate in forums you can
participate in other websites like Kora
or Reddit that's very you know content
based content driven user driven I
always recommend starting your own blog
blog is a good way to not only generate
content but it's a good way to
incorporate different types of content
so you could set up different types of
content and categories it's a good way
to incorporate different assets like
images and video it's a good way to get
users engag by having comments or having
social share buttons it's a good way to
leverage that content onto other social
media platforms so there's lots of
benefits to blogging very few cons the
only con would be a time constraint but
it's better to have one blog post in one
month consistently then not blogging at
all so getting listed on high quality
link directories like Yahoo directory is
still a way to add a link from a high
quality site and then make use of broken
link building so again on the last tip
we mentioned search console search
console certainly has reports available
for you that allow you to see what pages
on your site are no longer there and
allow you to see what pages they're
linking from and you can also do
testimonials there's lots of ways to
generate quality langage in a way you
almost have to get creative but creative
in a way that's going to generate
quality not quantity quality is the key
so even if it's one source whether that
be somebody else's blog so be it as long
as it's quality that's what counts so
let's talk about some of the key
takeaways from today's tips so remember
tip number one we want to opt for
smarter ways to do keyword research so
remember we want to look at volume we
want to look at competition we want to
create themes put them in a spreadsheet
so we want to be smarter in which in the
way in which we choose our keyword tip
number two remember publish high quality
content to get more traffic when we say
high quality content remember break up
the content use different assets
organize it structure it you know make
sure it's answering somebody's questions
then we talked about in tip number three
analyzing your metatags and URLs so we
want to make sure that title tag meta
descriptions are created of use
modifiers like numbers or or promotions
you know we don't want to go over
character counts we want to make them
unique and distinct so that somebody
clicks on them then we talked about rich
Snippets and tip number four remember
Rich Snippets are just additional HTML
that communicates the search engines so
the search engines can understand
exactly what's on your page so if you
have recipes if you have reviews if you
have videos if you have images if you
have ratings all these things can be
added to the Surs just by communicating
with the search engines via Rich
Snippets tip five optimize your site
structure we want to make sure that you

we're going to talk about keyword
research so what are we going to talk
about when we talk about keyword
research we're going to talk about why
we would do keyword research for SEO
we're going to talk about the types of
keywords that we need to research we're
going to talk about some methodologies
best practices on how to do keyword
research some alternate suggestions
we're going to talk about keyword
clustering and then we're going to talk
about some tools that you can use to do
your keyword research so let's start
with the why we would do keyword
research so Jesse is planning to publish
a Blog of pizza recipes
so she was doing pizza recipes step by
step pizza recipes with sausage homemade
pizza toppings pizza dough recipes think
Crust Pizzas she's doing a lot of
different topics on pizza recipes well
what Jesse needs to do is understand
what's going to drive traffic to these
blog posts if she's writing about you
know different topics around pizza
recipes so she's Unsure how these blogs
are going to to drive traffic so she
really needs to understand that hey you
need to choose the right keywords to
drive traffic so the question is if
you're writing a blog post about recipes
with sausages is pizza recipes with
sausages or recipes for free the best
keyword to use maybe maybe not so you
need to take uh care and choosing the
keywords to align with your content so
that's really the idea why we would do
keyword research because because some of
the issues with keywords that are poorly
chosen are they could have low search
volume for example you may choose a
keyword that just a lot of people aren't
using to search for or they can be
highly competitive so if you choose a
keyword that's very broad or popular it
could be very competitive and take you a
long time to be found for that keyword
or you could just make the mistake of
choosing a keyword that isn't align with
your content or you can choose keywords
but use them incorrectly with your
content so these are some of the issues
that you can encounter if you just go
about choosing keywords randomly without
due diligence without the proper
research so low search volume will lead
to less traffic High competition you may
not even rank at all okay if somebody
finds you for a keyword that's not
relevant to the topic they're just going
to leave the page and if you're not
using the right keywords and or if you
are using the right keywords and not
using them correctly in the content then
then your pages may not even be found in
organic search so you really have to
take care and choosing the keywords to
me that's the most important step with
SEO is keyword research so we're going
to talk about the types of keyword
research then so we have short tail
keywords and we have longtail keywords
so if you write a blog post about pizza
recipes well what are you going to
choose a short tail or long tail so
let's talk about short tail keywords
first so short tail keywords are
keywords that are usually three keywords
in a phrase or shorter in some cases it
may be two keywords in a phrase or
shorter so short tail keywords usually
have high search volume which means
likely means higher competition but what
it also means it could be lower
conversions because short-tail key words
like for example pizza recipes could be
considered a short-tail key word but
maybe somebody's looking for homemade
pizza recipes or pizza recipes from
their favorite Italian restaurant so
short tail keywords may not be as
relevant so if we compare it with
longtail keywords chances are you're
going to have lower competition that's
one of the benefits but you're also
going to have lower search volume but
with longer tail keywords the keyword is
probably going to be more relevant with
the content you're writing about so
therefore the conversion rates likely
going to be higher so that's really the
difference between short tail keywords
and longtail keywords if you want to
look at simplistically short tail
keywords are Broad in nature it's going
to capture a lot of eyeballs but those
eyeballs may look at your content is not
relevant versus longtail keywords that
may be very relevant but not as many
eyeballs on them so short tail keywords
the characteristics they're not as
specific usually they're less than three
words they have high search volume and
high competition so if you just choose
pizza recipes could take you a while to
rank for that keyword but when you rank
you're going to get the traffic but
again it may not convert because the key
word is Broad in nature so pizza recipes
is a short tail keyword that may not be
exactly what you're writing about in
your blog post so it may draw a lot of
traffic but the traffic may not do
anything so the longer tail keywords are
very specific they consist of more than
three words in the search query they
have relatively low search volume
competition so the chance of you ranking
higher faster for that long TI word is
probably going to be greater because not
many other websites are trying to rank
for that thinky were and so the benefit
of that is if you have let's just say
homemade pizza recipes with mushrooms
that's a long TIY word but if somebody's
looking for that type of pizza recipe
then you know you're going to track the
right traffic and chances are that
traffic is going to engage or convert
based on the type of conversion you have
in place so example would be homemade
pizza dough recipes that'd be another
example more than th key words in the
phrase very specific specific we're
talking about homemade pizza dough
recipes so we're not talking about just
pizza recipes so it's a little bit more
uh specific in nature longer tail so
these keywords are used for targeted
Pages including blog posts if you're
writing a blog post specifically about
pizza recipes with homemade dough then
this is the keyword you likely would
want to use versus just pizza recipes so
let's look at an example between a short
tail keyword and a long tail keyword and
to accentuate the differences we're
going to use Google's Keyword Planner
tool so Google's Keyword Planner tool is
located in Google ads the Google ads
platform and when you're in the Google
ads platform you can simply click on
tools and then Keyword Planner and so
what Keyword Planner allows us to do is
get a sense of the type of volume that a
particular keyword has so what Google's
Keyword Planner does is they show you
the average monthly searches this is the
average monthly search volume of a
keyword over the past 12 months and so
in this example we're going to choose
pizza recipes and homemade pizza dough
recipes so one short tail and one long
tail so we enter those keywords in we're
going to click get results and what
Google's going to do is it's going to
show us the volume of those keywords so
for pizza recipe we could see the
average monthly search volume is
33,100 for pizza recipe so note that
pizza pizza recipe and pizza recipes are
closely related keywords and so what
Google does is they consider that a
close variance so meaning if somebody
ties in pizza recipe then they're also
in Google's eyes looking for pizza
recipes so it's a close variance and so
for the keyword pizza recipe which is
short tail we could see on average over
the past 12 months this keyword received
33,100 queries and so if we hover over
the graph we could see basically the
volume the average volume per month so
here I could see for this particular
keyword here the volume per month is 33
1,000 and then I can see the actual
volume over the past 12 months and then
for the longtail keyword I can see
homemade pizza dough recipe again close
variance homemade pizza dough recipes I
can see over the past 12 months what the
search volume is for this on average
it's 2400 but I could see here in
December the volume went up to 3,600 but
for example in May it was 1,900 so it's
going to fluctuate a bit over the past
12 months but on average it's about 2400
so shorter tail a lot of more volume
longer tail not as much volume but
nonetheless there is volume here and so
these are the differences between a
short tail and a longer tail and so what
Google's Keyword Planner also does is
allow us to get get a sense of what the
competition is and so here I can see the
competition is low for both of these
keywords fair enough so we now know that
if we want to optimize or choose the
keyword homemade pizza dough recipe for
our blog post we know for ranked on page
one of Google even in the top spot we
can expect about 2400 search queries for
that keyword now whether you get all
2400 clicks for that keyword remains to
be seen chances are you're not going to
get all 2400 you're going to get a lion
share of those clicks but you're going
to at least get some volume on it so
even the longer take keywords have a lot
of Promise because there is some search
volume here for this keyword how to do a
proper keyword research so we looked at
Google's Keyword Planner tool in Google
ads and we typed in two keywords and we
were able to get a sense of what the
average volume is so we definitely want
to choose key words based on the
following factors we want to choose it
based on search volume search volume is
a good indicator of the potential
traffic we can obtain so again for the
keyw homemade pizza dough recipe we know
that it averages 2400 a month in search
volume again we may not get all 2400 but
are we're going to get a line share of
that we also need to look at competition
and so Google's Keyword Planner gives us
a high medium or low in terms of the
competition but if you're somebody who
wants to get a better sense of what the
competition is and you should because
competition is a key component in
choosing keywords and so what I want to
do is get a sense of how many people are
actually optimizing for that keyword so
Google's Keyword Planner tool is going
to give me a low medium high really what
I want to do is get a better sense of
that numerically so what I can do is go
into Google search and I could type in
pizza recipes and I could see there's
about 1 billion results that's a lot of
results however that means that every
potential web page out there on the
internet that mentions pizza recipes is
going to be included in this number here
and so I want to get a better sense of
who's optimizing for pizza recipes so
I'm going to put in the all entitle
syntax and so what that is going to ask
Google to do is tell me all the web
sites that have pizza recipes the key
word pizza recipes in the title tag so
if I do all in tile colon space then
pizza recipes my result drops down to
336,000 so what that tells me is that
there are 336,000 results with the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag
now if I want to focus in on my other
keyword if I choose uh my other keyword
was a longer tail keyword homemade pizza
dough recipe so if I type that keyword
in the homemade pizza dough recipe or
recipes remember close variance and I
just click enter or type the keyword in
hit my enter key I'm going to get 35
Million results but again is that really
an indicator of the type of competition
I have no because every listing that
men's homemade pizza dough recipes is
going to be included in the search
results so I'm going to type in my all
en tile colon space and then I'm going
to get a better sense of how many
websites have the keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes in the title tag and I get
2,160 different results so here I can
see the first result in the title tag
homemade pizza dough recipe second one
homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
sites or web pages that have that
keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the
thing you have to understand about SEO
specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few
different keywords not just one or two
so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to
contain keywords that we can potentially
want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my
recommendation is you come up with a
theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's
our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipes so the close variance here is
pizza recipe what was the volume well we
we know the volume was 33,100 for pizza
recipe so what are we going to do we're
going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition
well if we go back and type in pizza
recipes it was 683 th000 so I'm going to
type in 6
183,000 what was our next keyword well
it was pizza or homemade pizza dough
recipes so if I go back for this
particular keyboard is 2400 so I'm going
to put 2400 in under my volume column
and then what was my competition well my
competition was if I type that keyword
back in 2,160 so I'm going to put
2,60 so now I have an idea of what kind
of volume and what kind of competition I
have now you want to do this for a
number of different keywords and when
you do it for number keywords what you
do want to do is obviously choose a
relevant keyword that has high volume
and low competition so another way of
saying it is is the volume or ratio of
volume to competition and so basically
what we could do is take volume divided
by competition and if I make that a
percentage I can see it's. 35% is the
ratio between volume and competition if
I do the same for my longer tail keyword
2400 / 2160 I can see that 111% so this
just kind of proves the point that yeah
I'm still going to get some volume but I
have a better chance of ranking for this
long longer teal keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes so you want to be able to
do that for number keywords and examine
the volume the competition and the ratio
between volume and competition for your
themed keywords in this case pizza
recipes so relevancy you want to choose
keywords that are very relevant to the
content that you're writing and then
again commercial intent what keywords
are going to drive more conversions and
revenue for the business so when we talk
about commercial intent we're talking
about you know are you choosing keywords
that are going to get somebody to do
what you want them to do so we could say
You Know download Pizza D recipes so
somebody's typing in the keyword
download pizza dough recipes then
chances are they're going to find you
come to your site and take action by
downloading that pizza dough recipe so
you want to be able to also think about
the intent of the keyword is it going to
help you drive conversions and revenue
if you're an e-commerce site so search
volume is the average monthly search
volume made for a particular keyword and
phrase so we can get that number using
Google's Keyword Planner tool in the
Google ads platform we want to Target
keywords with high search volume that
will help bring traffic to the website
we want volume but we want to take into
account seasonality as well so that's
where the Google's Keyword Planner tool
comes in place because if we go back
again we can just hover over we can get
a sense of any particular trend going on
or seasonality so for example if I saw
large growth in the winter months and
not much volume growth in the summer
months then that might indicate to me
that this keyword is more popular during
the winter time so pay attention to the
graphs that you know the Keyword Planner
tool gives you use them to your
advantage to take into account
seasonality so a good example would be
funny Halloween costumes well we know
that for Halloween you're going to have
a spike probably towards the end of
September all the way through October
and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so
that's an example but in the case of
pizza recipes you know you may find that
more people are choosing to search for
pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay
attention to seasonality it will affect
search volume so competition based on
our example it's one of the most
important key metrics you don't want to
choose a key word that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive
then it's going to be harder to rank
number one or even on page one of Google
depending on competitive it is so high
search volume low competition in other
words the ratio between the two is the
ideal combination so going back to the
spreadsheet recommend you have that
spreadsheet handy put your theme in
place okay theme pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find
the volume we use the All In title
syntax to find the competition so we
entered both of those numbers in and we
get our ratio and so when you have these
numbers for a number of different
keywords you want to be able to choose
that ratio of high volume low
competition but always relevancy always
trumps ratio so always go with a keyword
that is going to be relevant to your
content don't choose a keyword that's
not relevant if you choose a keyword
that's not relevant it's not going to
bode well for user engagement so the
difficulty of a keyword ranges from 0 to
100 in Google's keyword tool so it's
going to be easy it's going to be medium
it's going to be hard but my
recommendation is also to get the
numerical factor and that's the all
entitle syntax and again relevancy is
what drives the traffic to your website
and keep the traffic there on your
website and also not only will it keep
the traffic on your website but
hopefully get that traffic to engage and
convert so that's the key about
relevancy you always want to choose
keywords that are relevant to your
content even if it's sacrificing volume
relevancy again trumps volume and
competition so always choose relevant
keywords first so when you do that
you're always almost guaranteeing that
at some point somebody's going to find
your content because somebody out there
might be looking for it and if they do
you're going to get found and then the
engagement is going to be better so
understand your business find keywords
that are relevant to your business and
then focus on those key wordss that'll
help you with getting the right traffic
to your site always keep in mind the
commercial intent so these keywords are
more specific and result in conversion
rate for example buying is a good
commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your
website and buy then focus on those
types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could
be our commercial intent keyword again
there may be search volume but those are
the type of keywords you want to focus
on because that's the type of traffic
you want to drive to your site so some
other examples of commercial intent
keywords or discount deal your coupon
shipping you don't don't be afraid to
use some of these keywords as part of
your longer tail keyword phrase again
the volume may not be high but the
traffic quality is probably going to be
better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen
your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's
going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk
about keywords we also want to talk
about our primary and secondary keyword
so every page should have at least a
primary keyword and then a secondary
keyword to work with so primary keywords
are really defining the nature of your
content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why
do we choose a primary and secondary
keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to
the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that
secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to
content and you may rank for that
secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one
keyword you want to give your yourself a
chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant
nature so for web page there can several
secondary keywords but only one primary
keyword so your primary keyword is
always going to be relevant to your
content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may
have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the
content and it gives you a better
opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary in search Okay so
let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and
secondary keywords when using keywords
so if our primary keyword is healthy
diet plan remember healthy diet plan is
directly related to the content so
that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also
related to content and play off the
primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to co Google's Keyword Planner
tool and get an idea of the volume for
healthy diet plan and then also the
volume and competition for some of these
secondary keywords like healthy diet for
weight loss healthy diet food low carb
diet healthy mail plans and diet plan
weight loss so if I go in to Google's
Keyword Planner and type those keywords
in I'm going to choose get results and
now here I can see healthy diet plan
keyword I'm focusing on as my primary
keyword has an average monthly search
volume of
9,900 and then some of my secondary
keywords healthy diet foods diet plan
weight loss low carb diet you know
Google will give me a number of
different keywords to work with so I'm
going to look at the search volume of
those as well and so ideally what I want
to do is be able to then look at the
volume and then look at the competition
so healthy diet plan I go into my
keyword analysis here that's my theme so
that's my keyword what's my volume for
healthy diet plan
99,900 what's my competition so my
competition is
74,700 and that's going to give me a
ratio of volume to competition of 13 %
so that's what my content's about that's
a considered a short tail keyword
because it has a lot of competition and
so my ratio is 133% and what I want to
do is I want to be able to put these
other secondary keywords in here as well
maybe even go to a little longer tail
because I want to be able to find two
key at least two keywords I want to be
able to find my primary keyword that's
relevant to my content and then I want
to be able to find my secondary keyword
which is again Rel related to the
primary keyword which is also related to
the content and so I want to be able to
choose two keywords basically and I want
to choose two keywords that are relevant
that have good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea
again of how to do keyword research you
want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and get a
sense of what the volume is what the
competition is look at the ratio between
the volume and competition and then
based on the content choose choose that
primary keyword and then again based on
the keyword you chose choose some
secondary keywords as well because you
want to be found for not just one
keyword but multiple keywords okay let's
look at some alternative suggestions to
keyword research so for doing keyword
research we want to take into account
LSI keywords we could take into account
other platforms that host a lot of
content like Kora or Reddit we can use
Google suggestions in the key word
search bar we can use popular platforms
like Wikipedia and we can use social
media bookmarking like Reddit so there
are lots of suggestions that we can
obtain from various sources so let's
start with LSI keywords and LSI stands
for latent semantic insect indexing and
so basically what it is it's just
keywords that are linked to your primary
keyword and so when you're choosing
keywords you always want to choose that
primary keyword and then secondary
keywords that that are similar to the
primary keyword and usually those are
LSI or latent semantic indexing type
keywords so they're used to drive
relevant traffic to your page so if
you're focusing on one keyword we want
to have other keywords that are similar
to increase our visibility on the search
engine result pages so we could find
latent semantic indexing right in search
so if we use the term healthy diet if we
go to Google search for example if I
type in healthy diet in Google search
all I need to do is scroll to the bottom
of the page and I can see searches
related to healthy diet so healthy diet
menu healthy diet essay what does a
healthy diet look like notice at the top
Google's also given me some other
suggestions here so they're saying
lowfat diet veganism gluten-free diet so
there's lots of different suggestions
right in Google search bar so all of
these are LSI related keywords so if
you're optimizing a page for healthy
diet then you could choose lowfat diet
as a secondary keyword you can use
gluten-free diet as a secondary keyword
it really depends on what the content is
but you always want to support your
content with as much LSI keywords as
possible so you can be found for as many
different keywords as possible in Google
search so it's important because if you
have a Blog that you know talks about
python so how do the search engines know
if the website python is about the
programming language or the snake so
Google for example uses LSI keywords to
understand what the page is specifically
focusing on so if you're just focusing
on Python and your content you want to
support that with LSI keywords and so
that will allow your web page to better
communicate with Google also to have the
visibility to show up on search so they
can certainly improve your search
positioning and featured Snippets as
well so if you have a keyword that a
question you could certainly found for
featur snippet for example maybe you
know healthy diet recipes if I type that
in you could see here there's a featured
snippet so if I'm talking about recipes
that's a keyword I may want to use and
if I use that then Google has an
opportunity to see what my content's
about and place my information at the
top in this featured snippet you can
also again see what some of questions
are being asked what meals are good for
weight loss what is a good healthy diet
plan all of these could be keyword
phrases that you can use so the answers
are right here in Google so cor is a
great platform because core is a
platform that people go and ask
questions in a community responds with
answers or responses to that particular
question or topic and so the great thing
about core is it's a good it's a good
place for you to go to get some ideas
about a specific topic so if we're
talking about healthy diet in so we can
find keywords with high search volume
writing Kora so the whole idea is you
can look at you know the top five
questions for specific topic like
healthy dieting and find relevant key
wordss to healthy dieting so if you just
type in that particular keyword in Kora
you're going to probably get some
responses to questions or responses to
somebody else's question and so if we
take a look at core for example so if I
just type in healthy dieting what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get some
responses to the the topic healthy
dieting so what's the best diet for
Healthy Living what are the top five
tips for a healthy diet habit so all of
these could be keyword phrases that you
could take away with for your own
content and so the benefit here is
you're getting kind of an idea of what's
trending what people are talking about
and if you use tips for a healthy diet
habit for example and you optimize for
that well again that could turn around
and bode well for you because you could
be featured feed in Google as a featured
snippet at the top here you can also
turn around and use LSI related keywords
for healthy diet habits and you can
simply just look for those LSI keywords
right in Google remember at the bottom
or at the Top If I scroll down I can see
some related LSI keywords at the bottom
so writing Google as well you could see
in the Google search bar that Google
provides some LSI related keywords to
your query so if I go back here and type
in healthy diet recipes I can see here
Google suggesting some other related
keywords healthy diet menu healthy diet
for men healthy diet foods healthy diet
for women so these are all LSI related
keywords that you can use to support
your primary keyword and the content
you're writing about so we've talked
about LSI keywords where to find them so
they're found right here they could be
found at the top of Google and they can
be found at the bottom you can also then
go to core as well and get some ideas
for thep of questions they're being
asked so if you ask a question and use
that as your keyword phrase then again
you have an opportunity of showing up
for a featured snippet in Google just by
doing some additional research within
Google itself or on Coral so according
to Google the autocomplete predictions
are automatically generated by Google's
algorithm without any human intervention
it's based on a number of factors but
the primary factor is how often past
users have searched for term so Google
col
all the keyword queries that somebody
types in and they're suggesting some of
the most popular terms that people have
typed in so if I go back to Google again
if I start to type in recipes I could
see some of the other queries that
somebody else has typed in or some of
the most popular queries related to that
topic so if you enter the keyword
healthy diet Google's going to suggest
multiple keyword suggestions that users
have asked in the past and you could
certainly get the search volume of those
keywords just by looking in Google
itself I could see for healthy diet
recipes billions of pages related to
healthy diet recipes I can also get the
search volume by going into Google's
Keyword Planner so if I type in healthy
diet I'm going to be able to see what my
search volume is for that keyword and in
addition I can see the seasonality of
that particular keyword and in addition
to that Google's going to provide some
other related keywords to my search
query so if I'm looking for healthy diet
Google's going to suggest hey maybe you
should choose healthy food or healthy
eating or how to lose weight so those
are LSI related keywords that Google
provides in the keyword plan which is
built into the Google ads platform
another option for you is Wikipedia so
Wikipedia is a vast platform of content
so we could turn Wikipedia into our own
asset and use it to our own Advantage by
finding relevant keywords in easy
fashion so with Wikipedia we can
identify a list of keywords in The Meta
description itself we could choose
keywords from the P paragraph of
Wikipedia that has many relevant
keywords or we can take a look at
keywords from the Wikipedia content
section so we can also see additional
Pages like the see also section that
gives relevant keywords that you're
looking for we can also look at the
references section as they contain
relevant keywords so we go to Wikipedia
as an example and I type in how healthy
diet into Wikipedia here I can get just
in the first paragraph alone I can see
some additional key wordss that I might
choose to use like micronutrients I
never knew that micronutrients was
related to healthy diet but Wikipedia is
providing some information about what
micronutrients is and maybe I can use
that as a keyword an LSI related keyword
to my content so if I scroll down I can
to see also section so it might give me
some information food information to
Consumers for example dietary guidelines
I can look at categories like dietetics
and diets I can also look at the
references section so I can also see
what information was provided like
health effects of overweight and obesity
I can look at diet and physical activity
so all of these are related to my main
keyword healthy diet so the answers are
right in here on the platform they're
just all over the page so Wikipedia has
an abundance of information you just
need to know where to look so again with
Wikipedia you can look no further than
the first paragraph you can look no
further than the SE alsoa section the
referencing section category section
there's lots of information right on the
page itself to help you get ideas for
keywords so if you Google your keyword
with Wikipedia term in the search query
and get relevant keywords from the title
tags and the Ser so you can also do that
as well so if I type in healthy diet
Wikipedia and search I can also get some
information here as well so people also
search for healthy food advantages or
healthy food habits essay or information
about healthy food all of these are
related to my keyword healthy diet so
again another bit of information for you
to choose or look to choose some
additional keywords for so Reddit it's a
popular Community where people post
content discuss a variety of topics so
that's what Reddit is so with the help
of subreddits an individual can find
relevant keywords with with high search
volume so in Reddit there's an easy way
to find out keywords they have a keyword
tool called keyword it so keyword it
gives the average monthly searches for
particular keyword so if we type a Word
in key Reddit and choose keywords from
the autogenerator list this tool will
extract the keywords and give us those
relevant terms to search volume so if we
go to the keyword it and Show an example
of that for example Le healthy food if I
get keywords I can see what keywords are
relevant and the search volume of that
keyword so if I just type in healthy
food keyworded tool is going to tell me
some relevant keywords and what the
volume is so if you don't have the
Keyword Planner tool in Google ads
available to you this is a good
alternative solution to finding keywords
so it's free you just need to go to
keyword it.com type in your keyword
click get keywords and and what it's
going to do is give you some relevant
keywords related to your primary keyword
with the search volume let's talk about
keyword clustering now so the whole idea
about keyword clustering is to really
take advantage of the keywords that
we're optimizing for to gain higher
ranking so if we can cluster keywords
together in a theme and that theme of
keywords is relevant to a specific page
of a website then we have a better
opportunity to rank so in other words
why do we have to Target just one
keyword when we can Target many so keep
in mind you know LSI keywords we want to
group a bunch of keywords together that
are similar core content so for example
after some keyword research you can
thematically group keywords into a core
topic so for example we can cluster
these group of keywords together like
for example what is SEO how does SEO
work intro to SEO what are the basics of
SEO all of those are related to the
court theme
what is SEO another cluster of keywords
for example could be SEO techniques SEO
best practices tips and tricks website
optimization on page SEO techniques Etc
so those are clusters of keywords okay
that we can group together in themes and
if we group keywords together in themes
we can apply that to a particular
content on our website so the whole idea
behind clustering keywords it's going to
provide more diversity more of an
opportunity for us to be found so that's
the whole idea behind clustering so some
additional steps remember stay up to
date on industry news so brainstorm your
ideas first and identify a list of
keywords like a thema keywords that you
can cluster together and then you could
determine the keywords that your
competitors are already ranking for so
for example if we want to rank for the
keyword SEO best practices for example
we can use a tool called keyword MZ if I
go to keyword the keyword Explorer tool
in MZ and just type in SEO best
practices what it's going to do is it's
going to give me some volume related to
that particular keyword but more
importantly what it's also going to do
is going to show me what pages are
already ranked for that particular
keyword so therefore I can get a sense
of who is already ranking for that
keyword so here I can see mzmz
medium.com alexa.com so I can get a
sense of what web pages are ranked for a
particular keyword or group of keywords
I want to rank for myself so if we look
at tools for keyword research look no
further than Moz that's the Moz is the
tool I would just use but you could also
use Google's Keyword Planner which we
used in the example so for example if I
go back to the Google ads Keyword
Planner if you're in Google ads you
click on tools you click on Keyword
Planner and what Keyword Planner does is
it provides you do for particular
keyword the average monthly search
volume over the past 12 months it
provides you information on seasonality
so if I hover my mouse over a graph I'm
going to be able to see the volume per
month over the last 12 months what the
keyboard planner also does is it
provides me some additional ideas for my
particular keyword and in addition to
that it's going to provide me some sense
of how competitive that keyword is by
telling me whether it's low medium or
high in terms of competition so there's
sem rush there's also other additional
keywords tools out there like word
stream or HRA or the Reddit tool keyword
it and then MZ is is another tool I
particularly use so if I go to Moz again
here I can just type in a keyword that
I'm interested in it's going to give me
the search volume of that keyword it's
going to give me the level of difficulty
so 50 out of 100 so it's halfway between
difficulty and easy and then it's going
to give me some additional metrics like
for example what my expected organic
click-through rate would be if I were to
rank for this keyword but more
importantly what I like about this is we
could see exactly what other sites are
link to this particular keyword we're
interested in so here I can look at the
top 10 list so this is moz's keyword
Explorer tool so that's what this tool
is and it's part of moz.com so there's a
lot of tools at your disposal Al I
particularly use Moz I particularly use
Google's Keyword Planner and those are
the tools I use but there are lots of
tools out there let's go with the
scenario that you have a friend named
Sam and he has a website where he sells
shoes but Sam doesn't understand why his
website's not ranking number one on
Google and so typically to rank number
one on Google there are some factors
involved and those are factors that are
going to help Sam get his website rank
number one on Google so he can sell his
shoes get traffic and convert that
traffic to conversions so there are
factors involved and so what are those
factors well it always starts with
keyword research so in order to rank for
a website where you sell shoes or you
sell products other products like
clothing or food or you're an automobile
website you know you're a mechanic it
doesn't matter whether you're selling to
customers or selling to other businesses
you have to start with the keyword
research and so we're going to go into
really explicit detail on how to conduct
a proper keyword research and then the
second factor involved is high quality
content so in order to rank high on
Google search you need to have high
quality content so we're going to go
over what's involved with creating high
quality content then we're going to take
that content we're going to optimize it
using onpage elements and website level
factors so we're going to take into
account what's involved with your
website and what's involved with
specific pages on your website in order
to rank number one on Google then we're
going to get into the offsite engagement
so when it comes to ranking on Google
you need to optimize your website and
you need to do some elements off your
website you need to be engaging on off
your website meaning on other websites
and so we're going to talk about what's
involved with offside engagement so SEO
being a major channel for most companies
and websites where the opportunity to
drive a lot of traffic is there but you
have to earn that reward the reward is a
lot of traffic but you have to earn the
reward and there's a lot of work
involved and so ideally what we want to
do is follow what we call the 8020 rule
when it comes to search engine
optimization and ranking on Google and
what do we mean by the 8020 rule well
8020 means we're investing 20% of our
effort and 80% of the results are
obtained so we want to invest 20 and get
back 80 that's basically what we Me by
8020 so for example if 20% of our
targeted keywords bring in 80% of the
traffic then that's following the 8020
rule or 20% of our landing pages Drive
80% of the overall traffic that's
following the 8020 rule or 20% of our
backlinks pass 80% of our link juice
that's the 8020 rule meaning these cared
keywords these targeted landing pages
these trying to Target backlinks using
offsite engagement we want to put in 20%
of our effort on those keywords landing
pages and backlinks in return for 80% of
the results so without further Ado let's
get started with the keyword research
let's talk talk about that keyword
research for a website with shoes and
and it doesn't really matter what
particular product you have if you need
to rank number one on Google it all
starts with the keywords as I mentioned
before and so in this example if you
have a website where you sell shoes for
kids you're going to want to be found
for certain keywords so the obvious key
word here would be shoes for kids well
every key word that you target has has
search volume associated with it so that
means when we talk about search volume
we're talking about how many people on
average type in that keyword or related
keyword on google.com or Google search
and there's always an average number of
searches associated with every keyword
and we call that search volume how much
search volume so obviously if we're
going to Target a keyword we want to
have as much volume as possible however
there's always going to be
competition for those keywords meaning
there's always going to be other
websites who want to rank number one on
Google for the same keywords and we call
that competition or difficulty so for
every keyword you're going to have
volume and you're going to have
competition or difficulty and the
difficulty ranges as well depending on
the tool you use and we'll get into that
in a minute but search volume is how
much on average people are typing in
that keyword or close variance of that
keyword and the difficulty is measured
in terms of how many other websites are
trying to rank for the same keyword and
so ideally when it comes to keyword
research we want to find that nice
balance we want high volume and we want
low competition but at the same time we
want to focus on keywords that are
highly relevant to our business so if
we're selling shoes for kids and shoes
for kids is highly relevant has high
volume and low compe I then that's a
keyword we want to Target so we always
want to focus in on those three areas so
there's always a trade off with keywords
so shoes for kids might have high volume
but also might have high competition or
difficulty if we look for another
keyword that's just as relevant for
example shoes for children it may still
have high search volume but the
competition or the difficulty may be
lower and if that's the case then that
may be a better keyword word for us to
Target instead of something highly
competitive like shoes for kids we can
focus on another relevant keyword like
shoes for children with just as much
volume and lower competition and the
reason why we want lower competition is
because we want to be able to rank for
that keyword so the higher the
competition the harder it is for us to
rank number one on Google for that
keyword and so the whole idea Beyond
keyword research is analyzing and
choosing the best keywords so we want to
identify a list of keywords that are
always relevant we want to choose the
keyword that your competitors are
ranking for and we want to use
thirdparty tools to choose keywords to
identify which keywords have low
competition and what keywords have high
search volume so one thing to take into
consideration when you're doing keyword
research is that the longer the keyword
phrase or in other words longtail
keywords or keywords with three keyword
words in the phrase or more you're going
to always have less competition but
there's always a tradeoff with longtail
keywords meaning the longer the keyword
phrase there's going to be less volume
but the tradeoff is less competition and
so what we want to do is we want to
brainstorm some ideas and find those
relevant keywords so let's look at an
example here so if we go to Google ads
so Google ads has a toe called Keyword
Planner and let's just say I have have a
a website where I'm selling dried figs
and if I'm selling dried figs I want
people to buy these dried figs however
in order to attract them I want to be
able to show them that hey we have a a
bunch of recipes and if I show you a
bunch of recipes where you can use dried
figs maybe you'll buy these dried figs
to using these recipes and so we're
going to look for keywords related to
bread recipes because if we can optimize
for our recipes page for bread then that
will attract an audience who wants to
make bread and use dried figs with those
bread recipes so that's the example I'm
going to give here and so if I look at
the Keyword Planner in Google ads if I
just type in bread recipes what Google
is going to do is they're going to give
me an average monthly search fum so I
can see the average monthly search
volume here is 60,500 and so in order to
do keyword research what I would
recommend is keep a spreadsheet and so
the idea behind the spreadsheet is to
document the volume and the competition
you're getting for certain keywords so
if I go into a spreadsheet here my theme
of keywords is bread recipes my keyword
is bread recipes and my volume therefore
is going to be 60,500 however if I go
back into Google's Keyword Planner
Google's telling me the competition is
low so that's great I want high volume I
want low competition but how low is low
so we want to be careful so if we're
going to put in numbers into a
spreadsheet we want to figure out what
that competition really is for the
keyword bread recipes so if I go to
Google and just type in bread recipes
I'm going to be able to see
771 billion results for the keyword
bread recipes now is 771 billion are
real competition maybe maybe not what we
want to do is put in a syntax and we
want to put in the syntax all in title
and then colon space and then our
keyword and the reason why we do that in
search is because we want to be able to
identify the true competitive number or
the true number of websites who are
trying to rank for bread recipes and if
we put in the syntax all entitled colon
and then our keyword bread recipes we'll
be able to see that there are
98,000 results that's a lot lower than
771 billion so that means that 9
198,000 sites or listings have the
keyword bread recipes in the title tag
and the title tag is what shows up in
the search engine results and so if I
look down and scroll down here I can see
bread recipes on every one of these
title tags so title tag is an important
important element to rank number one on
Google and we'll talk about that in a
few minutes but if we understand that
they're
998,199
18,000 in my spreadsheet as the
competitive number and so now I could
see for the keyword breed recipes I have
60,500 and if my competition is $998,000
then my Kei or keyword Effectiveness
index or in other words the ratio of
volume to competition is 6% so that's
nothing more than volume divided by
competition so that tells me that my Kei
or my ratio between volume competition
is 6% so remember we want more volume
than we want competition so anytime you
do a keyword research you're going to
find a number of different relevant
keywords so if I go back into Google's
Keyword Planner if I typed in bread
recipes you could see that Google is
going to give me a number of different
keywords related to bread recipes let's
just say I have another keyword that I
want to think about optimizing for being
ranked on Google for and that's banana
bread recipe very similar keyword as
bread recipes except it's a little
longer tail now if I type in banana
bread recipe in Google's Keyword Planner
now I can see the average monthly search
volume is actually gone up it's
368,000 I can also see the competition
is low so those are good signs so now I
can see 368,000 I'm going to go ahead
and put that in my spreadsheet now I'm
going to go into Google I'm going to put
in my syntax all in title I'm going to
put in banana bread recipe I'm going to
hit enter and now I can see I have
233,000 results with the keyword banana
bread recipe in the title tag so if I
look at the title tags I can see banana
bread recipe banana bread recipe banana
bread recipe on all the listings in the
Google search results so that tells me I
have 233,000 results that I have have to
jump over in order to rank number one on
Google so I'm going to put 233,000 in my
spreadsheet now I can see my Kei or my
volume to competition ratio is 157
158% and so to me that's a lot better
number to work with or in other words
that's a lot better keyword because it's
just as relevant and it has a higher
ratio of volume to competition so
therefore for banana bread recipe is
going to be a better keyword to optimize
for in order to rank number one on
Google so that's the whole idea behind
keyword research you want to brainstorm
ideas there are plenty of tools out
there so the tool I recommend is Google
ads Keyword Planner Google's going to
give you how much search volume they're
going to tell you the competition but
then you're going to go into Google
search you're going to use the syntax
all in title to get a more accurate read
on the actual competitive number and so
to find out how keywords that your
competitors are ranking for you can use
those keyword tools that I mentioned
another tool that I use is M so MZ if
you go to moz.com they have a tool
called keyword Explorer so if we just
type in the keyword for example red
recipes it's going to be able to tell us
how much volume and the difficulty so
you can use other tools at your disposal
figure out the volume and the difficulty
there are plenty of tools out there but
the one thing I would just make sure is
you use everything at your disposal so
you can use social media to find the
most shared article for a particular
topic or keyword like bread recipes you
could check other platforms that have a
lot of shared content like Rin and Kora
where you can ask people about certain
topics using keywords to figure out out
how much competition or volume there
might be you could stay up to date on
industry news to get an idea of what
types of keywords are trending but when
it comes to keywords and keyword
research remember for every web page we
want to be able to pick two keywords we
want a primary and secondary keyword so
when we do keyword research and we enter
all our keywords into our spreadsheet we
want to be able to have a number of
different keywords in this case we're
focusing on the theme bread recipes we
want to have different keywords because
we want to be able to choose a primary
keyword and a secondary keyword because
we want to be able to focus on multiple
keywords for each page because we don't
want to put necessarily all our eggs in
one basket meaning we won't want to put
all our emphasis just on one keyword to
rank four we want multiple keywords to
try and rank four so the primary keyword
can to find the nature of our business
the secondary keyword could be just
highly relevant to our keyword at the
end of the day we want to choose
multiple keywords to try and rank on
Google for that page so for example we
have a Blog and we're using ice cream
recipes and we're blogging about ice
cream recipes we can have a primary
keyword that is about ice cream recipes
or homemade ice cream recipes we're
going to always want to find out what
the volume in the competition is our
secondary key keyword could be built
around other similar keywords like
lowfat ice cream recipes or fat-free ice
cream recipes or lowfat homemade ice
cream recipes those are complimentary
keywords just like our bread recipes and
bnana bread recipe so one thing we want
to do when we do keyword research is we
want to be able to Target one keyword
per content when you can Target many we
want to be able to Target multiple key
wordss not necessarily Target one
keyword and so we want to be able to
Cluster keywords so we don't want to
Target just one we want to Target
multiple keywords per page and when we
talk about clustering if we go back to
our keyword research what we're doing is
we're clustering a bunch of keywords
under the theme bread recipes and so by
looking at the volume looking at the
competition looking at the Kei we can
choose different keywords for our page
and that's what we mean by clustering we
want to Cluster keywords into a Content
theme so why Target only one keyword per
content when we can Target many because
we don't want to put all our eggs in one
basket we don't want to Target just one
keyword we want to Target many and so
that means clustering your keywords into
a theme and choosing multiple keywords
for that particular page and when we do
that we have a better opportunity to
rank high on Google Search and and the
whole idea behind ranking high on Google
Search is we can get the volume so if we
know we're ranked number one on Google
search for bread recipes or banana bread
recipe we know we stand a chance of
getting a majority of the volume
associated with that keyword and if we
can get the volume and get the traffic
then we can get the conversions so let's
move on to high quality content and talk
about the impact content has on your
ability to get your website ranked
number one on Google so let's just say
you have content on your website and the
content is ranking on you know page four
of Google and it's that blog with ice
cream recipes and if it's just content
for the sake of content is not really
informative then it's not necessarily
going to get good engagement in the eyes
of Google you know they want to rank
content that's very inform it's very
fresh it's exciting to read it's
interesting it's going to have good
engagement so if it's a recipe or an
article about any topic if it's the
content is just not informative then
you're not going to get good engagement
and when you don't get good engagement
if people don't stay on the site to
engage in the content and they just
leave the website after landing on the
page causing a bounce then the content
is just going to continue to fall down
the rankings and we want to prevent that
we want to move up the rankings we want
to be number one on Google we don't
necessarily want to fall in the rankings
for our content so content is a key
driver in being able to rank number one
on Google so if the content is on page
nine what can we do well we want to be
able to you know take that content and
do something with it we feel like we did
write engaging content so let's go ahead
and share it on social media and to me
social social media is a good platform
to share your content because on social
media platforms like Facebook for
example you're building a community on
that platform that Community is already
interested in your content so if you're
sharing an ice cream recipe especially
in the summertime and you're engaging
with your community on that platform
then the likelihood of that community on
that platform is going to increase
engagement increased engagement will
send social signals to the search engine
it says hey this content is good quality
likewise for any other platform most
social media platforms have engagement
metrics and those engagement metrics
pass signals is it good is it not good
do we like this content are we giving it
a thumbs up are we going to want to
follow it are we going to want to share
it and so if you share content that you
feels engaging on social platforms then
it's going to be engaging and it's
likely going to cause an increase in
engagement for example a decrease in
balances and once you share that quality
content then the likelihood of it moving
up the rankings even as far as number
one on Google is going to be greater so
you always want to start out writing
good quality content so let's talk about
good quality content because Google does
take content seriously they do take into
account what other people think of that
content so high quality content is an
important factor so how to create good
content that's always the question so
let's talk about some best practices
here remember in the last segment we
talked about keyword research so we want
to perform good keyword research why
because we want to choose keywords
remember we're choosing multiple
keywords per page one keyword could be
related to our brand one keyword could
be related to the content but another
keyword could be related to a user's
intent like recipes if you recall the
example we use with bread recipes maybe
somebody's looking to type in a keyword
that says how do I make you know a bread
or how do I make a specific type of
bread or how do I make banana bread or
what's the best recipe for banana bread
they're question related and we want to
be able to answer those questions so
that's where choosing those right
keywords that's going to respond to a
user's intent so starts with choosing
the right keywords so remember we talked
about a number of different tools when
we talked about keyword research so
there's a research tool that you can use
called phrase. iio and that will help
you do quick research on you know
keywords and Trends and whatnot so if
you know about a research tool that you
use for keyword research then drop us a
comment below I'd be interested in
getting your comments about keyword
research and what research tools are out
there so if you know something better
than phrase. IO drop a comment below and
we'd be interested in getting your
perspective so keyword research is key
but creating content that fulfills
users's requirements so answering those
questions if it's a recipe we want to
answer that question if it's directions
we want to answer that question if they
don't know how to do something we want
to answer that question and that's the
whole idea behind content content is not
just to fill a page it's to really
fulfill users requirements that's when
you get good engagement so if somebody's
typing in something on Google and
they're looking for an answer your
content should answer that question but
we also want to make the content
readable so in other words you know
write for your audience don't impress
anybody with very high vocabulary type
words that somebody doesn't necessarily
know the meaning of don't use jargon
don't use a street language for example
use everyday common language that's just
easily digestible when your audience is
reading and then we want to keep that
content organized and so when we mean
organized we want to use headers and
subheaders you know break your content
into paragraphs keep the flow organized
if we can keep the flow organized then
it's going to be easier for somebody to
read and then it's okay to add resources
especially resources from credible sites
so if you can incorporate those
resources in there then it's just going
to add The credibility to your content
let the audience know that hey I've done
my research on this topic and this is
what this person has to say about it
this person who seems to be credible
okay so it only adds value to your
content so these are all tips to
Remember When creating content and then
the one important tip here is we want to
use white hat techniques and when we say
white hat techniques that means you know
if we've chosen keywords that are going
to answer somebody's question we don't
want to stuff those keywords into the
content we want the content to be
naturally written so when we say op for
white heck techniques that's what we
mean write the content naturally keep it
organized keep it readable include third
party sources and make sure it answers a
question so there are different types of
content so there's content where you
just write words it's all text based you
could also use an infographic
infographic is simply just a graphic
that visualizes exactly what you're
trying to explain for example if we want
want to write an article about how to
write good engaging content we don't
necessarily have to write all that outs
of text we can create an infographic so
for example here's an infographic on 20
effective ways to basically not bore
your readers but write engaging content
so you could see this is an infographic
it's all graphically laid out so
infographics tend to be easier to
understand because they're visual they
easy for the end user to comprehend
because there's generally no jargon it's
usually images that are portraying the
point of what you're trying to get
across and so it tends to break it up
the monotony of just text it's more
visually appealing and it's laid out and
organized so you can see this
infographic has 20 different steps or
rules and they lay those out all here in
this infographic and the great thing I
like about infographics is you could you
could share them on social media
you can re-engage them as a post you
could save them on really any social
platform so infographics tend to tell a
better
story versus say just writing text you
can use video and images so you don't
necessarily have to lay it all out in an
infographic you can certainly insert a
video or an image into your content
especially if it's a blog post if it's a
blog post then sometimes video and
images on its own tell the story you
don't necessarily need text to go ahead
and tell your story a video or an image
as they say tells a thousand words and
so images and videos are great to use in
a blog post so using different forms of
content you know you always want to
review your content when a user dwells
on your web page for a longer time
Google will tend to think okay this
person's engaged so we're going to rank
favorably so if you're using
infographics videos and images then the
chances of somebody being more engaged
are going to increase versus just text
that's not well organized and written
out in a way that somebody doesn't
necessarily understand so be creative in
the types of content you use so longer
engaging content tends to bode well with
search engines so this is according to
HubSpot so the more word count you use
the more words you use the chances of
you ranking higher are going to be
better just take into account best
practices you want to maybe break up the
content with an image organize it make
it engaging use headers so it's not
necessarily just words it's the words
and how those words are written how
they're structured the types of keyword
you're using how you're engaging with
your audience there's a lot of factors
again those best practices we just went
over but the key is you know if you have
longer more engaging content then it's
going to bode better for you on search
engines so couple of steps to create
high quality content so you want to
begin with a comprehensive introduction
so always introduce your content
remember the content should be relevant
to the keyword so if you're choosing
keywords and your keyword research think
about answering that question if
somebody's typing in bread recipes maybe
they're looking for banana bread recipes
how to make the best banana bread or how
to make banana bread using dried figs we
want to be able to align our content
with that keyword naturally you want to
create a title that's worthy that's
click worthy so remember if you're in
Google search and you're doing search
for something simple like bread recipes
we want to some make something that's
going to be you know gauging for
somebody to click on like easy perfect
yeast bread or easy crusty French bread
or something that's going to be engaging
you know the best bread recipes or how
to make the best homemade bread you know
something that's going to draw
somebody's attention to the title of
that blog post so we want to include LSI
keywords so what I mean by LSI keywords
in your content we mean you know
longtail keywords make it natural
headings and subheadings should consist
of keywords and variants so if you're
writing headers and subheaders include
the keyword in there and that way the
the content always stays relevant to the
audience okay shorten your sentences and
paragraphs so don't write long
paragraphs remember we want to break
this up we want to make it easy for the
end user to read and we want to always
put internal links on our blog post why
because if we have internal links then
if we have a link from one blog post to
another blog post or say our blog post
to an internal page on our website we
want to make sure that it's relevant
content that way if somebody's reading
something and you have an internal link
let's just say from a bread recipes page
to a banana bread recipes page then they
may find it interesting click on that
link and go to the banana bread recipes
page so it's keeping somebody engaged on
your website so putting in internal
linking will help keep the the end user
engaged because your offering up links
that's relevant to the content you
always want to break up that content
with images okay we want to use alt tags
meaning we want to pen the image with
text so that way if the image doesn't
load then at least the alt text will
load so we can incorporate call out
boxes and more importantly we want to
update our content regularly so we
always want to get the best recipe out
there if it's banana bread or different
ways to create banana bread or always
just coming up with ways to update the
content so we want to keep our content
our blog post fresh and then we want to
include a CTA call to action if we
include a call to action then that's
going to keep somebody engaged and have
them act on your content so these are
steps to creating high quality content
and so let's look at an example here and
this is a 3month Old Post on BuzzFeed
and it's it's 21 pictures that restore
your faith in humanity so it has a lot
of likes a lot of tweets and that means
it's engaged people are engaged when
reading that and so if we go and look at
it as an example we could see it in on
BuzzFeed here 21 pictures that will
restore your faith in humanity so this
was written back in 2012 again a lot of
Engagement but if we look at it we can
see immediately that it's taking into
account third party sources it's got
some content it's got images it's being
broken up by images we could see there's
call to actions on there in the form of
social so people can go ahead and go
ahead and share it if they like it okay
it includes videos it includes images
third party sources so it's a good post
because listen you know it's engaging
content it's probably answering
somebody's question about humanity and
we could see clearly that look you know
there's a lot of different examples here
from a lot of different sources and we
could take action on this content so not
just video not just images but text as
well and so it's very engaging answers
questions takes into account the
different types of content available so
this is a good post in that regard so
content updated regularly it's engaging
and it includes sources from high
Authority websites some dos and don'ts
on the content so take into account the
best practices I me mentioned about
creating high quality content okay
answer those questions that the end user
wants to hear you know CU that likely is
going to be their search and so you want
to be able to respond to the end user
that's part of creating high quality
content different types of content I.E
in the form of infographics or videos or
text or images you can add images from
public domain sites you can be relatable
and use examples to clarify points just
like the buzz feed article simplify
complex words don't use sophisticated
language talk to your audience as if you
they were standing right in front of you
and use bullet points to exemplify your
examples your points so some dos the
don'ts obviously don't lift content we
don't want to lift content from another
website so that's plagiarism so we want
to have our own unique content we also
don't want to take images from other
websites and so if you you do happen to
find an image that works for your post
and it's on somebody else's website
ideally that's not a good situation but
if you do happen to do that then always
give credit to the website okay so if
you took it from xyz.com credit xyz.com
for the image and even put a link back
but ideally you don't want to take
images from other websites just as much
as you don't want to take copy you don't
want to take images use your own imag
and content but if you don't have
imagery then you can always go to stock
photography there are plenty of websites
out there where you can sign up for a
subscription like uh Adobe stock images
as an example you can sign up for an
account and in some cases you can sign
up for a free account and use stock
imagery okay don't give less information
to your audience give them to your
audience what they deserve which is the
information they're looking for they're
looking for the best banana bread
recipes give them the best banana bread
recipes incorporate your own images
break it up with titles give them a good
quality piece of content that they're
going to be able to engage with and so
if you put long paragraphs in your
content then it's going to be less
engaging so try to avoid those long
paragraphs remember shorten up the
paragraphs keep the language simple add
in images answer those questions use
third party credible sources but write
it in your own words and you should be
on your way to creating good quality
content okay so now that we've talked
about high quality content in order to
get your pages ranked high on Google
search let's turn our attention to
optimizing onpage elements and discuss
some website level factors that are both
going to help you rank high on Google
search so let's just do an overview of
what we're talking about when we talk
about onpage elements and we website
level factors so optimizing on page
elements include a number of different
things but primarily we're going to
focus in on meta tags also known as meta
description tags header tags also known
as title tags and URLs so those are just
some of the on page elements we want to
be able to optimize using relevant
keywords in order to rank high on Google
search we also want to take a look at
some website factors that will affect
our ranking on Google search they
include website architecture having a
secure website having a Sit map and
taking a look at page speed so all of
those are some of the website factors we
need to take into account in order to
rank high in Google search so title tag
and meta description together are
considered metat tags so both play an
important role in ranking high on Google
so so we want to be able to write unique
title and descriptions for each page on
our website when I say unique that means
a title and The Meta description need to
be different for every page on the
website and so if you're not quite sure
what a title tag and a meta description
tag is if you go to search and just type
in any particular search query the title
tag is what's going to show up here and
bold and then the description is going
to show up below it below the URL and
that's going to describe the page so
both of these meta tags are important
because it describes what your page is
all about and that's what Google uses in
the search results pages so we want to
be able to pay attention to the length
of our metatags so if we go back to our
search results Pages met title tags are
generally 60 65 characters metad
description tags are generally 160
characters so anything really longer
than that then what's going to happen is
the meta description tag or the title
tag will get trunc headed and so if we
look here for example we can see all of
the title tags here fit the 65 character
limit but if you run over the character
count on meta description then Google is
going to truncate the copy so you want
to stay within your parameters in order
to avoid getting your content truncated
and so the the other thing when we're
writing title meta description tags we
want to minimize keyword repetition so
if we're optimizing for keyword we don't
want to necessarily just plug that
keyword into the title tag and meta
description multiple times we want to
make sure our title tags and meta
descriptions are naturally written so if
somebody's typing for banana bread
recipe with dried fix you know we want
to have a nice title tag and a this
description that is going to get
somebody to respond uh based on their
need and so we definitely want to avoid
keyword repetition but we want to be
able to use that keyword in the title
tag because if you remember from the
earlier segment when we did the all in
title syntax to find out exactly how
many competitors were using that
particular keyword well we obviously
want to use that keyword in the title
tag because again the title tag is an
important factor when it comes to search
engine results so we want to use the
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or
using it repetitively in our title tag
and our meta description we want the
title tag and The Meta description to
describe the page sound natural but also
be engaging because the point is we want
people to click on our link and go to
our website from search engines so title
tags with numbers tend to result and
higher click the rates this is according
to mods so for example if you just put
in a title tag that says learn digital
marketing well that may work but if you
put a number in there like five easy
ways to learn digital marketing that
might get somebody to click on your link
and go to your website so having
questions in your metatags can also
increase your clickr A for example if
you just put learn the importance of
first page rankings not too bad but they
again generic but if you put it into the
formal question how to rank number one
on Google it's more action oriented it's
going to get somebody to resonate with
the question that they have and that may
be their query how to rank number one on
Google and so these techniques will help
you get higher clicky rates and so
according to back Linko title tag with a
keyword can improve site ranking so
remember we want to include that keyword
in the title tag even though we only
have 65 characters we want to include
that keyword but we want to avoid
stuffing the keyword in there we want to
again make the title tag action oriented
maybe with a number maybe as a question
with the keyword in there once naturally
not easy to do but that's the beauty of
SEO if you can follow these best
practices and write a good title tag
then the chances of you improving in
your search results are going to be
greater so having only one H1 tag in
your post is going to be good so
remember when somebody clicks on a link
so let's say they do find a title tag
engaging and they click on this this
link here and they go to that website
you know you want to start out with
having that particular H1 tag because
the H1 tag especially with a keyword in
it is going to signal to Google hey
we're organizing our page and because
it's an H1 tag it's important we're
structuring the page according to best
practices so having only one AG one tag
in your post is definitely helpful
having multiple tags H tags in your post
help organize the page a lot better so
we want to add that targeted keyword in
that tag and your header tag should be
relevant to the content so if we go back
to our example of the using dried figs
with banana breads well the title says
California fig banana bread and remember
the last segment when we're talking
about high quality content we look no
further than including a video
into our content so not only will this
video help keep the engagement high but
it breaks up the monotony of the page
and it's from a third party source so it
adds credibility to the page so adding a
video based on the last segment of high
quality content definitely helps with
ranking high on Google search so
following hierarchal structure that
means putting those H tags in there H2
tags help break up the content and we
want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on
your different web pages of your site
meaning don't just put the same H1 tag
with the same keyword in it and keeping
it Blas we want to make those H1 tags
exciting to read but also used
appropriately to break up the content so
remember all white hat techniques we
want to avoid hidden text we want to
avoid stuffing keywords we want things
to be natural we don't want things to be
forced and your H1 tag should be 20 to
70 characters don't make long H1 tags so
if you go back to our page example a
short sweet tag here California fig
banana bread it's relevant to the
content it's short sweet it breaks up
the monotony of the content and more
importantly again any content you have
on the page should always answer the
user's intent remember people are using
search to answer questions find
information our content should be able
to answer that for them so according to
John Moher senior Web Master Trends
Analyst at Google header tags would
definitely help Google for rankings and
the search results so we want to use
header tags so when it comes to URLs we
want to use hyphens and avoid
underscores so if we look at this URL
here this uses hyphens fig and banana
bread so it's all broken up with hyphens
that's the best practice practice
remember canonical URLs a canonical URL
signals to Google this is the original
content so we want to use original
content and if you have multiple sources
of content out there on say different
websites we want to use a canonical tag
to signal to Google this is the original
content please Index this content and
not doesn't hurt to use a favon URL
meaning a small icon it helps to break
up the monotony and help your URL stand
out we can add targeted keywords in the
URL so again looking at the URL here I
can see we're using targeted keyword as
part of the URL structure fig and banana
bread and notice the H1 tag is fig
banana bread so it's all consistent and
it flows naturally URLs that are no
longer existing then we want to be able
to set up a redirect for those URLs
meaning a 301 redirect is a server
response for Google that says Hey Google
this page is no longer available but it
we permanently redirected it to this
page which is now available so that's
what a 301 redirect does it helps signal
to Google and all the other search
engines that if the page is no longer
there that's fine you're just going to
go to this page this is the page that's
permanently there now and another thing
we want to do here is if you have mobile
URLs you want to include those in the
sitemap and we're going to hit on that
in just a minute but all urls should be
mobile friendly as well as desktop
friendly meaning take into account this
best practices keep your url short use
hyphens put the keyword in that URL and
make it easy to understand want avoid
capital letters in the URLs the URLs are
case sensitive so go lowercase you
should always go lowercase on the URL
readable URLs again the rule of thumb
here is if you understand what the URL
is then Google's going to understand
what the URL is so the shorter the URL
the easier it is to read the easier it
is to read the better chance you have to
rank high on Google search so according
to backlink to URLs that are shorter
definitely definitely help you rank so
we want to be able to shorten those URLs
keep them short and sweet don't make
them long and unreadable so those are
some on optimized ways or on page
elements that help help you optimize now
we want to look at some website level
factors that will help you optimize and
rank K on Google search so good site
structure provides better crawling for
search engine Bots and what do we mean
by that well we mean having your site
organized in a fashion that Google's
going to be able to find all the pages
so what do we mean by that create a
logical hierarchy structure so if you're
selling shoes you know you're going to
have a homepage break the structure up
into men men's shoes women's shoes
Children's Shoes then under men's shoes
you could have it by brand it could be
Nike Puma Adidas on the women's side it
could be Nike Puma Adidas on the child
side it could be Nike Puma Adidas and so
you want to keep the structure flow in a
hierarchy so we want to balance the
amount of subcategories within each
category so the men's if it has Nike
Puma Adidas the women should have Nike
Puma Adidas and so you want to code your
site navigation and see s or HTML
meaning we want to be able to use
something that Google is going to be
able to index so most sites are built in
HTML and that's what Google likes to
index they like to index something that
they could take back to their servers
and then more importantly build a
comprehensive structure for internal
linking so internal links mean that if
you're on a site you should have natural
links pointing to other pages on your
website so to keep the flow going and we
don't want to have unnatural inbound
links you always want to have natural
internal links to keep the flow of the
user going from one page to the other so
here I could see as an example all the
ingredients in this recipe well this has
an internal link to another page on our
site and this happens to link to page
where somebody can buy the ingredient so
it's a natural internal link so John DH
of crto has claimed that one of the
biggest changes that he can make in
fixing the crto website is is
architecture so for example in Credo
John dhy has increased the organic
sessions by 74% in Pages by per session
by 41% just by changing the site
architecture so you'd be surprised by
changing the site architecture what that
will do to engagement and so let's turn
our attention to secure versus
non-secure so what we mean by that is
securing your site we want to make it
sure that compliant with certain
protocols and so if we go back here we
can see that this particular site is
compliant it is secure https means it
has a secure license meaning the site is
secure so Google likes secure versus
non-secure so non-secure would be HTTP
so we want
https as our protocol and what that
means is just enabling SSL certificates
and that means when you enable an SSL
certificate that means your domain or
your protocol is going to be turn to
https so Google prefers sites that are
secure versus non-secure so if you use
hsts as a protocol that adds an extra
layer of security over the https and
hsts prevents cookie hijacking so adding
multiple layers of security always helps
in my opinion if you have an HTTP
website a non-secure website you should
look in into buying an SSL certificate
getting your sites flipped over to
https because what's going to happen is
your url structure is going to change
when your url structure changes Google's
going to recognize that because they're
going to index your site and when they
index your site they're going to see
those secure URLs and that's going to
work favorably in your favor and help
you rank higher on Google search so
websites using secure or
https have a higher chance of ranking
higher so https is a ranking signal
because Google indexes those pages so
let's also talk about site Maps so
sitemap is one of the most important
ways to improve your website ranking why
well because sitemaps are a way to
organize all your URLs into one file so
we're basically going to prioritize all
our web pages in a sitemap so if you go
to any particular website and you type
in sitemap XML you're likely going to
see all the pages on your website so
usually the site map is located in the
root directory so if I type in
sitemap.xml I'm going to be able to see
all the pages in my root directory and I
can also prioritize them I can also
alert Google as to how often they change
and every page is going to have a date
stamp associated with it so Google can
actually see how often it changes so
remember we want our cont content to be
updated frequently so if content is not
updated frequently or it's not fresh
then Google's going to see that site
that date stamp that last modification D
so we want to be able to make sure our
content's updated frequently we want to
let Google know that we changed it
frequently and we want to be able to
prioritize our Pages let Google know hey
these pages are important to us so all
that can be set up in a sitap we want to
be able to add canonical versions of
URLs in the sit map so we want to able
to add all our original URLs in our sit
map and so we always want to build
Dynamic URLs sitemaps for larger
websites and what do I mean by Dynamic
URLs that means that if I look at this s
map and we're always adding content
let's just say in the form of a Blog
well guess what we want those pages to
be added to the sitemap as they're
published so as we add pages to the blog
or to the site then they should
automatically be added to the sitemap
and so in effect what's going to happen
is we're going to be able to see the
sitemap grow with more URLs when the
sitemap grows with more URLs then that
means then Google's going to index more
pages they're going to index more fresh
pages so they're going to be able to get
those pages that are just published
quicker so that's the whole idea behind
Dynamic sit Maps is we want to be able
to capture all the URLs just as they're
published and we want to be able to
maintain our site maps and so I would
always Rec recommended Dynamic sit map
but you can always create your own sit
map just by going to a tool called XML
sitemap so if I just type in XML
sitemaps into Google search here I can
see XML sitemaps generator and I can be
able if I have a small website just
create a free and simple sitemap on my
own when XML sitemaps creates it or your
platform creates a dynamic site map
either way the site map's going to sit
in the root directory and then what we
want to do in turn is let Google know
where that sitemap is so in search
console we want to be able to submit the
sitemap so you're going to add the
sitemap you're going to let Google know
where it is it should be in the root
directory and it should be called
sitemap.xml and when you do that
Google's going to be able to take those
URLs and index them so we could see we
submitted 528 urls goodle Google index
521 so one thing about URLs here is when
we create a site map we're putting all
your URLs in there we do not add no
index URLs in your sitemap and what that
means is that any URL we don't want
Google to index we're just going to
exclude from the sitemap okay so we want
Google to take all the URLs we want
indexed and put them in the sit map so
according to edgy using sitemaps for SEO
can increase your website visibility and
help you get indexed why because what
you're in effect doing is taking all
your URLs that you want index you're
telling Google how often they're
modified you're telling Google which
ones are important and you're submitting
that to Google and so Google's going to
be able to take all those URLs quicker
index them quicker and when they're
index quicker you can get ranked quicker
and when you get ranked quicker you can
get traffic quicker so that's the whole
idea behind sit Maps so let's turn our
attention to page speed now so one of
the last factors for our website besides
architecture making it secure and adding
site Maps is you want to take a look at
how quick our Pages load here are some
tips in order to optimize page speed
because ideally the quicker a page loads
the more engaged the user is going to be
if it takes a longer time for the page
to load all the elements of that page
then what's going to happen is the user
is going to get impatient maybe leave
the website all together or go to
another page and so we want to be able
to optimize images so any image that's
of large size in terms of megabytes we
want to be able to optimize that
compress the image so that's one way to
speed up page speed we want to use a
simple website design you know HTML with
CSS or cascading stylesheets just a
simple design with simple hierarchy and
website navigation structure so nothing
fancy nothing complex just a simple
website design with optimized images we
want to leverage browser cach in and we
want to upgrade the server response time
meaning all your files are sitting on
the server so when somebody goes to web
page the server is serving up all of
those files the images the text Etc and
so we want the server to respond as
quick as possible so when it comes to
page speed we can look at the factors
affecting page speed in Google analytics
so if I go to Google anal Antics and I
go under behavior and I go under sight
speed and I go to overview I'm going to
be able to see what my average load time
is for my site and ideally we want our
pages to load as quick as possible so
that means anything under 4 seconds
anything 4 seconds or higher and it's
likely the end user is going to leave
the page there's a correlation be
between page load time and bounce rate
and so what Google actually does does it
give you speed suggestions so if we do
have a page that loads slow we can just
go to speed suggestions in Google
analytics when we go to speed
suggestions then Google's going to be
able to tell us hey this particular page
load fast this particular page load slow
and if it loaded slow why is it loading
slow so here we can see the homepage as
example is loading on average of 7
Seconds well if we look here they're
going to give us some suggestions so if
I click on those page speed suggestions
it's going to load a report and a tool
called page speed insights and basically
what it's then going to do after it's
done running is this going to tell me
all the ways in which I can optimize my
pages not only for desktop but also for
mobile so here I can see for desktop or
for mobile I can look at some ways in
which I can optimize it to increase page
speed for example sizing my images
properly server response time reducing
my server response time avoiding
multiple page redirects so there's a lot
of opportunities that we can do to speed
up page load time and all that's found
in page speed insights and all that's
found within Google analytics so
remember optimizing code minimizing
redirects optimizing your images
upgrading your server respons all of
those are factors and so again you can
go into analytics page speed insights
and you could see exactly what Google is
recognizing as what's lowering or
slowing down your page load time so
Google takes sight speed as one of the
most important ranking factors why
because they're going to rank Pages not
only with high quality content that are
relevant to the keyword queries but they
want those pages to have a good user
experience so if somebody clicks on the
page then the user should be able to see
that content fairly quickly and so
that's why it's such an important factor
so the quicker your pages load the
chances of you ranking higher are going
to be better so according to web
performance today Walmart as an example
experienced a decline in conversions so
what they did was looked at their page
speed and when they looked at their page
speed youd be surprised what that did
just increasing it from 1 to 4 seconds
or decreasing it basically increased
conversion so there's always going to be
a correlation between how quick a page
loads and how engaged the user is
because if it's users engaged they're
going to stay on the site and if they
stay on the site then their chances of
converting are going to be higher so
just even one to two seconds increase in
page low low time will make a world of
difference in terms of Engagement and
conversions let's turn our attention to
offsite engagement so previously we
talked about onpage elements and website
factors that affect our rankings for
search results but we also need to turn
our attention away from our website
meaning what we do on our website and
turn our attention what we can do for
our website off our website and onto
other website so that's offsite
engagement and so let's look at an
example so that ice cream recipes blog
so we did everything we possibly could
we updated The Meta tags the title tag
The Meta description we added H1 tags we
made sure the site architecture was
sound we submitted a site map we we made
sure the the page load was good and fast
so we did all the things we were
supposed to do on our web page but we're
still not ranking well what do we need
to do well we need to turn our attention
away from our website into other
websites we call this offsite or
off-page SEO and we need to basically
generate links from high quality sites
back to our site so if we've done
everything we can on our own website and
we're still not ranking where we want to
be well then we need to turn our
attention to other websites and so if we
turn our attention to other websites and
other websites that are relevant other
websites that are of quality other
websites that have high domain Authority
then we're going to see an increase in
rankings so it's just a matter of
getting quality links from quality
websites that are relevant that's what's
going to move the needle on search after
we've taking care of all the on page
elements so more backlinks from high
domain Authority results in higher
rankings SEO is a combination between
what we do on our website meaning
optimizing the page and making sure our
website has good site architecture and
follows the best practices in terms of
site maps and Page load then we need to
turn our attention to the backlinking to
improve our domain Authority so
according to backlinko analysis is
offsite engagement is one of the most
important elements for ranking number
one in Google so you can't just focus
your attention on updating the title tag
and making sure the pages load fast you
have to turn your attention as well to
getting back links from high quality
sites that's offsite engagement and so
gaining links back links from multiple
DS is vital it's vital because they
bring referring traffic to your site
they bring credibility to your site but
more importantly Google's going to
recognize the relationship between these
sites and your website and if these
sites that have back links or links
pointing to your site and if they're of
high quality then we call that passing
link juice so it's going to bring
quality to you in terms of organic sech
so if we look at an example if I do a
search for banana bread recipe they're
241 billion results for banana bread
recipe Why did this particular page from
Simply Recipes rank number one well we
can turn our attention to M and MZ has a
report called link Explorer and so MZ
link Explorer report helps us identify
our own page Authority our own domain
Authority and how many links we have
from other quality websites so if I put
that particular URL into link Explorer
and notice the URL here is short even
though it uses an underscore when it
should use a hyphen it's still rank
number one and why because off page
elements help this page rank number one
why their page Authority out of 100 is
58 their domain Authority out of 100 is
82 and what does that mean well that
means that they have a lot of good links
from other domains of high quality they
have 82 24 linking domains to this one
domain they have 3600 inbound links and
they're ranking for a lot of different
keywords so if we scroll down we're
going to be able to see kind of a
breakout the quality of websites that
are linking to them so they have 19
domains with a domain authority of 91 to
100 linking to them they have 15 domains
between the range of 81 and 90 so what
does that tell me between 15 and 19
that's
34 particular domains that are very high
quality linking to them and so we could
see the breakout of the linking domains
we can see the top file links to the
site and we can see the page Authority
so the link explor report gives us an
overview of what pages are linking to
ours and it also gives us an idea of
what our own page Authority and domain
Authority are because domain Authority
and Page Authority both need to be high
in order for us us to rank on Google
Search and in order for it to get high
we need links from high quality sites so
that's the whole idea behind offside
engagement so some of the offside
engagements are influencer marketing
meaning is there somebody out there on
social who has a huge following but not
only do they have a huge following but
are they relevant to our product for
example usin B who's a famous Sprinter
if we're selling shoes and we're selling
shoes maybe husin Bol can reference us
on Twitter or Facebook that's influencer
marketing getting people to influencing
people to buy our product we can engage
with audiences on multiple social media
platforms like Facebook and Twitter
meaning if we're running a promotion on
those running shoes then we can promote
that on Facebook okay we can promote
that on Twitter we can also bookmark our
web page on popular bookmarking sites
like St upon we can also put our content
on discussion fors like Reddit we can
join High PR quality Q&A sites excuse me
and post answers to questions related to
our business like kora.com so we can
engage in sharing our content and
answering questions so there's lots of
ways to get links to your website if you
have a blog post as an example you can
make sure that maybe that content is is
shared on a similar blog post so if you
have an ice cream recipe blog post well
maybe you can look at a dessert blog
post and share your content on that
particular blog post and have a backlink
pointing from that blog post to yours as
an example and you can reciprocate so
the whole idea of content is sharing the
content but at the same time of sharing
it you're producing backlinks and
backlinks help domain Authority so not
only did it help domain Authority
but they improve the search rankings so
in Google's eyes the higher your domain
Authority higher the page Authority in
Google's eyes that means your page is
important it's credible and we're going
to improve it in the search engine
rankings it increases brand visibility
if we have our content on a highly
engageable website a highly popular
website or a Blog it's not it's going to
lift our brand visibility if we have
usin B who's very famous Sprinter do
some influenc in marketing for us then
that's going to increase our brand
visibility so anytime we can associate
with something that has some influence
or some clout or high domain Authority
then it's only going to increase our
brand awareness and visibility so again
it's going to increase our domain
Authority because of the association of
passing link juice from one domain to
another it's going to then as a result
increase referral traffic because if
we're on a high quality website that
gets a lot of traffic then the chances
of some of that traffic going our site
is going to be great and again it
improves The credibility and Trust of
our website and that's what we want we
want Google to trust us and a way to
build trust is by associating our
website with other websites of high
equal or higher quality so when we talk
about offside engagement we want to do
some guest post on relevant websites so
if you have that ice cream blog go to
another blog like the the dessert blog
and do a guest post so not only that
will that improve your brand awareness
but it'll generate a backlink and maybe
drive some referral traffic you can
participate in forums and blog
discussions like core.com or Reddit get
your content out there start a
discussion about a specific topic to
engage users build brand awareness and
generate that backlink you can always
you know put your your site on a
directory like Yelp for example or Yahoo
directory you could prefer testimonial
link building meaning if you serve
products or offer up a service well
somebody could provide a testimony on
their website or you can just earn
backlinks from relevant authoritative
web pages like we mentioned Kora or
Wikipedia or there's plenty out there so
the idea is to associate yourself with
high quality websites but do it
naturally you don't want to force
anything so if you're selling a specific
service or you're selling a specific
product look for like mining services or
products that complement what you do and
that'll create the natural environment
natural ecosystem that will eventually
give you the benefits that you need to
rank higher in the search results pages
so we don't want to purchase any links
we don't want to cloak content we don't
want to just inject links on sites that
aren't relevant we don't want to just
have sitewide links all over the place
pointing to the same page and we
certainly don't want to be on lowquality
websites directories it's all about
quality not quantity with offside
engagement so having offside engagement
complements what you do on your website
for Onsite together both of those
efforts will get you higher search
engine results thanks Rob with that
