foreign
and welcome back to another video by
simply learn this is anubhub and in this
video on Dom manipulation we will cover
how to use JavaScript to manipulate the
document object model of an HTML page so
let's begin but before that if you want
to become a software developer consider
this Kel-Tec postgraduate program in
full stack web development by simply
learn and master those necessity skills
check out the link in the description
for more details you can also call on
the numbers that are given below to know
more about the program so do check it
out now let's jump to our video
let's start this with a quick overview
of what the Dom is so the Dom is a tree
like structure that represents the
elements on a HTML page each element on
the page is represented as a node in a
Dom tree I'll explain it to you in a
while we'll giving an example also by
manipulating the node in the Dom tree we
can dynamically change the content and
layout of a HTML page to get started
with dom manipulation we first need to
access the Dom tree okay we can do this
by using JavaScript document object
and the document object represents the
entire HTML document and we can use it
to access and manipulate any an event on
the page
now as you know Dom is like a tree for
example it's like one document which is
an HTML then that HTML page is divided
into two parts head and body now inside
the head element there is meta tag then
there is title then comes links and all
okay in the head part then in the next
node if you imagine one tree I'll
explain you just a second
I'll write down and inside here I'll
find any image yeah
so I want to make this image big
okay
so as you can see here there is one
document which is a page in HTML there
is head body and in head there is meta
tag title links we add in that head part
and in body we add H1 H2 which is
heading tags and we also add paragraph
tags and so many other tags okay
now we'll work on the
document object model and we'll start
with adding element to the page
okay
so let's cut this and start working
on
now let's create a boiler code for that
I'll press Ctrl and one shift N1 sorry
and then one Boiler code is
created for us here I'll write Dom
manipulation
okay
and here I'll add one script Dot
okay
inside that script tag I'll give a
source
and I'll give this source as script dot
JS that we just created for us
okay this file
and here I'll write
differ
because it can differ Also let's close
this one and
inside the body
I'll write some text for now to check
whether it's working or not
hello from Simply love
let's save it and have installed this
awesome
live server extension you can also
install it on your system it's very easy
just press here and install and we'll
get installing your system
so after that you can just right click
here and here you will find one option
open with live server just click on that
and one
page will get opened with the title that
we have added and here is
hello from Simply learn so page is
working completely fine
so there are two different functions to
add the elements to our page
so let's open the script page add page
and here we'll write
const
ant body
and here we'll write document
after that
will append it so I'll tell you about
this too so there is one append
and as you can see there are two methods
append and append check I'll tell you
about both of them so first we'll see
about
pen first
here I'll write hello from
simply learn
so this append only takes up the string
elements okay
so and a pen child doesn't take the
string it takes the node well I'll
explain it to you in a while let's save
it and as you can see it's showing hello
from Simply learn but now I'll write
here append child function
and whenever I'll click save there is
nothing here it's because
I'll inspect and tell you more about it
me
open my console first as you can see
it's showing an error that it failed to
execute a pentylon node parameter one is
not the type node so as I have already
told you it doesn't take the app engine
these both append and open child Works
similar very similar but I always use a
pen more Whenever there is a need of a
pen child I'll use that whenever it's a
node and all but
you can also work on append so this is
about how to add the element
okay
now we'll see how to create a element
okay as we got to know how to add that
now we'll see how to create a element
for that we'll write document dot create
element
it will pass the type of element that
you want to
add so there are all the type of HTML
tags that we can add okay
so let's add developer
and we'll write here
we'll save it nothing is going to happen
right
we can't find any element because we
have created our element but we haven't
added
it inside our main page
okay
so
so creating anything in JavaScript is
very different
[Music]
in creating a page right
so let's move forward and append the
depth
okay
now you will see the dev in the body
part okay
and as you can see there
you will find the let's
maximize this page so we can get the
now inside the body
you will find the div but it's empty
right now because we haven't added
anything inside the dev we can add that
surely
so we'll do that
div dot entity text
hello from
simply them
or we can also write
[Music]
subscribe to Simply learn okay you know
I'll save it as you can see there you
will find
there is no
nothing working it's an error not
thinking an issue we'll find that div
because you will
you will find that
div inside this right this is a
Mainframe inside this there is an ID and
all right
so let's now print something on the
screen right
so for that I'm gonna
add
or change this inner text
or we can also write the line and we can
comment this
and we will write Dev Dot
text content
and I will write
like
is
reading
and we'll save it and you will see
this okay this is not working
okay we can start this over again
there is one error here let me check
okay
here we go yeah
so let's just open this one go live
yeah as you can see it's
showing like this video
now
we'll see how to modify the
element
so we can modify the text from by using
so many other functions also we can add
here it like using text content and all
by using this
we can add and modify the text right
as of now we are seeing modify element
text for let's see
I'll open my HTML page and inside the
body I'll take
span
and like a ride
like
another
YouTube
right right it's just a dummy text
so as you can see it's showing
like simply learn YouTube like this
video because of that
this script tag so let's comment it down
for now
okay
and
let's see
it's like simple on YouTube
okay
or you can write hello for making sense
okay
now if I want to give okay we'll
change this from
give some styling to this simple
to modify element text we are seeing it
right
so here we'll write Style
and inside the style I'm going to write
display
and inside the display I'm going to
write
none
and
now let's save this file
and go to script
dot JS and here we'll create one const
div again and give it a document
dot query selector
inside the query selector will give that
a tip okay
now here we'll see two different things
now okay
so let's see the text content and inner
text what the difference in this
modifying element text okay
so we'll write log
and here we will write Dev Dot
text content
the text content is all the text that
present in my body
and
console
DOT log
and here I will give it as inner
text
so let's save it and see what's the
difference it is showing only hello from
which is this one it's not showing me
this one because I have style it to
display none I have told it specifically
to make this simply learn invisible in
our screen so that's why it's doing this
so let's check what's the issue
or what's the difference okay so here
I'll open my console
and it's my console you can see can't
read properties of null
okay
so this is because as we have written
here that we want
spam say hello from that it is showing
on our console page but it's not showing
this simply learn because we have
specifically given the property that we
don't want this to be displayed on the
screen so in that these the difference
between these two inner text and text
content the text content will print all
the text that present here hello from
Simply learn but
this inner text will only print the
hello from
as that you can see on the screen so
this is the main difference between the
text okay
now we will see how to modify HTML
elements or how to add the HTML inside
the script so for that we will remove
and
go back to the basic from where we
started so we'll delete this one also
and we'll
recommend this out okay
so here as let me just read once okay
so as here we are using inner text
we will first give it a strong
to make this one bold
read
and here we will close this strong data
and will
write this
remove this
from inner desktop
okay
let's save it and delete the console and
refresh the speech as you can see
there's nothing
we'll go back here and check
okay and we can do
append the body here
as you can see here let me just
go back to heavier as you can see it's
just showing us all the tags of HTML
that we don't want to see as it is
thinking it's a string so we can modify
this HTML element by using
we we cannot firstly I will tell you we
cannot use the inner content or anything
we'll write here in our HTML and save it
and you will see subscribe to Simply
Learners then now I think you got an
idea how to modify HTML elements so we
can use append in everything like we can
use it in the header part body part
anywhere we can append the elements okay
so now let's move forward and see how to
remove an element
so let me just delete this part here and
go to the HTML and here we'll go back to
that spam
and
first
all right
hello
okay and I'll take another one
and here I'll write
our
okay we'll close this one and I'll give
it ID
so for ID I'll give it ID of
of
small IDs so I'll give it one ABC
and it's
so this is not recommendable to write
IDs like ABC and all because ID is is
very specific so
um I'll tell you about that
example by giving an example so ID is
what if we are using ID we cannot use it
after some time like I cannot change
this ID after going back to some other
place and if I want to write this spam
hello and want to change the ID of that
you cannot do that but in classes we can
do that it's a strictly not changeable
IDs for example in your class you are
assigned with a specific registration
number or a roll number or something we
cannot change it and nobody has the same
number of registration number as you so
this is like like an ID you have a
specific ID and in class if you are in
pursuing Masters in your class there are
50 60 students
so many students say all of the students
have the same class are in the same
class right so data is an example of
class
so here I'll write
x y z okay
we can call we'll call these exam okay
see
we'll open this one
and here I'll create one const Dev and
here I'll write
document
query selector
value selector I'll write the div that
we are creating here
okay
I'll just copy paste this
two times and here I'll write
and
get
and here I'll write
span
XYZ x y
tried XYZ and I'll write ABC because we
have given them different so to call the
ID we're gonna use the method hash and
here I'll write
is a b c
and we'll write here also a hash x y z
until now modify the content and let's
save this one
and we'll use C hello how are you it's
printed on the page
now
now if you want to remove this how are
you from this
so what we can do is
we can remove this element by just
writing span remove and you will see
it will go out and if you inspect it you
will still not find that x y z
right this is the
how this is how you can remove the
element
so we can also remove the element
from the Dom by using remove child
method so for that we'll hear write I
will show you
div Dot
remove child
and here we'll write
okay
that was
XYZ
file coming this down you'll see it's
showing that but let's write here spam
ABC
it's not
working let me check
this remove child is not working but
I'll tell you about this method so this
method will only remove the child
element from that class from this only
the method that we have called will get
removed I'll always use this method only
but you can also use that
this one the remove child or append or
any method that you want you can also
check out the documentation about this
document object model it's very cool
okay so the now the last thing I want to
talk about is
how to modify elements in the styles
now we'll see how to directly modify any
property of an element right
so
so property Wise It's like style
properties are very essential or two way
to access any CSS right
so we can just remove this room this one
and here I'll write span abc
dot Style
and here I'll write
color
okay style Dot color
and let's give it a color as
red
and if we will see the color of hello
which is X Y ABC is now red
we can also give the background color
and
you can also make this color
and change it to
background color
and save it you will see the background
color of this text
is turn greater
and if you want to add any style
property to the Dom you can just write
style dot the property that you want to
add
so that's it for this tutorial on Dom
manipulation by using the document
object and various methods and
properties we can dynamically change the
content and layout of an HTML page I
