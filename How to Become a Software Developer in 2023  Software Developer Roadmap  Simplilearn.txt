moving forward let me ask you a quick
question
who wrote the world's first piece of
software a Ada Lovelace B Tom Kilburn C
Grace Hopper or D Charles Babbage
please let us know your answers in the
comment section below moving forward
let's first understand what software
development is
so the process of producing and
maintaining computer programs is known
as software development the software
development process can involve a wide
range of tasks including the definition
of user requirements the design of
software architecture the Implement of
software components Etc along with that
it involves the testing of software to
ensure it is correct and reliable and
the maintenance of software to fix bugs
and add new features
not only that they have a variety of
positions and responsibilities like
analyzing and optimizing computer system
performance maintaining current programs
creating code for repairing Etc so
as we understood what is software
development now let's have a look what
software developers actually do
so software developer role focuses on
designing solution for Enterprise
organization
they take care of the design and
maintain a software system
they occasionally supervise the work of
computer Technologies programmers and
technicians along with that the visit
with clients to evaluate their needs
assist in development guarantee
usability and provide quality assurance
their work consists of working with
programmers to ensure that their
development and Design Concepts are
effectively converted into code
clients designers engineers and
management are also involved in the
development process
moving ahead we will look into the
skills you need to become a software
developer
so to become a professional software
developer there are some soft skills and
hard skills that you must know
so let's start with some soft skills
first would be communication so in order
to complete their work effectively
developers must efficiently interact
with clients colleagues and supervisors
and staff technicians departments Etc
this includes being able to clearly
explain technical Concepts to the
non-technical people
which makes the process smooth for
clients and developers one number second
there is teamwork so software developers
frequently collaborate in groups to plan
create and build projects
they must effectively work with others
receive constructive governments and
participate in meetings so this is how
teamwork is important in software
development
next up we have is problem solving
so one of the major responsibilities of
a software developer includes resolving
issues discovered by computer
programmers or consumers to ensure that
a software runs properly they must have
excellent problem solving skills time
management is another important skill of
a software developer as a software
developer you will be able to manage
your time effectively in order to meet
deadlines and deliver high quality work
this includes being able to prioritize
tasks estimate the time required to
complete them and manage your workload
effectively at last we have adaptability
so the field of software development is
constantly changing so it is important
to adapt to new technologies and
approaches as they emerge
being open to learning new things and
being able to quickly pick up the new
skills will be crucial for success in
this field so these were some of the
skills necessary for a software
developer now let's move ahead in this
video by knowing some hard skills to
become a software developer so first
would be data structures and algorithms
so a strong understanding of data
structure and algorithm is essential for
software development this includes
knowledge of common data structures such
as arrays linked list graph trees Etc
as well as algorithm for sorting
searching and manipulating data also
next we have Version Control System
as a software projects grow and evolve
it is important to keep track of changes
made to the code base familiarity with
version control system is essential for
software Developers it allows developers
to keep a record of every change made to
their code
this makes it easy to see what has
changed who made the changes and when
they were made so there are many
different version Control Systems
available such as git
Mercurial and subversion each has its
own set of features and capabilities so
it's important for developers to choose
the one that best fits their needs the
next skill is software development
framework so many software development
projects make use of Frameworks which
provide a set of tools and libraries for
building applications knowing one or
more Frameworks such as dot net or
spring can be helpful in software
development next skill owner list is
Ides so in today's world modern Ides are
essential tools for any code so visual
studio code Eclipse Turbo CR few
examples python programmers should use
jupyter notebook whereas C C sharp and C
plus plus programmer should use Visual
Studio code coming to the next skill
which is database and SQL so in many
software projects data is stored in
database knowledge of database design
and querying languages is important for
software developers there are many
different types of database available
including relational databases such as
my Square in Oracle no SQL databases
such as mongodb and Cassandra and in
memory databases such as redis next we
have scripting scripting is an important
skill for a software developer as it
allows them to automate tasks and create
scripts that can be used to automate
tasks or perform actions on a computer
there are many different types of
scripting languages available including
shell scripts python Ruby and JavaScript
each language has its own syntax and
setup built-in functions
and has its best suited to certain type
of tasks
in a nutshell scripting is an important
skill for software developers as it
allows them to automate tasks customize
tools and rapidly prototype ideas moving
on to the steps of becoming a software
developer so the first step would be
learn to code
so learning to code is an important step
in becoming a software developer there
are many programming languages to choose
from and the best one for you will
depend on your goals and interests
you can start by learning a programming
language like python Java C plus plus or
C sharp from a variety of sources to
learn to code you can start by choosing
a programming language and finding
resources to help you get started
this might include online tutorials
books and video courses
Etc
it can also be helpful to practice by
working on small projects and building
up your skills over time once you're
done with the learning to code then you
can start with building projects as you
learn to code it's important to practice
your skills by building projects
you can start by building mini projects
and then move to the broader ones
this will help you apply your knowledge
and gain experience coming to the next
step which is certifications
so certificate programs can help
ambitious software developers break into
the field or progress their careers the
training might help to fill up gaps from
previous degrees and refresh outdated
skills obtaining a certification can be
a valuable asset for software developers
as it can help to demonstrate their
skills and expertise to potential
employers following step is building
portfolio so employers can see your
talents and experience through a
portfolio your portfolio should ideally
highlight a wide range of success and
projects from school internships hobbies
and extracurricular activities some such
tasks includes game or app design
website development and coding
assignments that help demonstrate
various languages such as HTML5
JavaScript and SQL so after building a
portfolio the next step is internships
or entry-level positions so once you
have a solid foundation in computer
science and have a built portfolio of
your work you can start looking for
internships or entry level positions in
the software development field this will
give you the opportunity to gain
hands-on experience and build your
Professional Network so these were some
of the steps to become a software
developer now let's go to the
interesting part which is how much can
you make as a software developer
so the amount that a software developer
can make depends on number of factors
including the level of experience the
industry in which they work and the
location of their job in general
software developers with more experience
and specialized skills can command
higher salaries in the United States the
average salary for a software developer
is around 101 661 dollars per year and
the average salary of a software
developer in India is 7 lakh per year
salaries in other countries may be
higher or lower depending on the local
cost of living and other factors some
companies that are hiring software
developers are VMware JP Morgan
Del Deloitte Etc so this was all about
how to become a software developer in
2023
