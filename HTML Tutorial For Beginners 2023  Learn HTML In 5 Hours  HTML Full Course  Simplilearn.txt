HTML is not useful and will not take you
anywhere in your career but think of a
scenario where you have to create a
website can you create one without
having the structure of a website it's
not possible to create one right HTML
might be regarded as a more traditional
coding language but today it is still
quite important for programmers
professional programmers can benefit
from a basic understanding of HTML but
people in many other professions can
also benefit from it HTML is known as
the core fundamental of web development
so let us walk you through HTML in this
video tutorial hello everyone and
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
I hope you guys are doing well today
we'll be taking you through the basics
of HTML by the end of this tutorial you
guys will be able to understand how to
structure a web page
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple
technology videos so if you are a tech
geek in a container Sun for the latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and press that Bell icon to
never miss any updates from Simply learn
so let's go through the agenda for
today's video we'll start this video
with what is HTML followed by basic HTML
topics like HTML tags attributes and
HTML elements we'll then go through
images tables and lists in HTML once we
finish these basic topics we'll go
through HTML colors backgrounds and
fonts all these HTML elements are used
to make a web page visually appealing to
the user following that we'll go through
HTML form and we'll create a basic login
and sign up form with the help of HTML
form tag next up we'll cover
intermediate topics like how HTML is
used with CSS and JavaScript following
that we'll see what HTML IDs and classes
are and at the end of this tutorial
we'll work on a mini project wherein
will create a job application form with
all what we have learned so I hope you
guys are ready to learn something new so
without any further delay let's get
started website architecture website
architecture basically defines the
design and structure of a website a
website contains two important parts the
front end and the back end the front end
of any website is something the user
came across we can also state it as the
client side of any website whatever the
user of the website sees while going
through any particular website is
considered as front-end
HTML CSS and JavaScript are the three
most popular and mainly used
Technologies which are responsible for
the development of the graphical user
interface
the combination of these three
Technologies is responsible for giving a
smooth and appealing user experience
on the other hand anything the user
doesn't witness while going through the
website but actually exists somewhere in
the website and the server is known as
the backend of a website whenever we
visit a page and send a request for the
content the server goes through the
database and then creates a response
that is sent back to the browser the
browser then interprets the response and
displays the content on this school
several Technologies are used for
backend development few of them are
JavaScript Frameworks like node.js and
next.js python Frameworks like Django
Ruby Frameworks like Ruby on Rails C
plus plus Frameworks like Apache and
many more other Technologies let's move
ahead and we'll now go through what HTML
is
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language
introduced in the year 1993 by Tim
bernersley the same person who invented
the world wide web in the year
1989. the first version of HTML was
written in 1991 but released later in
1993 as HTML 1.0
HTML got many updates with time and the
current ongoing version of HTML is HTML
5.0
HTML is also known as the most basic
building block of the web which is used
to create the structure of any website
with the help of numerous predefined
tags it helps the browser to understand
the structure and style of a document or
file for viewing over the internet
it allows our web pages to host videos
images and other applications it also
facilitates navigation within web pages
or between websites through hypertext
hypertext refers to the links present in
any website to collect different web
pages and create a whole website
HTML has a lot of use cases web
development HTML code is used to design
how a browser displays web page elements
such as text hyperlinks and media files
internet navigation users can easily
navigate and insert links between
related pages and websites as HTML is
heavily used to embed hyperlinks web
documentations HTML makes it possible to
organize and format documents similarly
to Microsoft Word
moving on to the installation part HTML
does not require any special software to
work
if you have notepad installed in your
system that's enough to start using HTML
the best part about HTML is its ease of
use
let's move on to the editors part now
and we'll then download a particular
editor for a complete HTML playlist an
editor or IDE which stands for
integrated development environment is a
software application that comprehends
facilities to a programmer for software
development
just like Photoshop makes it easier to
edit photos in the same way IDE makes it
easier for a programmer to write code
the number of Ides present in the market
today is huge
some of these editors are notepad plus
plus atom and vs code
these editors are free to use on the
other hand editors like Sublime are free
but with some limitations to access all
the features of sublime we have to go
for the premium version for the license
and then we can use it for software
development my personal choice for an
editor is the visual studio code there
is a reason behind using vs code as an
editor let me tell you a few advantages
of vs code over other editors
first of all it is free to use as it is
open source software so we can get it at
no cost it supports multiple programming
languages there's nothing like we need
any web support or work on different
editors for different programming
languages we can use vs code for
different languages as well extensions
are also one of the main reason behind
using vs code suppose we want to use a
programming language it does not support
all we have to do is to add an extension
and we are good to it also does not
affect the editor's speed as it runs as
a different process
besides all these properties one main
key factor behind using vs code is its
availability in different platforms like
it is available for Mac Linux and
windows
so I think there are enough features we
have discussed till now there are many
more features that we'll discuss while
installing and working with vs code
let's start with the installation part
now
the installation process for vs code is
pretty simple just go to Google and
right here
vs code
press enter and the next page which will
open will show us the results click on
the first link over here and we are here
at the website of vs code right now you
can see the download button in front of
your screen you can click on it and you
can download the stable version for your
operating system from here only or you
can go to the other download button
present at the top right corner of your
screen
click on the button over here
so you can see here we have all the
extensions as well these are the top
extensions we have to download them
inside vs code once the downloading part
overs so here you can see the download
Starts Now sit back and relax until the
download finishes once the download
completes open the setup file from your
downloads and it will take us to the
license agreement page now agree over
here click on next and it will take us
to the browser part so here what we have
to do is we have to choose a location
for the vs code file to locate so you
can choose any location so for now I am
clicking on next over here now you can
see we have
a different folder so we can click on
browse and then select it and then click
on next so here we can see we have some
additional features so what we'll do is
we'll create a desktop icon now you can
see Adam
options as well so click on them as well
click on next and now click on install
the installation will start once we are
done with the installation part click on
finish and the vs code will start
automatically fine so here you can see
we have the welcome page over here what
we can do is we can open a folder from
here so if you have any folder so what
we can do is we can open it from here
now what we'll do is we'll create a new
file so here you can see we are in a
file what we have to do is we have to
save this file now so click on file
click on Save and now we can save this
file at any place or any location we can
see so what we are going to do is we are
going to go on desktop we are going to
create a new folder over here we are
going to name it as HTML now inside HTML
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here the name of our file so
we'll write here first then we'll write
here
the extension so what we have to do is
we have to write here first dot HTML and
here you can see we have an HTML file
over here right so you can see we have
four options over here the first one is
for opening a folder or any particular
location so click on open folder now
what we are going to do is we are going
to open HTML over here and you can see
we have the HTML folder open now we have
the file over here as first.html which
we created recently then we have the
search button over here to search
anything or to replace anything
the next button we have over here is for
the source control then after this we
have the debug Button as well and then
we have the extension so these are the
features vs code provides us and below
here we have the accounts option and the
settings option what we can do from here
is we can change the font size and
different settings right
now the next button we are going to
discuss is the extensions button here we
can find many extensions given by the vs
code Studio Community they are free to
use
so for now we'll use these two or three
extensions so what we can do is we'll
click on HTML CSS support so you can see
I have already installed these
extensions over here so then we have
JavaScript and type script nightly and
the live server extension so this
extension is pretty important the live
server one and the HTML CSS
you can leave the JavaScript and type
script knife please for now so we have
to install these two extensions for now
so I have already installed you can
install them in your computer now the
next thing we have to do is
so we can start writing a code here only
I've already told you that while saving
any file make sure that we are saving
that file with the dot HTML extension
so what we have to do here is we have to
put an exclamation mark over here and
press enter and you can see we have the
basic HTML code which we'll need in
almost every program from now on
so we don't have to write this code
every time just press the enter key
after putting an exclamation mark So
this code will come in a screen
now here we have different tags right so
we'll discuss these tags later on while
working on the HTML file so I hope for
now you got the installation part and
what is HTML basically using HTML is so
easy that we can simply start with it if
we have basic computer knowledge we got
you covered if you are a newbie to HTML
please stay connected with us and you
guys will understand HTML in a very fun
and exciting way
before we go through the different tags
present in HTML let's discuss what are
TAG is a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen the list of tags present in HTML
is pretty huge we'll go through some
basic tags in today's video and we'll go
through the remaining tags while working
with them so let's start with the most
basic tag we have in HTML you can see
here we have a basic program written
over here all the tags mentioned over
here are mandatory for all HTML programs
the first thing we have here is the
doctype as HTML you can see it over here
we have written doctype HTML so this is
not an HTML tag but an instruction for
the system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work accordingly
the next tag we have here is the HTML
tag you can see the HTML tag starts from
here and goes till n right we have ended
this HTML tag at the end of our HTML
document
now this tag is necessary for all HTML
documents if you are working on an HTML
document then this tag is what we are
going to need
the HTML tag represents the root and the
end of the whole document
this is a container tag that contains
all the other tags within it so this tag
is pretty mandatory in all HTML
documents now the next tag we have here
is the head you can see the head tag
over here and the ending of this head
tag is present over here we have certain
tags present inside this particular tag
now you can see that this head tag
contains meta tags and the title tag
right you can see the meta tag over here
we have three meta tags and then we have
a title tag as well
Now The Meta tags doesn't appear on the
page itself but only in the pages source
code meta tags are essentially little
content descriptors that help search
engines what a web page is all about
now the next tag we have here is the
title the title tag is used to define
the title of a web page basically we
write the name of our web page inside
this tag for example if we see here the
title of a web page is document form
the title of this HTML document and
right here something like
first document
fine now save the program open it with
live server now you can see it over here
that the window name is changed to first
document there is no change in the web
page itself so what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size of a
vs code and the browser we are going to
keep them side by side here
so that any changes we made in this HTML
document are reflected in the web
browser
other tags we can use inside the head
tag are the style tag the script tag and
the link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to HTML page
we have to provide the source of that
file and then any styling changes we
make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web page
for that so let's create a CSS file
first what we are going to do is we are
going to create another file over here
let's name it as
style dot CSS now this particular file
has dot CSS as extension this will tell
the browser that this particular file is
a CSS file and we are going to use it
for styling purpose
fine so we have this style.css over here
now we are going to link this with our
HTML document for that what we have to
do is we have to write here
link so this is the tag now we have to
write here real and we have to write
here
style sheet fine
now the next thing we have to do is to
provide the source code of this
particular file so for that we are going
to use href href is going to be style
dot CSS now close this link tab now this
Rel tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document
now you can see it over here we have
this Rel as style sheet this means that
this particular file is a style sheet
and we are going to use this for styling
purpose
another important tag we have inside the
head section is the script tab this tag
is used to declare or use any script
within the HTML document basically used
for JavaScript so it's not necessary to
use this stack within the head section
only we can use it anywhere but for now
we are going to use it inside the head
tag the syntax is also easy we have to
write it like
script
SRC now SRC is going to be the file name
so let's add another file over here
we'll write first dot JS so this will
tell the browser that this particular
file is a Javascript file so we are
going to write here inside this now we
are going to write first dot yes now we
have to define the type as well so type
is going to be text and the file is a
Javascript file so we'll write here
JavaScript fine now close this tag and
the script tag will closes automatically
you can see it over here fine
the script tag is close
keep one thing in mind that we have to
close the script tag every time but the
link tag is not necessary to close
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the body tag
the body tag defines the document's body
now you can see it over here if we go
back to HTML page you can see the body
tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc
there can only be one body element in an
HTML document any tag we are going to
use within the body tag is going to
define the structure of a web page
now the next tag we are going to use is
the heading tag there are six different
types of heading tags starting from H1
and goes to H6 H1 refers to the most
important heading and H6 refers to the
least important the font size of H1 is
the largest and the font size of H6 is
the smallest among all so let's use them
all here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1 now inside this H1 we'll write
this is
heading 1. save the program and you can
see it over here we have a heading in a
web page which says this is heading
similarly we have the h2 tag as well so
if we write here H2 and inside this if
we write this is heading
to save the program you can see the
change in the font size you can see the
difference over here the font for H1 is
greater and the font for H2 is a bit
smaller than H1 similarly we have H3
and for H3 we are going to write here
this is
heading 6. 3 fine then we have H4 as
well so we are going to write here H4
and inside this we are going to write
this is heading
4. fine similarly we have H5 and H6 as
well so we are going to mention them
first so we'll write here
this is
heading 5 and finally we have
at six
which is used for heading 6 so we are
going to write here this is heading
fix fine save the program and you can
see the difference in all the headings
over here the size for H1 is the largest
and the size 4 heading 6 is the smallest
we can use any of these headings
according to all
similarly we have the paragraph tag as
well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the web
page the syntax is simple we have to use
the P tag for that so if we write here p
and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing will write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first HTML
document
fine now save this program and you can
see it over here we have some text
present in the web browser right
so these are the most basic HTML tags we
discussed in today's video as we said
the list of tags is large and we'll
discuss them while working with them so
please go through these tags on your own
and let us know if you face any issues
we have already discussed about tags in
the last video we came across several
important tags in the previous video
like the HTML hand and the body tags
a simple definition of tags states that
a tag refers to a special word wrapped
in angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page
after using a tag in an HTML file the
browser decides how to render or display
the content on this screen right
now keeping this definition in mind the
definition of an element in HTML states
that an HTML element is the collection
of a start tag its attributes an antec
and everything in between the tags right
so an HTML element is basically a
collection let's understand this with
the help of an example
what we'll do is we'll right over here
inside the body of this HTML document
we'll write
P fine now this paragraph tag over here
is an example of a tag it has opening
tag and a closing tag so this whole
thing is a tag this paragraph is a tag
over here
now if we add an attribute to this tag
like an ID or a class so what we'll do
for that we'll write here let's say ID
is equals to
Paragon fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tab so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tag
we'll write over here let's say
this is a
paragraph fine so we'll write your
paragraph
so this is the content of a paragraph
tag now we have four different parts
present over here
we have the starting tag over here so
this is the starting text this whole
thing over here is the starting tag
then we have attribute so ID here is the
attribute then we have content of this
tag so this is the content present
inside whole tag and then we have the
end part of a paragraph tag so this
represents the end part
right so the combination of these four
things is known as the HTML element
now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so these two things are pretty
same so let's write something inside
this as well so let's say we are writing
here this is
paragraph two fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is the paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph two so what we have to do is
we have to remove a from here
save it now and now it says this is
paragraph two fine
so I hope you guys got that HTML tags
are not case sensitive
fine now let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss empty elements in HTML
most HTML elements have a start tag and
an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
thing and this is the end part right so
this indicates that this paragraph tag
ends over here
now there is a group of elements that
are exceptions to this rule so these
elements are called empty or void and
only have a start tag since they have no
content present inside
so they must not have an end tag in HTML
example of empty elements are
like the brake tag we have we have image
link and many more such tags the list is
quite long so what we'll do is we'll add
an image using the image tag so image
tag is basically an empty element
so we'll use that particular element and
you guys will understand what empty
elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing text
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
me then we'll write a SRC so SRC over
here is attribute we'll discuss
attributes in upcoming videos so inside
this will provide the path over image so
let's say we have
this image present inside
images folder which is a folder present
in a system so where we are saving all
our HTML programs so the next thing
we'll write here is alt alt stand for
alternate so if the image is not shown
over the browser then the alternate text
will be shown so let's say we are
writing here image one
now we'll close this image tag so that's
all we don't have to close this
particular image tag we don't have to
write here like this
so you can see we don't have to write
here like this anything so if we not
write it away that's fine because image
element is an empty element so let's
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here in the browser so the
image size is quite large what we'll do
is we'll reduce the site so we'll write
here
just for now
we'll discuss all these things in the
upcoming videos so don't worry about it
for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag
so this is done now the last thing we'll
discuss in this video is the nesting of
elements nesting means we can use the
tag or element within another element
for example you can see we have a
paragraph over here so this is a
paragraph which says this is paragraph
two let's add some more things over here
so let's say we are writing over here
tml stands for
hybrid text
cup language
fine
and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph text so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bool so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
B tag now save the program and you can
see HTML is bold in nature now right
similarly what we can do is we can Nest
one more tag inside this bold text so
what we can do is we'll write here I
now we have to
put this HTML inside both these texts
save this program and you can see the
HTML is cursive in nature now so you can
see we have three different texts or we
can say we have two different tags
inside a particular text this is known
as nesting of elements so we can do it
with HTML as well I hope you guys must
have got an idea about what HTML
elements are and how elements are
different from tags in HTML
in the last part we came across HTML
elements we saw the difference between
HTML tags and elements now that we
already have an idea about elements
let's discuss what attributes are let me
write the basic syntax of an HTML
element over here first so what we'll do
is we'll write over here
let's use the paragraph tag so we are
writing over here
this is a
basic example
of elements in HD fine I hope you guys
must have got an idea about what this is
this is actually a basic HTML element we
have nothing else over here just a
simple example of HTML element an
element consists of start tag and ending
tag and the content within the deck
right so this particular thing is an
element
now attributes in HTML refer to the
additional Properties or characteristics
of an element for example if we write
here let's suppose we are writing over
here let's say we are writing over here
ID is
para one fine now save this program and
you can see over here that we have a
paragraph which says this is a basic
example of elements in HTML now we have
this whole element with IDs paraben or
we can give any idea of our choice now
this ID is unique for this particular
element for now you don't have to worry
much about this ID or any other
attribute just focus on what attributes
are we are going through the working of
attributes basically
so we can use the ID of this attribute
to style this particular element so
basically this ID attribute defines what
this HTML element is we have to use the
style tag element or we can say we have
to use the style element for styling
this particular paragraph you will
understand it once we go through the
text so let's do it over here what we'll
do is we'll use the style tag over here
so
we'll write yes type you can see this is
a style element basically it has start
tag it has ending text now we'll write
some content inside this particular text
so let's say we are writing over here
hash
Parable now inside this what we'll do is
we'll Define some styling properties so
let's say we are writing over here
background color is
red and we'll write here
color so this color here refers to the
font color basically so we'll write here
blue now save this program and you can
see the paragraph in a browser is
changed so what we did here is inside
this style element we access this
particular ID so ID is unique for each
element we will discuss it later on so
basically this particular paragraph tag
has an ID named parallel so we are using
that particular ID then we have some CSS
properties so these properties are used
to style a particular element so we have
used it over here you can see it over
here if I zoom out a bit in the browser
you can see the background color of this
whole paragraph is read and the font
color is blue fine what we want to say
here is this idea over here is basically
an attribute it is used to identify or
change a particular element we have many
attributes present in HTML so we'll go
through some of them let's say we are
adding an image over here so let's add
an image and you guys will understand
about HTML attributes here as well so
we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of a image so if we go
back to this particular HTML folder so
here we have a HTML folder you can see
we have a folder here named as images
and we have an image present inside this
particular folder right so what we have
to do is we have to provide this path
inside a HTML file so what we are going
to do here is we are going to get back
to vs school and inside here we'll write
images so this is our folder name and we
have a file name html.png present inside
that particular folder so SRC is the
attribute and this particular thing is
the value of our attribute right now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to write here alt now inside
this alt let's say we are writing HTML
overview now this alt attribute is used
when we add an image only so basically
what happens is when we add an image to
our web browser sometimes what happens
is the image is not shown over the
browser so in that case the alternate
text will be shown so if this particular
image is not shown in the browser then
this particular text will be shown so
let's save this program we'll open a web
browser here side by side as well you
can see that this particular image is
present over here in our web browser the
size of this image is quite large
we can change the size in two different
ways we can either use the ID attribute
here as well and then use that
particular attribute in The Styling tag
or css file to change the size of this
image or we can simply use the height
and width attribute in the image tag
over here so that's the simple one so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
height height is an attribute we have to
define the height in pixels so we have
written over here 300 pixels save the
program and you can see the height of
this image is 300 pixels now same thing
goes for width as well if we write here
width and if we Define the width has 300
pixels as well save the program and you
can see now the height and width of this
particular image is 300 pixels right
so guys this is all about the basics of
attributes in HTML I hope you guys
understood this we'll go through each
attribute while working on those
attributes in the upcoming videos so
don't worry about it if we haven't
covered all the attributes over you
we'll go through them in the upcoming
videos before we move on and discuss the
different formatting tags in HTML let's
understand what formatting is formatting
refers to the process of making the text
present on a web page more appealing to
the user for example let's say we want
to add a heading in our HTML document
and for that we want a specific font
size let's say we want to add a heading
with a bigger font size
for this purpose we have the heading tag
present in HTML which provides us with
six different font sizes with H1 being
the tag with the greatest font size and
H6 with the smallest one we have already
discussed in in the previous videos as
well now we need to make sure which font
size we want and we can use the heading
tent accordingly let's understand this
with the help of an example let's
suppose we are working on a web page
wherein we want a heading so let's say
the heading is what is HTML we want the
font size to be bigger so simply we'll
write here
H1 we have already mentioned it that H1
has the biggest font size of all the six
heading tags right so inside this we'll
write what is
HTML so let's suppose this is the
heading now on saving the program you
can see here on the browser that we have
a heading with larger font size
so what we can do for now is we'll
remove this heading from here now save
it and you can see we have only one
heading as of now we have the heading as
what is HTML we can also write a
paragraph after this heading tag that
will explain what HTML is using the
paragraph there so let's do it over here
as well and you guys will understand it
much better
so here we are going to use the break
element so this is basically an empty
element used in HTML for line break so
what we are going to do is we are going
to put it over here so this is the tag
BR tag or Break Tag we can see now what
we are going to do is we are going to
write here inside the paragraph tag
HTML stands for
let's write it in capitals we'll write
here hyper text
markup
language fine
so here we have paragraph that says HTML
stands for hypertext markup language now
what we want to do is we want to add
another heading to this web page which
will Define the uses of HTML so
basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading text
so we want another heading let's say
over here
now the main heading of our webpage was
what is HTML and we wanted to stand out
among all the headings present in our
webpage that's why we use the H1 tech
for that edit now for the next heading
or for the new heading we'll have a
little bit smaller size than the main
area so what we are going to do is we
are going to use the h2 tag or the H3
tag for that so let's use the H3 tag for
now we'll write over here H3
so basically we are going to write it
after a br text so we are going to use
the BR tag over here or the Break Tag we
can see now we are going to write here
uses of HTML fine now save the program
and you guys can clearly see the
difference in font size of both the
headings let me zoom in a bit here in
the browser so now you guys can say it
much better there's a difference in the
size of heading 1 and heading 3 right so
this difference is what we are talking
about till now there are six different
sizes for a heading tag in HTML we can
use any of these heading tags according
to our need figure out which one of
these six tags is best suitable for your
web page and use that simple and easy
let's move ahead and we'll now discuss
some more formatting tags present in
HTML let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss some more formatting text
present in HTML the next tag we are
going to discuss is the Bold Tech this
tag is used to make the text bold or
stroke
so there are two different tags for the
same task for making the text bold we
can either use the Bold tag or simple B
tag we can say the other tag we can use
is the strong depth the functionality of
both tags is similar so we'll use them
side by side so that you guys can see
the difference or they are basically
same so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here after this BR
tag we are going to write here B so b
stand for voltage now we are going to
write something in here so let's say we
are writing over here HTML
now again after BR tag we are going to
use the
strong tag fine we'll write same thing
here the content will remain the same so
we are going to write HTML over here
now here we used both tags with similar
content present inside the save the
program and you can see we have two
similar outputs here on our web page the
outputs are exactly similar the working
of both the tags is the same right now
let's recall the nesting of elements in
HTML from the previous video we have
said earlier that we can use an element
within another element in HTML we are
going to Nest this bold tag inside of
first paragraph tag it means that we are
going to
Nest this bold tag over here so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
bolt tag
inside the full form or we are going to
put the full form of HTML inside the
Bold tag fine
so save it
and you can see we have hypertext markup
language written over here in the
browser in bold right it looks better
than the previous one
just like the Bold tag we have two more
tags present in HTML to make the text on
screen look more appealing to the user
the italic tag and the underlying tag
now you guys must be thinking that these
three formatting techniques are also
present in Microsoft Word you are right
these three tags are present in both Ms
word and HTML the working is also same
so let's use these tags here once what
we are going to do is we are going to
use this text over here only
so we are going to put this hypertext
markup language inside three different
tags so we are going to put them inside
italic we are going to put them inside
bold and we are going to put them inside
underline as well so we are going to do
this over here
now you can see the nesting of elements
over here if I zoom in a bit on Visual
Studio code you can see we have a
paragraph 10 then we have three tags
present inside it so we have bold Tech
we have italic and underline so this is
called nesting of elements
now save this program and you can see
the text over here we have hypertext
markup language in italics it is
underlined and it is bold in Niche right
the next tag we are going to use is the
delete tag we have two different tags
present for this task as well let's say
we want to put a line through the center
of any text Crossing it out basically
let's say that this text is not relevant
fine so let's go through an example
first what we are going to do is we are
going to use the break tag over here and
now after this braid tag we are going to
use a paragraph tag we are going to
write a paragraph So
let's say we'll write here I would like
to have a cup of
pop off
fine save it and you can see we have
this paragraph or sentence over here on
the browser now what we want is we want
to delete this particular word or we can
say we want to put a line through it
fine so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here
strike
fine we are going to put coffee inside
this Sprite tank because we want this
particular word to cut
and then let's say we are writing over
here D fine so save it now and you can
see it over here it says I would like to
have a cup of coffee has a line over it
and then we have written t so you guys
can understand the meaning of this
sentence by yourself I guess
you can use this tag anywhere according
to our needs we can achieve this same
thing with the help of the delete tag as
well what we have to do is
we have to write here in place of strike
what we are going to do is we are going
to copy this piece of code from here
we are going to paste it here now
instead of strike we are going to write
here delete so d e l this is the tag
and we are going to close this tag as
well now we are going to write coffee
inside it
and save the program and you can see we
have the exact same output with this tag
as well
fine
another tag we have in HTML for
formatting is the market now the mark
tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color for
example
let's say we are writing something over
here
or we can just paste this again and we
are going to remove this part
now we want to Mark the word coffee
let's say so what we are going to do is
we are going to write a mark this is the
tag and inside this tag we are going to
write
coffee let's say fine save the program
and you can see it over here we have
this sentence which says I would like to
have a cup of coffee and coffee is
highlighted over here right
so this is the mark tag and we can use
this tag for formatting
now the last tag we are going to discuss
in today's video is the font tag the
font is an inline element used to change
font sizes font colors and font styles
of the text in our web page this element
has its own attributes so the three
attributes we can use are size color and
face fine size is used to change the
font size of the text we can write
values between 1 and 7 with 1 being the
smallest and 7 being the largest font
exactly opposite to The Heading so you
can learn it that way color refers to
the font color we can simply write the
name of the color or we can use the
hexadecimal values for colors the
hexadecimal numbers are specified
according to the RGB value for each
color
the last thing we have is trees face
refers to the fonts type the default
HTML font is times new room we can use
any font style offer Choice using this
attribute so let's use this tag over
here and you guys will understand it
much better I guess so what we'll do is
we'll write here
let's say we are using a paragraph tag
so we'll write something over here let's
say I prefer
now we are going to use the font tag
over here so this is a tag you can see
it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is five so we'll write
here inside size let's say the size of
this font is cool then we have color so
color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red
and then we have the face so let's say
we want the font style to be
verdana and we'll write
something over here let's say we are
writing this over red fine
now save the program and you can see it
over here it says I prefer red fine so
let's complete this sentence what we are
going to do is we are going to write
something after this font tag as well so
let's say we are writing over here red
over blue save the program and you can
see it over here
that we have this particular sentence
which says I prefer red over so let me
increase the size of vs code so that you
guys can see it clearly so here you can
see we have this paragraph tag then we
have written inside it I prefer and we
have kept this red word inside a
particular element font element
basically this font element has three
different attributes size color and face
now let's change the size of this to 6
for now
and we'll
check the output save the program and
you can see red over here is quite large
in size right it looks different so I
hope you guys got this formatting in
HTML document is mostly done using CSS
but now HTML also allows us to format
our documents using different tags basic
formatting we can say so formatting is
making the web page more appealing using
these particular tags so the list of
format index present in HTML is quite
long we can't discuss all of them here
but if you use any of those tags in the
upcoming videos then surely we'll
discuss them over their own now the task
for you guys is to use these formatting
tags and let us know if you find any
difficulty in using them in HTML a
phrase tag is used to give structural
meaning to a block of text
what does that mean let's try to
understand this with the help of an
example we'll first take a paragraph for
this example a small one maybe so let's
do it here what we'll do is we'll write
here
P so we are going to use the paragraph
10 let's write something over here so
let's say we are writing over here hello
everyone
then I'll write this is
caution and let's suppose we are writing
over here
please subscribe to a
YouTube channel fine
save this and you can see here that we
have the same paragraph here on the
browser
now what we said earlier about the
phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right
so here we have a paragraph and we want
to provide meaning to a block of text
let's say we want to put some emphasis
on the word YouTube over here fine
we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasize tag in HTML
the Syntax for this tag goes like this
so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand now
we have the emphasize tag in HTML the
syntax is pretty simple what we have to
do is we'll write over here
so we are going to make changes inside
this particular paragraph tag only so we
are going to use the emphasis tag over
here
so what we have to do is we have to cut
the word YouTube from here and we have
to paste it here now the syntax is so
simple we have a two word tag so it says
em it stands for emphasis now save the
program and you can see here in the
browser you can see the difference
basically the word YouTube stands out
from the rest of the words present in
the paragraph
to lay some more emphasis on the word
YouTube we can use the title attribute
now title attribute will be used inside
the emphasis tab so let's do it here
once so what we are going to do is we
are going to use the title attribute
over here so let's say the title says
check a
YouTube
Channel fine so let's break it a little
more
so here you can see we have these three
lines
so inside this paragraph tag what we are
doing is
we are using the emphasis tag and inside
that emphasis tab we are using the title
editor fine
on saving the program you can see
nothing changes over here on the browser
to witness the change here we have to
take our mouse cursor over YouTube and
you can see we have a small pop-up here
that contains the value of our title
attribute let me zoom in a bit here so
here you can see on taking the mouse
cursor we have this small pop-up with
the value of a title attribute right
another thing we can do for this task is
we can add a link over here on the word
YouTube we'll discuss it in the upcoming
videos when we'll go through text links
in HTML so you guys will understand it
much better then now you guys may have a
question in your mind that we can do
this exact same thing with formatting
tags as well right yes of course we can
do that but formatting refers to the
process of molding the text for a better
look and feel of the text while face
tags are used to provide meaning to a
block of text
it's not necessary that if a tag falls
under the category of formatting text
then it can't be a free step the
difference lies in the purpose of using
that particular text I hope you guys are
getting it
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the mark deck we have already discussed
this tag in the formatting tags as well
so let's discuss it one more time the
mark tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color so we have
discussed it previously now what we are
going to do is we are going to copy this
piece of code
so we are going to copy the whole
paragraph from here and then we'll paste
it here now instead of using the
emphasis tag we are going to use the
mark tag over here fine
so we are going to change the tag name
from emphasis to mark for the opening
and closing time save it now and you can
see we have another paragraph over here
which is almost the same or which is
exactly the same it says hello everyone
this is caution please subscribe to our
YouTube channel now the thing to notice
here is the word YouTube it is
highlighted in yellow color right so the
title attribute will work same over here
as well if we put a mouse cursor over
the word YouTube you can see we have
this pop-up with the same title value
right
so one thing to notice here is the title
attribute is basically the
differentiator between the formatting
tags and the phrase tags it means that
the tag Remains the Same but the way of
using it defines the purpose
so let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss the abbreviation tag in HTML
the word abbreviation in general terms
refers to the short form of a word
that's it we have the answer here if you
are using any abbreviation for any word
we want the user to know that this
particular word has a special meaning
then we can use the abbreviation
so the syntax goes like this what we
will do is we'll again use the same
paragraph
and we'll
paste it over here again
so what we are going to do is
we are going
to remove this empty space from here so
that you guys will be able to see the
whole code or as much code as possible
so what we are going to do now is we are
going
to use the abbreviation tag fine so
we'll remove this piece of code from
here we have to put this over the word
YouTube so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here abbreviation and
inside there we are going to write y so
this is the short form of YouTube
basically
now save the program and you can see
that we have another paragraph but
there's no difference over here as of
now the word is simple there is it's not
standing out basically right so this is
because while using the abbreviation tab
we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this type so let's
do it here
we have to write here title and we have
to write Here YouTube because YT stands
for YouTube so we are going to write
Here YouTube
now save the program and you can see
here that the abbreviation YT is now
underlined with a dotted line fine this
indicates that the word YT is used as an
abbreviation here and the user will know
that something is different over here on
taking the mouse cursor over it you can
see we have the value of our title
attribute you can see it says YouTube
so this is basically the short form of
YouTube YT over here now the next tag we
are going to discuss is the address tag
this tag is used to display the address
in the web browser the content is
written within the opening and closing
address tag is considered as an address
in HTML so this is the address we
generally use fine not an IP address or
nothing else the general address we use
for our location or for a address
so let's use this tag over here we'll
write here
address and this is the tag now inside
this tag we are going to write
YouTube office let's say
then we have
one two three
street so this is going to be the street
name for our address then we have let's
say sector so let's say the sector is
four five six
and then we have
the place name is Noida and the country
name is India fine
you know
so this is an address and let's save the
program you can see here the difference
in the browser the address tag over here
has a different font this tag is used to
indicate that this particular block of
text is in address so you can see it
over here this is our address now if you
want
see it clearly let me remove these three
paragraphs from it save the program now
and you can see we have address over
here so if you want to write it in
different lines so what we can do is we
can use the break tag over here
and then over here again save the
program and you can see we have the
address over here the font is different
that's the only difference between
address tag and other text
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the short quotation tag this tag is used
to add double quotes within a sentence
the syntax is simple so what we'll do is
we'll write something over here let's
say we are writing over here paragraph
We Are
writing over here let's say again please
subscribe to a
now we want the word YouTube inside
double quotes right so for that we are
going to use the quotation tag this is
the syntax we have to write simple queue
and we have to put the word
YouTube inside it fine then we'll write
here
Channel and we have to put a space over
here save the program and you can see it
says please subscribe to our YouTube
channel with YouTube present inside
double quotes fine
so the last tag we are going to discuss
in today's tutorial is the code tag in
HTML this tag is used to represent
programming code in HTML the text will
look like we have any code from a
programming language for example
we'll write here code this is the tag
now inside there will write let's say we
are using a for Loop in JavaScript so
we'll write here for I is equals to 0
then we have
I less than
3 so let's give some spaces over here
and then we have I
plus plus fine
then after this we have
inside here
console.log and we are going to print hi
fine so if you are new to this language
just ignore it it's just a simple piece
of code from JavaScript so save it now
and you can see we have this code over
here now what we are going to do next is
we are going to use Break Tag over here
first then we'll
understand it fine so we are going to
use the BR tag here again and here
again fine save it now and you can see
the code now
you can see we have the same output on
the browser as the text present in vs
code the font is exactly the same so
this represents a piece of code in HTML
we can use the code tag for that
so Guys these are some of the basic
phase tags we discussed in today's video
as we mentioned earlier that the list is
quite long for all these texts we'll
discuss them in future whenever we use
them I hope you guys got it so that's
all for this video guys see you in the
next one where we'll go through meta
tags in HTML till now we have covered
different types of tags present in HTML
we came across the formatting tags and
the phrase tags present in HTML in the
last part we also covered the
differences between these tags apart
from all the differences these tags have
they are still similar in one aspect
that is these tags are used to change
the appearance of a web page whenever we
use these tags we change the look and
the feel of a web page Now The Meta tag
is a bit different from these tags this
tag does not impact the appearance of a
web page it is used in the head section
of the HTML document and does not
require any closing tag to work
what this tag does is it gives
information about the data we have on
our web page meta refers to metadata
metadata means data about data for
example if we have a website that
provides the user with some data it can
be any kind of data and the user can go
through it to gain some information
but the information about the data
present on our website is given by
metadata only
what does it mean to provide data about
data for example if we go to Google and
search for a keyword now how Google
works is it goes through the keywords
present in any particular website and
then choose the user that particular
website those keywords here refer to
metadata and we have to put them inside
meta tags in HTML the description we get
while searching for a website is also
present inside the meta tag of any HTML
document
basically what we are trying to say is
this tag is used to give essential
information about any particular web
page
meta elements can be used to include
name value pairs describing properties
of HTML documents for example if you
want to put any keyword for a web page
the name attribute inside the meta tag
will contain the keyword and the value
attribute will contain the actual
keyword name
there is no closing tag needed in meta
elements because these elements contain
information within attributes only we
can use multiple meta tags for different
information
so let's start with the programming part
now and you guys will get a better idea
about meta tag in HTML
here we have a simple HTML document
wherein we already have some meta tags
present over here so these tags are
present in any new HTML document we
create in vs code let me show it to you
again let me zoom in a bit in vs code so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a new HTML file over here so
let's create one so let's say we are
writing here the name is
meta.html fine now press the exclamation
key so we have to write it this now
press enter and you can see we have
all the necessary tags present in our
HTML document right
you can see here we have three meta tags
present over here with some attributes
let's discuss these text first
the first meta tag over here you can see
has the keyword or has the attribute as
care set right it says care set and the
value is utf-8 now UTF refers to Unicode
transformation format 8 bit it is the
most common character encoding present
in the whole world wide web that is the
whole internet
so the next meta tag here has the
attribute HTTP equivo or we can say HTTP
equivalent
the value is x u a compatible here
and then we have the content attribute
with value as IE equals to H now this
stack tells the Internet Explorer to
display the content in the highest mode
available
we generally don't need this tag in an
HTML document unless we are working with
bootstrap
now the next meta tag here is used for
the viewport width of the web page you
can see it over here it says name is
equals to viewport and content it
contains width device width and initial
scale is set to 1.0 fine now this gives
the browser instruction on how to
control the dimension and scaling of a
web page the width is equals to device
width part sets the width of the page to
follow the screen width of the device
which may vary depending on the device
size so the next thing we have the
initial scale is equal to 1.0 right it
is used to set the initial zoom level
when the browser first loads the web
page so 1.0 is the default value so
these are some predefined meta tags we
get while creating any HTML document in
vs code now let's discuss some more
thing we can do with a meta tag in HTML
we discussed previously about keywords
present on our web page right so what
we'll do is we'll first write over here
we are going to create a meta tag then
we'll write inside here name is equals
to let's see
keyword
and then we have
the content attribute so it will contain
keywords inside it what we are going to
do is we are going to write some
keywords let's say we are writing over
here HTML CSS
JavaScript and let's write something
else let's write here meta
so these are the keywords over here
now what we did here is we defined some
keywords for a web page now when any
user searches for any of these keywords
and we want Google to show our web page
at the top then we have to include all
the possible keywords that the user can
use to search in Google fine
similarly if we want to give any
description about a web page what we
have to do is we have to write meta over
here so we are going to use another meta
tag over here so
next up we have the name attribute
inside name will write
description
and inside content will give the
description the actual description fine
so we'll write this as a page for
meta tags in HTML and we'll close this
meta
that's it this is the description of a
web page one thing to say here is none
of these meta tags we are using will
affect the physical appearance of the
web page so these meta texts are
basically related to search engine
optimization only
so that's why we are not using them side
by side along with Google Chrome because
we can't see them or we can't witness
them now the next property we'll be
discussing here is the revised property
this property is used to mention the
last revision done on the web page the
syntax goes like this we have to use a
new meta tag for it and then
inside me what we have to do is we have
to write here revised
and then we have to write here
content and then we have to provide the
name so we'll write here simply quote
then we'll write the date over here fine
so we'll write you 14 0 3 2 0 2 2 this
is the date
you guys might have noticed while going
through Google after searching for any
website that last updated is mentioned
there in some cases so this is the
Syntax for doing soup
in case we want to put the name of the
person who made the change then what we
can do is we can write here
meta again so we have to use the meta
Tech again and again for each property
fine so we have to write a name now we
have to mention author and inside
content we have to write the name of
author
so let's say kaushal is the name of
author
now this meta tag over here states that
kaushal is the author of this webpage
who made the changes and worked on it
fine now if you want a web page to
refresh automatically after a particular
time interval we can use meta tag for
this task as well what we can do is we
can write here
after this we can write here meta
now we are not going to use name over
here we are going to use HTTP equip and
then we have to write here refresh
then inside content we have to pass here
value so 3 here in this statement refers
to the time in seconds if we include
this statement in a HTML file then the
page will get refreshed after every
three seconds we can witness this right
now save the program and what we have to
do is we have to open it with live
server we'll click on open it with live
server and you can see here after every
three seconds the page gets refreshed
right so this is how the refresh
property in meta Tech actually works
till now we came across certain types of
tags in HTML we have a good idea of how
and when to use any particular tag while
working with HTML now let's imagine a
situation where we are working on the
front end of any web page which contains
more than a thousand lines of code
we are almost finished with the front
end but suddenly we realize that we made
an error somewhere previously or we want
to change a particular piece of code
let's say in that case we can't go back
checking each line to find that
particular piece of code right that's
why comments can help us and save our
time a comment is common for almost all
programming languages the syntax May
differ in different languages but the
usage Remains the Same
it is a line in programming that does
not affect the output of the program it
stays there in the code but does not
affect the output by any means
in HTML the way of writing a comment is
quite simple we have been working with
text for some time now the Syntax for
comments also remains similar to them
all we have to do is we have to write
here
like we want to add a comment here let's
see so what we have to do is we have to
put an exclamation mark and then we have
to put this now this is the Syntax for
comments in HTML now whatever thing
we'll write inside will be treated as a
comment fine so one thing to notice here
is that there is an exclamation mark at
the start of every comment we use but
not at the end fine
just keep this thing in mind and we are
good to go with comments in HTML let's
save our program
and you can see there is no change in
the browser so for your convenience what
we are going to do is we are going to
add a paragraph over here
so let's say we are writing over here
we are going through comments in HTML
let's save the program and you can see
that particular paragraph in the browser
so the comment won't affect the outcome
of any program by any means fine
another use of comments is they can be
used to hide content now hiding content
means we can temporarily hide any tag
from the HTML document according to our
needs so let's say we have an image over
here and we want to see if the web page
will look good with the image or without
it so let's add an image first what
we'll do is
will right after this paragraph tag
I am let's say the source is
inside images we have html.png this is
the image then we'll write here
alternate alternate will be let's say
HTML
now save the program and you can see the
image over here but it's quite large so
let's fix this first we are going to
write here height and width so we are
using attributes basically
so we'll write your width width is going
to be 250 pixels again save the program
and here you can see we have a image
fine
now to remove this image temporarily
what we have to do is we have to put
this whole image tag inside the command
what we'll do is we'll write over here
the Syntax for comment now this is the
commit what we'll do is we'll copy this
image text we'll cut it from here and
we'll paste it inside
this comment fine
now
save the program
and the image is temporarily removed
from the browser right simple and easy
now a comment can be a single line
comment or a multi-line comment no
change in the Syntax for that anything
we put inside these tags will be taken
as a comment by the browser so what we
are trying to say here is comments are
very useful in programming it's just a
node for the programmer to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program or we can simply say with
comments we can place notifications and
reminders in a HTML code we have been
through the image tag previously if you
guys remember when we came across empty
elements in HTML there we saw the syntax
for image tag in HTML actually the image
tag falls under the category of empty
elements in HTML that's why we saw it
there as well it means that this
particular tag in HTML does not require
any closing tag to work it has
attributes we'll go through them in a
moment before that let me clear this one
thing to you guys
any image we see on a web page is not
inserted into that page instead it is
linked to a web page what the image tag
does it holds a space for the referenced
image you will understand it much better
in a while so let's go through the
syntax of adding an image or attaching
an image we can say to a web page using
the image tag is not at all a task for
the user it's the easiest thing to do in
HTML we can say that so what we'll do is
we'll write here inside the body tag
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a ime so this is the tag and we
already know that this is an empty
element so it does not require any
closing tag
now inside the image tag we have to add
attributes so we'll write here SRC so
let's discuss some important things
before we move ahead you can see over
here that we have used the SRC attribute
inside the image tag this is a necessary
attribute while using the image tag in
HTML voice
this attribute specifies the path to the
image any image we want to attach to our
web page needs to be stored somewhere
either in the system or it can be
anywhere on the internet as well
so let's move back to the main folder so
what we are going to do is we are going
to move back to our main HTML folder so
here we are inside the HTML folder now
what we are going to do is we are going
to make large icons over here
so here we are in the HTML folder you
can see we have all the HTML files over
here right here we have an image named
python so if we double click on it you
can see this is an image and the name of
this image is python right so what we
are going to do is we are going to click
on it right click basically go to
properties and here you can see we have
the name of a file and then we have the
type type here is PNG
PNG means portable Network Graphics it
is basically an extension for images and
pictures so HTML do support other
extensions like jpeg GIS SVG and many
more other extensions so we can use any
of those files with those extensions
now to attach this image to a web page
we need to provide the path to the
system through which the system can
understand that this particular image is
stored in this part of the system or the
drive fine
so the path you can check here is at the
top of this window
click on it and you can see the path
over here so this is the path so this
python file is present inside the C
drive users then we have a name this
folder name as caution based then we
have desktop and HTML fine so this is
the path of a image
let's move back to vs code and we don't
need the whole path as of now because
the current HTML file we are in right
now is present inside the HTML folder so
we don't need to specify the whole path
as of now
all we have to do is we have to write
the file name here inside the SRC
attribute what we'll do is we'll write
here the file name so a file name is
python Dot speed fine so this is a file
name save the program and you can see we
have an image over here on the browser
the size is quite large as of now we'll
see how to manage this thing after some
time
for now let's reduce the size of the
whole webpage what we are going to do is
we are going to reduce the size and you
can see the whole image over here fine
another possibility is we can store all
the images inside a single folder so
here if we go back to HTML folder here
you can see we have a folder named
images Right double click on it and you
can see we have different images present
over here we have three different images
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript we can
use any of these images
so let's get back to vs code again and
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to access any image from that
particular folder fine so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here after this IMG then SRC now inside
SRC we have to write the folder name
first fine so we'll write here images
then we'll use slash and then we'll
write the file name so we have three
different files over here this is the
benefit of using vs code we have all the
three files we can use over here so
let's use css.png as of now close the
image tag save the program and you can
see the image over here so let's do one
thing we are going to use
the BR Tech use it now
save the program and let's use it once
again
so that it will be easy for us to
understand so here we have two different
images the python one and the CSS one so
basically what we have to do is we have
to give the correct path of that
particular image fine
so the next attribute we will discuss is
the alt attribute or we can say the
alternate attribute let's write it over
here first
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a alt press enter and write
something over here let's see we are
writing over here CSS so this alt
attribute we have here provides an
alternate text for an image if the user
for some reason cannot view it so
basically it can happen because of slow
connection and error in the source code
or in the source we can say
or if the user is using a screen reader
so it can be any of these reasons but if
the user is not able to see that picture
then an alternate text will come at
Place fine
so the value of the alt attribute should
always describe the image so that's why
we have written over here CSS so that
the user can understand that this
particular image over here is a CSS
image or it can be basically anything
that describes the image fine
so let's do one thing here what we'll do
is we'll make an error over here in the
SRC attribute let's change the file name
away let's say this is the file name
that's a simple error right nothing
major over you let's save the program
and you can see the image is not here
anymore fine
so I believe you guys might not be able
to see because I have to increase the
size for that
so
you can see here now there is no image
present at this particular part of a web
page because the source is wrong so this
file name is wrong basically instead of
that we have text present over here
which says CSS fine so this is how the
alt attribute works in the image tag for
the end talking about the actual size of
these images over here we can change the
size of these images in two different
ways so let's start with the easier one
first
what we'll do is we'll use the height
and the width attribute just like the
source and Alternate attributes we have
these attributes are also used within
the image tag all we have to do is we
have to write here
right height is let's say 250 pixels and
then we have width as well
so width again is let's say 250 pixels
save the program and you can see the
image height and width is now 250 pixels
we can do the same thing for this file
as so what we'll do is we'll write here
width as let's say 100 pixels and
height as again 100 pixels save the
program and you can see the size of this
image is 100 pixels in width and height
now fine
another way of using these attributes is
to use them within the style tag we can
use this tag anywhere in the program
although this tag is related to CSS and
we can also Define these things in CSS
files but as of now we are not talking
about that concept so we'll stick to
HTML only so what we'll do is we'll
write here to use this style tag what we
have to do is we have to write here
style now what we want to do is we want
to access the image tag so we have to
write a IMG curly braces now we have to
define the properties inside here fine
so what we'll do is we'll Define the
width over here as 500 pixels
and height as well fine
it is again going to be 500 pixels now
one thing to notice here is this image
stack or these properties will be
applied on both the tags because we are
using tag over here fine so we are
changing the properties of a tag so both
the image tag will be affected save the
program and you can see the image size
are now changed both are 500 pixels so
let's do one thing
let's remove it from here and this as
well
now change the size to let's say
200 pixels and 200 pixels save the
program and you can see we have both the
images over here both are 200 pixels in
width and height so this tag is also
working fine
what we summarized from this is we can
use these attributes within the image
tag itself or we can use the style tag
to change the style of the image
so these are some of the basic
attributes we can use within the image
tag in HTML I hope you guys got it try
it by yourself and let us know if you
face any problem
a table is a set of data elements that
allows us to store or represent data
into rows and columns just like we
create tables in normal life for
representing the data the same table we
create in HTML as well a table consists
of rows and columns we can arrange any
kind of data like text images links
other table Etc into rows and Columns of
cells fine the table tag in HTML is used
to create a table so let's do it here
side by side and you guys will get a
better idea of what we are talking about
here so let's create a simple table
first we'll discuss each step here so
what we'll do is we'll write here inside
the body tag
will create a new text so this table tag
this is a table tag whatever data we
want to put in the table will go inside
this table tag only
now save the program and you can see we
are not able to see any table here
so we'll see it in a while now let's add
some data here first we know that a
table consists of rows and columns right
the table row tag defines any Row in
HTML or in a table we can say the Syntax
for it goes like this what we'll do is
we'll write over here inside the table
tag on we'll write PR now this PR
represents table row fine
one thing to notice here is we are
nesting one tag inside another tag the
table tag is responsible for creating a
space for the table the table row tag is
used to add a row to that particular
table
now the next step is to add columns
inside the table each row can contain
one or more than one column the table
data tag is used to add data in columns
so it might sound a bit confusing at the
moment but let's do it over here and you
guys will know how easy it is to add
data in column what we have to do is we
have to write here simply
TD TD stands for table data and we have
to put the data inside this TD tag TD
means table data Tech and this tag
represents a column in a table fine so
let's write it over here
carbon
comma
C1 fine
let's give some space over here as well
then again we are going to use the TD
tag
so we will write a R1 comma foreign
now here we are we have added two
columns inside the first row so let's
check the output now save it and you can
see we have the data over here
this is basically the table data R1
means Row one C1 means column one and
similarly R1 means Row 1 C2 means column
so this is a single row with two
different columns fine
now we are not able to see the structure
of the table right in order to get the
structure of the table we have to
include an attribute inside the table
tag what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the table tag
we have to write here border and inside
board we have to mention the Border
width so which is basically one pixel
right now save the program and you can
see this border attribute will show the
Border all around the table and the
settings fine
we can change the width of this border
by changing the value of Border over
here so for example if we write it 10
pixels and now if we save the program
you can see the Border changing
so this looks nice right so for now
we'll write here one pixel only so this
is the table border moving ahead let's
add another row over here first what
we'll do is we'll use the table row tag
again and the rest HTML will take care
of
we can add a row in a table anywhere in
the HTML keep this thing in mind until
the table row tag is nested inside the
table tag HTML will manage to add the
row in the table fine
what we'll do is we'll write here after
this table rotate we are going to add
another row so we are going to write a
TR
now inside this we have to write some
data or we can say we have to include
some columns so this is going to be the
Row 2
so we are going to write a R2 C1 for
column 1. and then we'll write here TD
again
we'll write here R2 then we have
C
5. now save the program and you can see
we have another row over here which says
R2 and C2 and R1 and C1 obviously
so adding rows and columns seems an easy
task now right I hope you guys got it
moving further we'll now discuss the
table heading type so every time we
arrange some data in the table we need
some reference to that data right let's
say we are creating a bill for a
restaurant what we need in that bill are
the name of the product and the price
fine
thank you
so we need to mention it at the top of
each column to do so we need to use the
table heading tag the Syntax for this
tag is pretty easy what we have to do is
we have to write here after the
first table rotate the Syntax for this
tag is pretty easy what we have to do is
we have to write here before the first
table rooting so we have to write here
only because this is going to be the
heading so it has to be present at the
top of the table before any row and
column we have to add another row over
here now inside this row we have to
mention headings fine so we have to use
the table heading
text so the syntax is this now we have
to write here the first heading so let's
say
first heading is item
and then we have the second heading as
price fine save the program and you can
see we have two headings over here
now let's change the tables data first
and we'll create a bill for some
restaurant let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to add
another column over here in each row so
we are going to add a column let's say
it's
as our number so it's going to be the
serial number
then we have to change the data here
only fine
so we'll remove the data from here
from each row basically so we'll remove
this as well
and we'll remove this as well fine now
this is going to be the first row after
let's save the programmers and you can
see over here we have empty cells
present over here we have three headings
serial number item and price let's work
on the first row now we need another
table data tag so the serial number is
going to be 1 for first row let's say
the item name is t then we have the
price so let's say the price is going to
be
rupees 20 save the program and we have
our first row over here
now for the second row we have to put
the serial number as 2 then we have
coffee or let's say
black coffee then we have to use another
table data tag now we have to mention
the price the price is let's say
34 black coffee
and we are good to go with this as well
we are going to copy this whole row from
here
and to paste it here the CL number is
going to be three the item name is let's
say
cappuccino so we'll write here
cappuccino
and the price is going to be a little
higher than black coffee let's say 64
cappuccino
and then we are going to add another
item over here fine so the serial number
is going to be 4
instead of cappuccino let's try it here
espresso then let's change the price to
90.
save the program and you can see the
table over here it looks nice right
now we have three columns the procedure
is the same and you just saw it right
just like we added the table heading
here in this table similarly we can give
a caption to the table as well like here
we can write the restaurants names or we
can write the bill or anything we want
so that particular caption will be
present at the top of the table so what
we have to do is we have to write here
at the top before this
table rotate before the first row we
have to write here caption caption is
another tag now we have to write here
let's see the restaurant name is
x y z
restaurant save the program and you can
see the caption over here as Xyz
restaurant fine
now the next thing we are going to
discuss in this video is the row span
and the call span attributes suppose we
want to merge two cells and create a
single merging two cells means let's say
we want to merge these two cells find
this one and this one so for that we can
use the column span attribute or the row
span attribute fine
to for example let's suppose we want to
print the grand total of all the items
for that we don't need the serial number
so what we can do is we can merge the
first two columns of this row with the
help of call spec so we are going to
create another row over here
and we are going to merge these two
columns fine in the new rule so what we
have to do here is
we have to write here
after this row we are going to add
another row so for that we have to write
here table row tag and now inside the
stable rotor we have to mention the
table data Tab and then we'll write a
call spend call spend is going to be 2
because we want too much
two cents fine now what we'll do is
we'll write here
grand total and we are going to add
another cell so we are going to write a
TD again
so let's add it and the total price is I
guess
200 so we'll write here 200 save the
program and you can see
we have two columns merged over here
fine
similarly we can also use the rowspan
attribute whenever we want to merge two
rows one thing to keep in mind is we can
use these attributes within the table
data tag only not in any other type for
example
if we want to merge two rows fine so
what we can do is we can write here
Rose pen and we are going to write it to
save the program and you can see these
two rows are now merged fine
so let's remove it for now and save the
program again so this table looks nice
now
the next attribute we have in tables is
the background color attribute we can
use this attribute to change the
background color of the whole table or
of any particular row or column fine we
just have to use the BG color attribute
as per our requirement for example if we
want to change the background color of
the first row which contains all the
headings what we have to do is we have
to write here inside this first table
row tag we have to write here
BG color and this is an attribute now
let's say we want to color it as red
fine save the program and you can see
the the whole row is red in color now
fine similarly we can change the Border
color of the whole table with the help
of Border color attribute we have to
write here inside the table tab
so this is the main tag and we have to
write here
border color is equals to
let's say
yellow fine save the program and you can
see the border is now yellow in color
one thing I want to tell here is we can
change the background color of any
particular cell fine so let's say we
want to change the background color of
espresso fine let's do it let's change
this background color to
Brown fine so here we have espresso
inside this table data Tech what we have
to do is we have to write here BG color
and we have to mention here Brown save
the program and you can see it's brown
in color
fine
so guys this is basically how we can
create and add data in a table in HTML I
hope you guys got what we went through
in today's video try doing it by
yourself and let us know if you have any
confusion lists are used to group
related pieces of information so that
they are evidently associated with each
other and easy to read of course it
makes a web page easier to read for the
user right there are three different
types of lists present in HTML the
ordered list unordered list and the
definition list we'll discuss each of
these lists in Reading
so now that we have a basic idea of what
lists are let's move on to the
programming part directly
the ordered list is the first list we
have in HTML it uses different schemes
of numbers to list our items the ol tag
is used to create an ordered list in
HTML so unordered list uses numbers or
some sort of notation that indicates a
series of items
an ordered list can start with numbers
like 1 and continue through two three
four and so on it can also start with
alphabets like a b and continues through
C D and so on Roman numerals can also be
used in ordered lists
so let's create one list over here first
and you guys will get a better
understanding of the ordered list in
HTML the syntax goes like this well
right here inside the body tag
we'll write ol stands for ordered list
to add items to a list we have to use
the Lite
Li stands for list item so this is the
Ally tag anything will write inside this
particular Ally tag will be added as a
list item to that particular list fine
we have to put each list item inside
this particular tag in order to add it
to the list so let's add something to
this list first what we'll do is we'll
write inside here let's say fine
then we'll add another item over here so
let's say we have
mango
let's add some more items and
we have banana and lastly let's say we
have
footage fine so we have four fruits here
we we are including them in a list now
save the program and you can see here we
have a list present over here in the
browser this list over here has numbers
right it has one two three and four we
can change them to alphabets or Roman
numerals for that we have to use the
type attribute within the ol tag so what
we have to do is we have to go here and
we have to write here
type press enter and if you are using vs
code you can see the types of order list
we can write here one we can write a
capital a capital A is used for
uppercase letters we can write a small
link for lowercase writers we can write
here capital I for uppercase numerals
then we can write a small line for lower
case number so let's write here small I
first and you can see the list is
changed there are lowercase numerals now
which starts from one two three and four
we can use here capital I as well for
uppercase numerals similarly we can use
capital A for uppercase alphabets and
small a for
lowercase alphabets you guys can see it
here right
we can also specify the starting point
in an ordered list and for that we have
to use the start attribute we don't have
to do much we have to write here
start and we have to write here any
number let's say we are using lowercase
alphabets right so if we write here
5 now the fifth alphabet is e the list
will start with E now save the program
and you can see the list starts with e f
g and H right
one thing to keep in mind while using
the start attribute is this attribute
works with numeric values only
so I hope you guys must have got an idea
about the ordered list in HTML moving
ahead let's discuss the unordered list
now an unordered list typically is a
bulleted list of items it is basically a
collection of related items with no
special order or SQL fine so let's
create one unordered list here as well
the UL Tech creates an unordered list in
HTML we'll write here UL stands for
unordered list and now we have to
include list items fine the LI tag will
be used for that we have to write a li
let's add some items over here so let's
write the name of some vegetables now so
let's say we are writing over your
potato then we have
let's say carrot
and then we have
let's say cabbage
these all are vegetable names so let's
say we are adding one more here let's
say it is
ready fine
that's it save the program and you can
see we have another list over here this
type of list in HTML is known as
unordered list you can see these bullets
over here in front of each list item
right
we can change the type here as well with
the help of type attribute
for an unordered list the type attribute
can have three different types Square
Circle or disk the default one we have
here in this particular list is the disk
so if we write here
inside the UL tag type
and if we specify here the type as let's
say
Circle save the program and you can see
it over here
we have circles over here now right
similarly we can use squares as well so
if we write here
Square save the program and you can see
it change to square
so the last type of list we are left
with is the definition list in HTML a
description list or a definition list is
a list of terms with a description of
each term in a definition list entries
are listed like a dictionary or
encyclopedia
if it sounds a bit confusing then let's
create one here and you guys will
understand
so the DL tag is used to define a
definition list in HTML the list item
tag is not used within the definition
list instead we use two different tags
the DT tag is used for the term and the
DB tag is used for the definition fine
for example if we create one list over
here so firstly what we have to do is we
have to define the list so for that we
have the DL tag for definition list now
inside here we have to mention the term
so let's say the first term we have is
HTML and for the definition of HTML we
have to use the D reader fine so let's
say HTML stands for
hyper text
markup
language fine
okay let's add another item over here so
let's say the second term we have is CSS
okay CSS will write over here then we'll
write
inside the definition let's say
CSS stands for cascading
file sheet fine save the program and you
can see here we have another list
present in the browser which defines the
terms HTML and CSV we can add as many
items as we want in these type of lists
we can add
more than one or we can just add one
item it totally depends on us so I hope
you guys must have understood what lists
are in HTML by now try it by yourself
and let us know what you learned
before discussing text links in HTML
let's understand what a link is any
website we go through in today's world
must continually a link in HTML is an
object that allows us to a new location
when we click on it it provides a simple
way of navigation between different
pages present on the web
these links in HTML are known as
hyperlinks and hyperlinks allows us to
navigate between websites by clicking on
Words emails and images thus we can
create hyperlinks using text or images
available on a web page
so let's go through an example of what
links are and how they make it easier
for the user to navigate within web
pages
here we have a sample web page we
created it when we went through jQuery
on this website you can see we have
words present over here like home about
categories top rated and contact fine if
we click on any of these words
it takes us to that particular section
of the web page what actually happens is
when we mention these words on the HTML
file we provided them with specific
links so that it will be easier for the
viewer to get to any particular part of
the website without much hassle I hope
you guys now have got an idea of what
links are
let's see how these links are added to a
web page now in this particular video
we'll go through text links in HTML
we'll cover image links and email links
in the upcoming videos so don't worry
about them now in HTML the anchor tag is
used to specify a link
anything present between the opening and
closing anchor tag becomes the part of a
link
and we can click that part to reach to
the linked web page or document so the
Syntax for the anchor tag goes like this
inside the body tag we have to write
here e so this is our anchor tank and
anything goes in between there will be
considered as a part of the link fine
now the next thing we'll do is we'll add
the link to a website here to specify a
link in HTML the href attribute is used
this attribute specifies the URL of the
web page or website or document the link
Google href is basically a attribute
fine so what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the anchor tag we have
to mention the href attribute and now we
have to write the URL of website over
here fine so let's say the URL of a
website is www dot
google.com fine and the text will be
let's say Google fine
now save the program and you can see
here we have Google written over here on
the web page in blue color it is purple
for now you will get to know about it
later on in this video only
so the URL we mentioned over here inside
the anchor tag will take us to the home
page of Google search engine
click on it and you can see here we are
on Google's home page right so moving
ahead let's discuss the two different
types of URLs we have in HTML the two
types of URLs are absolute URL and
relative URL
the URL will be used here in this
example which navigates the user to
Google's home page is an example of an
absolute URL basically when a full web
address is mentioned in the href
attribute it refers to an absolute URL
on the other hand the relative URL
refers to a local link a link to a page
within the same website or without the
https and www part fine the syntax for
this is also a bit different so let's go
through it what we'll do is we'll first
create another web page for this so
let's create one here
we have to name it so let's say we are
writing over here about dot HTML
oh let's write some code over here
let's say we are writing over here this
is the about section of our website so
we'll write here H2
and about us
and let's write a paragraph here as well
we'll write here welcome
YouTube
chairman fine so we are done with it
let's save this and let's open it with
live server one and you can see it's
working totally fine this is let's say
the about a section of a website now
what we'll do is we'll move back to our
original file so we have this original
file over here and we'll create a link
over here fine basically what we are
doing is we are linking these two HTML
files fine now in here what we'll do is
we'll create another link which will
redirect us to that about us page so for
that we have to write a href
and we have to close the anchor tag fine
so in here we have to write the file
name so we will write here
about dot HTML and we'll write here
about us fine
save the program now and you can see we
have the word about us present over here
click on it and it will take us to the
about a section of our website or to the
about us page of our website you can see
it over here
now the reference to adding a local page
is the same as attaching an image to a
web page we can provide the path of that
particular page inside the href
attribute moving ahead let's discuss the
target attribute in Anchor tag whenever
we click on a link it opens a web page
in the same window by replacing the
current web page this happens by default
in HTML fine we can change this to
either within the same window or in a
new window the target attribute can have
four different values
the four values can be self blank parent
and top so self is used to open the
related document within the same window
for example we use this particular
attribute over here inside this anchor
tag we'll write it Target then we'll
write here underscore cell fine save
this program and we'll refresh this page
once again
one thing to keep in mind is we have to
write the value like this only with the
underscore present before the value fine
now save the program and now if we click
on the link over here the about us link
the new document will be opened in the
same window only this is the default
value as well in any web page so if we
want to change the document to open in a
new window we have to write here
instead of cell so let's do it for this
link now what we'll do is we'll write
Target over here Target will be set to
blank with an underscore save the
program
move back to the web page and
click on Google away you can see this
link is opening in a new window now fine
similarly we have the top and parent
values as the parent value opens the
document in the parent frame and the top
will open it in full body of the window
we'll discuss them later when we go
through HTML frames in the upcoming
videos
one more thing we can do with links is
to change the color of a link for that
we have three different attributes a
link wheeling and Link
a link refers to an active link We link
on the other hand refers to a visited
Link and Link refers to the color of the
normal link we can mention these three
attributes inside the body tag only if
we want to make similar changes to all
the links present on the website if you
want to do it for one single link what
we have to do is we have to mention
these three attributes inside the anchor
tag of that particular link only
fine
the syntax goes like this for now we'll
mention them inside the body tag so
we'll write here
link link is going to be yellow in color
then we have a link so a link is going
to be let's say
Brown and then we have
Wheeling fine so we link is going to be
let's say green fine save the program
and you can see Google and about us are
now green in color because they are
already visited links so what we'll do
is
we'll add another link over here we'll
write a
href so let's use any
HTML file from here so let's use the
meta.html so we'll write here meta dot
HTML
Target will set to let's say
blank fine we are going to open it in a
new window so let's say we are writing
over here meta save the program and you
can see Meta over here which is also in
green color because these all these
three links are visited click on it and
you can see the color changing to Brown
fine because it states that these links
are active as well fine
now let's talk about the default color
of an HTML link as well so an unvisited
Link in HTML is underlined and blue in
color a visited link is underlined and
purple in color that's why this
particular Link at this start was in
purple color and active link is
underlined and red in color so this is
the task for you guys you have to use
these attributes to change the color of
a link present on a web page so I hope
you guys must have got an idea by now
about the anchor tag in HTML try doing
it by yourself and let us know what you
learned now that we know enough about
links in HTML and we saw previously how
to use it with a specific word or
phrases in HTML we'll do the same thing
but this time we are going to do it with
images on
now a link in HTML is an object that
allows us to a new location when we
click on it it provides a simple way of
navigation between different pages
present on the web just a quick revision
of what links are in HTML so we already
know how to attach an image to a web
page in HTML the image tag is used for
it now to add a link within an image we
have to Nest one tag inside the other
it's not as hard as it sounds so let's
do it here and you will understand it
much better
we'll use the image tag within the
anchor tag first of all we'll write here
inside the body tag of HTML document
we'll write a then this is the anchor
tag we have to write here href href is
an attribute we came across this in the
previous video
so now what we'll do is we'll write
inside here the reference to a web page
so we'll let's say right here https
then we have to write here this
let's say we are writing here www dot
google.com fine
now the anchor tag is ready let's recall
what we did with text in the last part
we simply wrote the text between the
anchor tag and the browser treated that
text as a link fine
now what we have to do is to add an
image in place of that text so we'll
simply Nest the image tag here what
we'll do is we'll write here
inside the anchor tag inside the body of
anchor tag basically so we will write
here image
so this is our Tech now we have to add
an image over here fine so let's say we
are writing over here SRC now we have
this image present inside the images
folder so let's use one image from this
and we have to write here
alt alt is going to be
HTML for this
that's it we have used the image over
here save the program and you can see we
have an image over here on the browser
the size is quite large right so let's
fix it first so what we'll do is we'll
use the height and the width attribute
within the image tag so we will write
here height height is going to be 200
pixel then we have the width as well
width is again going to be 200 pixel
save the program and here you can see
the image size is fine now
if we click anywhere on the image then
the home page of chrome will open
because the image is attached to that
link only we have written over here
www.google.com fine so it will take us
to the home page of Google search engine
click on the image and you can see it
takes us to the home page of Google
so attaching a link to an image is
surely one of the easiest tasks to
perform in HTML we have used an absolute
URL over here in this particular image
we can also use a relative reference the
syntax will remain the same so let's do
that as well what we'll do is
we'll write over here inside the body
tag again
we'll use another image so let's use the
brake tag over here
then we'll write here a href href is
going to be a relative reference so
let's say we have this about dot HTML
file in a system so let's use it for now
so we'll write here about dot HTML
then we'll Nest the image tag inside
here so we'll write here IMG
now we have to close this tag we'll
write here SRC SRC is going to be inside
the images folder again we are going to
use css.png
we'll write here alt alt is going to be
CSS then we have
height height is going to be 200 pixel
and width width is again going to be 200
the same thing we did with this image as
well save the program and you can see we
have another image over here which is
css3 and we have used a relative
reference or we can say a relative URL
over here for this image so this image
will take us to about.html we can do
many such tasks using images in HTML so
let's click on the image first you can
see the image over here click on it and
you can see we are in about us page
right it says Welcome to our YouTube
channel so this is how we can use images
within anchor tag in HTML the attributes
for both the tags Remains the Same we
can still use the target attribute
within the anchor tag for the new web
page to open either in the same window
or in a new one
so I hope you guys must have understood
by now adding an image and attaching a
link to it is quite easy I want you guys
to give it a try and learn something new
out of it in general term a frame refers
to a support structure we go through
this word in our daily life a frame can
be a piece of furniture it can be the
frame of a building or a car or it can
be anything that gives it its shape
basically
before iframes were introduced there was
a concept of frames in HTML let's
discuss it a bit
HTML frames were used to divide a
browser's window into multiple sections
where each section is capable of loading
a separate HTML document
a collection of frames present on a web
page refers to a frame set there were
certain disadvantages of using frames in
HTML like
smaller devices cannot cope up with
frames often because the screen is not
big enough to be divided a page may be
displayed differently on different
computers due to different screen
resolutions the concept of frames was
pretty similar to tables in HTML where
we can divide a window into rows and
columns and each frame will be able to
load separate HTML document
with the introduction of HTML5 the
concept of frames was removed from HTML
so if we try to use frames in 2022 we
can't do that the replacement of frames
was also introduced with the name
iframes
iframe stands for an inline frame it is
used to embed another document within
the current HTML document the basic use
of this tag is to embed media files like
videos on a web page we can display a
secondary webpage on a main page by
using this tag
so let's go through the syntax of
iframes now and you guys will get a
better idea the most basic attribute
used in iframe is the src8
this attribute is used to provide the
file name or the website name we want to
embed in a HTML document the syntax goes
like this the tag we have is iframe so
we will write a iframe now this is a
element
and inside there we have to write the
SRC attribute now inside the SRC
attribute we can either provide the
website name or the HTML file for now
we'll use the file so we have a file
named
embit DOT htu fine
so let me quickly show you the
embed.html over here so this is a file
this is just a basic HTML file with an
image with address tag then we have a
paragraph and then we have the code tag
fine so let's open it with live server
once and you can see we have this HTML
file we have a basic image with some
text present over here now we want to
embed this HTML document with our main
HTML document so let's move back to our
main document first so this is our main
document now we have already added this
file name this embed.html inside the SRC
attribute now save the program and you
can see here we have a small window on
the browser where the embedded document
is opened we can scroll down to check
everything we have on the embed HTML
file we have it over here right so this
is how the iframe tag actually works
the size of this box or window we can
say is quite small right we can change
it according to our needs with the help
of the height and width attributes so we
have to write here inside the iframe tag
we have to write here height
and let's say the height is going to be
300 pixels fine then we'll write here
width width is again going to be 300
pixels save the program and you can see
here the size is changed
it's larger and the image is more
visible now we can also add a video file
here and we can make it play this is why
the iframes in htmls are mainly used
so other attributes we have in this
particular tag are the title attribute
this attribute is used to specify the
title of the iframe so that screen
readers use this to read out what the
content of the iframe is what we have to
do is we have to include it over here
we have to write a title and we can give
any title so let's say for now we have
frame save it and you can see this is a
document and whenever the screen reader
will go through it it will let the user
know about the content present inside
the frame now as you can see here on the
browser you will notice that this
particular iframe has a border right a
shadow like thing on the top and left
side of the box so let me zoom in and
here you can see we have border on the
top and left hand side of this box or
window we can say or frame we can also
say but there is no border on the right
and on the bottom right so what we can
do is we can remove it with the help of
style attribute so what we'll do is
we'll use the style attribute over here
inside iframe so we will write here
Style
now inside style what we have to mention
is we have to mention the Border
property so border is going to be none
save the program and you can see that
the border is not present anymore you
can see it over here there is no border
as of now we can also change the Border
so we can either remove it or we can
change it so for changing the Border
what we have to do is we have to write
here instead of null we have to mention
here the Border value so let's say the
Border value is going to be
3 pixels solid
and black fine
now the Border will be of 3 pixels solid
in nature and black into save the
program and here we have the result on
our browser you can see the Border over
here so there were many attributes
present within the iframe element in
HTML but with HTML5 most of them were
depreciated one thing I want to mention
here is that we can also open a website
inside this iframe just provide the
website name as we did for links and it
will work but many websites don't allow
this feature like Google Facebook and
Instagram
so the task for you guys is to check
this feature with the website and let us
know which website you used and if it
worked elements in HTML can be
categorized into two different
categories in line elements and Block
Level elements let's go through the
inline elements first and you guys will
get an idea about them in line elements
in HTML take as much space as they need
and we can add content within them
without a line break the Bold italic and
underline elements are some of the
elements that fall under the category of
inline elements for example if we have a
paragraph written over in the browser
and we want to use any of these elements
within the paragraph
then we don't need a line break in that
case all we have to do is to use these
elements and without a doubt that thing
will work let's use it over here so what
we'll do is we'll just write over here
inside the body tag let's use a
paragraph over you so we'll write here
this is a and now we'll use the Bold
element so let's say we are writing over
here this is a paragraph
so this is a basic paragraph save the
program and you can see it here on the
browser we have a paragraph and this
particular word over here is bold you
can see that paragraph over here is
bolder in nature we don't need any line
breaks here right the element we used
here is Bool and it is an inline element
this was a basic example of inline
elements in HTML
Block Level elements on the other hand
appears on the screen as if they have a
line break before and after them there
is no need to specify the line break
they automatically take the full line or
width of the web page and create a line
break
the paragraph element header element and
the list elements fall under the
category of Block Level elements
anything that follows these type of
elements appears on its own new line
the most important Block Level element
is the div element it is used to create
the actual layout of the web page by
grouping similar types of elements
together
we can also provide similar CSS
properties to a group of elements
present within the div tag so let's just
use this tag over here and you guys will
understand it much better
for using a div tag we have to write
here inside the body tag
we have to write here
div stands for division
fine this tag over here will create a
container type of thing in the browser
and anything we write inside it will
follow a specific pattern in the browser
for example if we write here inside the
div tag so let's say we have a heading
tag present over here
so we'll write here this is
first group fine so let's say we are
creating a group over here now we'll
write here this is first two now H4
stands for heading tag is also an
example of Block Level elements so we
don't need any line break over here now
over here we'll use the paragraph text
which is also a block level element now
let's say we are writing over here list
of
cars fine
now after that let's say we are using an
unordered list over here so we'll write
a un and inside this we'll add some
elements so let's say we are writing
over here
the
name of some cards so let's say we have
Honda over here then we have let's say
Hyundai and
let's add some more elements so let's
say we have
BMW as well and finally we have
Audi fine so these are the four
different list items we have we have
enough content inside the div tag save
the program and you can see here on the
browser that we have a list present over
here now we can apply similar CSS
properties to each of the elements
present inside the div tag what we have
to do is we have to use the div tag over
here so what we can do is we can use
this div tag inside the CSS file as well
but for now we are going to style it on
the HTML part only so what we'll do is
we'll use the style attribute and inside
style attribute we'll write over here
color so let's say the color is going to
be
blue so this is the font color so we
have to write here blue and after this
we are going to use another property
let's say so let's say we are writing
over here border border is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and let's say
black in color fine
now save the program and you guys are
able to see the area acquired by the
whole div tag we can align these items
present inside the div tag later with
the help of CSS properties we'll discuss
it in another video when we go through
CSS for now let's create another
division over here so what we are going
to do is we are going to create another
division so
let's write over here
div again so this is another division we
have so what we are going to do is we
are going to
copy it from here
and we are going to paste it inside this
div tag so we are going to
name it as the second group we have so
we'll write a second and instead of
cards we are going to write here the
name of pipe manufacturers
so we'll write here let's say
Benelli and we have
Ducati and BMW will remain the same
because it is a Car and Bike
manufacturer then we'll write here let's
say at the end
Suzuki fine
now save the program and you guys can
see we have another list over here what
we'll do is
we'll use some CSS properties here as
well so we are going to write here
inside this div tag
we are going to use the style attribute
now inside this we are going to use the
color color is going to be let's see red
and we'll write here border as well so
border is going to be 2 pixels
solid in nature and let's say green in
color fine
save the program and you guys can see
here we have another division present
over here so you can see it is in a new
line but it's not clearly visible so
let's do one thing we are going to use
the break tag over here save the program
now and you guys can see both the
containers now are clearly visible fine
these borders are not visible by default
we can make them visible with the help
of CSS properties like we did here
now you guys might be wondering what the
use of this div tag is so whenever we
create the layout of any website this is
the tag we use the most to provide
better structure to a web page this tag
along with CSS is of more use than any
other HTML tag present today
you will get a better idea about it when
we go through CSS in the upcoming videos
any web page we create using HTML always
has a white background which sometimes
may look a bit boring to the user so is
there any way through which we can make
it look a bit attractive to the user yes
in HTML we have the background color or
the background attribute this attribute
is used to change the background of
either the whole web page or of any
particular tag
we can use an image in the background or
we can just change the background color
we'll do both in today's video so let's
start by changing the background color
of the whole body first
to change the background color of the
whole body we can use the BG color
attribute BG stands for background color
and we can use the name of any color
it's hex value or the RGB value of n
equal now the fun part is this attribute
is depreciated in HTML 5.0 a lot of such
things happen in HTML5 so let's see if
we can still use this attribute to
change the background color of the whole
body what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the body tag
we'll simply write here BG color
and will pass the colony so let's say we
are writing red over you
you can see the attribute is written in
red color over here the BG color we are
talking about this attribute so it's red
in color it means that this is not
working anymore so let's save the
program
and you can see here on the browser that
this thing is still working now to
change the background color of any
particular area like we can say a
division we have to use the background
color attribute we'll change the
background color of a whole division for
that what we'll do is we'll write some
code first so we have used the same code
from the previous part wherein we
discuss the div tag in HTML we have a
list present inside this container save
the program and you can see here on the
browser
right the background color of this
division is red for now because the
background color of the whole body is
red so it's invisible basically so what
we'll do is we'll remove this BG color
from here save it now and you can see we
have this division over here
now what we have to do is we have to
change the background color of this
particular division so for that we'll
move to our division and here you can
see we have the style attribute so we
have to provide the value or the
property inside the style attribute only
so we have color and Border over here
already now what we'll do is we'll write
over here
background color and the background
color is going to be let's say Aqua so
if you are using vs code you can see we
have this colors over here and what we
can do is we can change the color from
here and it will set the RGB values
accordingly fine so vs code provides us
with this option
now save the program and you can see the
background color of this particular
division is changed now
so this is how we can change the
background color of any Division if we
try to use the BG color attribute or the
BG attribute whichever we used in the
body tag previously it will not work
over here because that thing is
depreciated from HTML file and to change
the background color in HTML5 or above
versions We have to use the background
color property only inside the style
attribute we can also use the same style
attribute to change the background color
of the whole body what we have to do is
we have to write here inside the body
tab
so here's our body Tech and we have to
write here type style is the attribute
and here we have to write
background color so the background color
is going to be let's say a little
different for now what we'll do is we'll
use the brown color over here save it
now and you can see we have brown
background for the whole body tag right
for the whole body we have the brown
background another thing we can do with
background is we can change the
background of any division or the whole
body with an image element
the property name inside the style
attribute will change and we have to
provide the URL for that image that's it
so let's do it here we'll try doing it
with the division first so what we'll do
is we'll write here inside the div tag
so we have this division over here we'll
remove this background color property
from here
and instead of background color we have
to write here background image so this
is the property name now inside here we
have to provide the URL so URL is the
path of our image so we have a images
folder present in a system so this is
the folder now we have these images
present over here what we'll do is we'll
use background one dot PNG
save it now and you can see the change
in the background so this is basically a
transparent background so let's make
some changes over here what we'll do is
we'll remove this style attribute from
the body tag
and save it now you can see this is the
background we can also change the color
of this particular div tag so the font
color basically so let's make it black
for now
and we have to move the marker from here
to Black
and it's good to save it now and you can
see we have black font color over here
so you can see the image in the
background of this particular division
for now
we can do the same thing with the whole
body as well right here inside the body
Tech so we have to write here again
we have to mention the style attribute
inside the style attribute we have to
mention background image the URL the
process will remain the same we have to
provide the image path so we have images
and then we'll provide background two
Dot JP save it now and you can see the
background it's a little bit tricky to
see it over here because the image is
not clearly visible so for that we have
another property present in HTML so what
we have to do is we have to write here
with background image we have to pass
the property as
background size and
the value is going to be cover
save it now and you can see now the
image is clearly visible so the font is
not visible because the image color and
the font color is quite similar so we
can change it from here so what we have
to do is we have to change the color
again so let's do it once again and now
we'll
try to use white save it now and you can
see this over here so this is not
clearly visible but this is how we can
change the background of any particular
division or the body tag in HTML
so Guys these are the few ways to change
the background of any web page using
HTML I hope you guys got it the task for
you guys is to use a gif file here and
see if that thing works or not not much
of a task just change the file name here
and we have to pass the file name with
DOT gif as extension just change the
file name and it will work as it's quite
obvious that while working on any web
page we need to make sure that it looks
attractive to the user to gain more of
their attention
what colors can do to a web page is
quite understandable and we need to make
sure that colors present on a web page
should be at Point
the question that arises here is how we
can achieve that is it possible to do it
with the help of HTML only yes it's
possible to do so before we move on and
see how let me tell you guys that we can
achieve the same thing with the help of
CSS as well CSS stands for cascading
style sheet in fact CSS is always a
better option because it helps us make
the whole document not only clean but
also provides some extra features in it
now what if we don't have any CSS
knowledge how HTML can be used to make
change in the color scheme of any web
page the first thing to keep in mind
while using HTML for making color
changes is the style attribute we have
been through this attribute already and
we know that this particular attribute
is used to make style changes to any
particular HTML element or the whole
document
let's take an example here where we'll
use a division and we'll change the
background color and the font color of
that particular division we'll also
change the Border color for that we'll
write here so let's create the division
first so we'll create the division using
the div tag so we'll write a div now
inside div We'll add a heading so first
add a heading let's say so let's say the
heading is this is in
exam fine now let's add some paragraph
over here so we'll use the P tag for
that or the paragraph tag we can see so
let's say we are writing over here there
are three different
methods
to change
the
color in our back page fine so we'll
write it in a
web page
when we are done with the paragraph now
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to add an unordered list over
here so for that we'll use the UL tag
which stands for unordered list now we
have to add the list elements inside you
so let's say we have
color names as the first option then we
have
let's say the hex code we will write
here hex codes
and finally let's say we have
RGB fine so we'll write here RGB values
so here we are done with the basic
container the next thing we'll do is
we'll make the Border visible so first
of all save the program and here you can
see we have all the data over here we
have a heading we have a paragraph and
three different let's start
Phi
now we'll use the style attribute inside
the Dev tag to make the Border visible
first so what we'll do is we'll go to
the Dev tag over here we'll use the
style attribute we'll write a style
and here we have the style attribute now
inside this we'll write border
now the Border will take three different
values first of all we'll write here the
Border size so let's say the border is
going to be 2 pixel thick and the Border
is going to be solid in nature so
basically we have written solid over
here save the program and here you can
see on the browser that we have a border
present around the whole division this
is basically the whole area acquired by
this div element now you can see here
that we didn't specify any color of our
own choice here right the default color
of this border is black however we can
change this color from the border
property present inside the style
attribute so it takes three parameters
by default we have given two here we
have given the Border size and the
Border Niche the third one will be the
color of this board so what we'll do is
we'll basically write here
let's say red fine red here is the color
name save the program and you can see
here the Border color is red now it's
easy right
in the same way we can change the
background color of this whole division
as well the property name will change
what we have to do is we have to write
here after
border so we have border over here now
after border we have to put semicolon
over here and after this we have to
write here
background
color fine
so we have the background color property
over here now what we have to do is we
have to write the name of our background
color right so let's say the background
color of this property is going to be
Aquaphor now right here Aqua save the
program and you can see here the
background color has changed now this
background color property has the
capability to change the background
color of any particular element or the
whole body you can witness the change
here on the browser you have already
witnessed it it can be used to change
the background color of the whole body
as well for that what we have to do is
we have to go to the body tag over here
and we have to use the style attribute
over here as well so we'll write Here
style now inside the style attribute we
have to mention background color and
let's say the background color is going
to be
fine so blue here is the Kalani save the
program
and we have the whole background in blue
color now you can see it over here right
the next thing we'll discuss is how to
change the font color of any particular
element you can see the font color here
is black for now now we'll see how we
can change it
for that we have to use the color
property inside the stylet so you can
see it over here we have the style
attribute present inside the div element
what we have to do is we have to mention
another property over here so after
semicolon what we are going to do is we
are going to write here color and we are
going to specify the colorway so we have
a list of colors over here in vs code so
let's say we are using blue oil save the
program and you can see the font color
is changed fine so this is how we can
change the background color and the font
color of any web page or of any element
the last thing we are going to discuss
in today's video is the color coding
methods present in HTM
there are three different ways to
specify any particular color in HTML we
can either use the color name to do so
which we did till now so here you can
see we are using the color names so here
you can see we have blue wallet we have
Aqua so these all are color nibs we have
red and blue as well
now
apart from that we can also use the RGB
values or the hex values of colors the
RGB values stand for red green and blue
colors these three colors are the most
basic and these can be used to make any
color fine this color value is specified
using the RGB property so what we have
to do is instead of writing the name of
color we'll remove it from here and now
we'll use the RGB value so we have to
use the RGB property first so we'll
write a r g
and here you can see we have three
different values present inside RGB we
have red green and blue fine the value
can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a
percentage
so what we have to do we have to write
here
let's say 255 and for green we are also
going to use 255
and for blue let's say we are using 255
fine so these are the RGB values for
white color fine so for black we have to
mention 0 for all three colors it's easy
to use these values if you have a good
idea about colors and you know how to
make different colors out of these three
basic colors save the program and you
can see the background color is changed
to White NOW fine now not all the
browsers out there support this method
of color coding so it's recommended not
to use it
the last method we have is the hex
method in this method as well the three
basic colors are used a hexadecimal is a
six digit representation of a color the
first two digits represent the red value
the next two are a green value and the
last one is the blue value each
hexadecimal code will be provided by a
pound or a h sign for using the hex
values of any color so we have to write
here now what we are going to do is we
are going to change the background color
using hex values so we have blue for now
here now what we are going to do is we
are going to use a hex value of n equal
fine so let's say we are using yellow
fine so we have to write here hash now
we have to provide the hex value so we
have to write here f f f and 0 0 so this
is basically equals to the RGB value so
we will write the equivalent RGB value
for yellow color as well so the
equivalent RGB value for yellow color is
255 comma 255 comma Z so these two
colors are same these two things means
actually the same this is the
hexadecimal value and this is the RGB
value for your local so we'll remove
this for now save the program and you
can see the background is yellow in
color fine
I hope you guys got this if you are
using vs code as an editor then we have
an advantage as it allows you to choose
the colors from its own color scheme
just click here on any color and you can
see we have this color scheme over here
we can choose any color of our own
choice we have to set this cursor inside
you and it will give us the hex value of
that particular color so you can see it
over here so let's do it for now save
the program and you can see the
background color is changed
I want you guys to give it a try and let
us know what you learned just like
colors in HTML are used to make a web
page look more appealing to the user
fonts also play an integral role in
designing a web page fonts are used to
increase the readability of content
present on any web page we have been
using fonts since the very beginning of
this course
now that we have enough knowledge about
adding paragraphs or text to any web
page so we'll see how we can manipulate
that text present on a web page with the
help of HTML only before HTML 5.0 was
introduced there used to be a specific
tag present in HTML for changing the
font the HTML phone tag was used to do
so but now this tag is depreciated from
XT
instead of that the style attribute in
HTML again comes into play while
changing the font on any web page
we can change the size color and type of
font used on any web page with the help
of style attribute in HTML
so without wasting any time let's move
on to the programming part directly
first of all let's add some basic text
to the web page what we'll do is we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll use
the paragraph tag and we'll write here
this
is an example of
let's say fonts in HTML fine
so save the program and you can see here
that we have this text present on the
web browser the text over here is simple
one thing to keep in mind while using
fonts is the user will only be able to
see our font if they have that font
installed on their computer otherwise
the font will automatically change to
default according to the user's system
to change the font in HTML what we have
to do we have to write here inside the P
tag or paragraph tag we can see we have
to use style attribute first and then
inside the style attribute we have to
pass the font family fine so this is a
property and we have different fonts
present in HTML so if that particular
font is installed on your PC then it
will work totally fine so let's say we
have
comic sense MSS afford fine so this is a
phone
save the program and you can see the
font has changed for this particular
paragraph now let me show you the
default font for HTML as well so what
we'll do is we'll write here this is an
example of save the program and here you
can see the difference in these two
paragraphs the second one has Comic
sense Ms as the found family fine
the list of fonts is quite long and you
can use any of your own choice so
another font we can use is vardana so
what we'll do is we'll copy this
paragraph from here
and we'll paste it here fine
so what we have to do next is we have to
paste it here okay so it's not copied so
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here now what we'll do is we'll change
the font family so we have to use the
style attribute again now inside style
attribute we have to write your font
family and in font family we have to
write
okay we have to write it here so we have
to write here
we're done fine so save the program and
here you can see this font is also
different from these two paragraph So
this paragraph seems a bit different so
this is the font family vedana if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
similarly we can
quickly font in HTML make sure that
whichever font you are using is
installed on your computer
another thing we can do with fonts is we
can change the size of the phone so for
changing the size of phone we have to
take another paragraph so we'll copy it
from here we'll paste it here and we'll
write something here like
change size find
now save the program and you can see
over here we have another paragraph So
this paragraph says this is an example
of fonts in HTML and we have written
change size inside brackets so now to
change the size of this paragraph We
have to use the style tag and inside
this style attribute we have to write
here font size fine so the font size is
large larger medium small smaller extra
large extra small extra extra large and
extra extra small we can use any of them
or we can give a specific size of Our
Own in pixels fine so we'll use the
double XL here save the program and you
can see the change in the font size we
can use both these properties together
as the both font size and font family we
have to write here font family and
inside font family we have to write the
font name so let's say this is the
founding save the program and you can
see the font is changed now
fine
we can also change the font color
present on our web page we discussed it
in the previous video as well where we
went through colors in HTML for changing
the color of the font what we have to do
is we have to write here inside the
style attribute we have to use the color
property so color in HTML stands for
font color fine so we have to write here
color and we have to use any color of
our own choice we can either provide the
hex value or we can also provide the RGB
value or just the color name so we are
going to provide the color name for now
save the program and you can see this
color over here the change in font color
fine so let's use any other color so
we'll use green over here save it now
and now you guys will be able to see the
change in color
so guys this is how we can use HTML
fonts to make a web page look more
attractive to the user it all depends on
us how we can use these fonts colors and
all to make a web page look more
appealing I hope you guys got this give
it a try and you'll understand how easy
it is
in the most basic definition a form is
something we use to take the user's data
for example if the user wants to
register on a website then they have to
give us their names email and some more
info about them a firm takes input from
the user and then posts it into the
backend application for further
processing and other stuff like
validation and all the HTML form tag is
used to create a form
it's quite simple to create a form in
HTM we'll move to the programming part
directly and create a simple form to
start with so the first and foremost
part is that we need to use the form tag
to create a form so what we'll do is
we'll move to the body of our program
and we'll write here form so this is the
form tag in HTML save the program and
you can see here nothing happened on the
browser so this form Tech created an
area for a form it basically worked like
the Dev tag we used in the previous
videos
now to include data in a form we need
text areas or we can say input boxes in
our form there are various form elements
available like text field text area
Fields drop down menus radio buttons
check Boxes Etc
so let's start using them in the form
here first of all we'll create a text
box for the user's name for that what we
have to do is we have to write here
inside the form tag so we'll write your
first name and then we have to write
here
input so input is another tag so we have
to write a input
and then we have to use the type
attribute so the type is going to be
text for this text box and we'll write
here
name name is going to be
first name
fine
now save this and you can see here we
have an input box for the first name
the same code we can use for the last
name as well what we have to do is we
have to copy it from here
we have paste it here
so we'll use the BR tag before using it
again now we have to change first here
with last we will write here last
and in name as well we'll write
last fine
so we have this last name over here save
it and you can see we have first name
and last name we have two different text
boxes present over here we'll use the BR
tag one more time save it now and you
can see it clearly now right
so here we are done with the first text
box of us
now this input tag over here is used to
create these text boxes and the name
refers to the text boxes name fine
another thing we can do here is we can
write here
placeholder and inside placeholder we
can write something let's say we are
writing over here first name and you can
see first name over here
it's permanent until we write something
inside the Box the placeholder value
will appear on the text box same thing
we can do here as well we have to write
here please holder
so we have placeholder for
last name as well save it now and you
can see the value of placeholder over
here the moments we start writing
something over here you can see the
placeholder value is not here anymore

there are different types of form
controls that we can use to collect data
using HTML form they are text input
controls we can use checkboxes radio
buttons we can use select box controls
and we can also use file select boxes so
we can use radio buttons in our form for
that what we need to do is we need to
change the type in our phone so that's
the only thing that will change no
matter what controls we are using so
what we have to do is we have to write
here
let's say we are using braid tag first
so we'll use two break tags over here in
order to make the whole web page clear
and easily understandable for you guys
so next thing we'll do is we'll write
here
gender so let's write here gender then
we'll use great tag again and after this
we'll write
input type is equals to radio and we can
write here name name is going to be
let's see mail and the value for this is
going to be mail again fine we can use
the value attribute here as well so
we'll use it later now the next thing
we'll do is we'll write here
input again
we'll add another gender so let's say we
have type here is
radio again and then we have name as
female and will write here
so save it now and you can see two radio
buttons over here we can check them in
and you can see we have radio buttons
working totally fine we can use these
values later on as well similarly we can
use check boxes as well in our form
we'll see how in the upcoming video
where we'll create something like a
login or a sign up form using HTML only
so there are three different types of
text inputs used on phones we can use
single line text input controls so this
control is used for items that require
only one line of user input such as
search boxes or names they are created
in HTML using the input tag we discuss
them till now so these all are the
example of single line text input
controls which we discussed till now the
next are password input controls this is
also a single line text input but it
masks the character as soon as a user
enters it they are also created using
the HTML input tag so the syntax goes
like this we have to write here after
this so we'll use the BR Tech again over
here
and now we'll write here
input so before that let's write
password so this password is going to be
the user's password for our website for
login or maybe for sign in so this is
the password so we'll write a input type
is equal to password and then we'll
write here
name as
password fine save it now and you can
see password written over here with a
text box fine
right inside here will get masked so if
we write anything over here you can see
it in the form of password it will get
masked as soon as we enter it so this is
done to make the password a secret
now we can also set the maximum length
of a password using the max length
attribute so what we have to do is we
have to write here max length
and max length is going to be
let's say eight fine save the program
and now if we write something over here
you can see
and now we are not able to use more than
8 characters inside this particular text
box right because we have defined the
max length as a and it will allow only 8
characters inside the text box fine
the last one we have are multi-line text
input controls this is used when the
user is required to give details that
may be longer than a single sentence
so multi-line input controls are created
using html text area tag the Syntax for
a multi-line input is simple we have to
write here after this so we'll use the
BR tag
again for two times and then we'll write
here let's see description fine so after
description we'll use
the BR tag to make it more clear and
then we'll write here
text area so this is the tags and then
we have to Define rows and columns here
so rows are going to be 5 and we'll
write your calls so these two are the
attributes we'll write a 50 this
basically we are defining the area
acquired by this text area fine then
we'll write a name
and we'll write here description
then we'll write something over here so
let's say we'll write over here enter
description here
and that's it save the program and you
can see we have a text area present over
here it's bigger in size than the normal
text boxes we had earlier so what we can
do is we can remove it from here and we
can use the placeholder attribute inside
the text area tag to write such thing
fine
the last important thing in a form is
the submit button so this button is used
to submit the form data we can either
use the input tag or the button tag for
a submit button fine so let's use the
input tag for creating a button first
what we'll do is we'll write here after
this
we'll write here the
brake tag and then we'll write
input type is equals to button and then
we have
value is equals to
submit fine
save the program and you can see the
button over here on the browser so
here's the button
we can further make this button work
with the help of JavaScript but we are
creating the layout only for now so let
it be this way only the next method we
can use for creating a button is by
using the button tab so what we have to
do is we have to write here just use the
BR tag once and right here button so
this is the tag and right here the name
of
button fine so we'll write here submit
save the program and you can see here
another button fine so here's the button
you can see both the buttons are exactly
same no difference between the buttons
we can style this form according to our
needs we'll do something different in
the next video whenever we go through
the login or signup portal of any
website we see that on the login page we
use credentials like ID and password
name sign up page on the other hand
refers to the form we need to fill in
order to be a part of that particular
website
so what we'll do is we'll create a login
page and a sign up page in today's video
and we'll see what we can learn from
this field
so without wasting any more time let's
move on to the programming part directly
we'll start with the login page first so
first of all here we are in the HTML
file we'll start using the form tag but
before that we are going to provide a
heading for this login page so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body Tab
and we'll write here H1 so H1 stands for
heading 1. I hope you guys already know
this particular element
so what we'll do is we'll write here
login form fine so we have written login
form over here save it and you can see
we have login form written on the browse
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style it a bit using the
style attribute we have been through it
already so we'll write a sign now inside
style what we'll do is we'll align this
text at the center of our web page so
we'll write here text
align and will text align it to the
center fine so here we are we are done
with text aligning save it now and you
can see it moving in the browser so it's
in the middle of the web page now you
can see it over here clearly the login
form is present at the center of a whole
web page fine
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to use the form tag over
here fine so we'll write here form and
this is a form tag so we are going to
create the form inside this particular
tag only now let's style this as so what
we'll do is we'll write here Style again
the style attribute comes into play so
we are going to use the Border attribute
now we are going to keep the Border 3
pixel thick solid in nature and let's
use this particular color so we'll write
a F1 F1 F1 so this is white color
basically so here you can see it's not
completely right off white or a bit
grayish we can say so here you can see
the form body so I hope this is visible
for you guys
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to use a container so what
we'll do for that we'll use the div tag
we'll style and then we'll move on first
so we'll write here diff
now inside div we are going to use the
style attribute again obviously so we
are going to provide padding over here
now we'll write here 25 pixels so what
is padding you guys repeat so what is
padding you guys might be wondering
about it
padding provides the space between the
border and the content of an element
fine
so the space between the border of that
element and the content is known as
padding so padding is going to be 25
pixel for all the sites so padding is
basically four side from top right
bottom and left fine so we can provide
all the values or we can provide a
single value for all fine so here
padding is 25 pixel now we are going to
set background color for this and the
background color is going to be
let's say like fine save it now and here
you can see we have a container which
has a border of gray color and the
background color is
kaidu or we can say light fine
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to start creating a
form so here we are inside the div tag
so you can see we have the form tag
first and inside the form we have a
particular division
fine so what we'll do now is we are
going to create a login form so we'll
use the label tag so label tag stands
for the label of any form so you will
see it over here so we'll write here
user name
and we'll put
column save it now and here you can see
we have username present inside the
container or we can say inside the form
fine
so let's put a space over here save it
now and now I guess it looks fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create a text box now so
for that we are going to use the input
text so we'll write a input
type is equals to text for this username
and then we'll write here
placeholder placeholder will write enter
username fine
now after this we are going
to write here name
is going to be let's say
username again
and then we'll write here let's say
required so required is another
attribute we have
so what will happen now is if we leave
this box empty and if we don't write
anything over here and if we try to
submit a login form then a pop-up will
appear which says credentials required
or something like that only so HTML
provides us with this feature so save it
now and here you can see we have a label
username and a text box which says enter
username fine similarly we'll create a
label for password and text box or
password fine so we'll write here
label again and we'll write here
password
save it now and here you can see we have
a label for password as well now what
we'll do is we'll write here
again we are going to use the input tag
so we'll write here input type is equals
to password
you guys are already aware of this type
and then we'll write you placeholder and
we'll write here
enter
password fine so we'll write a enter
password then we have the name for
password we'll write here
name is equals
to
password and then we'll write here a
required again fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box
now so let me make it a little
more
here for you guys so here we are done
with the username and the password the
next thing we need is the submit button
now fine the button type is going to be
submit or we can use the input tag as
well as we did in the last video so
we'll write here
login fine so this is the button name
save it now and here you can see we have
the login Button as well now what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
check box or we can say a remember me
function right so for that what we'll do
is
we are again going to use the input tag
for that so we'll write here input then
we'll write here type type is equals to
check box
and then we'll write here after this
check check there's a property again so
we'll write here
checked as checked so then we'll write
here
remember me fine save it now and here
you can see we have a check box and a
remember me option fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create another button the
cancel button fine so we'll write here
button button and type is going to be
button again then we'll write here
id id is going to be let's say
cancel button why we are using this ID
because we need this ID in the CSS part
we'll see it later then we'll write here
the name of button is cancel fine
save it now and here you can see we have
a cancel button as well now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to put some links over here so for that
we are going to use the anchor tag again
we'll write here a
href href is going to be let's say hash
because we are going to write here
forgot password so we'll write here
forgot password
or we can write here forget password
fine
save it now and here you can see we have
a link present over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to use a
break over here and then we'll add
another link for the sign up page fine
so we'll write here a href again
reference is going to be
sine n dot HTML so this is going to be
the sign in file or the HTML file for
the sign up page
then we'll write here
register fine
save it now and here you can see
register written over here on the
browser so we are already done with the
login form the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to use CSS for
that so we are almost done with the HTML
part for this login page all of you guys
are well aware of the style attribute
till now right this attribute is used to
change the style of any particular
element
let me tell you guys another way of
using this style attribute in HTM we can
use all these styling properties inside
the style tag as well for that what we
need to do is we need to move to the
Head section of a HTML file and we have
to write here
style fine so here we are we are here
with the style tag so what we are going
to do is we are going to style our HTML
document inside this style tab on
fine
what we'll do here is we'll write here
body first fine so what we are doing
here is we are styling the body tag the
whole body tag now fine so what we'll do
is we'll use the font family first so
we'll change the font family we'll write
here
okay we are going to use Gill send we
are going to use this then we'll write
here the background color so we'll
change the background color of this
pitch we'll write a RGB the RGB values
are
we have to write it in
small letters the RGB values are 1 3 4
comma 1 3 2 comma 1 3 3 fine
we are done with it save it and here you
can see the change
so the RGB values are not working
because we have written RBG over here
instead of RGB save it now and here you
can see the background color is greener
fine so it looks nice
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to style the button so the
button tag we have used here you can see
it over here we have used the button tag
for cancel button and for submit button
fine or we can say for login bit so we
are going to style both of them
at once so we will write here button
we'll write here the tag name basically
so button is the tag name now we'll
change the background color of this
button which is going to be let's say
hash 150
5 FM so guys I'm already aware of these
colors and you can do what we did in the
background color video or you can change
the background color according to you
you can use the color name you can use
the hex values or the RGB values
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to provide here the width
width is going to be 100 of the whole
time fine then we'll write here color
color is going to change the font color
of this button so we'll write here RGB
again
and we are going to write here 2 4 8
comma 2 4 8 comma two four eight eight
fine let's see what it is so here you
can see the login and cancel button are
changed now so the font color is white
the button color is blue
and next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write here
padding padding again is going to be 15
pixels for all the sides then we'll
write here
margin fine so we'll write a margin
margin is going to be 10 pixel and
0px fine so what is margin guys margin
provides the space between the border
and the outer l
there's a difference between padding and
merge padding provides the space between
the border and the content of element so
here in this case this is the content
and this is the
padding fine margin on the other hand
refers to this space between this
element and the next value fine so
margin as 10 and 0 pixel means 10 pixels
from top and bottom and zero pixel from
left and right fine
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to write here border
fine so border will Define as none
save it and you can see the buttons here
now the next thing or the last thing we
are going to write here is we are going
to change the cursor to pointer on
taking over this buttons you can see the
cursor changed now fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style the input
tags so we'll write here input
and we are going to style them so we'll
write a type is equals to
we have used a lot of
input tags right so we'll write it type
is equals to text and then again we are
going to write here input
then we'll write here type is equals to
password fine so we have two input tags
for
username and for password so we are
going to style them at once side by side
we are going to style them
so the next thing we are going to write
here is we are going to set the width as
100 percent
and then we'll write here margin again
so we'll write your margin as 8 pixels
and 0 pixels fine
save it now and here you can see the
login form is looking more and here you
can see the login form looks much better
now
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to define the padding as
well padding is going to be
12 pixel and
20 pixel fine
then we'll write a display display as
inline block and we have border over
here border is going to be 2 pixel
solid in nature and we are going to
define the RGB value again so RGB is
going to be 109
for green we have
it and for blue we have
and for blue here we have let's say 240.
and save it now and here you can see the
borders over here now what we are going
to do is we are going to remove pixel
from here and here you can see we have
the
input boxes or we can say the text box
is working totally fine now what we are
going to do last is we are going to
write here
box size you can see these boxes going
out of area so we will write your box
sizing as
border box save it now and here you can
see the login form is almost done fine
so let me close it once
now the next thing we are going to style
is the button tag again so we'll write
here button
and then we'll write here a property it
totally depends upon us if we are going
to use these properties or not so we
have to remove from here we have to
write here hover and on hovering the
opacity will change so the opacity will
change to 0.7 now look it carefully and
here you can see when we take our mask
cursor over any button there is no
change right now save the program try to
take the mouse cursor again you can see
it's still not working as of now
foreign
totally fine when taking the mouse
cursor over any button it hovers now the
opacity will change fine the last thing
we have to do is we have to style the
cancel button
so we are going to use the ID over here
so here you can see in the HTML part of
cancel button
so we have used the ID as cancel button
over here so we are going to use this ID
to spell this particular button fine
will right here inside this cancel
button
width width is going to be Auto then we
have
padding padding is going to be 10 pixel
and 18 pixel
for top bottom and for left right fine
then we have the margin as well
and margin is going to be
10 pixel for top bottom and 5 pixel for
Left Right save it now and here you can
see the login form is completely done
fine now that we are done with the
styling part let's check the final
output save the program and you can see
so here you can see on the browser we
have this basic login form it looks fine
right we can make it more attractive but
we need CSS for that with HTML we can do
this only so let's move ahead and we'll
now create the registration form or the
sign up page
so let's move ahead to another HTML file
so here we are in the HTML file so this
file is for sign up pit here you can see
the title for sign up so we'll remove
this form tag from here it's a mistake
save it now and now what we are going to
do is we are going to open it with live
server again
so here you can see this HTML file has
no output as of so let's create the sign
up form now if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
so what we'll do for
later on now moving to the body part
what we'll do is we'll style the body
first so we'll use the style attribute
now we are going to define the font
family here font family is going to be
this one again let's say we have used
this in the sign up form or we can say
the login form as
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to change the background
color for this whole body now what we
are
doing here is we'll write here RGB then
we'll Define the values as 1 3 4 comma 1
3 2 comma 1 3 3 the same one from the
previous login form save it now and here
you can see the change in the background
color of the whole body tag fine next up
what we'll do here is we are going to
use the H1 tag again
will spell it as well so we'll write a
style we are going to align it to the
center we'll write a text align
and we'll write here text align at the
Center fine so here we are then we'll
write here
registration form
save it now and here you can see we have
registration form written and the center
of a web page fine next thing we have to
include a lot of text boxes and a lot of
labels in this particular registration
form because for login form we need only
two text boxes or two labels right the
username and the password but the sign
up form is different we need a lot of
information about the user so for that
we are going to use a lot of input tags
first thing we are going to do is we are
going to use
break over here then we'll use the form
tag
and that's it inside the form tag we are
going to change the style over here only
so we'll write a style
and we are going to use the board border
is going to be 3 pixel
solid in color and or we can say solid
in nature and
off white or gray in color fine so here
you can see the border on the browser
now what we are going to do next is we
are going to use the div tag again
so we'll write here div
here we have the div tag so let's style
this div tag over here only we are going
to use the style attribute for that we
are going to define the padding padding
is going to be 25 pixel for this as well
background color we are going to use
light blue one save it now and here you
can see the container on the browser so
it's similar to the login one now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use label first so we will write here
label then we have the label as
first name
and save it you can see we have our
first level over over here
the next thing we need is the input area
or the text box for this first name so
we'll write a input
type is equals to text then we have
name name is going to be
first name and then we have
sites or we can say the length so
will write here
max length max length let's define it as
15
and we are done with the first text box
use the brake tag again over here and
that's it so we are done with first name
similarly we have to mention the middle
name last name is when so let's define
them here so we'll write here label
again
this time we have the label for
middle name
and that's it save it and here you can
see we have middle name written over
here we'll copy this piece of code or we
can say the input tag from here
will change the name to
last name
and save here you can see we have
another text box present over here fine
so one thing we forgot to mention here
is the placeholder we can write here
placeholder
enter
first name fine save it now and here you
can see the placeholder on the browser
so we'll copy it from here we'll paste
it here will mention for last name or
for middle name as well save it now and
here you can see something is wrong
save it again
and there's something wrong fine
okay so there's a problem with the live
server so what we'll do is we'll open it
again with live server
and here you can see it's not working as
of now
okay the Break Tag we have
something wrong over here let me check
guys
okay we forgot to mention
this over here save it now and it's
still not working
with live server again and it's working
now fine
so it's working as of now we'll do the
same thing for
last name is so we'll copy this piece of
code from here we'll paste it here we'll
change middle to last everywhere so
we'll write it and the last name over
here
then we have name as last name
and we have to write here enter
last name or we can say last name over
here save it now and here you can see we
have another text box and another label
present over here for last name as well
now what we are going to do is we are
going to select
or we can say we are going to use
options or we have to mention them over
here so for that we'll write here
label so we are going to mention course
over here and for code we are going to
provide drop down menus so for that what
we need to do is we need to use the
select tag in HTML so inside the select
tag we have to provide options options
let's say the value of option is first
value is going to be course and then we
have to write here course it is going to
be a drop down list so we have to
mention a lot of options over here so
we'll write your option again
and then we'll write here
value value is going to be BCA
then we have to write here BCA save it
now and here you can see we have course
over here so here you can see till now
it has two values let's add some more
values over here for options or we can
say let's add some more options over
here we'll add let's say three four more
options we'll write here BBA instead of
BCA for this
then we have let's see
B Tech
and we'll change the value over here as
well
we'll write here B Tech then we have
MBA as well let's say
so we'll write here MBA
then finally we have let's say
M Tech as well so we'll write here M
Tech
save it now and here you can see if we
click on this code you can see we have
different options available we have BCA
BBA B Tech MBA and empty so the select
tag or we can say the option tag and
select tag both are used for drop down
menu so here is a drop down menu we have
to put a colon over here save it now and
I'll guess it looks fine now
so
the next thing we need to do is we need
to use the radio buttons for gender fine
so what we are going to do is we are
going to use
The Break Tag
and then we'll write here
gender so gender is going to be the
label so we have to put it inside label
tag so we'll write a label
and we have to put gender inside fine
save it now and here you can see we have
gender present over here
now what we are going to do is we are
going to put a break again over here and
then we have to
use the input tag so we'll write a input
type is equals to
[Music]
radio
for radio buttons when then we have to
write a name name is going to be mail
and the first value is going to be
me fine then we have to put the BR tag
again
and we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here
for female
then we have to change the value here as
well
email we have to write here we have to
put a br tag
will copy it from here again and let me
close it once we'll copy it from here
we'll
paste it here
now we have to write here instead of
female
other fine
so we'll mention other over here as well
save it now and here you can see we have
three radio buttons over here for gender
we have male female and other fine now
next thing we have to include is we have
to include the phone number for phone
number we need two input boxes one for
the country code and another one for
phone fine so we need to write here and
we'll put another break over here then
after this break we need the label for
food fine we will write your phone
and after phone we have to write here
input
type is equals to text for phone number
then we'll write here
name name is going to be
country code
then we have to write here the value as
well value is going to be plus 9 1 this
is the country code of India then we'll
write here
max length max length is going to be 3
so that the user cannot write anything
inside here fine save it now and here
you can see we have phone as label and
we have a text box if we try to write
anything you can see we are not able to
write
so what we'll do next is we'll add
another input box or we can say the text
box for phone number so we'll copy it
from here
we'll paste it again we are going to use
the name as phone for phone number
the value is going to be
none so we'll remove value from here
and then what we'll do is we'll change
the max length to 10 degrees fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box over here so what we'll
do is
we'll change the type here so you can
see we are able to write
characters here as well what we'll do is
we'll change the type as num fine save
it now and now you will be able to see
that we are not able to write any
character over here but we are able to
write a number fine
so here is
the text box for phone number fine so we
are going to use
The Break Tag again so we'll write here
break
let's use it twice
and after this Break Tag what we need is
the address so we'll write here
label label is going to be address
so we have to write here address we have
to put a colon over here and after this
address we have to put the brake tag and
the text area so we are not going to use
this text box for this now we are going
to use the text area attribute so we'll
write here text area text area columns
are going to be 80 for this area and
roses fine fine
value is going to be
let's say address over here
and we are almost done so save it now
and here you can see on the browser we
have a text area for address
fine
so what we need to do next is we need
email we need password and retype
password we need three more options
right so let's start with email so what
we are going to do is we are going to
use break over here
twice so that it will be clear for you
guys to see now what we'll do is we'll
write here
inside label will write email
so we have the label as email then we'll
write here
input
type is equals to email then we have
ID as
email then we can write here
name as well name is going to be email
again so save it now and here you can
see we have a text box for email as well
now what we need to do is we need
another box for password so we are going
to use the brake tag twice
and now we are going to use the label
tag again label is going to be password
save it now and here you can see we have
label as password now we'll write a
input
type is going to be password then we
have ID is equals to pass in case we
need them in the CSS part that's why we
are using the idea attribute here name
is going to be pass again and that fine
so we have text box for password now
what we are going to do next is we are
going to use the brake tag again
next up we need to retype password
because this is a registration form the
user needs to retype the password he
choose fine so we'll write here
label label is going to be
re-enter password
and that's it we need an input box for
this as well so we are going to use this
one only so we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here
and we are going to use the BR tag again
fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box for a re-enter password
fine
the next thing we need is the submit
button the last thing so we will write a
input
type is going to be button then we have
well value is going to be submit
so save it now and we are done with the
registration formation
so here you can see we have everything
we need in a registration form
so here we are done with the HTML part
only let's style this page a bit now
we'll move on to the Head section again
and we'll write here inside the style
attribute or we can say the style tag
basically
so we'll write here
we are going to use
input
input for type as
text so basically we can do one thing
we can remove it we can go back to HTML
and we have this input one over here
we'll copy it from here
we'll come back to sign up page and
we'll save it so here you can see it
looks fine so some of them are not
working obviously because here for email
we have
use the input as email so for that to
work what we need to do is we need to
write here again after a comma we need
to write here input then inside this
brackets we need to write here
type is equals to email and for one more
we need to write here input
type is equals to
number fine
save it now and here you can see these
two are also working the text area we
can also use it over here
so what we can do is we can write here
text area only and it will work as well
so we need to change the Box sizing for
this address attribute or we can say for
the text area
so one thing we are going to do here is
we are going to write here
text area as well
let's see if it works you can see we
have written text area over here and it
works completely fine now fine so here
you can see we have both the pages now
if we move back to our login form you
can see this is a login form and this is
a registration
so it looks nice so what we can do is we
can go over here login form and we can
click on register and it will take us to
a registration form because these two
pages are linked together fine
so this is how we can create a HTML
login or sign up page using HTML and a
bit of CSS we can say I hope you guys
got it try doing it by yourself and let
us know what extra you did
CSS stands for cascading style sheet it
is a rule based language used to
describe the formatting and looks of a
web page
CSS stands one among the top three basic
languages required for front-end web
development there are three languages
which are HTML CSS and JavaScript HTML
as we all know is used to create the
layout or structure of a web page while
CSS is used to format that web page it
means to make changes in the style of
elements of a web page JavaScript on the
other hand is used to make a web page
more responsive to a user all three
languages together are used for basic
front and web development let's not go
deep into that and we'll now go through
the different ways of adding a CSS file
to a web page we can use CSS in three
ways in a HTML document external
stylesheet define stylesheet rule in a
separate CSS file the CSS files
extension is going to be dot CSS and
then we can include that file in our
HTML document using the link tag another
method we have is the internal style
sheet Define style sheet tools in the
header section of the HTML document
using style tag
another one we have is inline stylish in
this method we Define style sheet rule
directly along with the HTML elements
using the style attribute remember the
difference in internal style sheet we
use style tag and in inline style sheet
we use style as an attribute so let's go
through each of them practically you
guys will understand it much better
we'll use an external CSS file first
we'll attach it to a HTML document for
that let's write something over here on
the web page first so that we can then
style that particular element so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body of a
HTML document and we'll use a div tag
over here so we'll write here div and
inside this let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here
standing using
external CSS file or we can say styling
using
external style sheet
so this is a basic example of creating a
division save the program and you can
see here we have some text present over
here right the next thing we'll do is
we'll attach a CSS file to this HTML
document using a link tag then we'll
style this div tag in that file only so
let's do one thing first we'll create a
CSS file first so we'll go to this
section We'll add a file and let's name
it as
style.css dot CSS is the extension for
external CSS files remember this guys
press enter and you can see we have
another style sheet present over here so
this is empty for now we just created
this style sheet now let's move back to
the HTML file for now
now what we'll do is we'll link this
style sheet to a HTML document for that
the task is simple we use the link tag
so we'll move to the Head section of a
HTML document and we'll write here link
fine so after link what we'll do is
we'll write here array and Rel is going
to be
stylesheet then we have
type so this defines the type of a
document so we will write here Text
slash CSS and then we finally write here
href and a sheet name is
style dot CSS fine so we'll write here
style.css close it now
the Rel attribute here signifies the
relationship between these two documents
which means the HTML document and the
CSS document fine
the type is CSS and the hdf refers to
the source of a CSS file save the
program and you can see nothing happened
over here on the browser now what we'll
do is we'll style this div tag in the
external CSS file we just created
so let's move on to the CSS file and
what we'll do here is we'll write over
here so we are going to style our div
tag fine so for now we'll write over
here dip this is the Syntax for styling
any HTML element fine so let's style it
so let's say we are writing over here
background color as fine save it now and
you can see the background color is
changed to Blue
next thing let's change the font color
as well so let's say we are writing over
here
antique white as font color save it now
you can see the font color is also
changed let's add some more CSS
properties
so let's say we are writing over here
font weight so font weight is going to
be
bold then we have let's say font it's
time so font style we are going to write
here a tank fine save the program and
you can see the text is bolder and
italic in Niche fine next thing let's
add a border as well so we'll write your
border border is also a CSS property so
we'll write over here 3 pixel this is
the thickness of our bottom then we'll
write here solid this is the nature of
our border and let's say we are writing
over here the color name so silver is
going to be the color name save it now
and you can see this div tag or division
we can say now has a silver border with
some background color and font color as
well the last thing we are going to
write here is text align we are going to
align this text at the center of a
division save it now and you can see the
text present at the center of a division
fine
you can see the change over here on the
browser we created the layout here with
HTML and then we styled our div tag
using CSS we can style any HTML tag here
either with the help of tag name or the
ID and class attribute fine
the second way of styling an HTML tag is
with the help of inline CSS this method
is used to apply a unique style to a
single HTML element
for inline CSS what we need to do is we
need to move to the HTML file first and
here what we are going to do is we are
going to create another division now
fine we don't need any special tag or
external CSS file for inline CSS or we
can say inline style sheet so what we'll
do is we'll write over here
let's use the break tag first to make it
look more tidy so we'll use breakwise
and then we'll write here div fine so
this is going to be another Division and
we are going to write here p
so let's write here styling
a document
using
inline CSS fine save it now and you can
see this division has the same styling
as the previous one this is because we
have used the tag name over here inside
this style.css and both the tag names
are same both have Dev text right so
what we'll do is we'll remove this line
for now now save it and you can see both
of them don't have any style right now
fine so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here again now we are
going to style it with the help of
inline CSS for that we need the style
element so we'll write yes type then we
are going to define the background color
as let's say aqua
then we have
so let's make it tidy so we'll apply the
font color as well so let's say the font
color is going to be black for this one
then we have
let's say font style font style is going
to be italic
and then we have font weight on weight
is again going to be bolder we have
discussed all these properties in the
external CSS part as well so let's
mention all of them here so we are going
to use the Border as 3 pixel again
let's say dashed for now so we'll write
here dashed and then we'll write here
the color name so let's say the color
name is gold
and we have the Border as well so at the
end we'll write here text align at the
center
fine so the style attribute plays a
significant role in this type of style
and you can see it over here on the
browser the moment we save we have
another division over here so you can
see it over here this division has
dashed board which is also 3 pixel thick
and it looks different from the previous
one right so let's mention the link over
here as well again so we'll write your
link
Trail is going to be
tile sheet
type is going to be Text slash CSS and
then we have href href is going to be
style dot CSS and close it save it now
and you can see the difference between
both the divisions right the first one
uses the external CSS file and the
second one uses the inline style sheet
okay the output is almost the same as
the previous one apart from the colors I
know so inline CSS is easy to use but it
can make an HTML document look more
confusing and we need to style each
element separately if we use this method
to apply as time to an HTML document it
doesn't matter if we want to apply
similar styling to more than one element
inline CSS can be tricky and lengthy in
such tasks moving ahead let's talk about
the last method we are left with for the
HTML style sheet the internal method so
it uses a style tag inside the head
section of HTML document
so for that what we are going to do is
we are going to remove both these
divisions save it now and we are going
to remove this link as well we are going
to remove the link for our external
style sheet as well save it now and you
can see we have nothing over here on the
browser so what we are going to do is we
are going to create another division now
inside this we are going to use a
paragraph so let's say
we are writing over here styling a
document
using
internal
fine save it now and you can see we have
a paragraph over here nothing else
now this method is used to style
elements of a single web page we can
apply the same styling to a bunch of
elements simultaneously with the help of
internal CSS the task is simple so let's
do one thing let's create another
division over here
so we are going to create it after the
Break Tag and
paste it here and let's write something
over here as well so let's add Here
style sheet 2 and you can see we have
two paragraphs now these two are in
different divisions so what we are going
to do is we are going to style both the
divisions at the same time or
simultaneously we can see so for that
what we are going to do is we are going
to move to the Head section of our HTML
document and we are going to use the
style tag so style can be used as a tag
or as an attribute as well if we are
using inline CSS then we are going to
use style as an attribute and if we are
going to use internal CSS then we are
going to use style as a tab
tab fine so let's write it over here so
we have a div tag now what we'll do is
we'll style both of them so we are going
to write a background color as
let's say red for both of them then we
have color which refers to the font
color so let's say we have the font
color as black again then we have font
weight font weight is going to be bolder
then we have
upon style font style is going to be
italics save it now and you can see the
difference in the browser both the div
tags have same styling as of now now the
next thing we are going to write here is
border fine so we are going to write a
border let's make it 5 pixels this time
we are going to write you solid again
and let's change the Border color to
let's say we have yellow fine so we'll
write a yellow save it now and you can
see the Border color is yellow
so the last property we are left it is
text aligned we are going to align it at
the center save it now and you can see
the difference on increasing the
browser's size you can see the
difference the text is aligned at the
center of both the divisions fine
this method is also good to use if you
want to style any particular web page
only
I hope you guys must have understood all
the three methods of using CSS by now
the question that arises now is which
method we should use to keep the whole
document neat and the answer to this
question is external CSS this is because
external CSS allows us to style multiple
document at once it keeps a HTML
document clean and less prone to error
as well so I want you guys to use all
the methods and then let us know in the
comments which method you like the most
or which method you are more comfortable
working with
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting
language used to make a web page more
interactive and livelier to the user it
is one of the most popular scripting
languages present in world today it's
almost impossible to cover the whole of
JavaScript in one small video because
JavaScript in itself is an interesting
topic in this video we'll go through the
ways to attach JavaScript with HTML and
some basic examples of what this
language can do
so to include JavaScript in an HTML
document we can either keep the
JavaScript code in a separate file and
then include it wherever it's needed or
we can just Define functions inside the
HTML document itself using the script
tag
let's go through both the cases one by
one firstly we'll create an external
Javascript file the benefit of using an
external Javascript file is if we are
going to define a functionality which
will be used in various HTML documents
then it's better to keep that
functionality in a separate Javascript
file and then include that file in your
HTML document it will help us keep the
HTML document neat and organized as well
so a Javascript file always has a DOT JS
extension and the script tag is used to
attach a Javascript file to an HTML
document
let's move on to the programming part
directly and then we'll see what we can
do with JavaScript let's create a
Javascript file first
so we'll go here and we'll click on
create a file now we'll create a file
let's say the file name is going to be
new DOT JS dot JS is the extension here
and we have the Javascript file now
it's time to attach the JavaScript file
to a HTML document we'll use the script
tag after the body so what we'll do is
we'll move here and we'll write you
script
now inside the script tag we need two
attributes first one is going to be SRC
SRC is going to be new DOT JS as this
file is saved in that same folder the
next attribute we need is type so we'll
write here type type is going to be Text
slash JavaScript
fine
so SRC here defines the path where a
file is actually saved and type defines
the type of file that is Javascript in
this case so we are done with attaching
the file now let's move on and make a
web page a bit interactive to the user
fine we can write small functions known
as event handlers and then trigger them
using HTML only adding responsiveness to
a web page means defining an event that
will tell the system to perform a
specific action upon calling sounds a
bit confusing right so let's understand
it with the help of an example we are
all aware of adding buttons to a web
page right so if the user clicks on a
button then what should happen we can
either create a pop-up alert on the
button click or we can do whatever we
want
so let's create a button here first and
we'll then add functionality to it fine
so here we are in a HTML document it
will create a button over here so we'll
write over here button and let's say the
button name is going to be external for
external file save it now and you can
see we have a button over here on the
browser fine
now click on it and you can see nothing
is happening as of now so let's add some
functionality to this button now for
that what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the button tag will define an
event first so let's say we are writing
over here on click and we'll call a
function on button click fine so let's
say a function name is going to be
message
and save it now fine what we are doing
here is we are asking the system to call
the message function on clicking this
particular button let's define this
message function in a JavaScript file
now so here we are in a Javascript file
now we need to create a function named
message fine so we'll write here
function
message and this is the Syntax for
creating a function in JavaScript now
we'll write over here alert
inside alert will write button
clicked fine so here we have this
message over here now this alert is a
method present in JavaScript for
creating pop-ups save the program and
now click on the button over here you
can see we have a pop-up here which says
button clicked you can see the message
right over here now
the number of such things we can do with
JavaScript is uncountable let's move
ahead and we'll see another method of
using JavaScript with HTML the internal
script method we can use for this this
method is useful if we want to use
JavaScript for a particular file or a
particular tag we can write a script
code directly into a HTML document
usually we keep the script code in the
header section of the document using the
script tag otherwise there is no such
restriction and we can put a source code
anywhere in the document but inside the
script tag so we'll move back to HTML
file and we'll create another button
over here this time we'll use the
internal script tag to add functionality
to it fine so we'll move to the body
section and here we are going to create
a button so we'll use the break tag
first
again a braid tag now we are going to
create a button
then the button name is going to be
internal save it and you can see we have
this internal button over here as well
click on external and you can see we are
getting a message click on internal you
can see nothing is happening as of now
now to add functionality to this button
we need to add an even first so we'll
move inside the button tag and we'll get
right here
on let's say mouse over so this is
another event we have in JavaScript
we'll see what this event can do in a
while so we'll write over here
the function name so let's say the
function name is going to be internal
for this particular button save it now
and now what we are going to do is we
are going to define the JavaScript part
fine
we'll move to the Head section of our
HTML document and we'll write here
the script tag will remain the same in
both the cases here you can see we have
defined the srcn type but here what we
are doing is we are using it internally
so we'll create the function over here
only
so we'll write over here function
internal and this is going to be the
body of this function and we'll write
something over here inside the alert box
so let's say we are writing over here
internal
Crypt tag fine
save this program and move back to the
browser now you can see the moment we
take a mouse cursor over this internal
button a pop-up will appear with the
message internal script tag you can see
the message over here fine this is
because of the on Mouse over event we
used
so guys we went through both the methods
of adding JavaScript to an HTML document
I hope you guys got it although
JavaScript is a very long topic to
discuss it is a language and if you want
to learn it then you can go through our
Channel and find the JavaScript playlist
here before we move on and start
creating the layout of any web page
let's discuss what a layout is a layout
refers to the arrangement of things in
HTML a layout refers to the arrangement
of elements in a way to make the web
page look more neat and clean to the
user
creating a layout also allows us to
manage the content present on our web
page more effectively and efficiently
you can think of it right a well-planned
website is easier to manage and edit if
we have an idea about all the sections
present on a web page
we have used the header and footer text
before along with some more tags like
nav and section to create the layout of
a web page this time we are going to use
the table tag to create a layout and
then we'll use the div and spend tags as
well for the scene so we are going to
use two different methods for creating
the layout of a web page we'll use a bit
of CSS as well to differentiate between
the different sections of the web page
so let's move on to the programming part
directly and we'll create a first layout
a question May pop up in your mind why
are we using tables for creating the
layer it is because tables are already
arranged in columns and rows so we can
utilize these rows and columns in
whatever way we like so let's understand
it with the help of an example now if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
so what we'll do is we'll move to the
body tag of a HTML document it will
remove this H1 tag from here and now
we'll write here
table so we are going to use the table
tag first now let's style this table a
bit we'll write over here width width is
going to be let's say 100
and then we'll Define the Border as 0
fine
so we have used these two CSS properties
for the stable tag here now close the
table tag and you can see we have the
whole table element here now inside
table tag we need the table row fine PR
tag we can say so we'll write here TR
now inside TR we need the table data tag
to mention the data inside the table
so what we'll do here is we'll again
style this table data column or we can
say table data tag so we'll write call
spend calls pen is going to be 2 and
then we'll write
style fine we are going to style the
background color over here so let's say
the background color for this is going
to be
fine so let's use green yellow instead
of green
and now inside the table data we need to
mention a heading so we'll write over
here H 1 and inside this we'll write
this is the
title of a
web
page fine now save this and you can see
over here we have this division or we
can say block with the heading this is
the title of a web page so if I increase
the size of a browser you can see this
is the title of a webpage we have this
over here fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to come out of this table data and
table root tag because we are going to
use another table row tag for another
section of the web page so we are going
to write here
TR
now close this TR tag let's style this
as well so we'll write here we align
and we are going to align it to the top
fine save it now now we have another
table row
so we'll write over here table data
again so we'll write here table data
now inside table data we need to style
this table data tag so we'll write over
here
Style
and will write
width again so width is going to be 100
for this
and then we'll write over here
background color so background color is
going to be
let's say Aqua let's change this
background color a bit from here you
know we can do it in visual code so
let's change it to this the RGB value
will change for this background color
now we have to close the table data tag
as well so the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to put the content
inside this
so we'll write over here
inside the
bold text so we'll mention B over here
let's say this is going to be the main
menu
so we have this bold over here now we
are going to use the brake tag again
so we'll write over here this save it
now and you can see we have this main
menu present over here fine so you can
see
now let's do one thing what we are going
to do is we are going to mention here
100 percent the width and save it now
let's see if this makes a change and you
can see now both the divisions have full
width of the web page fine so the next
thing we are going to do is
we are going to do HTML and then of
course we are going to put a break over
here
then we'll write here CSS again a break
we need
then we'll write here
python let's write each of them in
capital letters so we are again for this
as well then we'll write here
JavaScript
are again so this is basically the
content of a web page save it now and
you can see we have this main menu
present over here fine
now we are done with this table data tag
as well so let's move on and we'll
create another table data tag inside
this same table row so what we are going
to do is we are going to cut this
section in two different parts the left
part is for the main menu and the right
part is for the
other things fine so let's Zoom it out
again and we are going to use
the table data tag here again
so
we have this table data tag and now what
we are going to do is we are going to
style it we are going to write here
inside this style so let's say
background color we are going to mention
so let's mention any color over here
we'll write you purple and then we'll
change the color from here
let's make it light purple and save it
you can see nothing is happening over
here on the browser or you can see this
purple color over here it's smaller in
size as of now right so let's do one
thing
mention the height and width as well for
this particular block so we are going to
write here after this
width is going to be
100 pixels
and then we'll write here
height is the height is again going to
be let's say 200 pixels fine for this
box and
we are done with it so let's mention
over here something
so let's say we are writing over here
tutorials
present in the website find all this
thing refers to the content we have in
our website so save it now so you can
see we have two sections present over
here in a website for this particular
section we have the main menu sections
and then we have the tutorial section as
well so now let's do one thing let's
move back here again and now what we are
going to do is
we are going to add another table Row
for the footer section for the bottom
moves section of a web page so we are
going to write here t d
again then we need call span call span
is going to be 2 again then we'll write
here
Style Style
will mention the background color
background color is going to be let's
say
right this time
let's change the color a bit because we
want light colors so let's choose this
color over here and you can see it over
here it's
not completely visible but it is here so
let's do one thing let's
mention something inside this box as
well
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here
this and now inside this table data we
are going to use a paragraph tag so
inside the paragraph tag let's write
something so let's write copyright
because this is always mentioned over
here so let's say we are writing of a
copyright
ABCD save it now and
here you can see we have copyright
written over here let's put it in the
center for that we need to move back to
the style attribute and we have to write
here
text align at the center save it now and
you can see the text is aligned at the
center now you can see the layout of
this webpage we designed this layout
using the table tag and we have all the
tags present within the table tag we
have the table row table data tag and we
have the table tag as well so this is
the complete layout of a web page fine
let's move ahead and we'll create
another layout this time we'll use the
div and span tag for creating the layout
we'll create a new file for that layout
we'll create a file so we'll move here
and we'll write here how to dot HTML
save it now and you can see we have
another file over here fine let's
do this and we have the HTML code over
here the basic HTML code now we'll move
to the body section directly
and what we'll do is we are going to use
the div tag and the span tag for
creating a layer right so let's open it
with live server once and here you can
see we have this document so let's write
the code now so we'll use the Dev tag
for creating divisions so we'll write a
div style is going to be
the width which is going to be 100 fine
so let's write over here 100 now this is
the main division fine so we are going
to create the layout inside this
particular division all
so we'll use another div tag inside this
particular div tag we'll write here div
Style style is going to be
the background color we have too
set so we'll write your background
color so background color is going to be
it's a blue wallet let's change the
color from here
save it now and you can see nothing is
happening as of now
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to mention the width over
here as well it will take the 100 bit of
whole div tag so we'll write a hundred
percent
and we'll close this div tag fine so we
have this web tag now we have to mention
our content inside this depth so we'll
use the H1 tag again and we'll write
here this is the
title of a
impact page fine
so we have this save it now and you can
see we have this division present over
here it says this is the title of our
web page
and you can see we have this whole
section present over here which
basically refers to the navigation bar
of any website so this is the layout
first now what we need to do is we are
going to create the whole layout so we
need different sections right so we are
going to use the Dev tag again for
creating another section present in a
web page so we'll write here diff now
inside this dip what we are going to do
is we are going to use style first so we
need to mention the background color
again so the background color is let's
see
this this is the gray color
and then we'll write here height of this
section so height is we are going to
write here 200
pixels then we have width as well so
we'll write here width width is going to
be
100 pixels fine
and we'll write here float as well float
is going to be left
now let's mention the data inside this
so that you guys will be able to see it
now what we'll do is we'll
create another division inside this
division
and we'll write here in
block letters or we can say bold letters
Main
menu fine we did the same thing in the
previous layout as well now after this
we'll write here all the languages we
have so we'll write here HTML
then we'll put a Break Tag over here
then we have
CSS
then we'll put a Break Tag again here
then we have python so we'll write here
break again and then we have
JavaScript fine
so we have this div tag over here it's
almost done
now save the program and you can see
float left means the whole division will
float at the left side of the whole web
page so it's basically we are taking the
division and we are putting it in the
left hand side of a web page if we write
your float as right the whole division
will move to the right hand side of the
web page you can see it over here it's
on the left hand side we can also put it
at the right hand side as well
so let's create another section now so
for that what we are going to do is we
are going to use another div tag
so we'll write here
diff
now we need
background color height width and Float
properties again fine so basically what
we are going to do is we are going to
copy it from here
we are going to paste it here close the
div tag and that's it fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to mention something inside here
so let's take the text from the first
layout we have
so let's write tutorials present in the
website here copy it from here paste it
here
and that's it fine let's put it inside
the paragraph there so that it's not
confusing for you guys
save it now and here you can see we have
tutorials present in the website present
over here fine so before we move ahead
let's change the style of this
particular section so for that what we
are going to do is we are going to
change the height and width so height
will remain 200 pixel but the width we
are going to change let's skip it 350
pixels save it now and you can see it
over here fine
so you can see we have this
whole section present over here so we
have put our main menu at the left hand
side then we have tutorials at the
center and then we can keep something at
the right hand side as well
so let's do one thing let's move here
and we will create another section now
so what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this div tag from here we
are going to
paste it here
again now we are going to change some
style so let this time we are going to
write your float as
right
fine
then we'll change the width and height
as well width is going to be 100 pixel
and height is going to be 200 pixels
save it now and let's see the change
over here you can see we have this
layout or we can see say this section
present over here
and I guess it looks fine now at 175
percent we can also use this space as
well fine so let's do one thing
let's create the bottom side of this
layout first and then we'll discuss what
we can do fine so here we are we need
another Dev tag now for the bottom side
or we can say for the footer section so
we'll write a div Style style is going
to be again the background color we are
going to mention so we will write here
background color
background color is going to be let's
say
blue
blue is good and then we'll write here
here is going to be both
and then we'll write here text align
text align at the center for aligning
the text to the center of a division now
inside this we are going to use the
paragraph tag again and we are going to
write here
copyright ABCD save it now and move back
to the browser you can see it's present
over here
now you can see many things are wrong in
this particular layout so how we can
correct them what we can do is we can
increase the size according to our needs
so let's increase the size of these
sections a bit and we'll see if it works
or not so let's change the color for
this section first let's make it red and
now we are going to change the width of
this particular
section save it now
and you can see it's greater in width so
it went down now what we need to do is
we need to remove the width by a bit so
let's write here 350 pixels
save it now
let's see and it's a bit more
again and now we'll write here 300 let's
see if it's working
and you can see it works fine now it
looks fine now right so what we can do
is we can change the width of each
section according to our needs that's
how we can create the layout of any webp
so guys here we have seen two different
methods of doing the same thing we
created two layouts one with the table
tag and the other with the div and spend
time in my opinion the letter method we
went through is a bit simpler because
the only thing we need to keep in mind
while working with the div and span tag
is the area fine we need to keep the
width and height of any division in mind
if we are clear with that then we can
create the layout very easily so that's
why we prefer the letter method to
create layouts for a web page before we
discuss these two attributes in
particular let's go through the
definition of attributes okay
attributes in HTML provide additional
information about an element
for example the height and the width
attribute in HTML are used to define the
area any particular element will take
over on a web page
today we'll be discussing two different
attributes the ID and the class
attribute let's go through them one by
one and then we'll see the difference
between them
let's discuss the ID attribute first
this attribute is used to make an
element unique we can't have multiple
elements with the same ID in HTM this
attribute is used when we want to make
certain changes to a particular element
so let's understand this with the help
of an example what we'll do is we'll
create a div tag first and try to make
some style changes on it with the help
of an ID so we'll write here inside the
body tag
let's create a division so we have to
use the div tag for that now what we
need to do is we are going to define a
heading inside this div tag so let's say
we are writing over here this is heading
one fine
now save it and you can see the heading
over here on the browser now what we are
going to do we are going to give it an
ID first so for giving an ID we have to
move to this div tag because ID is an
attribute so we'll write here ID now use
some specific name for ID so we'll write
here
division one keep one thing in mind that
this ID attribute is case sensitive fine
now save it and you can see no change
over here on the browser because we are
going to use this ID attribute in a CSS
part
now we have a div tag here with an IDs
division one
so we'll use this ID in the CSS part to
make some style changes
to this particular element so we'll move
to the CSS file so here's a CSS file now
what we'll do is we'll write over here
hash
equation one fine so let's check it out
if the ID is fine so you can see a ID
name is division one over here I already
told you that ID is case sensitive fine
so keep this thing in mind guys now
let's make some style changes to this
particular element so we'll write here
background color so let's say the
background color is going to be aqua
we are going to define the height height
is going to be 100 pixels then we have
the width as well width is again going
to be let's say 200 pixels and then
let's say we are going to use the Border
property so border is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and let's say
black in color fine choose from over 300
in-demand skills and get access to 1 000
Plus hours of video content for free
visit skillup by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
so one thing to keep in mind is while
using the ID attribute whenever we use
this attribute we need to use the hash
symbol to access it you can see it over
here we have this hash symbol written
before the ID
now save the program and you can see the
change over here on the browser let me
zoom in a bit for you guys so I guess
this is visible now
using the ID attribute is easy right
you guys might be wondering if we can
use the div tie here as well in the
style sheet yes we can but what if we
have more than one div tag or we can say
div element present in a HTML document
using the div tag will change the
styling of each div element present on
the web page till now in the previous
videos we were using the element name
right so from now onwards we are going
to use the ID or the class attribute for
making style changes to a particular
element So to avoid such circumstances
of not accessing all the elements at the
same time we are accessing one single
element with the help of ID attributing
right I hope you guys got it so moving
ahead let's discuss the class attribute
as well
what we'll do first is we'll add some
more division in a HTML document for
using the class attribute so let's move
back to HTML document and we'll write
here
div now we are going to create some more
division so we are going to use the h2
tag again and we'll write here this is
heading
to 5 so let's copy it from here and we
are going to create some more
headings over here so let's change the
heading names in here as well we have
heading 3 and heading 4 save and you can
see we have three more headings right we
have heading two heading 3 and heading
4.
let's assume a scenario now we have
already styled the first attribute or we
can say the first division using the ID
attribute the ID is unique for this
element right so let's say we want to
make similar style changes to heading 2
and heading 4. heading 3 we want it as
it is so we are left with three options
now we can either use the ID attribute
with each heading but this will take a
lot of time right
another thing we can do is we can use
the tag name but there's a problem with
that it will make style changes to all
the div elements present on the web page
what we want is we want similar style
changes but in two headings only in
heading 2 and heading 4 heading 3 we
want to leave it as it is fine that's
where the class attribute comes into
play this attribute is used when we want
to make certain changes or we can say
certain styling changes to a group of
elements By changes we mean similar
changes to use this class attribute we
need to write here in both the div tags
so we have to write here
plus let's say class name is class 1 for
this Dev Tech and we want to make
similar style changes in heading 4 as
well right so we have to give similar
class name here as well so let's say the
class is class 1 for this div tag as
now we have two elements here with the
same class let's use this class name in
the CSS file now to make style changes
in both the elements so save the HTML
part 1 move to the CSS file and to
access a class we use the dot operator
or we can say we use this DOT fine then
we have to write the class name so our
class name is classroom and then inside
those curly braces we'll write a CSS
properties so the difference between ID
and class attribute is this for ID we
are going to use the hash symbol and for
class we are going to use the dot signal
keep this thing in mind next now we are
going to make certain style changes so
we will write a background color
background color is let's say yellow for
this fine so there's a spelling mistake
over here we'll write a yellow then we
have height height let's keep it same so
we'll write 100 pixels then we have
width which will also keep the same
we'll write here 200 pixels and then we
have border so let's change the Border
property here we'll keep it 2 pixel
instead of solid we are going to write
here dashed and let's say the color is
going to be black fine
save the program and you can see we have
similar styles for both the elements now
heading to and heading 4 have the same
color border and almost everything right
heading 3 is as it is
now the difference between the ID and
class attribute is that an ID is only
used to identify one single element in a
HTML document IDs are only used when one
element on the page should have a
particular style applied to it however a
class can be used to identify more than
one HTML element I hope you guys must
have got an idea by now about what these
attributes are and where we should use
them so these attributes are also used
in JavaScript as well along with the get
element by ID and get Elements by class
name methods you guys will understand it
when you go through the JavaScript part
you can find JavaScript videos here in
this channel only you can go through
JavaScript once you are done with HTML
and CSS so I hope you guys got what we
learned today HTML is used to create the
layout of any web page by layout we mean
the structure of a web page today we'll
be creating the layout of a job
application form where the user can
apply for a job let me quickly take you
through what we are doing today and then
we'll see how we can do it so here we
are on the landing page of our
application form you can see here that
we have a bunch of input text boxes
where the user can fill in all the
required information to apply for a job
we have to style this web page to make
it look more attractive to the user
obviously we'll be using some CSS for
that and you'll learn everything we are
doing in this video so here you can see
we have the column for first name last
name then we have email job rule address
City pin code date of birth and a CV
portal so here the user can choose a
file to upload from then he can apply
and on clicking on apply now you can see
we have this pop-up which says please
fill out this form we'll go through
everything in this tutorial so please
watch the video till the end and you can
post all your queries in the comment
section will definitely help you out so
let's start creating this layout for
this we'll move back to our HTML
document here we have a HTML document
and we'll start writing our code here
only the first thing we are going to do
is we are going to create a div or we
can say a container so let's use the
class attribute first let's say the
class for this is going to be container
we'll close this and here we have a
container fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create the Box first so for
that we have to write here
div
and again we have to use another class
for this the class attribute we are
using this is because of the CSS part we
are going to style each element with the
help of ID or class or the tag name fine
so first of all we'll write a class
let's say the class name is going to be
apply box and then we'll move inside
here and we have a heading there so
we'll write here H1 and inside H1 we'll
write
stock application
fine so let's go through the form first
so here you can see we have written job
application here now what we are going
to do is we are going to write this web
over here you can see the font for web
is a bit smaller so let's write the code
for this as well we are going to write
here after this job application we are
going to use the span tag again and then
we'll write a class class is going to be
title and let's say small fine
we'll write something inside here so in
Brackets we have written web over here
fine so here we have the title of a
application form save it now and here
you can see we have job application Web
written over here we are going to make
this one smaller on the CSS part where
we are going to style this particular
with the help of class attribute so
let's move ahead and now what we'll do
is
we'll create another form inside this
div tag so we are going to write here
form and then we are going to write a
action we are going to
let it be there and now we are going to
create another div inside this form tag
so we'll write here div then class we
are going going to use
form container fine so this is a class
name
and let's do one thing so we have this
div tag over here we are going to use
another Dev tag for each input box we
have so we'll write here
class class is going to be let's say
form
control fine
so keep this thing in mind we have
different class name for each div tags
we have used till now don't get confused
in this part so the next thing we have
in application form is
the label you can see here we have the
label as first name here fine so let's
use the label tag for this so we are
going to move back to our HTML document
and we are going to write here
label
so we'll write your label is for
first name fine so this is
the label then we have the label as
first name fine so this is the label for
a input box now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
here input now we are going to use the
input
tag fine for a placeholder or we can say
for a text box then we'll write here id
id is going to be
post name
and then we have another attribute over
here as name as well so we'll write here
name as
again let's say
first name for this
text folder or we can say for this
placeholder or textbook whatever we can
say now we are going to use the
placeholder attribute placeholder is
going to be
enter
post name fine
so we'll use this and then we'll write
here at the end
click y we'll discuss what this required
property will do in a while so let's
close this input tag for now save the
program and you can see we have a first
text box over here with the label as for
its name and then we have this text box
where the user can enter the first name
you can see we have a pop-up here which
says please fill out this field this is
because we have used the required
attribute inside the input tag fine
so let's move back to a application form
here and you can see we have several
text boxes over here right we need to
add all of them first fine so let's do
one thing
let's move back here and we'll add all
the text boxes first so the next text
box we have to add is for the last name
so we are going to use the same proceed
we are going to use a div tag for that
now we have to come out of this Dev tag
first and then we have to write here
another
div tag fine so div we are going to
write here and we are going to write a
class plus is going to remain the same
for all the div tags remember this is
the div tag for first name so we have
the class name as form control over here
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here we are going to use the same class
for all the text boxes so that we can
later style them at once fine
so let's right here inside this div tag
we are going to use the label first
again and we are going to write here for
last name label is for last name
then we have
lost
name over here fine
now we are going to use the input tag
again for the text box we'll write a
input
ID is going to be let's use some space
over here to make it more cleaner to you
guys so we'll write here ID as last
underscore name
then we have name is
last name again then we have
placehold inside placeholder will write
enter
last name fine
so we'll use the required attribute here
again so we'll write here
required
and that's it we are going to close this
input tag save it again and you can see
we have this last name present over here
on a browser so this is the label name
and this is the text box seventh thing
we are going to do for each text box we
are going to add now the next text box
we are going to add is for a email
address fine so we'll write here again
div class is going to be
form
control and
that's it inside this we are going to
use the label tag again we are going to
write your for
and level is going to be there for email
then we'll write here
email this is a heading and then we are
going to your user input so input inside
input we are going to use the type
attribute because we are going to write
here email because this is where the
user will enter the email so for that we
are going to use the type attribute and
the type is going to be email Phi fine
next up we will write a id id is going
to be email and then we have
name again as email and finally we have
placeholder so we'll write here
and
email
and then we'll write here
required fine
next thing we are going to close this
input tag save the program and you can
see we have the text box and label for
our email as well
so again we are going to use the div tag
this time we are going to use it for
another text box so we'll write here div
class is for
control and then we have inside this we
are going to write here label label is
going to be there for
let's check it out once so after email
we have a job fine so the label will
remain the same but instead of input tag
we are going to use the select tag
because we are going to provide options
to the user so you can see we have four
different job roles present over here we
have react node.js full stack and fronti
so let's see how we can do it we'll move
back to HTML document and we'll write
here label for as
job rule fine so we'll write here job
underscore role
and we'll write here
job fine
after label we are not going to use the
input tag again we are going to use the
select tag fine so we'll write here
select
and then we'll write here id id is going
to be
draw underscore rule fine
then we'll write here name name is going
to be job rule again
and we'll write here
all right fine
that's it so we are going to put some
options inside this
so we'll use the select tag here and we
are going to use option fine so we'll
write here
option option is attack
then we'll write here value the first
value is going to be
select job role so this is what we want
the user to see when he opens the
top application form so we'll write here
select
job role
that's it then we have another option so
we are going to use another option tag
for this we are going to write your
value as
react and the value is going to be a
react
fine
save it now and you can see we have
another text box or we can say select
box here for job rule click on it and
you can see we have two different
options select job role and react over
here similarly let's add other options
as well what we'll do is we'll copy this
from here
we'll paste it four times and we are
going to change the values here after
react what we have is
node fine so we'll write a note
instead of this we are going to write
here no dot Js
and then we have
full stack so we'll write here
full stack developer
and we are going to change the value as
well so we'll write here
full underscore stack and then we have
at the end front end so we'll write here
front end and will change the value here
as well we'll write here
front and developer
fine save it now and click on this job
role again you can see we have four
different job rules present here we have
react node full stack and front-end
developers fine so this thing is working
fine
now let's do one thing
what we are going to do is we are going
to create another Dev tag because we
have another
text box over here you can see this is
different from other text boxes so for
this we are going to use the text area
tag fine so let's do one thing let's
create another div tag here
so you can see it over here that this is
different from other text boxes so we
are going to use different class for
this so we'll write here class class is
going to be let's say
text area
control
and then inside this depth tag we have
to put the label for address
so we'll write here label for
address and
the label is going to be address fine
save it now move back to a HTML document
and you can see we have address written
over here now let's use the text area
tag for this so we'll write here after
this
text area this is a tag we are going to
use the ID attribute again ID is going
to be
address
then we have the name as
address and we have
the row attribute fine so we'll write
here row row is going to be 4
and after this what we are going to do
is we are going to use the calls as well
so we'll write your calls calls is going
to be let's see 50 columns fine so four
rows and 50 columns for this particular
text area of us then we'll write here
placeholder placeholder is going to say
enter
address
and after this we'll write
required over here because address is
mandatory fine close this and here we
have the text area element present over
here save the program and you can see
the text area over here it looks
different right we can write anything
inside
so the text area is here
now let's move ahead and we are going to
create other text boxes we have in our
application form so let's
move back here and you can see we are
left with City pin code date of birth
and upload your CV fine so let's create
the text box for City now
now city is the same text box as we had
for other text boxes like first name and
last name so we are going to use the
same class for this text box so we are
going to write here div class is going
to be
which class we used previously so we
have used form control so we'll write
here
form underscore control
and after this we are going to use the
label first so we'll write a label for
City fine so we'll write here City now
the label is city with C Capital save it
now move back to the output and you can
see we have City present over here now
we are done with the label tag so the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to use the input tag again now for
this we are going to write here
input
ID is going to be City
then we have
let's do it the same way as we are doing
for others then we have name as well
name is going to be City again
then after name we have
placeholder so we are going to write a
placeholder inside this we are going to
write enter
CT name
fine
and at the end we are going to write
here required
that's it
close the input tag save it now and you
can see the text box over here on the
browser which says enter city name
everything till now is working totally
fine so let's move ahead and we are
going to create another text box for pin
code fine so we'll write here
dip class we are going to use the same
class classes uh
form control
fine
now inside this div tag we are going to
use the label tag again label is for
PIN code
and we have to write here pin code again
we are done with the label let's move
ahead and we are going to use the input
tag again
for input we are going to write a type
because a pin number is always numeric
we are going to specify type as number
then after type we have id id is going
to be
pin code after ID we have name as pin
code again
and we have to use the placeholder
attribute here so we'll write here enter
pin code here
and we are going to write
required here again so we are done with
the PIN code as well so here you can see
it works fine now let's move ahead and
after pin code what we have in our
application form so let's move back and
here you can see after pin code we have
dob which means date of birth
or we can
just try it here anything
so you can see we have date of birth as
well so one minute let's close it and
you can see 10 119.99 so let's see how
we can create this fine using HTML only
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1000 plus hours of
video content for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so we are going
to use the div tag again this time we
are going to do it for date of birth so
we'll write here diff class will remain
the same as
form control
and inside this we are going to write
here
label label is for
date then we have to write here D
who
B fine
so save it now and let's see if it's
working or not you can see we have dob
present over here now it's time to add a
calendar to a HTML fine so we'll write
here
input

say the value is going to be
2022 and then let's say
today's date fine 24
or
fine save it now and you can see it says
2020 to 2405
let's do one thing we are going to write
here
type type is going to be
date
and then we are going to write here ID
as
date again
and after this we have to mention name
as date fine
we are done with it save the program and
you can see it says DDM why why
so we have
to mention here
0 5 and
24 save it now and you can see it says

fine let's change it to 1999
save it now and you can see we have a
calendar over here we have here since
1999 we can use any of them you can see
we have here still 20 20.
and it's going on for you fine so this
is how we can add a calendar using HTML
we have to mention the type as date and
that's it we are done fine
now let's move ahead and we are now left
with this particular thing we have to
create an option where the user can
choose a file from his system and he can
upload it fine so let's create this as
well we'll see how we can do it
now what we have to do is we have to use
another div tag for this fine
so we'll write a div
class is going to be the same so we'll
write your form
control
and after this sum of the part will
remain the same will write here D or we
can say label for we'll write here
upload
and label is going to be upload here
fine
we are done with the label now what we
have to do is we have to use the input
tag again
so we'll write here input
and then we have the type as file
and after this we have
ID as upload and name as
upload fine
we'll write here required once again
and that's it fine
to save it now and let's check if it's
working you can see we can choose a file
from it click on it and it will let you
choose any file from your system fine
now we are almost done with the
application form the last thing left now
is the apply Now button let's create
this button now and then we'll be done
with this particular application form
complete fine so we'll write here after
this div
we have to define a class for a button
so we'll write here button
container
now after this we are going to write
here button we are going to use the type
attribute
button type is going to be a submit
button
so we'll write here apply
now fine
we are almost done with it save the
program move back to the browser and you
can see we have our application form
here the complete application form the
HTML part is done we are done with the
structure now we know that how the form
will look like the form will contain all
the information about the first name
last name email job role of the
candidate address City pin code date of
birth and an option to upload the CV
fine then the user can click on apply
Now button and you can see on clicking
apply now you can see it says please
fill out the speed this is because the
required attribute we used in the input
tag fine let's move to the CSS part now
and we are going to style this according
to our need so here we are in a CSS file
let's see what styling changes we have
to made in our application form first of
all you can see the background here we
have two different colors present in the
background we'll see how we can manage
them then we have this container which
is for the application form and you can
see everything here looks completely
perfect and in this application form we
are creating right now it looks a bit
confusing right so let's use CSS and
we'll make this particular form look
like this one fine so let's start
writing our code in CSS so first of all
we'll write here asterisk
this is for the whole HTML document so
we'll write here margin
margin is going to be 0 initially then
we have
padding padding is going to be 0
and then we have
box sizing as border box save it now and
you can see the margin and padding over
here is zero fine now let's style it so
we are going to write here body we are
going to use
background color initially so we'll
write your background color background
color is going to be
hash
3 4
a d f f so we have all the colors
present with us and you can use any
color of your choice now save the
program and you can see the background
color is blue as of now we'll change it
later on I'll also show you how we can
achieve that two different color thing
using CSS so first of all what we are
going to do is we are going to style a
container so you can see over here that
we have a class named container fine so
the first div tag has the class s
container we are going to create the
container now so to specify a class in a
CSS file we have to use the dot operator
and we are going to write here container
now inside container we are going to
write Max width Max width is going to be
900 pixels and let's say margin
margin is going to be 0 and auto save it
now you can see there is no difference
as of now we'll see the difference in a
moment
let's move ahead and now we are going to
Styler apply box fine so now we are
going to create this particular box you
can see over here we are going to create
this box with the help of CSS so let's
do it
will write here Dot
apply
box fine
we are going to write here
Max width Max width is going to be 600
pixel for this box then we have padding
padding is going to be 20 pixels
and then we have
background color as white then we have
margin
margin is going to be
0.02 again then we have
margin top margin top is going to be 50
pixels and after this margin top we have
the box Shadow as well so for box Shadow
we are going to write here
4 pixel and then 3 pixel
5 pixel
and we are going to use the RGB a values
so we'll write here rgba
red green so the value of rgba are going
to be 1 comma 1.
comma 1 comma 0.1
which is sort of black color save it now
and you can see it over here you can see
the box which has some box Shadow
present around its Left Right top and
bottom side fine so we are styling a
application form
so next thing we are going to do is we
are going to define the Border radius
border radius is going to be 10 pixel
save the program and you can see the
Border changing from this side right
from each Corner the border is a bit
rounded
at the end we are going to write here
text align at the send Save the program
and you can see the text is aligned at
the center now
now we have to style this web first so
you can see it over here the font size
of web is pretty small when compared to
this job applications font size so let's
move back to HTML document and you can
see the class title small over here we
will use this class so we'll write here
title underscore small
and inside this we are going to define
the font size font size is
going to be 20 pixels fine save it now
and you can see the change in font size
we could have used this font size
property in the HTML part only but we
are using CSS so let's do it here only
let's do all the styling over here in
this file only fine
next up what we have is we have the form
container class you can see it over here
we have the form container class which
Remains the Same for all the text boxes
so let's style this class as well so
we'll write here Dot
form
container
and inside this we are going to write
display as
Flex We want it to be flexible so we'll
write here
Flex direction as
column so it will be flexible column
wise then we have the font weight fine
so we'll write your font weight as
bold
save it now and you can see the font is
bolder now
after this we are going to use the label
tag so we are going to style all the
labels fine so we'll write here
label and inside this we are going to
write
font size font size is going to be 15
pixel for each label and we are going to
write margin bottom as
5 pixels save it now you can see the
font size is of 15 pixels now
now we are going to use three different
tag names we are going to use the input
select and text area tag means fine so
let's
right over here
input
then we have
select and we have
text area fine
so all these tags we have used for a
text boxes fine so let's do one thing
we'll write your padding padding is
going to be 6 pixel and
10 pixels
then we have the border for each
textbook so we are going to add your
border as one pixel
solid in nature and
the color code is this fine so white we
can say or off white a bit of off-white
we can say then we have the Border
radius as 4 pixel for each text box
and we have the font size fine font size
is going to be 15 pixel for each text
box save it now and you can see over
here
we have every textbook present over here
we have first name last name email and
each of them looks a bit similar to this
particular
application form fine let's style them
again so we are going to write here
after this
input
we are going to use the focus property
over here
on focusing we are going to write here
outline
so we are going to write here outline
color outline color is going to be we
have the RGB values so we'll write a RGB
38 comma 0 comma
255 38 for red 0 for green and 255 per
blue fine save it now and you can see on
focusing on each text box the Border
changes to blue color we can say the
outline is changing to blue color for
address you can see the outline is black
as of now for other text boxes you can
see the outline changing to blue color
fine
now after this input we have the button
fine so we'll use the button container
class so we'll write here
button container
and inside this button container we are
going to write
display as
flex and
we have
to justify content at the
flexing fine margin top we are going to
Define margin top is going to be 20
pixels
and that's it
fine we are done with the button
container as well save it now and you
can see the button present at the bottom
right of our application form
now after this we are going to style a
button as well so for that we are going
to use the button tag we'll write your
button
background color we have the RGB value
for a background color which is 0 comma
47 for green and 255 for fine you can
see the button is blue in color now
next up we are going to write here
border border is going to be
transparent for a button then we have
heading as
5 pixel and
10 pixels fine save it now and you can
see the padding as 5 pixel for top and
bottom and 10 pixel phone left and right
so we are done with the padding
then we have after this
color fine so we are going to change the
font color for this we are going to use
the color property color is going to be
white again and after color we have the
Border radius border radius is going to
be
8 pixels and after border radius we have
the transition as well so transition is
going to be in 0.3 seconds and it is
going to be easy fine
save it now and you can see the
transition over here
save it again and you can see the
transition in button fine
now after this we are going to use the
hover effect on a button for that we
have to write here button and we have to
Define
hover over here
then we have to write here
background color we want to change on
hovering over the button so we'll write
a background as this then we have
border here border is going to be
and
solid in nature and we have the RGB
values with us RGB values are 0 comma 47
comma 250
5. fine
so we have to put the bracket over here
save it now and you can see on clicking
or on taking the mouse cursor over this
button it changes and the background
color is white the Border color is blue
on hoof fine so this thing is working
totally fine as of now we are going to
change the color as well color is going
to be black which is the font color
then we are going to write here
transition transition is going to be
0.3 seconds and
ease out fine
then we have to write the cursor as
pointers save it now take your mouse
cursor over the button and you can see
the transition and you can see the font
color is black the Border color is blue
and the background color is white or off
white we can see fine so the hover
effect is also working fine
next up
what we want to
style is the text area we are left with
this text area only increase the size of
our browser and you can see this is our
text area we are going to style it first
so we'll write here Dot
text
area underscore
control this is the class name we have
then we'll write here
grid column grid column is one
so it basically is Grid in and grid out
so one column and we are going to span
two
so we will write here font weight as
Bolder fine save it now and you can see
the change on the browser then we have
to write here Dot
text area
control space
text area fine we are going to use the
tag name here as well we are going to
write your width
width is going to be 100 percent
fine
now save the program
increase the size and
you can see
the address is over here the width is
completely taken by the text area fine
now what we are going to do next is we
are going to make it look better in this
version as well so we'll write here at
the rate
media
mix width
and then we have
Max width has 460 pixels
and we'll write here
dot text area control
we are going to write here
grid column
will write you one
by
fan one fine
so let's see if this thing is working or
not
save the program and
you can see this thing is not working as
of now
move back here open it with live server
and you can see the
application form is not what we expected
it to be let's see if something's wrong
here
and we have used the form container
class but we forgot to use the form
control class so the mistake here is we
have to write here
for control for this
and we have to Define another class over
here so we have to write your form
container save it once and you can see
it's almost fine so we have to define
the form container class now inside the
form container class we have to write
here margin top margin top is going to
be
20 pixels
then we have
display as
great
and we will Define the grid template
column so we'll write a grid template
columns
12 right here repeat
and inside here we'll write autofit
comma min max
and we have to define the minimum and
maximum over here
fine so the Min is going to be 200
pixels
and Max is going to be
1 fr
fine then we have to define the Gap as
well Gap is going to be
20 pixels I hope this thing will work
now
let's see if this thing is working or
not
save the program and you can see we have
the same application box over here as
well
now one thing we haven't achieved yet is
the background which is of two different
colors we have two different Shades of
Gray over here let's see how we can
achieve it
so for that what we have to do is we
have to move to the body section and we
have to write over here background image
so background image we have to use
webkit linear gradient and we have to
define the
angle here 120 degree then we have the
colors as hash
three one three one three one which is
gray
and then we have to write here
50 percent fine then we have to put a
comma over here we have to define the
second color as well which is hash
4 F5
355 fine which is also a different shade
of gray
then we have to write here 50 percent
so gradients allows us to display smooth
transition between two colors when 20
degree here is the angle and 50 defines
the area the color will acquire save the
program and increase the size of a
window you can see we have two different
colors of gray or we can say two
different Shades of Gray here
now we have created a application form
completely fine you can see the
transition working and you can see the
transition working here as well it's
working totally fine right now let's try
to fill out this formula so let's enter
a first name here we'll write here
caution and we have let's say name then
we have for email
and we have to write here something
like this at the rate
gm.com then we have to select the job
role so you can select a job as node.js
developer then we have the city name
city name is let's say
now try to apply you can see we need to
fill out this field because we have used
the required attribute in almost each
text box right so let's enter the PIN
code here then we have the dob here we
can choose any file from here and click
on apply now you can see we have to
choose any file from here so we'll use
this file
apply now click on apply now and you can
see the form is refreshed we haven't
used JavaScript with this phone so to
make it completely working we have to
use JavaScript with this form for now we
are done with the styling and the
structure of this particular web page
