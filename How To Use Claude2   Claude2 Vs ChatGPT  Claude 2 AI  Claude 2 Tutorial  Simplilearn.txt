in today's digital age the frontier of
artificial intelligence is rapidly
evolving marking significant Milestones
that are reshaping how we interact with
technology at the Forefront of this
revolution are two Advanced AI models CH
jpt developed by open Ai and Cloe 2 that
is crafted by anthropic both platforms
have garnered attention for their
sophisticated capabilities in
understanding generating and
interpreting human language but they
diverge in their core philosophy design
principles and envision applications
chat GPT a descendant of the
groundbreaking GPT Series has become
synonymous with versatility offering an
area of functionalities from generating
creative content to solving complex
coding queries its architecture buil on
the latest advancements in machine
learning enables it to process and
generate text in ways that are
increasingly indistinguishable from
Human output this AI model not only
assist in automating task but also
Sparks Innovation across various sectors
including education programming and
content creation on the other side of
the spectrum clo to by anthropic takes a
slightly different approach emphasizing
safety and ethical AI use conceived with
the intent to prioritize user well-being
CLA 2 integrates Advanced safety
features to navigate the complex
landscape of misinformation bias and
ethical dilemas its design reflects a
deep consideration for the ethical
implications of AI
aiming to foster a safer and more
responsible interaction between humans
and machines in this video we are going
to take a deep dive into comparing these
two powerful AI systems we will be
looking at their capabilities
limitations use cases and overall
performance on a variety of test the
goal is to set a sense of their strength
and weaknesses to see which one seems
more advanced and well suited for
different task as you dive into the
comparison between chat GPT and CLA 2 we
are not just exploring two AI models
models we navigating the future
trajectory of artificial intelligence
this comparison sheds light on the
diverse approaches to AI development and
the balance between Innovation and
ethical considerations and before we
move on just a quick info for you if you
are one of the aspiring python
Enthusiast orml Enthusiast looking for
online training and graduating from the
best universities or a professional who
El sits to switch careers in Python orml
by learning from the experts then try
giving a short to Simply learns
postgraduate program in a ml learning in
collaboration with per University and
IBM by enrolling in this certification
program you will gain experties in
skills like generative AI PR engineering
chat JP explainable AI machine learning
algorithms supervised and unsupervised
learning model training and optimization
and there's much more on the list so
what are you waiting for hurry up and
enroll now and a year of experience is
prefer to enroll in these courses you
can find the course Link in the pin
comment and description box below so now
let's discuss with like what's new with
chat JP or jp4 and then we'll discuss
with the clo
2.1 so let's discuss so this is a GPT 4
and there have been lots of updates to
CH GPT in a few months so the first one
is mobile application for Apple and
Android users and then the AI image
generation with
Del if I show you so here's the
Del and you could explore the GPT is
over here so there are various
gpts and you could see the all the
plugins also here and have a back and
forth voice conversation with an
assistant in the chat jpt and image to
text output internet access with binge
search and then we have access external
plugins and gpts for specific task as
you can create it I have created one of
my
own uh
I think that's the image generator only
yeah this one I have created my own and
GPD store to choose from gpts created by
others and a team plan for sharing GPD
access across the workspace training
data exclusion and more so you could
have the xs4 add team workspace so you
have to upgrade your plan for that so
this is new with the jbt and now move to
the clo 2.1 so enop is again in
discussion with the launch of CLA 2.1
and it has done that so it's improved
content generation coding and other
improved abilities have impressed the
audience however it is still in the
testing phase and will soon be available
in other countries as well so let's see
what's new with the cloud
2.1 so Cloud 2.1 has been launched with
a 2 lakh tokens usage limit and
improvements in comprehension and
summarization and they have also also
added the summarization for legal
documents and financial reports and
there's a 30% reduction in giving
incorrect answers and there's the three
to four times rate of mistakenly
concluding documents and there's a API
tool use also in development and then we
have the improvements to developer
experience so let's move to both the GPT
and the clot
2.1 and now we
will give some prompts to them
and let's see their features
comparision so the first we will ask
them is teex
summarization so we have articles of
Simply learn we will move to its
website and let's copy this article how
to use
clickup
now moving back to
GPT and
here so it will paste the content in the
clo and ask it to summarize the whole
text and the same we will do with the
GPT so let's open a new window for gbt
and we'll
ask summarize the whole
text and we'll paste
it so summarizing long text is where
both Jad jpd and cl 2.1 do well yet in
terms of understanding the number of
tokens clo 2.1 is where ahead with chat
GPT will stop processing text and point
out that the text is too long clo 2.1
goes on so you can see that we have
pasted the whole
article and these are the responses
generated by CL
2.1 and chat
GPD and sometimes clo 2.1 convert the
text when we uh provide the text for
summarization it converts the content
into a txt file to understand it better
and for the chat GPT it directly takes
the content and summarizes
it and in the GPD 4 we can use the web
pilot plugin so it can save like lot of
time for the copying and pasting the
content since it can access the internet
and we can simply paste the URL there
and it will take the article and
summarize
it and now
let's move to the next prompt and check
the next feature that would be image
recognition and let's provide an image
to both the AI
tools
we have an image
here and we'll ask the both High tools
to provide us the
description mentioned in the image
okay
so we'll ask the chat JT describe the
image
provided
and give us a little description about
it
and similarly we will move to clot
2.0 and
here we
will attach the
image but here you can find that for
this comparison it's already been for
chat jbt as it can understand an image
as a prompt so it has accepted and it
has provided the description also but
when it comes for the cloud 2.1 so it
can't take image as a prompt and it's
not able to understand an image and
could not generate a result so here's a
all went for chat
jp4 now moving to the next comparison
and that we'll do in terms of language
understanding so let's get some Proverbs
and we'll get them in Spanish and French
language and ask both the tools whether
they can understand it and give us what
these proverbs
mean so here we have the French Proverbs
let's copy this
one and here we move back to j4 and ask
him
U
if you understand this
proverb make me understand
two let's see what result it provides
and moving back to Cloe 2.1 and here
also we have pasted the same prompt and
let's
see
so here we can see that the GPT has
started
responding and it respond that this is
the French proverb and it translates
literally to One Nail drives out
another and this is again to the English
saying out of sight out of mind so the
proverb means that a new problem or
issue can cause one to forget the
previous problem and now let's move back
to CL
2.10 and here you can see see that it
has responded Us in
the Spanish language only so let's ask
him if
it can make me understand the meaning in
English
so you could see that it has responded
with here is the explanation of the
French PR and the translation is One
Nail drives out another so CLA and Chad
JP are great at understanding foreign
languages and providing explanation or
translations of any language so you
could see that we have asked them the
Spanish proverb and they both have given
us the same answer
so they both are good at
it now let's move to the next
comparision and that we'll do on the
basis of data
analysis and now we'll provide both the
I tools and Excel file and ask them to
analyze the
data so I have one of the files
downloaded from
kagle and let's provide that both the AI
tools so here we have this
file and it's about the Netflix
data
so
so let's first extract this file and
then we will provide the file to both
the a tools and here we quote the
file
now let's give the prompt to the AI
tools so
first comes the gbd4 and we will ask
him can you
analyze the
provided CSV
file and
analyze the
data in it
and provide some
insights from
it and the same prom We will pass it to
the clo 2.1 and let's see but both will
respond to
them so you could see that the gp4 has
provided us with the in insights from
the netflix. CSV file and moving back to
CL 2.1 and it has provided us a error
that messages
1,699 over the length limit so try
replacing the attached file with the
smaller
experts so you could see that chat jpt
has provided the analysis of the whole
file whereas CLA 2.1 is facing
difficulty with the
length limit
here so let's break the file for both of
them and then we'll analyze both the
tools for the smaller file
then
[Music]
so now you can see that we have
extracted the file and the data into a
new file and that to a very small part
of it
and let's upload this file to both the
tools and then compare the speed for the
data analysis for both High
tools
for
so you could see that the clo 2.1 is
unable to get the file and make the
analysis out of it whereas gp4 has done
it
again and it has extracted the data in a
very minimal
time so for this also gp4 is a clear
winner and now moving to the next
comparison and that will be on the
grounds of creativity so we'll ask both
the AI tools to write a poem on the
clear
skies so let's ask
them can you
generate a
poem
on on or mentioning a word clear
skies
for
so on the grounds of creativity both
Chad jpd and CLA 2.1 can generate poems
and stories with great creativity and
deep meaning and they both are equally
creative in this field so we'll rank
them similar in these grounds and now
moving to the next comparison and here
we will ask both the chat boards to
write a code for a Drop Shipping Company
or a Drop Shipping
website so let's ask
them so generator code to create a base
basic website used for Drop
Shipping you could see that both has
started generating a HTML
code and then we have the C CSS file and
here you could see that the clo
2.1 it's faster than their peers that is
the GPT
4 and one thing we can see that the
gbd4 this chatboard is allowing to
understand whole code and it is
providing
commands within the code
also
so both have generated a working HTML
code to create a Drop Shipping website
and that to in a snap and cl 2.1 however
went a little ahead with a better
structure for the website and you could
see that it has also added example of
products and
pricing so here we will give a little
Edge to the cloud 2.1
and now moving to the last comparison
that would be the logical reasoning so
let's ask both the chat boards whether
they can solve a problem or a puzzle in
what time they both will solve
that so let's find a puzzle for
them
okay so we select this puzzle and
let's ask the gp4
first can you sol this
puzzle and the same thing we will ask to
the clo
2.1
so we'll ask them to write the answer
for the
puzzle
so you could see that CL 2.1 has already
provided the
answer and if we get back to chat Jey
it's a bit slow when it's compared with
the CL 2.1
responses so they both have provided the
correct answer for the
puzzle and I did not feel a big
difference comparing both for this
parameter as both have perfectly
understood the question and we able to
give up the correct
solution so this is our comparison and
now we will talk about the chat jbt
capabilities so chat gbt plus provides
access to API support and chat gbt
plugins and it supports more than 80
languages and can understand text inputs
analyze images and files and describe
what is depicted in the images and even
generate an AI image and it can also
answer queries related to any field of
study and it has Mastery in all the
fields and it also can crack jokes which
are funny enough to make you smile
and if you have heard this news that it
has cracked most of the standardized
examinations and it does not respond
easily to restricted text and now moving
to the CLA 2.1 capabilities so it has
earned a marginal pass on the blind
graded test and it has a token limit of
2 lakh tokens and it can have open-ended
conversations and it can also tell jokes
and discuss various subjects and you
could see that it has written the poem
for us and the fictional stories and
when compared to gp4 the writing style
of the this chatport CL 2.1 is more
detailed and accurate so with this guys
