Google so go to Google and type in
samamp download for Windows 11 select
Windows 11 and now you will be having a
lot of links click on the first one
which says download Zam and here you

version which is
8.2.2 and download that one so make sure
that you're downloading the 64-bit
version so that your PC supports it and
there you go the file is getting
downloaded if you press control J or go
to downloads you can see I already have
a file but let's ignore that
let's check the new
one yeah so the download file has
successfully started let's wait for a
few
seconds there you go the file got
successfully downloaded but it is asking
a question let's provide yes it's just
an antivirus one there you go the setup
has already started now click on next
and select all the options by default
everything will be selected press next
so since I already created the folder I
think it will give me a warning yes so I
think we might have to create a new file
go to C then here let's try to delete
the files in the existing folder which
is Zam okay it's a new so let's try to
create a new one
instead so we will create a new folder
and let's name it as new zamp now let's
give the location to this particular
folder
so the file was new Zam let's try to
search for it there you go there it is
click on that okay and next and you can
keep it as default English next and
there you go the installation has
started it might take a
while
there you go the installation is almost
done now you can check on that
particular option which says you want to
start the control panel now click on
that and you can
finish there you go you can check on
that option to start the control panel
