Google introduced the B by directional
encoder representations from
Transformers update a significant
advancement in natural language
processing designed better to understand
the context and variations of search
queries as a result of this update
websites were impacted positively the

backlinks and even the users's location
and search history there's several
search algorithms with respect to
various search engines like Google Bing
and more a few Google search algorithms
are listed below Google penguin Google
Panda Google hummingbird Google BT
Google page rank Google rank brain
Google mobile gon Google Fred and Google
pigeon so let's have a look at them one
by one Google penguin the Google penguin
algorithm is the part of Google search
algorithm that was introduced in in
April 2012 its primary purpose is to
identify and penalize websites that
engage in manipulative link building
practices or violate Google's web
Masters guidelines regarding the link
schemes here is how the Google penguin
algorithm works the Google penguin
algorithm works by scanning websites
backlinks profile to identify unnatural
or manipulative links such as those from
low quality or spammy sites excessive
link exchange and paid links when it
detects such practices it may penalize
the site by lowering its ranking in
search results sometimes resulting in
manual penalties Google updates penguin
periodically to catch new spam tactics

how Google B Works birs methodology
involves understanding words within the

extensive Text data to learn language
integrities but can then be fine-tuned
for specific task such as search query
interpretation or text classification
