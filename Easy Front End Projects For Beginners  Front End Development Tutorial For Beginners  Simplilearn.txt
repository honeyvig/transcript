hey everyone welcome to this interesting
video in javascript
the best way to master a language is by
programming in it so in this video we
bring to you six simple applications
that you can build using javascript
and all of this in 5 hours
if you enjoy watching such tech videos
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
so what's in store for you
we'll first create some simple beginner
level projects like the to-do list app
then we'll move on to a quiz app and
then we'll see how to build a calculator
app
then we'll move on to more advanced apps
like the weather app
the tic-tac-toe game
and finally we'll conclude the session
by creating a snake game application
now i'm sure you're excited to dive deep
into it so let's begin
using this javascript css and html combo
known as call
to do application to do applications
kind of general task manager application
where you can attach add the task delete
the task and uh completed tasks very
simple and sophisticated application we
will start to start working with and
here we start working with our first
very simple statement
that this one is called
[Music]
i like to
we would like to start working with
html by constructing our file will be
well taken care of
so we say
here you will see
class equal to
container
now inside this
we would like to have
some header portion
okay let me see another tape type
and inside the stick type let's say div
my
input
[Music]
next we like to use the spam tag
now
i do not have the function name for new
element but you would like to create it
new
okay
and here i would like to
here i will say
id equal to
list
under this ui tag i'll look for array
and within this you can say sub name
learn
new
tasks
the first item
like that i can have some other items
with me
walk with the dog like that i can have
any number of tasks which is available
to me
okay so here the human tech is getting
closed
and the div tag is also getting close
that's it
okay
so i do not have any css file with me so
i can just create
css
and this i like to import it
here
link ready to install sheet
href equal
okay so i can have
very simple looking field for title
nothing is there
add
which must be a
kind of a button for me or whatever it
is
so it is just a span tag for me
on which i will try to click and perform
some action remember this is not very
good
now here once it is ready i would like
to go ahead and talk about my
main thesis which will help me to make
the complete look and
feel okay thank you
so we're going to start working with the
css now
from my css
uh
we want to basically perform
the edit where
close button i want to create it
and i want to create a close button to
hide the current list items in multiple
activities i have it which i want to do
it with my css let's get started with
css now and with my css i would like to
create some basic effects toward my
application
fine so the step number now i would like
to say a strict
for everything that means for everyone
i'm saying box sizing
border box
basic one
nothing is affected because for common
for all
here i would like to start with my body
now
body
background color
background color i will say lights to
the blue
like to have taken
and
background image it's up to me whether
you would like to use it or not
but i can use
height
600 pixels
next background position
that i would like to use center
next is background repeat
because if i do not have any image i
would not be using repeat so
background
size
cover
looks beautiful
well
going ahead we talk about our container
part
okay
so if i just see my previous code which
is there with me that is called
calculator
here in this app dot app.css
i have option called container
so that was my container i just copy
this
and i use it again here
here in container width i would like to
use 50 percent now
background color remain white
align self
center display block
the margin
of using
120 pixels
auto and box shadow
whatever it is we're not using
adding once again we're not using
box shadow 5 pixel 10 pixel 20 pixels
perfect
there we go
okay
so this is my simple look now talk about
the ul part now
margin
zero
next order left
sorry border left
six pixels
next list
iphone
style hyphen type
i'm saying
next party
zero
let's take a look
better
okay
now
so
few things are used
uh
border left 6 pixels solid tail padding
now we talk about our ul and allied part
okay cursor
pointer
next position
related
next pattern
we just would like to use the pixels
like this
background
light
font size
you can select 18 pixels
transition
for
0.2 seconds
so transition
okay and the last option
user icon select
none
perfect
now looks beautiful
you can see now how the effects are
awesome
okay url like that
now
we talk about our positions wise
properties ur
li colon
over
okay i said
background color
okay
and after that use you will
let's check
all values
background color
again i can do the same
okay
now after this
we are using this called ulli project
i'll be using background
then color
i'm using the same white
text decoration
line through
which is the checked option
okay
now
after that
check before i also want to use it so we
just say
url
checked
before
you will ally check column before
content
after that position
absolute
after that water style watercolor sorry
watercolor i'm just using color white
then border style
solid
then bottle width
border
icon width
then top
10 pixels
left
then transform
rotate 45 degrees
then height
15 pixels
then width
now you see this now
how they work like
that javascript will be applied later on
to make it even more better so we are
just getting it ready for that
okay after that we'll be using foreclose
and just close using position
absolutely
then write
zero
zero
ready
four options we are using it here
okay then afterwards
close
or
in this close over i'll be using
background color
that's called
orange red
and
color
right
this is for close over
then we'll be talking about color header
header will be using background color
then padding
30 pixels
and 30 pixels
color
okay texture line
center
looking beautiful
well this is your header what we have
written it now
after we will be talking about for
header after an input
dot
header colon
after
content
colon
and then display
table
okay
now after this will be using for the
input
not
dot i'll be using rather using directly
input
for input
input i have to make
more better way margin
zero
then water
none
then border radius
zero
then width
75
then padding
two pixels
okay then float left
the next option will be font
i'm using size pixels
perfect
nice
so
this is my text box
okay
now
we like to talk about buttons
okay
it's time to talk about code button so
we'll be saying dot
at
bt
so
once again the conditions that will be
remain same
we talk about call
padding 10 pixels
talk about coverage
say 25
we say background
purple
then we talk about
color
okay and we use float
left
after this four left on what texture
line
center
then font size
the top work on 16 pixels
then talk about
[Music]
and then border radius
over
that's it let's check
awesome
so you see now how exactly is it now
so my to-do list css part is over okay
well after this
we're going to talk about our gs file
which is on the most important area of
your code now here if we close down
everything
and start creating another file here one
is called
app.js
the main calculation goes here
so from this point onwards we would like
to start working with the property
whichever we have created here
on the top of that
we start working here
okay
so
in my css what are the things are
required
that you want to understand okay so we
talk about option called like the
lifestyle forward list items
so
let's start working with
my list
is what
i is less than
node list
dot
length
and then
create element
document
dot create text node
and
i'll just give the value here i think
forward slash
to be created for the new text
okay later on we just say span
dot class name
span dot class name equal to
close
after that
respect
dot
change
txt
and then
my list
so there's a name
called nodelist this is just a typical
logic in fact i would not even say the
function is just a logic which you write
after that
what we need to do now is
we have to start working with our option
called r
close
equal to
document dot get eliminated
for
i press this
click
ok close
dot
equal to
function
and now here we save our
element and now effective
display
okay
and now
next thing so this is for when you try
to click on a close button to hide the
current list item
okay so you can say
got it
test
okay
now
next what we develop the code is
is to basically add a check symbol
okay while clicking on the list item
that means if any items you basically
clicked so what should happen now
so when i so it'll get straight saying
that hey this task is over now so we can
say bar
list
which takes even parameter
okay here i see this
dot
target
dot
class list
and what should happen now
but before that
i just need to check the condition for
if
e dot target dot tag name this way
give it a
then what then
toggle
that's it
okay now you have to basically go and
create one of functions for this
so after that i'm going to create a new
function function
nearly
okay here we say
r
l
equal to document
dot
create element
input value
equal to
document
dot
get element by id
item
dot
okay
and after that we're just calculating
this value we are saying var
t
equal to
document dot create text node
okay here we pass
input value here and i say dot
like this
and here we see if
input value
equal to black nothing is there
then what so in such cases we can say
alert
this is basically the validation for me
this field cannot be empty
okay this field cannot be empty so this
is the first error procedure showing
that else condition
in plus condition
document
dot
get element by id
okay which is the type of item
okay
so
taking about an item which is a type of
so else condition which is saying
documentary element by id
rather than item let's pass list here
and inside this list will say
dot append child
item
okay that's the case now
after that it will start working with
our
span tag now
and the span tag will have its own
condition there
so first we check about this
and now we talk about how fine so we
just say for this man we say
or spam equal to
sorry
document
spell
okay so here's what's trending
dot
yeah so we're now talking about call var
txt
equal to once again
document
dot create text
apparent child
txt
and then
at the same time we'll be using li dot
append child
dot
and then last but not least we have to
basically i trade to all
for
i
equal to
zero
i is less than close dot
length
and
i
plus plus
then
close
off type
i
you're passing it dot
one click equal to
function
and here we are saying var
div
equal to
parent element
okay and
div
dot
style
dot
display
equal to
so so friends we are almost ready now
because our javascript file is ready
after that we'll be talking about how to
include it in html to take a look
well everybody so we are all set now
since we have our application ready with
me gs
really now in our index.html5 you have
to just check
how to apply
this js within my code now so in my
index.html file i'll just go to my at
the bottom of my page
that is called script
script src
equal to
the name call
gs
that's it
okay and let's check about my final
outcome
okay so you can see now the crossbar
automatically appeared
okay with my application let me try to
add another one that is called
welcome
see it
is right
click because it is called strike that
means it is done
if i try to click on this it goes off if
i click it here strike click here
add another
it's also working
delete it
click it again it is unchecked or
unstriped
so guys that's it so
we are happy like finally we have
finished one of our very important
project which is called today
application okay so this time we're
going to develop another very
interesting example
using this html
javascript and css together and that is
called working with a quiz application
so one of the very very interesting
projects will be developing it from the
scratch and i'm sure that you will enjoy
a lot
so what we will do we'll start creating
a new folder now first of all i'm going
to give the name called
html
quiz
now i'm going to create a three files
inside this number one i'm going to say
index.html
index.html
then i need another file that is called
app.css
and the third file i'm going to create
inside this that will hold the script
related part so we are saying script
dot js
so we have total number of three files
ready with us
now from html page we would like to
develop this html tags first
so we'll go to the html and see
so we have got this basic html syntax
ready and from here we will start
working with the div tag first
here onwards deb tag
so within my tip tag
we would like to create
another div tag
okay so the first top level class
to this particular div
see we haven't created a css but we
would like to offer some of the css
classes available here so we see
the class equal to container
now we have got another tab tag inside
this we will set their
id
equal to
question hyphen container
question hyphen
container so that is the name or id of
this div and we say class
equal to height
now within this div tag we would like to
offer some details
but
before that we would like to create some
embedded div tags inside this so we're
going to create another tip tag here
and this dev id
equal to
answer
answer hyphen buttons
so that's the id name and we would like
to offer the class also
class equal to
btn hyphen grid see again i'm telling
you these classes we're just creating it
but we would like to use this
in our css
okay so they are just the normal
classrooms we are giving it right now
now inside this dev tag
we want to offer
some more details
now what exactly the details are number
one i would like to offer few people
like to offer few buttons now
button so we see a button class
equal to btn
and after that we would like to give the
name called answer one
answer one
so that i can have this button class
copied three more times
and now we can change
the names to
two
here three
here four so we have total number of
answers ready with us dev tag is getting
closed here another tip tag is getting
closed here
and now here
before that last step tag is getting
close we would like to create another
div tag
now inside this div we say
class equal to controls
that's another div tag so under this div
we want to offer few more buttons
button here we say button id equal to
start button
start iphone btn
okay and then we say class
class equal to start
hyphen
btn
space
btm
and we say start here
now just copy this
complete line
and put it again
so
rather than giving the start button
we say
next button and class equal to
next hyphen button
next hyphen button
btn and we will give additional property
called height
and here we give the value called next
let me make this s capital
and
next
two buttons we have created
after this
div tag is getting closed
after that i would like to start another
type tag
and if this tip tag we will offer
class equal to score
okay
and here
we would like to start working with this
pan
and here we will say span
id equal to
right hyphen
answer
or answers i can say
so
after that the dip tag is getting closed
and
that's it and it last
the last tip tag is getting closed
which you can see right now we would
like to use the script tag
but one more thing
this div tag i would like to close even
before
so two tip tags are getting close and
this is another tip type which is closed
at the end
and here we want to include the script
tag
script
src equal to
script.js
that's it our html page is almost ready
let's review
and yes i can see some standard buttons
has been created
now we would like to look make gives a
better look and feel to this kind of
buttons and
complete ui by offering some awesome css
okay everybody so we'd like to start
working with css part now
so to work with the css we have to offer
few things
here
we're providing a route
and with this route some basic settings
we are offering it number one
hyper hyphen hue hyphen neutral

hyphen
hyphen hyphen q
hyphen neutral
the value is giving a score 200
after that we're giving call hyphen
hyphen

again hyphen round
this value we're giving us
zero
then we are saying hyphen hyphen here
hyphen
correct
145
so these three values we have given
followed by body
in this body we would like to offer few
details number one
hyper hyphen hue
this we are making with the variable
hyphen hyphen u
neutral
the one which we have already declared
okay now we will try to provide padding
so this padding we're giving zero
next property is margin
module will also remain zero
after that display
and then
after that not display covers and then
instead it is better we can have
flex
after that width
we are providing width almost 100
followed by height
so height we are providing is called
once again 100
okay now we have called justify contents
this justify contents i can say center
perfect going forward
align items
here we can say
center again
now background color
which color you would like to give it so
we can just use this option called hsl
in this we
would like to use this var
again this in this world we are using
hyphen hyphen q
and followed by
100
comma
20
these things and this is style we
wouldn't we would like to use in my
index.html page
so within my head tag
well
in index.html5 how you would like to
prefine the styles we always use
link
link
css
so the value is automatically style.css
but we would like to change to app
dot css that's it
now let's see the final outcome
now it looks better
okay so it is only for the background
nothing else it is impacting
now we want to offer
few more
things into my css it is only for the
body
now we would like to go ahead with the
body dot
correct
body dot correct
we're providing
q
var
and here we would like to offer
iphone iphone raw
and also sorry not wrong just work
correct
and
we can use
body
dot wrong
body dot round
so same thing i'd like to copy
so rather than saying correct
we're using
rock
well these two properties we have
defined
going forward we would like to start
working for the container
container inside my container i would
like to offer width
basic thing that we are providing 800
pixels
followed by
max weight
this max would be 80
now going forward background color

pixels
after this padding
this padding will be 10 pixels
followed by box shadow

so this is we have applied for the
container and container is used
right over here let's see
okay now it looks better
so this is where it comes under my
container
now
we would like to offer the buttons
here in our
css we want to now offer the button
colors
so
dot
btn
hyphen
grid
well
in index.html file so we have a call

this button grid we would like to start
from here

followed by grid
hyphen
template columns
so here we are saying repeat
in this repeat we are saying 2
comma
auto
then we would like to offer the gap
this gap will be the 10 pixels
followed by margin
that will be the 20 pixels
and then zero
this is for my button grid let's see

going forward we would like to apply the
styles of my button
so how my button will looks like in
well button grids we have created it now
we would like to go ahead with the
buttons so dot ptn
followed by the details so

100 percent
30
okay these are the values for
border
followed by background color

details
now we would like to use background
color
so
in background color we will just use hsl
rather than this
so hyphen hue 100

followed by
border radius

or
and for this pull forward
you want to say border color
this border color you would like to use

awesome
so this looks pretty nice
as you can see right now here
well
so
this is how my initial
looks like
okay now i also want to change
this
start button and next button both
so here
we want to use dot
start hyphen btn
and also for
dot
next hyphen bt
common look and feel for both
one size

next font weight
now this font weight i want to give bold
followed by padding
this padding is the 10 pixels
and 20 pixels followed by 10 pixels 20
pixels
next cursor
will be as usual pointers
now we want to go ahead with the
controls
with controls reset display
flex
followed by justify contents
just justify content services center
followed by align
items
and here we say center
and
last option which is left is called
height
this height is a
display
none
that's it let's check this out
well
this will be
visible to me
so the moment i said start then with
other buttons will be visible so this is
how my program is
well my css is all set
well let's get start working with the
script part now
this is a major part of your
main
code development so here we will start
working with this const
and here we will say
start
button
equal to
document dot
get element by id and here it will give
the name called
start hyphen btn
that's the name
like this
i just copy this line
make it available here like people call
start button
we have a call next
button and here
next button
like
here
another one
here we change the name
and give the name call question
container element
container
element
question container element talking
documentation by id
here we give the name called question
hyphen container
question hyphen
container
because this is already there
you see question hyphen container is
already there
we're using
question hyphen container
like this we would like to use one more
and that is called
question element
question
element document good element by id here
will be passing
question followed by
we want to use
answer button element
answer
buttons
element
answers
or i can say answer buttons element
answer hyphen buttons
answer hyphen
buttons
so naming convention must be chosen very
carefully
now we will provide
option called shuffle question because
we want every time the questions to be
get shuffled
shuffled questions
shuffle questions
current question index
shuffle quotients and current question
index
and we would like to provide one
variable call let
quiz score
equal to
zero
so we created those variables
now
once it is done we want to basically go
ahead and start creating a set of
questions for my application
so here we want to provide the questions
so we say const
questions
const
questions
equal to
first question which i would like to
create it here is called question
now here you will see
javascript framework
so which of these
is it
which one of these are which one of
these is a
javascript framework
this is my question now
okay
so i would like to have answers for sure
so here we are providing answers
so what answers we would like to provide
so in this answers the first answer i
can say
like this
here i say text
first will be python
python
okay
python
answer is true or false
correct
false so it will be the false
copy
now let's change the value here i say
django
correct false
third is react
so
i can say true
last i'm keeping it's called
false as usual
so like this we have created a question
and four answers
okay so we're all set now
so
here after that
we want to create a few more
okay
so once again i would like to bring some
questions now
and related answers
so i just copy this
first
so second question
i can say
who's the prime minister of india
so we can have two ounce answers
available
okay
talk about render mode value is called
what true
second we're gonna give the name call
which value is called false
so taken the values like this
and we can take one more
just for the demo purpose
so
like here
next is called what is 4x3
i can have many answers
so i'm just making the first is called
six
which is false seconds 12
like that total we have created
three
okay so we all are set with this
multiple questions
okay
now once it is done we would like to
offer
one function here
okay and what that function would be
the function would be known score clear
status class
function
player
status
class
it takes some parameter call element
and here we will say element dot
class list
dot
remove element.classlist.remove
correct
and once again i copy the same line
raw
[Music]
so we have two options available
call what
write
and what wrong
now
going forward we want to have
few more functions to be attached there
is only one function attached that's
called clear status class
now we would like to add one more
function here
called
function set
status class
okay and here we pass two parameters now
one is called element
and second score correct
two parameters we are passing it down
element and correct first we are calling
this function called clear status class
is a function which we have created pass
element
followed by we are saying if
correct
then
element
dot
class list dot
add
correct
okay
else
use the same option
but we'll try to add
wrong here
so this is how we would like to apply
right or
wrong
so this is a set status class which we
have it now
followed by the most important function
which you're going to use it right now
here
is called
your
select answer so you have to basically
select the answer so this is a little
bigger function
so let's try to understand function
select
answer
here we'll pass e as in parameter
and from here we will use
const
select selected button
selected button equal to e dot
target
number one
second const
correct
equal to
selected button
dot
data set
select button dot data set dot
correct
now going forward
we'll be calling this
set status class function
in the set status class we'll be passing
document
dot body
as the first parameter
and correct
is the second parameter
okay now we are using
array
dot from
and here in this error dot form we're
using answers
button element
dot
children
okay followed by
dot
for each here
we're using
this button
as in parameter
now here
what i will do we are using this option
called
set status class
first parameter will be what
a button
then
button
dot
data set
dot
we can give the value call what correct
okay so this is how we are using this
array
now we'll be
utilizing the
main evaluated value called if
shuffle quotient
dot
length
if
shuffle quotients dot length is greater
than
current quotient
index plus one
then what
then we are saying
next button
dot
class list
dot
remove
and here we will say height so this will
be
hidden
okay
else
else condition says what start button
dot inner text
okay start button dot inner text equal
to
restart
okay
and
next is called start button
dot
class list
dot
remove what we need to remove height
part
that's it
okay and here we're using this option
call if
selected button
dot
data set
equal to
correct
then
quiz score
plus plus
and
document dot
get element by id
here we are providing
write hyphen
answers
followed by
dot
inner html equal to
quiz score
so whatever the score will be after
selecting the correct answer
this will be available to the user
okay
now the next thing which we're going to
develop it is basically your reset state
function
reset state
function reset state
so what we're going to offer here we are
saying
clear status class
document
dot
body
okay here we are saying
next button
dot
class list
dot
add
height
okay
now
we are using this while option now
answers button element
dot first child
so here i will be using answers button
element
dot remove child
here we have a call dot remove chart and
here we'll be giving
answers button elements
dot
first child
so these are the functions are used
right now
we haven't called those functions but
we'll be calling those functions one by
one
but this is something which you wanted
to start with
okay
well
reset state is already set
now going forward we would like to start
working with the show questions so that
the user can start seeing the question
we are saying function show question
show question the first parameter will
be question
and
from here onwards we would like to use
the question element
so we have a call question element dot
in a text
equal to
question
dot
question
now followed by questions dot answer
question dot
answers
dot
for each and here i would like to use
we are passing what
answers and parameter
now
here we like to create a button called
const
button equal to
document dot
get sorry document dot create element
you like to create a button now
okay after that we are saying
button
dot inner text
you to set the value
equal to
answer
dot
text
then
followed by button dot
class list
dot
and here we are
offering
btl
okay now you're saying
if
the condition is
answer dot
correct
if answer is correct
then what
then button
dot
dataset
dot
correct
equal to
answer dot
correct
okay now
the next thing is we're using button
dot
add event listener
attaching the listener to this event
which event
on click event
second parameter will be
select
answer then
answer button element
dot
append child
of what
button
so this is your show questions
followed by what is the next question it
will appear so here we say function
set
next question
next question
here
function
set next question
here in this next question we are just
saying
reset state
the function we are calling it
and saying
show question
and here we are passing this
shuffle questions
and we are passing this current
question index
that is water set
next question is offering it to me
now the last function which is left that
is called start game how the game will
start
function
start
game
and here
the main magic begin here we say start
button
dot class list
dot add
and here
height
after that
shuffle questions
equal to
we have called questions
dot
sort
okay here we say
math dot
random
and
five
we're passing this value
okay after that we are saying
current question
index initially we are giving 0 right
now
after that
question
container element which we have already
defined
dot
class list
dot
remove
height
okay
and then
recalling
set next question
which is a function we are calling it
initializing our quiz score
but the value called zero
when start game is
ready
next thing which you to start the cover
button
so here we are saying
start button
dot
add event listener
here
in this
on my click event
i will try to call this function
start
game
first thing
now next we'll be calling
next button
dot
add event listener
on click
on click
we are using
okay so here we're calling current
question index
current quotes question index
plus plus
and
set next question
that's it
so we are mostly done with our code
script.js we have basically already
initialized there
okay
the values will be
kept automatically
so most of the things are now ready with
us
okay so
our javascript is almost
ready
index.html file is there and app.css is
also ready with this
now let's finally see how my overall
look and feel really looks like it
let's just go here and try to refresh
and check on a button called start
awesome i could see
the first
question appears automatically which of
these a javascript framework
if i select as usual my correct answers
for react
now you can see
is automatically making the rest of them
as a
red and not giving me the next button
now
for the prime minister of india i'm
saying the red moody
great next
and i say
for multiply by 3a12 i said next
and which of those used in mobile up
development flutter
and flask is a flask it says splitter
and now you can see the application
looks perfectly fine
and it gives me the restart now
and that's it so this is how
dear friends your project is now
completely working
and expected as the way it was designed
for when i
once again restart and you can say start
button that's giving me four multiply by
three that means it is one second have
taken
random question so we have decided to
basically develop another very
interesting project in javascript that
is known as calculator application
like you have seen earlier some projects
like in tic-tac-toe you talk about snake
game you talk about quiz application
this time we're going to introduce you
another very interesting project using
this javascript html css
so-called calculator application so
let's get started let me try to delete
first those files which we really do not
need it now
uh
we delete this all
yeah now i will be creating a new folder
now and give the name called
calculator
and in this calculator app once again we
need some new files which is called
index
dot html
and we also need one more that is called
app.css
and another one that is called app dot
js
so these three files required now first
of all i would start with
index.html file where we'll be creating
a template of my code
now
let me go and create this template and
here
i have a god body with me
let's start with the
first
tag here that is called h1
and this h1 we are giving the name
called calculator
calculator
so that will be my h1 heading
after that we'll start working with the
div tag
now within this div
i have to create many classes i may not
have lot many css classes but we can
give some classes here so we can say
class equal to
container
okay so within this div tag we're going
to create a table now because i want to
organize it
so i'm starting with the table within
this table
tr tag
and within this tr tag i need a td
now in this td i need few things call
call
span
equal to three
another value
and here
i want to offer the text box
input type equal to
text
okay input up to text id equal to give
the name called result
that will be the final outcome while
pressing all the different buttons id
equal the result and
class
equal to
screen remember i haven't created those
css classes but but we're giving some
names but later on we can utilize it
while creating those css classes
table data is getting closed let's get
started with another td
now insert this td we need another text
box
input type equal to
text
and here in this input text sorry i
would like to better say button because
i'll be having
buttons
okay
input i'm equal to
button
value
equal to
c
and
on click
equal to i may not have any function
right now but yes i can create
a function but let me give some domain
name here
i'm saying clear
screen
okay so that will be the function will
get called
and after that
class
equal to
clear
yeah so this is my
button tag
after this the td tag is getting closed
after the td tag the table row is also
getting closed
after the table row
which is getting close we're going to
start working with another table row
okay and in this table row i'm going to
create one more td
so let's go and create
another td here
and inside this td i'll be having
another projector we get created
so i'll just say
this is my another button now input
button value equal to
one or click equal to i'll be calling
another function called display
okay
and inside this we're giving the value
call 1
okay
and class equal to member
class equal to
number
and here after the tag is getting closed
okay now you have to start another td
tag here
okay like that we have to keep on
creating the multiple buttons so let me
copy
and paste another table data
now here
again value equal to 2 on click equal to
display
give the value call 2
and class equal to what
number
like that i'll keep on creating multiple
buttons but first check how it actually
looks like
now i can see the buttons like in c one
two three
but yes i'm gonna create few more
buttons one after another
okay so i'll go here
and create few more buttons so this is
where the table data is getting closed
okay i'll copy this
and paste it again
i have to create
the button
like in 3 4 something like that
so after this two we're giving the value
called three
yeah
i'll get the value for three
so val equal to two well equal to 3
display 3
and then afterwards
just giving the value called
forward slash
and here also we're going to keep the
value
forward slash
and here class equal to
operator
operator
after that
you have to do the value call 4
and then followed by 567
so here we give
six after six we're giving call minus
[Music]
okay once again it will be what type of
operator
okay after this
minus we'll be talking about call 7
then we have to have 8.
okay nine
okay after that we're giving for plus
and
display
plus plus equal to operator
operator okay so here you can see the
table data is getting closed and here
the table is also getting closed
and after this table row you can start
working with
another table here
and
after this table row we can start
working with again
td let me have this
again
inside this i'll be giving the option
called decimal which is value equal to
dot and here we get the value called
decimal
okay
now display zero
so after giving this dot to basically
take what the value
zero which we haven't put now
we'll be talking about value called zero
so here
the decimal value we've given it td is
getting close let me have the another
one
zero
zero
so like that we have to keep this now
after that
we'll be once again
taking this
this time rather than giving this 0
we'll be using this call as a button
and value equal to equal
or click equal to
solve
okay and in this song will
okay
so
table data is getting closed
so we will be using another table data
now
so here it will be the button only
okay we will be using
well equal to
multiplication
display
just check and he'll be using operator
okay
so table data is getting close table is
getting close table is also getting
closed here
okay so your div tag is also getting
closed here
okay that's it
okay so that's the only thing which we
wanted to make let me try to refresh and
check
awesome
so we have got
all those
necessary calculator behavior
which
we wanted to
reveal
okay
now our next statement will be once we
are giving this c then we have one two
three
and then forward slash
followed by
four five six will come down
okay so let me check whether we have
used six or not
okay so we haven't used six
so let me check here
four five six
so let me go back here
four five six let me copy this
and paste it later on
before
minus
six
equal to
number
okay so we're almost set now
so we are having this
look and feel
this we are giving one two three four
five six
and after this we have a call minus and
then plus related behavior so we are all
set now and after that we'll be
basically applying the css as well as
the javascript look towards my code okay
thank you
well everybody we are all good to go now
but i just want to first check whether
my
uh this outlook is looking properly or
not see what my expectation is after one
two three forward slash i really want to
bring four five six to the next
and then seven eight nine and again
forward still but i can think this is
absolutely unorganized
so after this when we say
this uh forward slash which we have used
after hyphen
okay your tt is getting closed here
okay so here the tr i also want to close
here
okay and after this tr i also want to
start
another tr here
okay so that i can put them into the
another level now
so under this tr i can use this td now
so after this minus
after four five six
minus once again i would like to start
another table over here
okay so that it let's go to the next row
so here
after td
we're closing this dr
and starting
another tier
okay we're starting another tier after
that we talk about seven eight nine
okay plus
see here talking about seven eight nine
plus here the table is getting close and
it is starting right now like this
see that looks better now
okay but still few more things which i
would like to make it even more
organized but that's not a problem we
will do it a little later on
okay because you can see eight is
missing right now
so
here seven
we copy this
equal to eight
eight
yeah that looks better now so now they
are basically completely organized
so the moment i expect my application
so we have a call
dot here then zero then equal to and
then multiplication
okay so it looks
better now
now i just would like to perform
the overall look and feel
so i need to go ahead and use what css
because without css i really can't
utilize this in a proper way so i have
to start working with a css friend
how to start first we will go back to my
code and here in my css we'll start
working with
font family but before font fabric i
would like to start with the body part
now
body
background color i'm using
that looks nice
okay so
i will be using this app.css
in my html to see the look how it has
been appeared right now so in my
index.html file
on the top under my head section
click
start sheet
okay now see it looks better now
going forward
in my css
we want to use
some h1 correctly so here we would like
to use the h1
text align
center
color
white
margin top
margin top would like to use 50 pixels
this for h1 let's check
perfect so it is now coming in between
next statement will be called screen so
we say
screen
so in this screen we use the background
color
background color gray
and after that border
sorry
border solid
black and two pixels
after that color
white
font size
medium
next width
we're using this
100
then talk about cursor
what are the default cursor is
okay then padding
we would like to save 10 pixels
and then
margin
save auto
then margin bottom
that i'll be using 10 pixels
so in the proper alignment
okay
look
that's how exactly we want that's for a
screen where the exact outcome will be
visible to me
and rest of the details we'll be showing
you one by one and now we'll be talking
about call input
okay
input
type
equal to button
for input type equal to
button
okay
input
i say
background color
change to what
right or else i can say
let's walk
okay
and
when the button is active
what i want
let me copy
and this color should be orange red
like this you can see now how it is
basically looking like it
okay active the color will be like this
okay i'll be talking about color
operators
operator should behave different same
dot
operator
in this operator we are saying
background color
background color orange
okay then padding
i want five pixels
okay then i want color
that should be black
after this i'm using call border
sorry
that border
i'm using this called solid
and then black
then height
height is 40 pixels
then cursor
it has to
for number i want to save the same
option
padding i want 5 pixels
then i need height
of type 40 pixels
then i say color
it looks i want to say called black
then border
border i want solid
black into six for it
black
two pixels
then width
i would say point with i would say
hundred percent
and cursor
once again
point there's one number let's check
awesome so they looks nice now we're
left with few
other type of options like a dot and
equal to
okay that i'm talking about called
decimal or decimal i need to have a
different options with me
okay so
let me try to copy this
paste it and i say for
does it
so for decimal place will be
light blue
padding five pixels color black border
solid
okay black two pixels with hundred
percent height forty pixels five cursor
pointer
perfect
okay looks nice but i have changed the
color to light blue
now
i talk about
clear
okay
now come back
and say
clear
okay in this color
background color is i'm changed to light
salmon
light salmon
padding 5 pixels color black border same
width
height 40 pixels
fine so cursor
pointer
file margin
auto and margin bottom
merging bottom
let's check
perfect now it looks beautiful
okay
now
here after giving these details we're
talking what called equal part dot equal
so for dot equal also i'm just copying
the same
so you recall
background color adding color
just change to
lightly
after this
since it is a equal so we say padding
five pixels is okay color black fine
border fine with hundred percent high 40
pixels
color and cursor pointers just i don't
need to
it's for dot equal and i want
for container
container
in this container width i want 40
percent
okay
now
here padding is 15 pixels
so display block
so first of all width
okay in merchandising to pixels
auto
okay
now align cells
go to
center
okay border radius
border radius which is say 10 pixels
okay now using box shadow
box shadow 5 pixels
black
and padding
so these are details i have it now okay
we have it
background color we are taking it now
align cell
display block border radius padding
and then
writing 15 pixels we have given
i don't need to give it again margin
okay fine
box shadow let's try
awesome so it's looking beautiful now
okay so this is where exactly my
application
works like that
and table when we talk about
everything with
100
okay
that's it
super
so it's now giving me the proper look of
how
my application should be here i can just
see about the container what we have
done
with 40 we're taking background color
let's bring it below
then align
display block
okay margin
okay
and border radius
and uh
fine i think we're all good now
so
that's it so we'll try and implement the
javascript part well everyone so our css
file is ready our html is ready it's
time to just
go ahead and talk about my
final portion that is called gs part
where i want to basically perform some
calculators
now here i just say function
display
function display which takes
val as in parameter and say
document dot
get element by id
here i'm saying
result
okay dot
value
okay
plus
equal to
whatever we are adding it just basically
try to apply
calculation on the top of that
okay there is a function
after that we have another functions
available here called function solve
here in the solve
we just use the value called
x equal to
document dot get element by id
result
okay
dot
value sorry
dot
value
okay and say select
y equal to
perform the calculations for the will be
using one function called
eval
and type
axis and parameter
now the next statement will be again
document dot
get it home by id
result
dot
value equal to
y
okay
now
later on
i'll like to use another function here
function
clear
screen
and here we say
document.
get it in my id
here we say
result
dot
value
equal to
like that
so clear screen
solve
and
display three functions are associated
with me and these three functions
are the part of this javascript file
which i'll be calling it
at the end before
the water tag get closed so here
here
two you can see the values
i will say plus
six
equal to eight absolutely i say c is
clear the screen
six
divided by
2
equal to 3 awesome so friends your
calculator application is ready
congratulations to all so it is a very
simplest form which we have developed
this is your html which is a template
for you this is the css which is your
complete
the area of like how the look and feel
will look like in of this template
beautification and here last year called
js which is smaller logic but really
meaningful
okay
hello everyone and welcome to the
another very exciting project for our
development in javascript that is known
as called weather pro it is in a
continuation to the series of the
previous project what we have developed
in javascript and this is once again a
very competitive project i'm going to
present to you
which is called weather pro where i
would like to offer you the real-time
weather application into your browser
taken from the real-time weather
applications
okay so let's get started with the new
development of our application which is
called a weatherproof
now once again
compared to the previous project what we
have seen these projects were working
more kind of static in nature where like
you talk about snake game you talk about
tick tock toe or other type of games
like an online quiz
where the data was very much static in
nature but we were presenting the data
in the form of more dynamic in nature
this time
this project we are presenting you while
connecting with the real-time weather
application where i'll be making a one
rest api call or else you can say
asynchronous call and since javascript
is working as a what a pure asynchronous
nature you will be enjoying the way how
the javascript can communicate with your
back end
load the data and represent the records
in a very very beautiful manner
so once again we would need this
vs code editor only just to
develop our code and once again
for developing our presentation part
will be using html for
formatting part will be using css and to
make some dynamic update we'll be using
javascript now here i'm going to create
a new file name called index
dot html
apparently i just want one more that is
called app.css
and
another file we need it
and
that is called
your js file so we are saying
app
dot gs5
so total number of three files are
available to us i'll start working with
an html now and here
we'll start
with this
html templates
now here first of all i would like to
load my css file which i do not have
right now but certainly i can use it
okay so i can just say link
area
equal to
style sheet
and href
equal to
app dot
css
well that is my css location
now i just want to create
some
this link area i would better use
inside my head tag that will be the more
convenient place
now in my body
i want to have some of the div tags and
there i can decide where the weather to
be displayed so i can just start with my
div diagonal
with my div tag i say
class equal to
i can just create a class which later on
i can offer
a different size of or different type of
style so we can say container
so we're saying div class equal to
container now within a div tag we like
to use another dev tag which is a nested
one
so this tip will have another class
called
class equal to
app hyphen
title
i have hyphen title
in the same dave tag we can use
this a typical paragraph tag
and here we say weather info
whether
info
now after this paragraph tag
we want to have a text box because i
would expect a client to enter the
detail on which city or for which city
he or she would like to get the details
so we can say input
some properties like id
equal to
search
second type equal to
text
next placeholder
equal to
enter
the city
next
autocomplete i'm saying autocomplete off
the reason because i do not want the
previous value user can see in this case
we can say autocomplete
oh i do not want any autocomplete in
this
okay
now
here it is getting close now
after that we also want the locations
for that i may use some of the png files
and all but right now i just want to
display the details
of the user
like which city he belongs to and
accordingly i can display the records
right in your application
so for that i really need some of the
div tags once again where i can display
the details
of this particular city so i'm just
having this only text box let me go and
go back and check
how it looks
so i have a call into the city so here
i'll be picking up the city and
somewhere down the line i have to
display
the record so
after this div
we can also have some of the locations
to be displayed
so
we can just use the notifications
and
also the location where you want the
details to be displayed
okay so we can use div plus
class equal to temperature value
temperature hyphen
value
okay so d plus equal to temperature
hyphen value inside this i will be using
paragraph tag
and here in my paragraph i will say
iphone
and
this degree centigrade or whatever you
want to display it here
and we'll use
a spandex within this and show
in degree centigrade
that's it
and if you want to define the
temperature description
after this dev tag we can use another
day of tag
and inside my tip tag
i can define the temperature description
okay so we can sit here
class equal to
temperature hyphen description
temperature hyphen description
and within this i'll be using what
a paragraph tag
here i'll be displaying
all the description
so right now that is the only thing
which i want let me check
okay so it's here right now
so now let me try to collect the value
from the client
and perform some javascript tag
within this
okay now it's time for us to go back and
try to bring some of the css features
inside my code now
now few things i would like to say is i
have basically downloaded some fonts
which i would like to use it in my
application and i also have some of the
icons which i would like to use
during my application presentation so
there are some png files which i have
downloaded from the internet just to
bring more beautiful experience towards
my application development well this is
another background image which is called
bg.jpg which i would like to
make it as a background of my
existing
application so i'll start with my css
and see how this css can really bring
some new features to my code well
first thing i need to have a call font
face so to make this font face we are
using this statement name called here at
the rate
font face
and
i like to use font family
font family i'm using
mod select
okay
it is already there with me monster
and the url
what is looking forward for so we are
saying src
url and i'm saying under the
font so we have a file called ttf
okay that is called
bold.ttf that is the file which is there
next thing
so
for every
location i want to use the font family
font hyphen
family i want to use same
monster
and the next thing is like in my body
so in my body few details like
background image
i need url
and in this url we can say
bg.jpg
in my background
next thing is background color
that i needed steel blue
then i need height
i'll say 500 pixels
next your background position
this i needed is center
next is your background repeat
i say no repeat
next is your background size
this i'm saying cover
this is my body part
okay let's check
okay
looks awesome now you see this now this
is how
my weather it was looking like it you
can see like the background looks
awesome now now
next thing we required a container
so we are saying
dot
container
container is a width
width 50
next background color
we're just using white
next we need it is your align itself
that will be
center
display
we block
margin
so in margin we can say 100 pixels
after that border radius
border radius we're seeing 10 pixels
and then padding bottom
this padding bottom will be 50 pixels
then box shadow
this box should be giving 5 pixels
10 pixels
20 pixels
and black
this will be with my content so
index.html file we have called container
now
okay looks awesome now
so this is where exactly the details
will be
okay
now
after this
thesis container we have used
we can talk about called title
you can say
hyphen
title
inside this we will say width
will be 100 percent
then height
will be 150
pixels
then border radius
10 pixels
10 pixels
then we need display
display we need flex
and then we need align items
this align items which is saying center
next we need justify content
that will be the justified content will
be just center
then flex direction
would be column
so this option we're using for our tool
name called what
app hyphen
title
okay so here in my index.html file we
have called div class equal to what our
python title equal to weather info let's
check
okay
so
this is another
we have used that is called app title
now we need to use it for paragraph
inside my app title what should be
alignment for my paragraph
so here
this app title
tab title space
but it should be the class so we are
saying dot
and there also we have to use what
dot because both have to be the class
type
okay
so here
you can see now
there is a difference i forgot to add
dot and now you can see it looks better
comparatively
paragraph
so once again in my paragraph i will be
having texture line
center padding
i want 15 pixels
then i need margin
margin would be zero and
auto
followed by font size
font size
this i'm saying is called 1.2
this position then color
we are giving
hash
value
call 333
okay
now here
okay so some changes in a paragraph
well going forward for the search
because if you remember
we have an index.html file we have a
call id code to what
search so here in my
app.css i have to use
hash
search
okay so this search conditions i want to
use it
now inside my search i need few things
one is called display
i need block
after that i need margin left
auto
margin right
auto
width
i'm looking forward for 5 pixels
height
that i'm looking forward for 20 pixels
then
border radius
i'm looking for four five pixels
then outline
that's called none
there is a border
okay
in this bottle what we can say three
pixels
space solid
okay and once again
see
that's what
let's check
so this is actually the text box
so once again search you use display
block
margin
left auto margin right auto weights 5
pixels
width
padding sorry one thing i said
padding should be five pixels
width
should be forty percent that's why it is
smaller but it will be
forty percent
let's check yeah let's look better now
okay so my text box is now ready i'll be
having some of the details for the
notifications also
so what i need for the notifications
let me go back and create a class for
notification so dot
notification okay
now in notifications i would like to
give some value called background color
and in this background color we are just
giving white
and after that we are saying display
and we are saying
none
this is for notification and followed by
the notification
we're talking about the same
notification
okay and followed by
its paragraph
we are giving the color first of all we
are saying color
color
is basically red
okay or else if you want to give maroon
into the mural
and
after this
the next property we are taking is
called font size
one size we are taking is called 1.2
am
followed by margin
margin we are taking is zero
after that texture line
center
id
10 pixels
zero
so this is for notification p and then
the weather container
okay in my weather container i will say
width
100
sorry
yeah with 100 height
height we're giving 260 pixels
or up to you 250 pixels if you want
background color
this background color we are giving this
call once again white
and followed by margin top
20 pixels
20
pixels this is for weather
container now for the weather icon
whether hyphen
icon
i am saying width
is 100
and height
128 pixels
just to give in a better look
now the next thing we're using dot
weather icon icon
space img
here we can display
none
and uh
sorry display node none i will see
another block
display block and margin
giving 0
space auto
that's for
icon and location icon if i want to give
then
location hyphen
icon
this location icon i can save with same
width height
so
width i'm giving is 100
then
height i'm giving 40 pixels
and then we give this option called
add it
then take pixels
so it's for location icon
now
followed by location icon we are also
giving call location icon img
okay dot
location hyphen
icon space img
here we're giving the value called
display block
display block width
we're giving is called 32 pixels
and then we're looking forward for
margin
margin would be 10 pixels
and
auto
then cursor
so cursor will be pointed for sure
and then we required padding
padding looking forward for 5 pixels
followed by border
border we are looking forward for steel
blue
steel blue
solid
and 2 pixels
then border radius
water
radius
we're looking forward for 10 pixels
and followed by your color
steel
so these are the look and feel we have
to basically offer it for my
current application which i yet to
discuss in my
next development
then i'll be having some small small
properties here
okay
and those properties are nothing but to
give you the details of
like
temperature values so we say dot
temperature hyphen value
okay this temperature hyphen value we
can give it
is 100 percent
and height
making school 60 pixels
okay this is for temperature value let
me copy this again
and i'm giving this temperature value
space paragraph
here
i'm gonna give padding
0
margin
0
then color
which color you're looking forward for
we can just say dark grey
okay for any color which you're looking
forward for it's up to you now but if
you want you can change the color also
to another one we're giving this call
hash
293
okay two five one
okay that is a more perfect color for
this
development now font size
four am
then followed by texture line
and once again center
so this is for
temperature value p
we haven't used much
but you can see now it looks somewhere
in much more better way
okay that is called temperature value p
then you can use a temperature value
span
here
dot
temperature value expand
space
span
and here
remove the additional dot
now within this
span say color
once again save
and font size
this is for
spam
and in the same temperature description
paragraph you can use it
dot
temperature iphone description
description space b
so this will be having the padding
of 8 pixels
then margin
0
followed by color
same color the one which we have used it
earlier
after this color just set texture line
center font size
1.2
this is for temperature description
okay glass which is available for your
location
so let me give the location now dot
location
is space 3
here we can say
margin
0
then padding
0
then color
same color i would like to use
after this color texture line
and font size
and copy
text align center and here we'll be
giving some different value called 0.8
okay and last which is really left with
quality
in that
relative
hair position
i'll be using
absolute
top
from top
i'm using 600 pixels
okay and right
using 120 pixels
that's it
okay so all set
so you can see now
here we have to basically offer the
details how my pictures will be taken
attack so this is what my css now will
be applying some of the css into my
applying the css into my html to see how
it really looks like it
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit scale up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
okay so we have seen some of the css
classes we have introduced
in my html
we have used this uh
autocomplete equal to off then we have
used tip classical temperature
value
okay if you just check carefully we have
used this temperature and there we have
used temperature hyphen
value
but before that we would like to use
some other properties too
okay after this autocomplete equal to
off we want to use
another dev class
okay before my previous date tag is
closed here so here
after this we would like to use another
div tag
div
here in my div
i'll say
class
equal to
location hyphen icon
location hyphen
icon
okay and here i'll be using img
src
equal to what under
icons i'm using the file name called
location
dot png
and alt equal to we leave it as it is
the blank
okay
now here that div tag is getting closed
okay
now there's another div tag is getting
closed here
so two div tags are closed after that
we'll be using another div class for
notification here
class equal to
notification dev class equal to
notification and this step tag is
getting close right here
okay now another div for the weather
condition
another div tag and here we say
class equal to weather hyphen condition
whether hyphen what
a condition
or i can say whether iphone container
whichever so i can say
weather hyper container
under this
weather container i like to use
another tube
for weather icon
tip for
class equal to weather hyphen icon
weather hyphen icon
and within this
i want to use another img
src equal to once again
icons
slash
dot png
okay div tag is getting closed
so after this div tag is closed i'm
gonna use
temperature value
so the temperature value is anyways used
here if you see
raising call temperature value after the
first step tag is closed
you see like temperature value we have
used
after that the paragraph tag
and the temperature hyphen
description b
after the p that the div tag is getting
close
okay and after this we are using div
class equal to location
so we want to use
div
class equal to
location
and within this location
we want to use one more paragraph tag
[Music]
with this hyphen
after this paragraph exists close
this tip tag this tip tag
another tip tag three div tags are
closed
that's it
and at the last
before my body tag is closed
i would like to use
script
src equal to
app
dot
js
that's it let's check
great my application looks pretty
beautiful now
so
this i
want to be display only when i don't
find the weather and the location
anymore so look and feel is absolutely
good and now i'll start working on my
javascript front
okay so let's go ahead and start writing
our javascript code
so in this javascript code first of all
i need few things
uh first thing what i need is call
individual elements or individual
properties of my application i need cost
icon element
i can element equal to
document dot
query selector
and i'll be using the name
call
dot
weather hyphen
icon
okay
now
copy this
now we will call icon element we can say
location icon
call
location icon
here we are saying
dot location
hyphen
icon
now
next i need it is called temp element
we are using
the property call dot
temperature hyphen
value
space
p
next we're looking forward for
desc element which is called description
here we're giving temperature hyphen
description
hyphen
temperature has been description space
what
p
then location element
okay we need location element and we use
dot location
space b
next we need notification element
notification element and here we're
going to give the call
notification
notification
so four properties we have taken so we
are selecting all the elements next
statement what we're going to talk about
see this is statement is all about
selecting the arguments the next step we
are talking about call
get the input field so we are saying var
input
equal to
document dot
get element by id you'll be given the
name called
search which is the name or id of my
text box let
city equal to
blank
next we're gonna keep score let latitude
equal to 0.0 we are initializing this
value and let
longitude
let longitude equal to again 0.0 so we
are getting the coordinates right now
so this is how to get the input fields
next we want to apply the events here we
are saying input
the variable dot
add event listener
the variable what we're talking about
which even list will be talking about
key up
key
up
and what even do you want to apply so we
are saying
function
with a parameter name called what
event
and now we would like to attach the
logic now
we send if
what is the condition
event
dot
key code
equal to
13
okay
then
that means number 13 is basically the
enter
see the key code means for 13 13
represent the enter keyword so even dot
key code equal to what 13 so we are
saying event
dot
preview
default why we're using this because i
do not want my page to be get
refreshed just to avoid this we're using
this and after that we are saying city
equal to
input dot
value
now
you will be using this another function
because i do not have function created
otherwise i have to call the function
name called get search weather and be
passing this as a parameter so we are
going to get
search
whether i do not have this function i
yet to create this
and pass it here as a what
city
and we say
console.log
city whatever we are basically printing
it
okay
so that is the first thing
later on we need to get the data so to
get the data we are just using this
variable name called const
whether
equal to const weather equal to
curly braces
after that we are saying
weather
dot
temperature
equal to this
and which temperature conditions you
want i'm saying unit
of type what
celsius
i wanted a celsius put it in a double
quotes
okay
so next statement will be
getting the details in kelvin i'm saying
const kelvin
equal to value of the kelvin is about
273
and after that
con c ultimately what we need is
we need to interact with our backend api
from where i will
get or receive the updated weather
applications
okay
now to get this i'll be using one very
popular api here that is known as called
openweathermap.org
this is a very very popular app
which
people use it and it's used and trusted
by many companies
clear
so here
what you can do this
open method map.org
so you need to basically first of all
get yourself registered because if any
third party application is interacting
it requires that particular
unique
api key
since
as a visitor you really can't get it
unless you register yourself so i have
my api key with me so i'll go here
it'll ask me for the registration
so
i already signed up so if you're not you
need to sign it there's an api key for
me which i need to copy
and this api key i'll be using it in my
project
so i just use
this property called const
key equal to
to paste my key here
okay
after this pasting the key but make sure
that you rather using my key you use
your key otherwise this application
sometimes won't work
so i'm basically trying to use this tool
name called geolocation
i'm saying if
geolocation
okay in
navigator
navigator as you know there's a browser
object model element
so here we are using
navigator
okay
navigator dot
geo location
dot
get current position
in which i'll be passing the first
parameter name convert
set position
and second parameter will be show error
in case
if any error is received
okay
else
in the sales condition what would happen
i'm using this statement name call
notification
element
you see this notification element dot
style
dot
notification remain dot
get elements by class name
but i don't need this rather i will use
what the style
dot display equal to
block
then i'll be using the same
notification element dot
inner html
equal to
you're gonna use a paragraph
saying what browser
doesn't
support
so you have to enable the current
location of use
okay that's where exactly
so after that we have to basically set
what the user position
okay if the user is having that support
available
so after this
location we'll be just using another
function here
function
set
position
it will i'll be taking
position as a parameter
and take latitude
latitude equal to
position dot
chords chords for coordinate start
latitude
okay like that
longitude
equal to
what position dot
cords
dot
longitude
after this we'll be using this function
called what
get
weather so this get weather will be the
function in which you will be passing it
so this function will be soon seen
i'll be having it defined below but as
of now we are just saying
get feather and in which this we are
passing
latitude and
longitude
that's it
so we have this function name called
what set
position
in which will be passing all the values
okay at the same time
i will be using one more function here
that is called function
not function in fact
i would like to use location
icon the one which you define at the top
dot
add event listener which even listener
i'm saying
one click
second
function
which take
even doesn't parameter
and inside this i'm saying console just
to confirm whether the records have been
taken console.log
hey
just
and
we say get with it
okay once again you'll be passing what
latitude and longitude same i just copy
this
and paste it here
okay everyone so we have written till
here when i try to run my browser
so i should see there is a message name
called show error is not defined
but obvious because this message what
we're writing it here is called show
error
okay this
as a function as in parameter it is not
defined let me define this function
called show error so we are saying
function
show error which take
error is in sorry just take
error is in parameter
now in this we are using
notification
dot
style
dot display equal to what
block
after that once again
notification element
dot
inner html
equal to what
we're just using this as a paragraph
and here
error
dot
message
okay and after that
paragraph
so this is how we are basically writing
it down
and now
see it is immediately asking you
to know your location okay if i say
allow
that's okay
okay so nothing
you can see now it is saying get weather
is not defined because right now the
moment i click on this
so it is saying like get weather is not
defined but obvious because i told you
this get weather function i need to
develop so i get to develop this
function called get weather but before
that i'm using another function called
function
get search weather
get
search weather in which i'll be passing
what
city name
now
what exactly my apa will be in case if i
want to make a call i will be using let
api equal to
now the url will be what
http
colon double forward slash api dot
open
weather
map dot
org now open weathermap.org
sorry
2.5 that is a version slash
weather
okay question mark
i have to take the city dynamically so
i'm saying weather
question mark q
equal to
here
we're using what city
and
where is the amp percent
app id
equal to the one app id we have used it
already
okay what is that
that
key so that is the key
which we've already written so that app
id we are passing it right over here
okay q equal to city and i have id equal
to this
now after that to make the restful api
call i'll be using one independent or
by default api which is available to us
that is called what
fetch
okay so if you just check this fetch it
is basically a take request info
and give you the what a promise response
so return type will be the promise type
in this fetch i'll be passing what
the api
and will be using dot
then that means if the request
is successful using function
function
response
then function as a parameter response we
are saying let
data equal to
response dot i'm expecting the response
of stripe of what json
using json and return what
data
so it will be returning data back to me
now
if it is successful then what then i'm
saying dot then once again it is
chaining
again
function again
data's in parameter
now in this case we'll be getting lot of
things i'm saying
whether
dot
temperature it's a predefined dot
value
equal to i'm using what
math
dot
floor inside this we are passing what
data dot
main
dot temp it is a predefined property we
are receiving it now hyphen
kelvin whatever the kelvin value is
basically we are taking score 273 on the
top
minus
kelvin
followed by
another property or
weather dot
description
weather dot
description
equal to we're using
data dot
weather
zeroth position because it contains lot
of data but i will be taking what
description out of that
then
weather dot
icon id
whether that icon id equal to
data dot
weather
dot
icon then
dot icon then once again
weather dot
city
okay equal to
data dot
name
after this
weather dot country
dot
equal to
data dot
sys dot
so these are the properties i have it
right now with me
okay and once i received all the
property i'll be using dot
then
i will be using one function
and i will say what
display there is no function written
called display weather but i am gonna
say there's a one function name called
display weather
this function i had to write
but this function just putting it here
okay
now this is closed
after that
since i need to get a weather from the
api provider
so i have to also pass what the latitude
and longitude which i am receiving it
from the client because
here i just want to have two things
the properties as well as whether both
and both i'll be using it one by one
okay so here
we have kept this get search weather and
now i'll be calling one more function
after this logic and i'm giving the name
call function
getweather
okay it takes two parameter one is
called what latitude
and seconds call
longitude so we have two things called
latitude and
longitude
and here i'm using this property called
what let
api equal to
once again if you remember
i have used this statement i'll just
copy the same
and
pass it here
but challenge would be this time
i will not be passing city name because
that two options are available either
you type the city name or else you click
on the icon and let your application
identify the location which you belong
to
so after this feather question mark
here i will not be using queue i'm using
what
led
equal to
latitude
okay
and we're using
and
hello in
equal to
we're using longitude
okay and app id equal to what key so
this is the variable which we have it
now
okay
now
similar thing which we have used it on
the top
okay called fetch api
so i just copy this same fetch api again
because i really don't want to waste
time on keep on typing the code when we
know it very well it can be similarly
done i just copy and
paste it here
so the same fetch api
dot then response data equal to
response.json return data then
whether that temperature method flow
says country.displayweather
so we have used the same thing here and
after that we have to use the last
function here that is called
displayweather
display
weather
and here in my display weather i can use
what
i can element dot
inner html equal to
i'll be using
img
src
equal to
icons
slash
dollar
and we'll be passing what whether
dot
icon id
okay
dot
png
okay so
that we are basically putting it here
dot png and after that
it is closing that
okay and this icon we also need to close
here rather than closing this i'll be
closing that and
this i'll be closing it here
now
we'll be using top element
sorry temp element
temple element
dot
inner html
equal to what
we'll be using this dollar
weather dot
temperature
dot
value
okay
and
after this value we can just use
this asterisk side
the one which i told you
okay and use
spam
spam
okay next we're using call talk element
so we have that sorry dsc element
we have got dec element dot
inner html equal to weather dot
description
and last but not least location
element dot
inner html
equal to
what
i'll be using once again this
and here
weather dot
city
comma
dollar
weather dot
that's it
these two properties we have to use it
and we are all done let's check with my
code
if i get any error
now
allow
so
awesome you can see now
27 broken clouds globe undefined that's
perfectly fine intercity
you can see awesome beautifully it is
showing you
the conditions it's saying smoke 28
degrees centigrade and now let me put
another city here i'm gonna say called
pulley
awesome your application is working
perfectly fine
and
let's see one more
i would say
awesome and now we are planning to
develop one very special game for you
in javascript and now it's time to talk
about another very interesting game that
is known for tic tac
tic tac toe is
world's favorite game we have already
played a lot in our childhood days and
still my favorite game so i have decided
to basically offer you this tic-tac-toe
game
developed in javascript html plus css
which can create something really really
great effects for the end users so let's
go and start developing our next game
that's called tic tac toe
so in this tech tractor i will start
working with creating a folder called
tic tac and inside this i'm going to
create a new
file name called index
dot html
now here onwards the same thing
i'll be creating this html tags
and now here onwards
we want our sum classes for headers and
footer
but so we're going to create some div
diagram
so in this div tag
i'll be creating some of the tags
in which the css class will be applied
so we just gonna create a classes
uh for you gonna just use those classes
but we will create it later on so just
go ahead and create those so we are
saying div
okay
so now this point onwards is my first
div tag inside this i'll keep
my h1 tag
and under this h1 i will be offering
some of the headings which will be
useful
to contain some necessary information
with regards to this game so tip here we
say
h1
and inside this h1 it gives the message
called class
equal to header
and here i'll give the name call
is a tic-tac-toe game
after this div class
yeah here we will start working with our
form tag
within my form tag i will start my div
after div tag i will use
label
so label for player 1
or else i can say player 1 and inside
this let's do the name called
player
label is closed
and
after this label will start working with
our input tag
input
now in this input what are the details i
need first i need call type equal to
text number one second
placeholder equal to enter name
next name
equal to player1
next we want id
equal to
player one
and then
any class if i want to apply
anyways we're gonna close this this is
my first text box
and
same thing i would like to create for my
another one
so the first div tag we have used let me
go and create another tip tag
in this div tag i'll use the same label
copy the same
paste it here
and this is for player 2.
so we have this
two players with me and after this div
tag
i'll offer the submit button now
input typically submit
start
game now the form tag is closed here
dev tag is also closed
so
you want the div tag to be closed or
before that it's up to you now
so here we have a qualitative class
whichever we have taken so if you want
you can basically put it later or before
whatever
so we will basically form that with this
so form tag is there later on you can
just show some containers where the
details will be visible to me so here
after the form tag
let me try to offer but first check that
it is really working fine
so here
yeah we have this option called enter
name in the name after the stick tag
tool
so
yeah so here are the details we have
taken input application text in input
typically text
okay so two values we are taking now and
accordingly we will go ahead now finally
after the form tag
we would like to start with working with
the tape tag again
div
and inside this div i since i haven't
created any css classes so those we can
use it later on but let's have
this div
and inside this div i would like to use
one more tip type
okay and here we want to use one more
div tag
so inside this div we will be using one
more div tag
so
in this div we can just give the value
called data id equal to zero
id equal to
zero it's just the value we are passing
it
div
data equal to zero the div tag is
getting closed
fine so
that's how we want it now
so here
the first div tag is closed like that we
can create another data id so 0 1 2
total number of 3 we want to create it
so i want to create 0 1 2 3 4 5 like
this so the way we have created here
for this div let's go and create one
more div tag
id equal to
one
two
three options we have it now
okay like that i can keep on creating
the others also
two
three
four
five so zero one two three four five dot
number five we have created one more i
would like to create it down here
for six
there'll be no difference because we
haven't changed anything here
okay so the div tag is getting closed
here
okay
and uh
that's it
and if you want to create a some clear
board or button that you can basically
offer it little later on
but here
we can use one more div
and here we say do
dip classical relative
and within this step tag i can use
any image tag if i want
so i just leave it as it is
and after this
i can create one more tip tag
and inside this another tip
okay
and
under this i'm gonna create
a button
okay and in this button
we'll be having some value
okay we can secure the value name called
replay
this button is created and now we can
create a clear board
spam
and here is a clear board
that's it
okay so here
it's just
a small game i want to develop it
better
now there's no user interface has been
used so this user interface will be
using it later on by offering them a
pure
look and feel so that you know it gives
me
more better look when your application
will start
but most importantly i need to start
working with a javascript part where the
logic will get calculated here
okay so
we want to start with the javascript so
let's get included the javascript with
my code
so here
i can see here
a script tag
script
equal to
now the file i haven't created so let it
be as it is
that's it so this is my script tag and
let me try to include my
style cheat also so
i just say
link real quick style sheet
into the name called
css though i haven't created what i'm
giving it
okay that's it
so we have taken
this html into our
consideration now we'll be creating this
css as well as the javascript
to make this example complete
well we are ready with our html but it's
time to basically go back and spend time
on our javascript we're going to create
a new file now with the name called
app.js
and inside this we will start writing
the logic with our main application
okay
now the first thing is how we're going
to start now
yeah
so
first thing what we need to do is we
need to attach window
dot add event listener
and when the window will load some logic
should happen so i'm saying load
second is the name of the function
so the name of the function perhaps does
not exist but i can give the name called
app
which i'm gonna create it shortly
now here first of all let me try to
create a game board i'm saying let
gameboard
equal to now let me have some of the
values because it is
eight digit
so we just make it
like that
and one more
for making it nine
[Music]
okay so that's how
we're going to create it now
okay
now this is all empty right now
after that we're going to create let
turn
just a new variable
equal to zero
what this is it keep tracking if x or
zero player itself
like which player turns it to be so just
it is trying to mention it i'm saying
weller equal to
false
okay now let's go and create the player
so
create
player how are you going to create a
player we say const
player equal to
what we're going to pass
name
okay equal to
now inside this we can say name equal to
name
next we say return
name
that's it
okay after that i'm defining let
here
x
equal to
player
with the empty value
and again
player
y
equal to player is an empty value now
let's try to initialize the app
okay
function
okay
and inside
first of all
document dot
get element by id here
we're going to take
the class name of this particular text
field so we are saying input
icon
field okay
dot
oops
okay now after this we have to say cost
add layers
once again
dot
okay dot
add event listener we want to attach the
event
on which event
submit event
and what logic
add please
okay
just the name we are basically taking
that
and here we say
sorry
replay button
dot
add event listener
which even i want to say
click
ok that is the first event second
reset board
reset board
that we are basically passing that
okay
now
this is the initial case which we have
it
now beyond that i will add
this is the layers what we have added
right nut slides to add the plates so
this is how we have initialized after
that let's
add
this
how to basically add the players here we
have to just define the function
add
players
okay so take
event as a parameter
and say event
dot
prevent prevent default this present
default will try to prevent
the default
uh you know
behavior which is submitting to be get
avoided and now here we say if
this
dot
player
one so we just define the property
called player one
if this dot player one dot what
value okay
is blank
okay or
let's start
day two
sorry
let's start
player 2
now i just want to find it out its value
also
value
black
then what i should do
in this case i am saying alert
you
almost
enter
name
for
each
field
the user has to add the values and after
that
return
okay
now the next thing is like we would like
to select the players in this inside
this by saying cost
layer
form
container
again
const play from controller container
equal to
document
dot
query selector
document a query selector here we will
just pass
the value call
enter
icon
okay now we say cost
board main equal to
document
dot once again
query selector
code
underscore main
okay after that
layer
form container
dot
class list
dot class list dot
add here we're giving the name forward
height container
right like
container
and after that you just say board main
boardman
dot class list
dot
remove
height
hyphen container
and after this what i will do i'll just
say player
x
dot name
equal to
this dot
player 1
dot
value
ok this for player x copy this
player y
2
and after that
that's it so we have done it now
so
we'll be calling other functions one by
one but that is the first thing which we
have implemented
well so add player function is added
right now
and after this add player we have to
basically call
one more that is called which returns
the current player so i'm saying return
current player
and here what i will do is we'll just
write function
and here we say
current
player and in this current player what
we will do is
we will say return
turn
just variable
okay percentile
2 we're just adding it with this
zero
okay if it is
then
x
turn i'm telling you
okay or else
so we're adding like the current player
who says the current tail right now
well
after this adding the return current
player we're gonna add another function
that is known as call rate of the
current player return current player is
having this value and after that we need
to say
resize the square in event browser is
resized
once again if the browser is getting
resized automatically the square size of
your
tic-tac-toe should also get increased so
we just say
resize
squares
and here we're gonna say this option
equal window
dot
add
event listener
now we have a call option called resize
here
and the second parameter what we are
parsing is called on
resize
okay on resize
now let's try to add it
after this we are writing this function
called function
on
resize that is a function link for me
the one which you are passing into the
second parameter
we are saying let
all cells
equal to
document
dot
query selector all
in this we are passing
board
underscore
okay and then we're using another option
called what let
cell height
equal to
all cells
with the position
okay dot
of
set width
of
set width
after that we are saying all cells
dot
for each
here we are passing
cell
[Music]
and after that we are using cell
dot
style
dot
height
equal to now he'll be using this
backtick and use this
dollar sign
and say
cell
height
and that tool in a pixel
so this will be taking the dynamic
values
okay that's it that's it over
now we have to just launch our build
board
now
billboard
build
board so how we gonna build our board
now for this we are saying function
build port
and inside this billboard we will see
this option called let
reset
container equal to
document dot
once again query selector and pass the
value call dot reset
okay and after that we are saying
reset container dot
class list
dot remove
and we are passing the value call
reset hyphen
hidden
this value and after that
we may call some other type of functions
also
okay so for those functions i can say
first will be called on
resize
after that we are calling
add self click listener
but i do not have that function with me
these functions we need to create it by
our own
okay so we will just leave those for a
time being let's go back and create
another functions now so we just want to
write another event with self click
event for play to attempt to make move
so
here we're trying to say
cell
click
event
for
player 2.
attempt
to
make
move
now this function we need to create it
so we just say function now
we just say function and give the name
of the function
to make move now
function
make
it takes
let's go back and try to check another
condition that is called
current cell
equal to
percent because you have to read the
value from there and here we are saying
what
event dot
current target
sorry
even dot
current target dot
first element child
okay dot
data set
dot
id
so we're reading these values
after that we use another variable
called let
cell to
add
token
now here we are typing document
query selected
and here
you know using backtick
i'm using this value called
data hyphen id
okay equal to
here we are using
once again in a single quotes
dollar
current cell
okay
so this value we are taking it like that
after that we are using this situation
called if
cell
to
add token dot
inner html
exterminatory mark
blank
once again if cell to add
token
dot inner html
equal to blank
then what next
so cell to add token
dot inner html
equal to blank then what you should do
i'm saying console
dot
log
and give the value the one which you
want
okay
so
in this console.log what value we can
give it
cell to add token
we have it it is taking this value to
the current set dot inner html
console.log
and inside my console.log we can set
this
cell
is
already
taken
so values are already taken for this and
now we will be
returning those values
after that we will be using else
condition
and here we use once again if
current player
okay
is x
then we'll be using this option called
cell
see we have this property option
available called set to back to
consuming cell to add token okay dot
text content
equal to
current player
okay and we say game mode
the one which you have created pass in
this game mode
this value call
current cell
and in this correct cell value will be
equal to
x
okay
else
we can say
send
to add token dot
text content
equal to
current player
okay and say
game board
current cell
equal to
like this
okay so here we are adding the values
like that
so it is closed after that we can just
use the function name for
is winner to check whether the user is
winner or not so we are saying
is
winner
okay and
after that we are saying
turn
plus plus
after that we are saying
change
we do not have the function name called
change board header names
okay so it's just like that we're giving
it so as usual we can leave this
function for a time being
and we'll call this little later on so
leave it as a for the time being
okay so your function is now ready
so the next thing what we need to check
whether
it is tie or not okay so we are saying
function
check
if
we're just taking the function
whether it is tie or not so here we say
if
the condition is turned
greater than seven
alert
again
okay we can say give over else we can
say our type
okay
well after that we are saying winner
function is winner
now what we will check is we'll check
const
winning sequences
winning sequences
and here
sorry
here
we are having this array and having the
different conditions associated we say 0
1
2 probability we are checking it
and then i just copy it
well we are saying zero 2 and here is
saying
3
4
5
6
7
8
and 0 3 6 again
0
3
6
and once again 1 4 7
4
seven
and next we have a call two five eight
eight
then we are checking the vertical zero
for it
eight and one more last option we'll put
is called two four six
six so these conditions we are adding it
now
after this array we can say
varying sequences start
for each
and give the name called winning compose
winning
compose
and inside this varying component we are
giving let
cell one equal to
varying combos position zero
then
that copy
and paste three times
cell two
cell three and here we get the writer
called what one
is two three values we're giving it and
after that
we're checking the condition
let's say
if
and here the conditions you're checking
what exactly that would be for the game
board we're saying
game board
set
one
current player
sorry
current player
ampersand time percent
come down
board
cell 2
i just want to copy this the same line
and paste it multiple times
now
here we're checking the condition for
cell 2 and cell 3
and
cell 3
and
after that
we're starting the position
so after that
we're starting the position call
[Music]
by cutting this condition called
consense
const
sense
and then equal to
document dot
get element by or sorry document or
query selector
query selector
all
and here let's select the position dot
board
cell
okay
then after that we will be using
cells
dot
for each
cell
and inside is what we are passing they
are saying
let
cell id equal to
cell dot
first
element child
okay dot
data set
dot
id
so this is the value which you are
basically adding it now and we're using
one more if condition
pressing if
cell id
now we're talking about call cell id
triple equal to
cell 1
or
or
salary equal to
so three
okay and in that case we can use
cell dot
class list
dot
add
and get the name board
just give the class name
winner
so here we'll be giving the winner and a
part of that we can use the other
conditions too
okay so here it is
adding the value and now let's say
let
current layer equal to
document dot
get element by id
so you can basically define it so
current player you want so we can use
the current player or whichever
conditions you want so here we use what
the cell winner
now
small change rather than using correct
layer we can use
the current
layer text
the new variable we are creating it
current player text document dot rather
than saying get element by id
we can say
query selector
and in this query selector will be
giving the value
by saying dot board
and that
query selector
value whichever you given this let me
try to put it in a
parenthesis
like this
okay now here we just check
if current player
x
then what
then in this case we can say
current player what is the value we are
using current text
dot
inner html
equal to
now we can define the value whichever
you want to
operate
we just use a condition called div
class equal to
okay so we are saying congratulations
okay and here you say
congratulations
along with
and here the tip tag is getting closed
like this
okay
so that's the message we are basically
printing it
and after that we give this value and
say this message called
winner equal to
true
and after that
if you want to apply
remove
that function we haven't written we'll
be talking about a little later on and
just say return true again
so your function is ready now
and later on we can just check the
condition if filler
if
winner
or you can
say check
if type
and
return false
that's it
now in our continuation to this example
we're gonna develop another function
which
the name is called change board header
names so let's continue by defining the
new function called function change
change
board
header names
so this change board header names will
be the new function for us and here they
would like to check whether the user is
winner or not so here we say if
not
winner
then what
then in that case we have to say let
current player text
equal to
document
dot
query selector in this will be getting
the details like dot
board
and here we gonna keep the name called
player
and hyphen turn
player hyphen turn
now later on after this particular
variable we have to just check the
condition by saying if
current player
equal to x if the position is x sorry
let me try to put it in capital letter
here
x
then we will say
currentplayer
dot
inner html equal to
now here we have to just use the same
option called backtext because i want to
go multilines
that's the benefit of this backtick and
here we say in our inner html span
class
equal to
name
iphone hyphen
style
close this and here
we want to
use the statement
now this
value
we want to write it with name attribute
so it is getting close and here we are
saying dollar
with this player
x
dot
name
and then
close the
span tag
and we say
you are
up
like this
and after that
we say dev
class equal to
which is going to create a class which
later on we can apply the css style on
the top of that u hyphen r
hyphen
winner
and here we say closing the div type
so div tag is closed
that's it and now after this line
what next we have this called else
condition
else
what else here we say
current layer
text
dot
inner html
inner html equal to
after this
we gonna write the span
class equal to here we say
name
hyphen hyphen same option we're going to
use it
so in this condition so
winner conditions so let me try to copy
the same rather than copying it again
and again
i'll just copy the whole text
expand class equal to
name hyphen iphone style player rather
than saying x you can use file
you are up your
winner
okay
so here it's getting closed
well
after this what we could do create
another function called reset
port function
reset board
now in this function reset board which
is a console.log
a small message
resetting
resetting is added now afterwards we
will be using
the game board
and the same game board what we have
used it earlier
i'll be using the same conditions
on the top
if you remember
that was the game board for me so i'll
be using the same keyboard
to copy this
yeah
with the same condition
okay give me equal to this
after that line we will say let
sell to add token
send to add token
equal to
document dot query selector all
here
in this
i'll be using
another class called
letter
now
cell to add token
whichever we've used dot
for each
square
and within this square we would like to
use square
dot
text content
equal to
black
after that
square
dot
parent element
dot
class list
dot
remove
and here we would like to say board
okay underscore in the school
cell
winner so these classes we had to create
because these changes classes were just
using this but we haven't created we'll
be using it little later on
so that was the point
now after that we are defining the turn
value
turn
equal to zero because we are resetting
it and
winner equal to
false
after that winner is equal to false we
just define another variable called
define it current player text
current player text equal to
document
dot
query selector all
yeah document query select all
so here
we're gonna use the name called board
define player hyphen hyphen turn
after that current player
current player
text
current player text dot
inner html equal tool once again we have
to use the condition for
up
and winner point
so let me try to copy this
inner html equal to
okay and in this we have to say player x
dot name
okay just everything is same
no change at all
okay now
here after that we're gonna write one
more function called function
add
cell
click
listener that means when i will be
adding
or clicking something to my cell
what kind of event i would like to
listen
here
we are saying const
cells equal to
document
dot
query selected all
let's check
the condition board
board
cell
and here once again we say sell stock
for each
dot
for each
and here this is cell
dot
add
event listener
which event i want to listen
click and the second parameter will be
handler
once called
make move
okay and this function which we have
created called add cell clicks listener
okay this i'll be calling it here
perfect
later on once it is done let's try to
add one more function called function
remove
cell
click
listener
remove cell click listener
now here we say
let
all
cells
equal to
document dot
query selector all
let's pass
board
cell
and now we say
all sets
dot
for each
cell
and here we say cell dot
remove
event listener
which event
click
and second parameter will be
make
that's it so friends now here
most of our javascript code is written
now
so going forward we would like to use
css and finally we'll be applying
everything into our html file
well after the javascript file is ready
towards my application now it's time to
go and create our html file now sorry
the css
so
inside my tic tac i have got app.js and
index.html ready now here i'm going to
create another file here called
app.css see you can basically put this
app.css in either folder like in static
folder but i have just kept it outside
now from this point onwards i would like
to start with my basic functionalities
okay what those are let's start with the
first feature called body
with my body some basic settings i would
like to do like in background image
background color so i just start with
background color
background color i can just use it as a
white
okay
but i don't think so it's really needed
it so if you want you can have it
otherwise leave this background because
it's by default gonna be white only
and now
next would be called height
height will be 800 pixels
next background position
background position i just say like
center
next background repeat in case if you do
not want to repeat the image
background repeat
and here i say no repeat
next background size
here we are saying cover
okay so it resize the background image
to cover the entire container
okay so that's what the body part
now the next thing is we have to select
the
rest of the css classes first select div
dot relative
inside this dot relative is first say
call position
position we are saying absolute
next is stop
from the top i'm just making 760 pixels
next right
right is saying 120 pixels
next
after this we are saying height
container
height
dot container oh sorry hide hyphen
container
here in hide hyphen container we will
display
display
colon
none
well after that we have to use the
header point
header
inside the cellar we will say color
will be by default white but still we
just say color
and
white
next text line
we just say center
next margin
margin will be 50 pixels
next font family
font family i am selecting called
permanent marker
permanent
permanent marker
okay next class we are talking about
call interplayer that's called dot
enter
hyphen
players
now in inter hyphen players have the
same color
will once again
we can use another layer but we can just
use white or any color you want or you
can just use
hash
okay
margin
margin we are giving it's called zero
auto red
we're looking forward for 80
next texture
line center
position
relative
now
next we're going forward for input field
in this input field we just say border
border two pixels
solid
and black
next
outline
outline none
i do not want any outline to be there
next padding
i can take 4 pixels
8 pixels
4 pixels 8 pixels now margin
we're saying 0
0 10 pixels
okay and finally
for pixels
after this margin we say font size
18 pixels
okay so that is your input field
next we are talking about something
called input field focus
input
hyphen field
okay colon
focus
now here
border
two pixel
solid
right
or any other color which you want to use
it
next
how you want your submit button to be so
i'm saying
dot
submit hyphen btn
border
two pixels solid
and black
adding
8 pixels
and again 8 pixels
font size
80 pixels
now width
250 pixels
followed by border radius
5 pixels
next your margin from top
let's take 10 pixels
after that background color
let's take
white only
okay
so this is the property
now going forward you can associate
with your submit button active and
submit button focus so we are saying dot
submit
hyphen
btn
colon
active
and
two options we are taking
followed by condition outline
outline
then
next border
we're talking about two pixels
solid
and the color red
okay
so that's the one
and after that we like to use over
dot
submit hyphen button
colon
over
what you want
change the background color
to what white
you can use white smoke
well
here we like to use
a
dot
board
here we'd like to use player
hyphen so these are the classes we were
using in our javascript we remember
and here we say color
color we're using once again
right or you can use this white smoke
whichever you want
well later on
texture line
center margin
10 pixels
0
and 10 pixels
height
54 pixels
okay
so these are the properties initially we
have taken
okay so after this
turn let's go and start another classes
here i'm saying dot
name hyphen hyphen
style
and here we are saying color
red
and then font size
22 pixels
well
now coming back to the another
properties now we're talking about the
next important called border container
called board container dot
container here we define width
which is 40 pixels we are taking
or sorry 40 percent we can rather take
after that background colors
that we can say coded blue
okay
next margin
we're taking is 0
and
auto
after that font size
font size we are taking 0
next border
bottle we are taking 2 pixels
then solid
and then black
followed by
box shadow
if you remember this box shade is one of
the very very season
three popular property here we're
defining three pixels
three pixels
three pixels
zero pixels
and
rgb
we can talk about called black
okay
so my
border color will be shading color will
be
black
after that we're offering this
board cell
dot
now in this board cell we are defining
width
now in this width we are using
calculation
ca lc and in this calculation we are
defining 100 percent
okay divided by
three
this calculation
after this
the next property will be display
display will be inline block
next font size
we're taking 40 pixels
well texture line
center border
we are taking
two pixels
solid
and
black
adding 20 pixels
vertical align
top
next font family
this formula can use permanent
permanent marker
okay
now
next option
a part of this
we have a call
your board circle
board
[Music]
let's make background color
red
okay and
[Music]
later on just use
letter
now in this letter we just give the
color combination so color will be
white
next position
relative
top
50
next transform
translate y
to minus 50
after that font family
we are making it once again permanent
marker
let me copy
okay
now
here next option will be called winner
container
here we're giving
winner
with dot
dot
winner hyphen
container
okay so for this winner container what
are the values we want to use it
that's you want to basically do it so
for this winner container what i would
rather suggest is you can use dot
reset
texturing
center
margin
20 pixels
that is for reset and now reset hidden
inside this reset heading we will set
display none
display
none okay after this the replay button
it's yeah i'm going to talk about replay
button dot
replay hyphen
vta
and here with
we make it
to
25
okay
and followed by padding
10 pixels we take it from here
and 20 pixels
border
this bottle we are taking is called two
pixels
followed by solid
okay and black color
now later on
border radius
border radius we're taking 5 pixels
later on outline
i'm saying none
after this outline we say letter spacing
now this letter spacing would be again
zero
after that
text transform
this text form value we are talking
about call
uppercase
next font size
font size
we are taking 16 pixels
then margin top
margin top would be 12 pixels
then word spacing
that you are taking three pixels
followed by background color
this you are taking white as usual
so this is for your replay button
okay
now in a similar line we can also have
call dot
replay iphone btn
colon hover
followed by dot
replay hyphen
active
now apply the common style outline
we are making it null
then color
we are making is called white
then background color
will be black
okay
and
when it comes to the congratulations
so we'll be using this
dot
okay
so this congratulations
class will be using font size
to what 24 pixels
and after this we are using this call
winner dot u
hyphen r
dot
winner
in this winner we will be taking
font size
okay that's 18 pixels
after that height
we are taking 18 pixels again
then line height
line height we are taking 18 pixels
and then
margin two pixels
and then zero
okay that's it so
last but not least we would like to use
this
dot replay
iphone btn
this i'm saying with 50
50
percent
so this is what my css file is all set
i know it was pretty lengthy but it is
required for this particular application
okay everyone so we are all ready with
our css also now it's time to go back to
our index.html file
and take care about the final finishing
touch
so we have this index.html file with us
and now
the css class which we were using it in
our application that is known as call
this
permanent marker this class is not by
default available so we have to include
this
using this external api so here
where we have a call css with us
before that
we want
link
so within this link we want our
variable name called href
equal to now we have to give the proper
location by saying https
colon double forward slash fonts
dot google apis
okay dot com
slash
css
question mark
family
equal to
permanent
plus
marker
okay so if you just copy this
into your browser
you will get to know
where exactly it is using
okay if i just copy and paste it
so i just need to say https before
yeah https
fonts
dot
google apis
dot com
slash
oh spelling wrong
css family equal to permanent marker
that is the main url
from where i can take this kind of font
so here
css so that's what i was cross verifying
it
well it's there we have included our css
also but in which class we need to use
that is an important now
js i also want to include it
so here
in my head tag only
i would like to include
script
src equal to
app.js
so here my script is actually loaded now
after that
if i just go back and check
the
final outcome of my code
which is
index.html5
well it pretty much look like in basic
nothing else has started when we talk
about call start game
okay so it needs to start because there
is no css class are attached so i need
to attach those classes within my code
so here onwards we have to start with
offering those css classes so that at
least i can apply
those common behaviors to my application
okay like here we have a call
div
we haven't attached any class to this
after this body we have a part tip h1
class equal to header
tic tac toe then we have a call div we
have a call
body
uh
under this we have a call another dev
tag so
just imagine how many type of classes
are available when we have called tip
class equal to header
div class is closed again we have a
called one more div tag so like that
multiple css files are there where we
have to apply the new css class
to make it happen so now we have to just
go back and change our html and to apply
our main class
so this is what my final html which
looks like the same you can see we have
added
all those type of css classes which we
had that is called inter player
player form player container label
placeholder and player container and if
you see all different type of classes we
have attached this to
okay because
here only my css class will get applied
and the javascript will apply those kind
of dynamic css based on certain
conditions so these css classes are
already there added inside your html
page
our app css is ready
app.js is also ready now let's go back
and try to reveal how it looks like
awesome so it looks like pretty nice
tic tac toe is a game it is expecting
when i say start game it says you must
enter a name for each field validation
is working
let me try to add
two names and say start game awesome so
now you can see it is saying a you are
up
now let me try to give the values
awesome now you can see
it's saying like hey you are a winner
great so guys congratulations on this
the first example of how the
tic-tac-door game is used so it is a
classical example of css
javascript and html together
so this time we're going to talk about
our next very interesting feature that
is known as called dealing with another
example that is called snake game so
sting keep is one of the very very
powerful
example which i'm going to share with
you which will help you to understand
like how
we offer a very simplest way of
developing a mini project
okay that is something which is a snake
game let's see how the snake game is
important and how we're going to deal
with this
these are our previous examples which we
have seen which i will call a project
which we have created that is called
quiz application and now we're going to
start working with our new project
now here first of all i'm going to
create a new folder
that is called snake
again
and inside this is a game we need some
new folders
uh first folder i'm going to create it
inside this that is called images
and
within this snake games i'm going to
create few new files that is called
index
dot html
and here
i'm going to create a new file name
called app
dot
js
at the same time i'll be having some of
the css files if i need so i can say
app dot
css so total number of three files i
have it now let me close down all the
files whichever i have opened it earlier
so
now that looks cleaner approach so
this is the snake game for us from where
we need to start
and we have an index.html file and here
i will as usual create
our basic html syntax and
here i would like to include
our script tag
script
src equal to
app.js
that's it and now going forward we will
start developing
our next
implementation of
snaking
now inside my body tag i would like to
have some basic property called speed
okay and later on i'll be taking the
input from the client so we are saying
input
type equal to
so here we can justify the speed and we
can give id
equal to
gamespeed
and followed by value
equal to we can give the value called 5
initial value
and min
equal to
1 that is the minimum value
and max equal to 9 that is the maximum
and minimum value we can offer beyond
that i won't allow the users to go
and step
that means the increment value that is
one
well that is the input type and now
another input we are taking input
type equal to
button
and
value
equal to
start
and then id equal to
game start
okay so we're giving these values
after that
i can give some
bricks
so two bricks we're giving it and start
working with the div diagonal
and in this div tag i'll be using the
canvas
it is a html5 feature
we use canvas
and i just give id equal to
game
area
there is a canvas
and
after this canvas
we will
that tip tag is closed here after the
div tag i can use another tab type
div
here i can say
class equal to
i may not have any class written but i
can say
class equal to related so later on if i
want to apply any css style
i can certainly
apply and after that i can offer the
images
okay so i may not have any images right
now so i just leave this image playing
right now
okay and this script src i'll load it
only
before my body tag get closed it's
always a good practice to keeping this
script tag on the bottom of the body tag
always designed for good practice
now this is almost ready for me let me
check
okay so i can see
values
now it will go maximum nine that is how
we have given
and minimum is one
start is the button which not doing
anything but later on we can allow some
logic inside this
now we have to start working with our
main javascript tag
this is my amp.js and here onwards we
will use
some of the properties okay which i want
to initialize it so using var
game
start
equal to
initialize
second game speed
equal to
next game area
equal to
null
game area context
equal to null
then
game area with
game area
width
equal to
zero that is in integer value
give area height
game area
equal to zero again
then solve it
cell width equal to 0
play score
equal to 0 again
next snake
equal to null
next snake food
equal to null
next snake direction
equal to
null
snake speed or else i can say speed size
speed size
equal to
zero
next we have a timer
equal to
so these number of properties
we've initialized
okay
now after that we will be writing a
function by saying function
name is called initialize
okay and here in initialized we would
like to use some of the properties
first we are saying
game start equal to
document dot
get element by id
here i can give the value call
hash
game start let me put it in double
quotes
okay
start
now game speed now these are all
basically the values are there game
start game speed
these all values we have to take it
okay so we will be seeing these values
one by one so let me say another one
that is called game speed
game speed equal to again
document dot
get element by id now we are passing
the game speed game
game speed
now
here
once again i will take another point
game area
i say game
game area
here you have to give the value called
game area
okay so these values we have taken
now we'll be talking about called game
media context
give me the context equal to
game area
dot
get context
okay
and in this game context we will be
using what type of context using 2d
okay because i want to have
the kind of 2d so
this is how the kind of environment we
want to set
next we talk about game area width
equal to just initialize to 400
next
game area height
equal to 600
now solve it
we're initializing with 20
next game area dot width
okay so game area
dot
width equal to
game area width
and then we define k media dot height
dot
equal to
game area height
so these are the values we are
initializing this
okay
now after that we have to start writing
the logic here i'm saying game start
game start
dot now we have to line uh which event
you would like to take so i will say on
click
on
click
so when i basically click what should
happen so on click equal to
function
so what you want to write it here i'm
saying this dot
this dot disabled
equal to
true
so i want to disable these values
and after that we want to call
another function inside this
but which function let's do that so here
we are saying function
start game
start
okay
and
here in start game
we want to define the initial score see
the initial score for the player will be
certainly zero so we say
player
score
equal to zero
after that
direction in which direction you want
the snake to move so we are saying snake
direction equal to
right
in the right direction
then speed size
the value also the variable which we've
defined so speed size equal to because
it will be accepting the value
from the text boxes or from the drop
down so it certainly will be string type
so we have to use power sent
so we're using this option called power
sent and here we're using
game speed
dot
[Music]
value
okay so we are using this value gain
speed dot value now here we would like
to calculate certain things
what those are first we are saying if
okay
what if condition
uh
see this function we are writing called
start game
because there are certain things which
you need to
make it
so like that we have to define it so
function initialize
we have started
okay and then after that we have written
on click within this
so this is what the on click we had and
there onwards we have to finish this
point
and after that we've started
start game and now we'll be writing the
logic for this so here we are saying if
using speed size
missing if
a speed size
greater than
9
in case if it is
the value is hard coded it
then we would like to write a logic here
and what this logic would be it says if
it is greater than 9 we say speed size
equal to
9
we basically initialize to what name
here we say else if
speed size
is
zero
we say speed size
sorry
speed size
equal to one
that means if it is less than zero i'll
be making it minimum to one if it is
greater than nine i'll be making it to
nine maximum
and that's it
okay
so after this else if condition
is getting closed we are seeing speed
size equal to
one
so here we just say snake
snake equal to
array so that is my array for me and
after that we are saying snake
dot push
because it needs to move ahead and here
will be pushing it towards
by saying
x
position
0
and
then the y
and here the y value will be what
cell weight that means how far it can go
so it will go within the width of this
application
okay so that's how exactly we would like
to make it
okay so here we have a call cell width
which we have given here
after that what we have to do is
we have to define our own function
called
clear interval
and this clear interval perform any
logic whichever i would like to make it
okay so here after that snake.push value
has been given
here i will be creating one more
function here that is known as call
create food okay so here we're saying
create
food
so create food will be the function for
me now you might be thinking where this
function is but this function will be
declared soon within your application
but here first we are seeing the
function called clear interval
clear interval
with the timer
[Music]
okay whatever the timer will be passing
it
and after that
this clearing treble will be saying
timer
equal to
set interval
with this we are saying create game area
create
now
here in our application whatever the
value we are giving it that we need to
basically implement
so here we are giving this call create
food is a function we are calling after
that we are calling this clear interval
cleaner will be just like in a typical
function which is there after that we
are using this option called create game
area
so
this will be available to me on which
the value will be taken that
okay and then we will be telling you
how you can call this function create
food and how to create it first well so
we are talking about a functionality
called create game interval so this
create game
timer is the one which we have to create
it by our own so this function which we
are passing it after the saying set
interval
this function is knotted there so we
have to basically go back and create
this function within my application
fine so
what we will do is just particular one
we will try to comment it for a time
being
okay so here we have a call what create
interval
in this create interval will be
passing any parameters which we are
passionate about as a timer here and
here we are calling this call create
food
so here after that we'll be calling this
function called create food so let's go
and say
function create food
and this function create food let's go
and write the logic here
and what logic we want to write it in a
create food we say snake food
snake food equal to
and here in our curly braces we use two
direction x and y we say in x we say
math dot
around
and inside this we say
math
dot
random after this math.random function
we have to just take this calculation
and check the another parameter called
game area with
game
area width minus
cell width the one which you are passing
it and here after that we'll be
performing the calculation by saying
cell bit
okay so this is for our x coordinate
similarly we would like to use for my y
coordinate also
now
math dot round round dot number game
area
game area height
but
here rather than using width we'll be
using height
minus
solve it let me give some space
divided by cell width
okay so that's where exactly it's got
closed
okay
now
here
our applications is now ready by calling
the function called create4
like that we'll be going to create
another function called create game area
let me go and create all the functions
first so you're saying
function create game area
create
game area there's another function for
me
after this create game area there will
be another function i'm going to create
it
that is called control
function
control
okay after that we are going to write
one more function called function
right
score there's another function available
for us control we have a call write
score
there's another function which you're
going to write it out here that is
called function
right score is done now we say create
square create
square
this is another function
and finally we'll have a call change
direction
function
change
change
direction
so that's it so these many functions we
wanted to create it
here in our system
well
we know very well that we have taken
this call create food grade food
function is already ready now now we're
going to talk about our next function
called create gain area and in this
great game area we are defining two
locations bar
x direction and y interaction so we say
a snake
x
equal to
snake the position we are taking is
called zero and we are saying dot x
for the x direction
we are saying var
snake
y
equal to
snake
position we are taking once again zero
and
dot okay so two directions we have taken
x direction and y direction
now here we are starting
game
area
context dot
fill style at the unit variable it is a
property
fill style equal to which color you want
to fill this up
so i'm saying hash white color
okay and then we're using this game area
context again
dot fill react
fill react
now keep the position values i'm saying
0 comma 0 comma
game area width
game area width
comma
game area height
so we are basically filling the values
with color we want to use it called
stock style let me take the game area
context again
dot
stock style
stroke style
equal to now we give the another color
here
by saying hash
okay and then the next option called
same gave me the context dot stroke
react
stroke
react and here we pass the values again
0
0
comma game area width
comma
game
area
height
so we are passing those values like that
and now after this we have to write a
logic
of the directions
now see the when you talk about snake
game it move left right and center
up and down so now in this case we have
to increment the situations accordingly
so we say if
the snake direction
if the snake direction
go to
right
then we say snake
x
plus plus
now
elsif
else if
see
let's copy this
snake direction
left
then what should happen
here we say
snake
x
minus minus
okay so we're taking like that let me
copy this again
now here
here we're taking about left right we
set down
so in this case we say snake
y
plus plus
and in this case
if it is up
then we say it's name
y
minus minus
so these conditions we are taking it now
now here after this else if condition we
would like to take another if condition
now here in my if condition
we are
using some more lengthy statements
what's that we say
if snake x
if snakes x
-1
or
snake x
double equal to
game
area
width which we have taken
divided by
solve it
okay or
we are taking this condition called
snake y
snake y double equal to
minus one
okay so we're giving this call minus one
or
snake white
snake by equal to
gain area height
to save it
or
here we will take the another condition
here
yeah we will take the another condition
here call
we'll have another function called
control
which we have
created some time back and inside this
control
it will take some parameters so what
those parameters we can pass and we can
say
snake
x
comma
snape y
comma
third parameter will be
string
so this would be my another function
okay
so here we are passing the conditions
just like that
okay now here
this is
available to use a parenthesis and here
we're writing the situation for right
score
which is so far the function is only
created not
described more so we're writing the
right score the score will be written
here
and here we are saying clear interval
because the timer will be stopped
okay and using game start
dot disabled
equal to
false
and after that
return
that's it
so this is the logic for we have written
to this particular example
now we can use
another if more conditions here just to
check the behavior of my code if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
well here we have finished this
game start dot disabled equal to false
and we returned now going forward after
this return
we would like to have another condition
for the snake x so we say if
snake x
if a snake x double equal to
snake food
dot x
okay snake photo takes
amperage time perfect
snake
y
double equal to
snake
food dot
y
then in this case i will say
var new
here
x
colon
snake x
y
colon snake
snake x and y colon
snake
y
these options we are taking it
now
after that we are using this option
called player score
plus
equal to speed size
and then we are calling
create food method again
and here after that we're using the else
condition and in this else condition
we are saying var
new head
equal to
snake
dot pop
okay and we are saying new head
dot x
equal to snake x
and new head
dot y equal to
snake
y
so these values are basically
associating with your heads and after
that we are saying snake
dot unshift
and shift
snake dot and shift and here we are
passing this option called new head
that's it and after that we'll be
starting with our for loop by saying
for
var equal to
one
i
i equal to zero
then
i
is less than
snake
dot
length
and
snake dot length
and once i
plus plus
okay later on we just use the option
called
create
square
and in discrete square we are passing
snake
snake position
i
dot
x
comma
same
snake
dot y
that's it
so it's getting closed here and after
that we are calling the same option
with this snake food let me copy this
again
and here rather than
using this we can say snake food dot x
and it's like food dot y
okay so now this values has been added
into my code now let me start working
with your control
control needs to take three parameters
x y and the array so we are passing this
option called
control and in this control we are
taking x
comma y
comma
array
three parameters we are taking it later
on we are using this option called for
bar
i equal to
zero
i
is less than
array dot
length
and i
plus plus
and after that we'll be using this
option called if condition and here we
say
array
i
which value you're passing dot x
double equal to
x
ampersand time percent
here we say array
with a position called i
and in this we are saying dot y
and this position we are checking for
the y condition
for the y condition so it returns what
true
written
through
the condition
okay that is for if condition else
return were
false
now that's it now we are talking about
this option name called write score
this right score we have to use the game
area context
game
area context dot
font
equal to here we'll be passing this
situation we're saying 50 pixels
50 pixels and then
sense
hyphen
service
after that we're using called game media
context again let me copy this
take it again call game area context dot
fill style equal to here i'll be using
the another color now
so we say hash
okay
now after that we are saying once again
the game area context dot
fill
text
here we are saying
score
colon
and here we say
plus
player score whatever it is
with game area
game area width
slash
2
minus
100
and then
again
game area width
so this is where exactly the right score
where the data will be actually written
okay next we'll be having this option
called grade square at this great square
it takes two parameters one we're
talking about call x
second is taking y
and now here we're using this game area
context
same
dot
fill style
equal to let me give the color
after this we're using column same gary
and text
game media text dot
fill react
here we are saying x
multiplied by
cell width comma y
multiplied by
cell width
comma cell with comma
cell weight
this is what
my grade square is now we are left with
only one option that is known for change
direction
it's time to figure out this last
function called change direction
which takes one parameter called e
typically we talk about for
parameters
now here we are passing this option
called workkeys
equal to e
dot
and
later on we want to say if
keys
equal to
40
okay
ampersand ampersand
is sneak direction
equal to
up
okay so here we say
snake direction
equal to
down so we are changing the directions
here
okay now let me try to copy this
and here we use elseif
[Music]
four times
okay
so here we talk this
30 40 and here we say 39
and followed by 38
followed by 37
39 38 27
and here we say up
let's change to what
left
down
right
here we say
right
up
left
three options we have changed and last
but not least here
i will just use
window dot
on key down
equal to
change directions
and
window
dot
on load
okay equal to
initialize
that's how exactly we want to use now
and this function what we have defined
in initialize
okay
so in this initialize
we are having this gamestar dot on
clicking and all so you have a call
start game now
this start game will be calling it here
okay so in start
were called snake we have called snake
dot push
and after that we are calling
this function called what
create food
clear interval and here we say
timer equal to
here set clear interval and here
change
game area
slash
speed
size
let's say you want to use it okay
everyone so our code is almost ready so
we have this complete javascript ready
with me
now it's time to basically use within my
html
just to check how it may behave
so in my html page i have written this
normal speed
number
game speed value
button start we will call game start
after that we have a call canvas where
we written id equal to call game area
dev classic to relative
and
that's it and here we have a call script
sr is equal to app.js
so that's it what we have written now
finally we would like to see
how it may look if i try to use in my
browser let me try to refresh
okay
i really do not see any changes in my
code
okay
despite i'm having this because
the css content is actually missing
okay because then only my code really
look
better
because if there is no css it wouldn't
really make
good towards my application
okay and i also want to have certain
images but those images we will take it
later on let me go back and try to bring
css into this picture now
so first of all
have this
index.html file with me
and here i want to use css so inside my
head tag
we want to use
link real
equal to
style sheet
okay hr
equal to
app
dot
css
okay
now
here
in my css we want to offer certain
details
what those details i want to start
working with i will start with my body
part
body
so we want to offer
the font family
so
one family may be little bit later on i
can use it first i want to use margin
margin 20 pixels
auto
later text
align
center
next font size
font size 150 pixels
also 150
and here we want to say background
background image
since i do not have any image so i will
just leave it as a blank
okay so just otherwise i have to say url
and insert this url
it gives some values but i leave it as a
blank because i do not have any image
i will say background color this
background color i can just use white
after that height
i can just say 800 pixels
after that background position
background position i want to use center
then background repeat
background repeat i want no repeat
then background size
okay let's see if there's an effect in
my
okay i see it's now
in the middle
better
now
inputs canvas we have to basically take
that here we talk about call input
okay in this input i say font size
font size may be optional i can
make it
but let me just say font size 100
percent
then text align
center
then padding
i want to say 5 pixels
and
seven pixels
okay looks better now
well here after that i can use canvas
in this canvas
i want to see the background color
i just say white
after that border radius
whatever it is i can say 20 pixels
then
shadow if i want to use it
so i just say box shadow
box shadow i can say 3 pixels
5 pixels
and 6 pixels
and the color is
black
let's check
awesome
so i can see here
uh
the
logic is there so shadow you can easily
see how it has been using
and
that's it and this div
i can say
div
dot
relative
position
absolute
top
here i'm saying using 760 pixels
left
120 pixels
that's it
so this is where exactly
i program now when i say start
okay so there may be some error here
there's a cannot set a property of call
on click
null
so this we can just check this into this
gamestar dot on click
let's check
anyways
we just try to fix that issue in a
while
but anyways we have our created css and
now going forward we'll be implementing
the rest of the logic within my code
okay everyone so we have changed some
names here because there was some value
was mismatched so we have basically
changed those values
with your properties and now when i try
to relaunch my application
by
this
index.html file
so now in my index.html file when i try
to add
so
it's just as usual same let me say start
and here you can see game start when i
go up you see like it's starting right
now
okay isn't this an amazing game right
now friends
okay that is the same game what you used
to play it earlier
okay where you can just change the
direction
go up and you can see the score 10 is
being placed here
that's it so this is where exactly the
look and feel of your game has been
taken
and you can just increase the speed
suppose if you just put a value called
what zero
by default set
whatever value you want to take it with
a start now you can see
based on that the speed can be justified
and the example can be developed
okay you can see the start button is
disabled because right now the user is
still going on unless the user game is
finished this one is not going to work
fine
so like that you can see and
automatically this will be position this
is what's called food that is how we
have used in my example on call app.js
you can see we are using this example
name called food
create food and create food of the
specific interval time this would be
automatically created and the snake will
eat and increase the size of the code
okay that's it and now the css has been
given if you want to add certain image
certainly you can add it otherwise this
is the first game which we can see how
it is running and giving you the better
example this video on react.js helps you
build two fun applications using the
library
as you all know react is a widely used
javascript library to build user
interfaces for applications
this video will make you realize why it
is adopted so widely
so first we'll build a calculator app
and then we'll move on to building a
spotify clone
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
now i'm sure you're excited to build
these apps so let's begin
this time we're gonna introduce you
another very interesting project using
this javascript html css
so called calculator application so
let's get started let me try to delete
first those files which we really do not
need it now
uh
we delete this all
yeah now i'll be creating a new folder
now and give the name called
calculator app and in this calculator
app once again we need some new files
which is called index
dot html
and we also need one more that is called
app.css
and another one that is called app.js
so these three files required now first
of all i would start with
index.html file where we will be
creating a template of my code
now
let me go and create this template and
here
i have a good body with me
let's start with the
first
tag here that is called h1
and this h1 we are giving the name
called calculator
calculator
so that will be my h1 heading
after that we'll start working with the
div tag
now within this div
i would have to create many classes i
may not have lot many css classes but we
can give some classes here so we can say
class equal to
okay
so within this div tag we're going to
create a table now because i want to
organize it
so i'm starting with the table within
this table tr tag
and within this tr tag i needed td
now in this td i need few things call
call
span
equal to 3
another value
and here
i want to offer the text box
input type equal to
text
okay input text id equal to give the
name called
that result
be the final outcome while uh pressing
all the different buttons id equal to
result and
class
equal to
screen remember i haven't created those
css classes but but we're giving some
names but later on we can utilize it
while creating those css classes
table data is getting closed let's get
started with another td
now insert this td we need another text
box input type equal to
text
and
here in this input text sorry i would
like to better say button because i'll
be having
buttons
okay
input
button
value
equal to
c
and one click
equal to i may not have any function
right now but yes i can create
a function but let me give some domain
name here
i'm saying clear
screen
okay so that will be the function will
get called
and after that class
equal to
clear
yeah so this is my button tag
after this our td tag is getting closed
after the td tag the table row is also
getting closed
after the table row
which is getting close we're going to
start working with another table row
okay and in this table row i'm going to
create one more td
so let's go ahead and create
another td here
and inside this td i'll be having
another projector we get created so i'll
just say
this is another button now input equal
to button value equal to
one
on click equal to i'll be calling
another function called display
okay and inside this we're giving the
value call 1
okay and class equal to member
plus equal to
number
and here after the techni tag is getting
closed
okay now you have to start another td
tag here
okay like that you have to keep on
creating the multiple buttons so let me
copy
and paste another table data
now here
again value equal to 2 on click display
give the value call 2
and class equal to what
number
like that i'll keep on creating multiple
buttons but first check how it actually
looks like
now i can see the buttons like in c123
but yes i'm gonna create few more
buttons one after another
okay so i'll go here
and create few more buttons so this is
where the table data is getting closed
okay i'll copy this
and paste it again
i have to create
the button
like in
3 4 something like that
so after this two we're giving the value
called three
here
i'll get the value called three
so val equal to two value equal to three
display three
and then afterwards
just giving the value called
forward slash
and here also we're going to keep the
value called
forward slash
and here
class equal to operator
operator
after that you have to do the value 4
and then followed by five six seven
so here we give four
four
five
five
six
six
after six we're giving for minus
[Music]
okay once again it will be what type of
operator
operator
okay after this minus we'll be talking
about code seven
then we have to have eight
okay nine
okay after that we're giving call plus
and
display
plus class equal to operator
operator okay so
here
you can see the table data is getting
closed and here the table is also
getting closed and after the stable row
we can start working with another table
row here
and
after this table row we can start
working with again
td let me have this
again
inside this i'll be giving the option
called decimal which is value equal to
dot and here we get the value called
decimal
okay
now display zero
so after giving this dot to basically
take what the value zero which we
haven't put now
we'll be talking about value called zero
so here
the decimal value we have given it td is
getting close let me have the other one
zero
zero
so like that we have to keep this now
after that
we'll be once again
taking this this time rather than giving
this zero
we'll be using this call as a button
and value equal to
equal
or click equal to
solve
okay and then this soft will not be
passing anything
it will like a normal function
and plus equal to
equal
okay
so
table data is getting closed
so we will be using another table data
now
so here it will be the button only
okay we will be using
value equal to
multiplication
display
plastic
and here we'll be using operator
okay
so table data is getting close table is
getting close table is also getting
closed here
okay so your div tag is also getting
closed here
okay that's it
okay so that's the only thing which we
wanted to make let me try to refresh and
check
awesome so we have got
all those
necessary calculator behavior
which
we wanted to
reveal
okay now our next statement will be once
we're giving this c then we have called
one two three
and then forward slash
followed by
four five six will come down
okay so let me check whether we have
used six or not
okay so we haven't used six
so let me check here
four five six
so let me go back here
four five six let me copy this
and paste it later
before
minus
six
equal to
number
okay so we're almost set now
so we are having this uh
look and feel
in this we are giving one two three four
five six
and after this we have a call minus and
then plus related behavior so we are all
set now and after that we'll be
basically applying the css as well as
the javascript look towards my code okay
thank you
well everybody we are all good to go now
but i just want to first check whether
my
this outlook is looking properly or not
see what my expectation is after one to
three forward slash i really want to
bring four five six to the next and then
seven eight nine and again forward still
but i can think this is absolutely
unorganized
so after this when we say this uh
forward slash which we have used after
hyphen
okay your td is getting closed here
okay so here the tr i also want to close
here
okay and after this tr i also want to
start
another tr here
okay
so that i can put them into the another
level now so under this tr i can use
this td now so after this minus
after four five six
minus
once again i would like to start
another table over here
okay so that it let's go to the next row
so here
after td
we're closing this dr
and starting
another tier
okay we're starting another tier after
that we talk about 789
okay plus
see here talking about 789 plus here the
table is getting close and it is
starting right now like this
see that looks better now
okay but still few more things which i
would like to make it even more
organized but that's not a problem we
will do it later on okay because you can
see eight is missing right now
so here
seven
we copy this
equal to
eight eight
yeah that looks better now so now they
are basically completely organized
so the moment i expect my application so
we have a call dot here then zero then
equal to and then multiplication
okay so it looks
better now
now i just would like to perform
the overall look and feel
so i need to go ahead and use what css
because without css i really can't
utilize this in a proper way so i have
to start working with a css friend now
in css front
how to start first we will go back to my
code and here in my css we'll start
working with
font family but before font fabric i
would like to start with the body part
now
body
background color i'm using called t
that looks nice
okay so
i will be using this app.css
in my html to see the look how it has
been appeared right now
so in my index.html file
on the top under my head section
link
style sheet
okay now see it looks better now
going forward
in my css
we want to use
some h1 color tool so here
we would like to use the h1
texture line
sector
color
white
margin top
margin top would like to use 50 pixels
this is for h1 let's check
perfect so it is now coming in between
next statement will be called screen so
we say dot
screen
so in this screen we use the background
color
diagram color gray
and after that border
sorry
border solid
black and two pixels
after that color
white
font size
medium
next width
we're using this
100
then we talk about cursor
where we say
what are the default cursor is
okay then padding
we would like to save 10 pixels
and then
margin
say
auto
then margin bottom
that i'll be using 10 pixels
so in the proper alignment
okay
look
that's how exactly we want that's for a
screen where the exact outcome will be
visible to me
and rest of the details we'll be showing
you one by one and now we'll be talking
about call input
okay
input
type
equal to button
for input type equal to
background color
change to what
right or else i can say
let's walk
okay
and
when the button is active
what i want
let me copy
and put a little button and here i say
active
and this color should be orange red
like this
you can see now how it's basically
looking like it
okay active the color will be like this
okay i'll be talking about operators
operator should behave different so i'm
saying dot
operator
in this operator we are saying
background
color color orange
okay that padding
i want five pixels
okay then i want color
that should be black
after this i'm using call border
sorry
that border
i'm using this called solid
and then black
after this bit
i'm using hundred percent
then height
height is 40 pixels
then cursive
it has to be pointed
okay that's it let's check
perfect so they should turn back to what
to your
orange color
and
you can see the moment you take macros
on the returns to white
perfect and now those were type number i
also want to change them
so for number
for number i want to say the same option
padding i want 5 pixels
then i need height
of type 40 pixels
then i say color
it looks i want to say called black
then border
border we want solid
black into access for it
black
and cursor
once again
decimal i need to have a different
options with me
okay so
let me try to copy this
paste it and i say for
does it
so for decimal background color will be
light blue
padding five pixels color black border
solid
okay black two pixels with hundred
percent height forty pixels fine cursor
pointer
perfect
okay looks nice but i have changed the
color to light blue now
now
i talk about
clear
okay
now come back
and say
clear
okay in this color
background color is changed to light
salmon
light sediment
padding 5 pixels color black
border same width 100
height 40 pixels
fine
so cursor
pointer
file margin
auto and margin bottom
merging bottom differences
let's check
perfect not looks beautiful
okay
now
here
after giving these details we're talking
about call equal part dot equal
so for dot equal also i'm just copying
the same
so we recall
background color id
color
just change to
lightly
lightly
and
after this
since it is equal so we say padding five
pixels is okay color black fine border
fine width hundred percent height forty
pixels
color and cursor pointers just i don't
need to
it's for dot equal and i want
for container
container in this container width i
white
okay
now here
writing is 15 pixels
so display block
so first of all width
you see
display
block
which we're taking
margin
okay in merchandising to pixels
auto
okay now align cells
go to
center
okay border radius
border radius let's just say 10 pixels
okay now using box shadow
box shadow 5 pixels
black
and ready
so these are details i have it now okay
we have it
background color we are taking it now
align cell
display block border radius padding no
no
writing 15 pixels we've given audi
i don't need to give it again
margin
okay fine
box shadow let's try
awesome so it's looking beautiful now
okay so this is where exactly my
application
works like that
and table when we talk about
everything with
100
okay
that's it
super
so it's now giving me the proper look of
how
my application should be here i can just
see about the container what we have
done
with 40 we are taking background color
let's bring it below
then align
display block
okay margin
okay
and border radius
and uh
fine i think we're all good now
so
that's it so we'll try and implement the
javascript part well everyone so our css
file is ready our html is ready it's
time to just uh
go ahead and talk about my
final question that is called gs part
where i want to basically perform some
calculators
now here i just say function
display
function display which takes
val as in parameter and say
document dot
get element by id
here i'm saying
result
okay dot
value
okay
plus
equal to
whatever we are adding it just basically
try to apply
calculation on the top of that
okay there's a function
after that you have another functions
available here called function solve
here in the solve
we just use the value called let x equal
to
document dot
get element by id
result
okay
dot
value sorry
dot value
okay and say connect
y
equal to
perform the calculations for the using
one function called
rebar
and type
access and parameter
now the next statement will be again
document.
get a member id
result
dot
value equal to
y
okay
now
later on
i like to use another function here
function
clear
screen
and here we say
document.
get it in my id
here we say
result
dot
value
equal to
like that so clear screen
solve
and
display three functions are associated
with me and these three functions
are the part of this javascript file
which i'll be calling it
at the end before
the water tank get closed so here
script
equal to
app.js
that's it
okay let's try to execute now
here
two you can see the values
i will say plus
six
equal to eight absolutely otherwise say
c is clear that's great
six
divided by
two
equal to three awesome so friends your
calculator application is ready
congratulations to all so it is a very
simplest form which we have developed
this is your html which is a template
for you this is the css which is your
complete
the area of like how the look and feel
will look like in of this template
beautification and here last week of gs
which is smaller logic but really
meaningful
okay if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scale up by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more
let's start with uh creating a simple
demo on react.js and we're going to
create a simple application
that will connect to an online music
streaming service called spotify and we
will call our application music app so
let's get started the first step is to
first get the notejs platform and server
installed to do that let me go to google
and let's just type node.js
and here is the website
nodejs.org there are two versions
available the lts which is the stable
version and the current we'll prefer the
stable so we'll click on that and you
can see we have an option which is
called save file the moment this file is
saved to the disk we just need to double
click on it and keep clicking on the
next button to get it installed on our
system and we also have a documentation
available here so which explains most of
the features of the node platform and
there are binaries available for
different os's mac windows etc so you
can select the right bitness 32-bit
64-bit and the right os
and then go ahead and download the
specific uh version that suits
your platform and you can see here that
there are different there are also help
files available that will allow you to
go through the installation documents
for node.js installation on linux etc so
to start with uh i'm opening up the
command prompt and here is where we're
going to call the node package manager
using the node package manager which is
pre-installed with your standard node.js
installation we will initialize our
react application so we would say react
dash app and we want to now go and
create an application called music app
in this folder so as a prerequisite for
the demo all we need to do is install
node.js from node.js.org the official
website just download it and install it
and that's when you open the command
prompt you fire npm which stands for
note package manager init for initialize
react dash app is a standard keyword to
initialize and create a skeletal
structure of a react.js application and
the name of the app is music app so
we'll hit enter we'll give this some
time and you can see it's
started downloading the core
react.js libraries and it is attempting
to create
our application so it's installing all
the prerequisite packages and scripts
that are required initialize and create
a new react.js application called music
app now once this application is created
all we would require is an online editor
so you could use an offline or an
on-premise editor as well so any editor
of your choice it could be atom or
sublime text or webstorm and for this
demo uh we're going to use visual studio
code which is
a free editor available by microsoft and
you can just google for visual studio
code again this is not visual studio
professional edition etc that we use for
building our c-sharp or mbc-based
applications this is a lightweight uh
editor for building javascript based
footstep full applications so so while
this installs let's go and take a look
at
visual studio code so this is the visual
studio code editor and this is the
editor that we've
installed directly downloaded from uh
visualstudiocode.com
and installed it and all we need to do
is open up this folder that would be
created with all the prerequisite files
in it we just say file open folder and
we would open that folder within our
visual studio code editor so we'll give
it a while until that application gets
generated and once it's created we will
again implement the component based
design and architecture and the data
flow between the components and we also
look at connecting to a live data source
which is a json set of characters that
we would consume which is a restful
service
the set of music tracks uh exposed as a
restful api endpoint by spotify which is
a premium streaming service we will
connect to that and we will look at
accessing some of the music tracks on
that website okay so we've got uh the
application created here so let's
minimize this and
we'll open up our editor all we've got
to say is file and open folder and
let me go to the react.js demo folder so
this is the music app that got created
and that's exactly what we're going to
open up here so we'll navigate to
that folder it's called music app we'll
select it
and have it opened in our application so
you can see here we've got a note
modules folder this has all of the
pre-installed packages that make up the
react.js library we've got a folder
called public which will have the
index.html file that's the root file
that will launch so this is the single
page application that we typically
create
in a react you have a single page which
on which we're going to load multiple
components so that's the index.html and
then we could go and create
a folder structure currently if i open
the source folder we can see a single
app.js file and that basically is
the file that has
the source code in javascript for a
single component which
we are interested in adding on to our
page as of now so we just have one
component which is the default root
component that's the app component and
it has its corresponding css file and
then we've got
the a public folder with the index.html
file which is going to be uh the root
html file that launches uh when we run
our application so let's uh go right up
here and let's add
a link to an additional file so i'm
going to link to another style sheet
okay so we'd say relationship is equal
to stylesheet and the type is going to
be text
and css
and
we will reference a file called
reset
dot css and this is a file that we look
at
adding up later on it doesn't exist at
this point in time so we will connect
this and that's purely for styling
purposes uh so that we can have
all of our css styles defined there next
thing i'll right click on the public
folder we'll create a new file we'll
name this file as reset
dot css so that's going to be the css
file that will have all of the css
styling that we're going to apply and
i'm going to use a ready code snippet
for the css code so let me just uh okay
so i'll all i'll do is uh i'll just go
and pick up
a ready css file that i can just go and
use
if you look here i have a set of
css files that are created that we're
just going to use uh
within our application and uh and that
will avoid us uh spending a lot of time
on the styling so that we can focus on
our core concepts uh which is actually
learning how component based
architecture works and how do we set up
components and have data communication
between them in react so
here is a file called
reset.css let me just fire up
notepad and i'll just open up this file
copy up the text here and i'm going to
just paste it within uh
myreset.css and if you look at the code
very simple it's all about
styling so we've got
article aside etc all html5 tags set up
as display block so they take up the
entire width of the page we've got some
padding margin and font size etc defined
we've removed list styling for the
unordered and ordered list specifying
the line height for the body tag so
basically uh just styling up tables and
uh so nothing nothing to do with react
here it's just about simple uh css that
we've added up uh and now we need to
actually go in and dive into create
creation of the components that we need
so let's right click on the source
folder so i'll select the source folder
we'll right click there and that's where
we're going to create a new folder which
is called components okay so this is the
components folder now that's going to
hold
all of the components within it within
the components folder let me create
another new folder and i'm going to call
it app and this is exactly how we are
expected to structure all of the code
that we have now i already have a css
and app.js which are the root components
that were added by default and all i'm
going to do is i'm going to move them
within this folder called app okay so
there's a proper segregation of
responsibility
and
all of the code that
deals with a particular component is all
added into respective folders and this
really improves the maintainability of
the application uh going forward now we
need some images
and i'm just going to make use of some
set of images that i've downloaded from
the web and
here are the set of images that i have
so i'm just going to copy all of them
and we'll come to a music app and we'll
go into the components and app folder
and that's where we're going to add all
of the files and you've seen all of
those image files getting added so these
are just icons and images we're going to
use for our music tracks inside our
application now uh let's move to the
app.css file and
this is where we've actually got
so the app.css file is the file that's
going to style up
the
all of the style rules that we've added
into the root app component and
this is what we'll have to revamp so
i'll just get rid of this code and
we'll probably add something for the
body tag the html tag and the root
element let me say hash root and let's
set the height to 100
coming to all of the html across the
page we'll give it a font size of 10
pixels
and
the h1 elements
let me give it a padding of
0.77
and 0 let's set
a background color give it a background
color and just select
some random color here that can be
applied then we'll set up the text
alignment which is going to be the
center of the page we'll set up the font
family the font family is
and this is part of
sans serif what else do we add let's add
up the font size 1.88
and also the color so again these are
standard uh html and css elements so
nothing really that
has to be done uh that is specific to
react here so again we are bringing in
the highlight class so there is a class
called highlight that we will create
later in the
html view of this component and we'll
set this to a red rgb component so
combination of 46 113 and 238 okay so
that's uh pretty much done let's move on
and also add up for the anchor tag let's
add up some text decoration and set it
to none so that the anchor tags don't
come up with those underlines and of
course we'll provide a color of hash
okay so a white color there now coming
to the h2 element for the h2 element
let's have font family and again i'm
going to use
so i'm going to use
the font family that we defined here
bracket and we change this to probably
1.55 okay now coming to the app tag uh
let me just
save this and create a copy of it uh
there was some content that
i did delete and
i can simply go and make use of it so
i've just undone all of the deletion so
this is uh something that i can't
if i can use something i can just
probably use it from the tag below so
let me start with the height here and
let's say the height of the header is
100 of the app sorry not header padding
0
17
10
17
the background and i'm going to change
that to background url so the background
url or let's say the background image
will have a url property okay and that
url is going to be dot slash
pg1 dot jpeg so that's the image that
we've added some in the previous step
let's also add
background size so we'll add background
size and set it to cover i also need a
background position that is to center
let's have background repeat which is
set to
no repeat so that we don't have the
image uh in a grid format uh and then i
would need this bit of it let's take up
the font family will maintain the same
font family let's use font weight the
font weight is going to be 500 and the
color is going to be hash
so that's a white color then we come to
dot app dot playlist so that's going to
be uh another class that we are going to
use dot but app dash playlist is what we
we're going to name it and
let me say that the display should be
flex
flexible display and we will justify the
content to leave spaces
in between all right so that finishes
that bit and now uh
let's write up a media query for the
responsiveness of this page so this is
media for only screen and max width is
going to be one zero two zero pixels
okay and the class name that we'll
provide later is obviously app playlist
so for this screen size we would align
all the items
to the center and we change the flex
direction okay so we seem to be good
with
the css for the app as of now and that's
the app.css
that we created let me save everything
okay let's check
for any kind of
additional so all free of errors no
errors now things are good in the app
css and it's time to move to the next
step of building this application uh now
we'll have to go and add up
the code for uh the app.js file so let's
dive into the app.js file and this is
where
we will actually need to go and add
all of the code that is required for the
app component so all the code that's
relevant to
the app component we are going to add up
inside this specific component itself
which is going to be obviously the
app.js file so we have skeletal code
which is important importing the react
library and
let me get rid of the basic sample logo
we'll have app.css that's getting
imported here
besides that lot of other files that
we'll have to get in so
let me import playlist and this is these
are the components that we'll create
as we go forward and we're going to get
this from the playlist folder
and the component the file is going to
be called playlist so we'll add that
then we'll have to go and also import
search bar so what we're basically doing
is we're going to split this app into
different components there's going to be
one component that's manages uh the
playlist of all the tracks uh one
component will uh act as the search bar
so that's the search bar component that
we're going to add so searching for
tracks will be managed by this we'll
have another component that we'll create
that will get imported into the root app
component which is a search results so
this is going to display the record set
with the set of results as an outcome of
the search criteria so search results
slash
search results and finally we'll go and
import spotify that's the spotify
service from so we'll create a utility
folder which will hold
the code that connects us to spotify so
that's what we are adding up next so all
of the imports are done one component
that manages the search bar so that's
search bar search results let me correct
the spellings there that search results
that spotify and playlist so that's done
now let's move on to the class that
we're going to create here so let's
create a class app that goes and extends
react dot component so that's going to
be a react.js component so that's a
constructor we discussed about props or
properties and state management and
that's what we are implementing we are
using the super keyword as a best
practice so that all the properties are
initialized in the constructor and also
we pass the values up the chain to the
superclass which is the root component
class now we're going to initialize
a variable called state that's going to
manage the state
and we are interested in tracking our
search results so we'll have multiple
results so we'll store that as an array
the playlist would have different names
so we'll just call ours new playlist
that's the default name and we will also
store a list of tracks which is going to
be playlist tracks so playlist tracks is
going to be a list of tracks and let's
close
this block okay and this two is going to
be initialized within the constructor so
we'll add it here and now we need to do
the binding we discussed uh data binding
so let's look at
creating a search variable which will
hold this dot
search dot bind and bind to the context
of this very class so we are passing
this pointer then we'll create another
variable called add track weights to
this dot add track dot bind and all this
functionality is what we're going to add
going forward so right now we're just
setting up the bindings then we'll have
capability to remove a track so we'll
say remove track so remove track equal
to this dot remove track dot bind and
let's fix that so and all of these two
is going to be initialized as part of
the constructor so that's where we're
going to add it then we need to update
update the playlist name so we need
functionality that will help us to
update the name of the playlist so
functionality that helps us to update
the playlist name so this dot update
playlist
name is equal to this dot
update playlist name dot bind and this
is the pointer that we'll pass i need to
save the playlist so this dot
save playlist
equal to this dot save playlist dot find
and pass this and then i would also need
to remove the track that has been
searched for from the playlist so remove
track search go to this dot
okay remove track search and
dot find
and finally one last function that
executes
all of these which probably will bind to
points to this context so all the
declarations are done in the constructor
now we need to provide the definitions
for all the methods that we actually
have added here so let me select this
tab inside and let's start with the
search function so we'll define the
search first it takes
some variable value that it searches on
and then i'm going to say spotify dot
search i'm going to search for term dot
then and that's an observable so the
moment it the search returns a value it
it's going to call this uh callback
function and that's when we want to set
the state and we're going to set the
state for search results to whatever is
passed by the system so the search
results are going to be returned as a
callback and that's what we store as an
updated state now coming to the add
track method so let's scroll up and
we'll say add track and this will take
the track to be added let's declare a
temporary variable called tracks equal
to this dot the current state of all the
tracks that are there in the playlist
now if
track start
find i'm going to call the find method
so if we are able to find which means
that the track is already there in the
playlist then we would not want to add
it if it's not there in the playlist
that's when we would want to go and add
it the triple equal to is an equality
operator that will check for both a
watch value match and a match on the
data type as well okay so if the track
is uh already saved to nothing if the
track is not safe just track the track
id because that is the track that will
uh have to be added if it's not if it's
already there then just return if it's
not there then we've got to go to this
variable called tracks we'll use the
javascript method called push and we
will push the current track into this
tracks
array and then update the state so we
want to set the state of the playlist
tracks and this is how
your state management that we discussed
in detail is actually being practically
implemented here okay so the track has
been added now let's talk about the
remove track so that's the remove track
function and that's the track that we
want to remove so let's let tracks equal
to this dot state dot playlist tracks
those the set of current tracks that we
have and
let track search another temporary
variable equal to this dot the current
state of the search results then let's
take the tracks array equal to track
start filter so filter is a javascript
function that will again allow you to
remove a certain value create a
temporary variable called current track
use the lambda operator and if the
current track dot id is not equal to the
track dot id which means this particular
track is
not there in the list okay so you need
to remove that and again i have a method
called as unshift which will actually
get rid of the track in the array and
then we've got to so we'll search
whether that
track is existing in the tracks array if
it is then we simply want to remove it
if not we do nothing so we set the state
we need to update the state of the
playlist because the track has been
removed so the playlist tracks will have
to be updated with this tracks array
okay then we go for remove track search
that's the next method that also will
take a track as a parameter okay here we
are going to say let tracks which is
another temporary variable we'll give it
this current state of search results and
then we are going to say tracks equal to
tracks dot filter current track current
track dot id not p equal to the track
dot id and then this is where we would
want to say this dot set state and we'll
pick up search results
and let's go and assign that to track so
that's the updated uh set of tracks
after making the change let's remove
this and correct it okay so that's fine
so the remove track uh
is now the remove track and the remove
track search is now in place let's add
the do these functions which actually
again takes track as a parameter and
here we'll say this dot add track okay
so it adds the track and then it removes
the track from the search criteria so
the search component which is managing
searching of the tracks it will go and
remove it from there after adding the
new track so that's a combined
operation we want to execute then i've
got update
playlist name which will take the name
of the track to update and this dot set
state the playlist
name is what we need to update with the
name that is passed to this function
then we've got to save playlists so
here let me create a constant variable
constants are variables whose values
will not frequently change we'll take
all the track uris dot state dot
playlist tracks
will be dot map create a temporary
variable called track track dot uri so
we actually want to go and
now save this on uh spotify so that's
the reason we'll access
spotify's safe playlist method this dot
state dot playlist name comma track uris
and if that is successful we then go
into a callback so that's the callback
anonymous function where we're going to
say this dot set date and the playlist
name that we want to create on spotify
will be called new playlist so that's
the custom
name that i want to provide and the
playlist tracks
define that this closes here
okay so that's for the update on
spotify
now here is where
the render method is going to return the
html now this html is the view and react
simplifies this by having the javascript
and the html in the same
file so you can actually go and access
the variables you've declared in the
script directly in your html view
and synchronize and bind the data
together so it helps from a
maintainability perspective so even
though everything is in the same file
it's well classified and differentiated
into different code blocks so we'll add
the anchor tag and we'd say href is http
localhost so that's the default server
port on which this application will run
okay and we want to give it a custom url
name of musical file so the h1
terminates will then say div class name
equal to app within that this is how
we're going to inject a search bar
that's going to be the search bar
component injected here and on search so
that's the custom event we will call a
method called search so on search we
just call we bind to a method called
this dot search then we'll open up
another div here we'll have class name
equal to app dash
playlist and if you remember that's
exactly the css
class name that we refer to in the css
file we have another component called
search results
that we're going to inject here
and
that's going to be search results here
search results will be equal to this dot
state dot search results so that's how
we can actually go and bind so that's
simple data binding the component is
going to be displayed with the data
bound and if somebody says add if if i
click on the add button for search
results
do these so it will add that new track
to the playlist by calling binding to
the 2ds function and it will remove it
from the search results text box then we
have another component called playlist
and here the playlist tracks will be
bound to this dot state dot playlist
tracks okay so on the top if you look
here we started with defining all the
function declarations in the constructor
then we provided the function
definitions okay that's how and this
that we passed refers to the context
of the current
component itself so whatever you put
into the app component or into the
respective component those values will
be then passed out here to these
individual functions okay so that's with
the playlist couple of things we'll have
to do is if somebody changes the name of
the track so on name change is going to
be another custom event where we have to
call this dot update playlist name and
we also have remove functionality so to
remove a track we would say equal to
this dot remove track on save equal to
this dot
save playlist okay so that's done and we
close this so we seem to be pretty much
on track the export
app will make this all of these
functions accessible across other
components it's very similar to the
public access specifiers etc that you
provide
in other programming languages so that's
done we've created our app component now
let's create another folder under
components and we've got to define all
our various components here this folder
is going to be for the search bar so
we'll name it search bar we'll add two
files within it the search bar dot css
okay and another file that we'll need
here is
search bar dot js
so that's in terms of the search bar
let's start with the css file so we'll
start with first styling search bar we
will say that the display should be flex
flex
direction should be column we want all
the items to be aligned at the center so
that's align item center then we'll add
up padding so padding top
is going to be
6.94 rem and
margin
bottom is going to be
6.33 rem all right now let's add up for
the search bar so that's search bar
we'll add
for the input element we want the width
to be 287 pixels the padding to be 0.880
the border should be 1 pixel solid white
the border radius
will give a slight rounded edge to give
a web 3.0 look and feel so we'll set up
the border radius then we've got uh
margin bottom so we've got a bottom
margin
that we want to add up then we have
color so let's add up the color c3f so
that's the color black then let's add
text alignment of
center and let's add up a font size of
one rem okay so that's how we've set
this up let's add
the search bar input is going to be so
if someone focuses so focus is the got
focus if someone clicks inside so the
end user goes and clicks inside the text
box
we change the outline to none okay and
so for the search bar we are interested
on input and if the input is
focused so that's the event that we are
looking for and then we would have a
button called search button so on the
search button
the cursor will set it to pointer so
that's the cursor pointer the width we
set it to 8.11
rem the padding we are going to set up
to
0.77 rem and 0 the border radius
will set it to 54 pixels so we get a
slightly uh well defined search button
with a nice little border let's also add
background color hash 1 db 954
that gives me a color then i've got
my text alignment let's set that to
center then we've got
a font family let's set up the font
family to the same standard font 80
and it's a part of the sans serif family
then we'll set up the font size
to 0.833
rem correct this
and finally we will need
transition so all of these are basic uh
css properties so that will add a slight
uh transitional effect with a delay of
that many milliseconds
so transition
background color we've provided what
else let me scroll up uh let's also
provide a border here so we'll remove in
fact let's remove the border we would
not want a border on the button that
would look odd so i'll get rid of the
border and color we'll specify as per
our standard color that we've been using
okay so that's the color we've specified
and then i've got font weight of 500.
finally we'll take
the search button and on the search
button we will register for the hover
event so if someone takes their mouse
over the button that's the over the
event in that case if we hover around
the button we would want
the background
color to change so it will appear to
have a slight little glow there a mouse
pointer moves over the button okay so
that's the opacity and the rgb
combination so that completes
the css file for the search bar and we
obviously now need to go and
get the code in for
our search bar component and that's
exactly what we are going to do next so
let's start with setting up the code for
the search bar first thing let's go and
import
react from
react next thing we would want to do is
import
the search bar dot
css file then we define a class called
search bar which extends
react dot
component we define our constructor and
we go and
pass these parameters to the base class
we also define
the state we'll just need one variable
here which is the term to search for in
the search bar and then let's say this
dot
we'll define a function called handle
term change which is going to be equal
to this dot handle handle term change
dot
find so that's going to be the first
function then a function that will do
the searching for us
which is this dot
search so that's the search function and
we'll have it bind to this then we've
got this dot
handle
enter so the moment we enter into that
search text box
handle enter dot find this
so the functions are ready now let's go
for the first one which is handle term
change
we'll pass it a system defined keyword
of event this dot
set state and for the term
we will use the event keyword we will
get
the value that is there inside that text
box the moment the search term the user
is entered changes so the search
criteria changes we trap the updated
value then in the search function we
will update the local property props dot
on
search
okay so we'll access the on search and
pass it the updated term and then we got
the handle enter on which uh we're also
going to pass the system define event
keyword so if there's any data flowing
along with the event we are interested
in it in this case the data is the key
code that the user is pressing and if it
is 13 that indicates that's the ascii
key code for the enter button so if the
enter is hit then the user is completed
entering the search criteria and we need
to start searching and that's where we
write our render method that's going to
render the html view and we return the
complete view here so that's the view
now that we want to return let's say
diff class name equal to search bar then
on the input text box
we will use placeholder equal to enter
song album
or artist that you want to search for on
change
on the on change event the moment the
term changes we connect that to handle
term change we already have an
function that manages that and the
moment
keys are pressed and released so on key
up is where we would want to connect to
this dot handle enter okay and this is
place bracket that i'll have to put up
here so in the render function uh we're
going to return a value i shouldn't
forget to export the search bar okay so
that's uh what i want to export so we've
exported that okay so at the end of this
what we've done is we've written a
render method we've written our div tag
here is where we'll go and close
the div tag we've added an input and
here is where i'm going to add a button
provide a class name called search
button and the moment the end user
clicks on the button we're going to
connect it to this dot search and we
close
the button tag within the pattern tag
search so that
completes the
render function so in the render
function again let's run through all of
what we've written we started with
extending react.component we then added
a constructor passing props to the super
class constructor we created
state we set it to a value of term and
null so the state currently we defined
as term then we said handle term changes
search and handle enter should be
functions
that we want to add then handle term
changes
we defined search we defined and handle
enter we've also defined then we used
render render we said is going to return
to us
the html that we've specified okay we
dumped all the html that we want this
component to return to us
so on change and on key up are
two functions that uh or two events that
we connected to where we called handle
term change and handle enter then we
added a button where we registered for
the click event and connected it to this
dot search so all the three functions uh
that we
had actually written
so two things we've completed now uh in
the app class
okay if you look at the app class we've
actually defined a set of functions here
that deal with the playlist and adding
applications etc adding tracks delete
removing tracks
then we've created
the search bar okay so we saw that the
search bar also we have specified a set
of functions
and all the functions that we defined we
have taken care to structure every
component separately so the search
component is doing something completely
different which is managing the search
bar we have the core the root app
component in which we have imported all
of the other set of javascript classes
uh that we are creating and that's how
the entire application is now structured
so and that's the core
concept when you're working with react
where you would actually have every
separate
block of
code or every separate functionality
handled in a different component
altogether so we've completed the search
bar component as well so two components
done and two components good to go so
we've got to start up on the next set of
components that we will need to build
and the next component is
the track component that will manage
individual tracks so a new folder a new
file called track.css
and
track.js
so that's going to manage
the tracks for us
so let's start with dot track we would
say display is flex
align items
center border bottom one pixel solid
rgba
256
256
to 56 0.8 that's the opacity then let's
come to track action so we'll use all of
these classes uh when we write up the
html view we'll add a padding here of
0.5 we'll set up a font size
of 1.05
set up a transition color of 0.25
s
border of 0 pixel and
a background color of rgb a
0 0 0 0 color ash
so that's the color that we continue to
use then we bring in track another class
track action and if we hover over this
class we want
the gb values
change to 265 265 2 6 5 5 is the last
parameter so that's the hover then we
have track information so track
information is the next class that we're
dealing with we'll add the flex
parameter first display flex and
then flex
direction
is going to be column let's have justify
content set up as
center and let's have height as
180 pixel so that's a track information
let's have another track information and
the h3 tags nested inside that
for all the h3 tags nested inside that
we need a margin bottom of 0.22
rpm finally let's have track information
and paragraph tag we'll have the font
size
of 0.83
rem and a font weight of 300 and a color
as well that we'll add so let's add up a
color here rgba 2 6 256
256
256 and 0.8 okay so that's uh that's in
terms of the css and let's move to the
track and we'll move into the javascript
file so let's move into so let me take
what we added in the search bar i'll go
to the track.js
this will change to track dot css
okay the constructor this will change to
add track so add track change this to
add track this is
remove track change this to remove track
get rid of this
and that's going to be
the add track function and here we're
going to say uh
this dot props
so we'll modify this this dot
props
dot on add this dot props dot track and
then we have the remove track so that's
going to be the remove track function
this function is not required so this
dot props dot on remove
and this is the track that we would want
to go and remove we'll add up another
function called
render action so this is going to be a
function uh that we're defining called
render action and in this we'll just
check if this dot props dot is
removed if this dot props dot is
removable so in that case
we would want to return so this is a
view action method that we are adding
which is going to go and add this button
with a class called as track action that
we've already written the css for and
this button will actually get added via
this render action function and this dot
remove track is what it's going to map
to let's close this
this is going to point to this specific
function so that's uh the closing button
tag okay so the closing button tag is
what
we've added there and the binding is
what we have done to this dot
remove track and
we will terminate this here so now the
render action uh let's also have the
return here and we just add up the
button and this is going to add track so
you can look at how the component is
completely dynamic
in nature so we have two buttons that
are going to be added this button with
the hyphen is going to remove the track
this button with the plus sign is going
to add the track and you can actually
see how simply it was done in a render
action function so the render action
function actually helped
with
checking that if
on the value of the props
and if the user
depending on
the action performed you will actually
be able to remove a track or add a track
from the existing playlist okay and then
uh
the class name here is now going to be
track the class name for
uh the enclosing div inside it so let me
get rid of this the class name for the
enclosing div here
is going to be
track dash information within it we'll
add h3 we'll bind to this dot props dot
track dot name so the name of the track
is going to get bound here then in the
paragraph we will bind to this dot props
dot track dot artist
and
with some gap this dot props dot track
dot algo so that's what uh we've data
bound to
and then let me add an iframe an iframe
allows us to uh very easily inject some
content into the page within a small
embedded window the source parameter of
the frame is going to be https
open dot so here i'm connecting to the
spotify stream
spotify.com slash
embed slash track and close this so
that's the spotify stream that we are
going to connect to and this dot props
dot track dot id so that's the track id
the width is going to be 300 the height
parameter this the height parameter is
going to be 80 of the iframe and
the frame order is going to be zero and
the allow
transparency so that's the opacity we'll
say true
let's add allow
encrypted media so if spotify has
encrypted media that also would be
embedded here and we can also have the
title set to preview
so that's uh with the iframe okay at the
bottom is where we would want to so this
could be an empty element and we can
close it
right around here so we wouldn't need
this part and then here i'm just going
to say this dot
render action so we call the render
action method uh which will actually
give us plus minus button to add and
remove a
new element okay and that's
what we can actually go and add up there
so let's check now whether uh all that
we've done is good to go fine so
everything looks good
in terms of the track component now and
we have all the functions in place it's
now time to jump into the
next component that we would require
after the track component and
that's going to be the track list so
this is going to be a list component
that will comprise of a list of tracks
inside it so we'll create a new folder
call this track list
and that's going to have
track list
css and it's going to have
track list dot js
so that's the track list
component now which
we're going to go ahead and use
and the css we don't need much so let's
just say track list
and we just provide a width of 100
okay that's all we need
in the css so let me add this in the css
file save this
and come to the js file now which is
going to have
the track list code that we will need to
add up so here again i'm going to say
import react
from react we'd also want to import
track list dot css
and
we
also want to go and get track because
this component is going to be made up of
a collection of tracks individual tracks
so we want to get this from track slash
track and we'll define class track list
which is going to go and extend
react dot
component
we just need the render method here
because this just needs to go it does
not really have any state of itself it
simply goes and returns a list of
individual tracks
so this class name is going to be track
list
and we'll bind to this dot props dot
tracks dot map create a temporary
variable
and this will go and return the track
component which is going to bind to
individual track data the key is going
to be track dot id
so the key is going to be
track dot id
and on add on adding a new track we want
to bind to this dot properties dot and
we already have on add defined so that's
what we connect to we add up my
base bracket here okay and
then we would also need
is removal
equal to
this dot props dot is
removal and the on remove will do this
dot prop start on remove so that's for
the track removal and
so we've got our track list
oh yes we'll have to go and
also close the tip tag correctly and
also we need to go and export so we'll
have to go and export the track
list so we've got one more component
done which is track lists and let's move
on to the next component now so we've
got app which is root we've got the
search bar that takes care of entering
the search criteria we've got individual
tracks that are searched and returned
and we've got a track list that manages
a set of track records so the track is
more relevant to the playlist and then
we've got the search results also to
manage once we search for some set of
tracks so we'll add a new folder which
manages search results
and this is going to have
search results dot css
and it's going to have
search results dot js okay so we need a
search results dot css and js and here
in the css file we'll keep it simple for
the search
results so we'll say search results
we'll set up the width of
50
we set up the height of 950
pixels
we'll say
overflow y is
scroll we'll say padding is 0.88
rem background color will be rgba
95
23 23 0.7 and we will use the box model
so we'll provide a shadow dropping
shadow of zero four pixels to pixels to
pixels ash
and then uh let's add a scroll bar so
webkit
and mozart are the constants specific to
mozilla and
chrome browsers
so they target certain animated features
etc
or properties
that are specific to those individual
browsers that's the reason we use those
constants
and then we'll also add a media query
that if it goes with a max
with one zero two zero pixels
in that case dot search results
width is ninety percent
with a margin bottom of two are
okay so
we're going to add hyphen so it's hyphen
webkit scroll bar zero pixel width
and we've set
transparent background so that's that's
about it with
the css i need to get to the uh js file
now let's move to the search results uh
js file and that's where we will now
have to go and add up the component code
for search results
and let me take
pick this up from track list
add it up here this will be
search results and
we need the results will return to us a
list of tracks so we'll have to get uh
track list this will be tracked list
and
i'm just going to return class name will
also be search
results so that's the component and this
is going to export out search results so
it's accessible across
other components then we've got h2 with
results let's go and create
track list with a set of tracks and we
will bind it to this dot props
dot search results and on the on add we
are going to bind to this dot props dot
on add so we already have that so that
uh basically completes
search results and
that leaves us with the last component
which is going to manage the playlist
for us so we'll add up a new books we'll
add up a new folder in components
and that's going to be playlist
and within that
we will have a playlist dot css
and
uh playlist dot js
so that's our
playlist component now that
we're going to work with and the
playlist component is
uh we'll first set up
the css that we will need
to add up to the playlist and i'm just
going to
pick that up from my code snippet so
that's my playlist and let me get all of
that css here so that's uh just the css
for the playlist nothing to do with
react again pure css uh let me get uh
into the js file and that's where we
will need to go and add all of our
component code so again let me go to the
track.js
the track list rather let me get this
and add it
out here we'll make some small changes
this is going to be playlist
i need to import the track list
because the playlist is going to contain
a list of tracks
this is going to be
playlist
and let me
here this will be playlist and we'll
leave this
for later okay let me also get
the constructor in so we'll add up the
constructor here and just one
function that we will need here which is
handle name change you know if i need to
change the name of the playlist so
handle name change and that's exactly
the function that we will need to write
code for so that's the event
and this dot props
dot on name change that's when we'll say
event dot target
dot value so we get the updated playlist
name
coming to the render we now need the
input input
is going to be on change equal to
this dot
handle name change
the default
value we have already provided with a
hard coded value which is new playlist
so that's the default value if
not provided then we'll just pick up the
default value then we've got
track list so track list is
what i will add the tracks i'm going to
bind to this dot props dot playlist
tracks
so we're going to bind this to playlist
tracks
and here we will say
is
removal equal to
true and on remove
equal to we'll bind that to this dot
props
dot on remove finally we'll need a
button we will use
class name equal to playlist
dash
save that's what we've added in the css
click equal to this dot props
dot on save and here we're going to say
save to spotify so that's with the
playlist and yes we need to go and
export playlist and not track list
now we need to
do a quick lookup
in spotify so let's go to this website
called developer.spotify.com
and once once we sign in uh and create
an id it takes us to our dashboard uh
that's where we can create a sample
application
the name of the application will be
musico file okay and
we'll say that we are building uh some
kind of desktop app for example for
which we want to uh connect this to and
we'll also need to provide uh so we'll
say next
refresh the dashboard so it's
asking me for a login so let me login
once more so moment i login that's going
to be description and i'll say maybe
this is why i need it i'll say no not
commercial integration agree with the
terms and conditions and we will say
submit
and that's the application that has got
created and now i can say edit settings
and
the redirect url here is what is
important
so it should accept connections from
http localhost 3000 that's the port on
which we will host our application okay
and we'll say save okay so that's uh
now there's a client id that is
generated here for my app which is
unique so i'll just copy that up let me
come up to my application under the
source folder i'm going to add a new
folder called util and under that a new
file called spotify.js
so we will start with
adding our code to the spotify.js file
that we've just created as a new file
within the newly created util folder the
first line of code is going to define a
client id variable that equates to the
client id uh that we will generate on
spotify so this is going to be the
spotify generated client id which is a
unique id associated for the developer
to connect to the spotify api and we
will look at the source of that as we go
through the demo the next variable that
we'll create is the redirect url or
let's call it redirect uri and that will
equate to localhost colon 3000 which is
the port and we'll create another
variable called the access token let's
also create another constant variable
called spotify and this will work like a
function expression so we'll equate it
to a function called get access token
and we will say if access token is true
then return the access token now let's
declare a constant variable called
access token match which will be equal
to window dot location dot href dot
match
and we will say this is equal to access
token which will be equal to and we will
give a regex expression to do a pattern
match ampersand so that we can actually
get into the url and extract
the token information from that and
hence
the patent match is crucial here another
constant
variable called
expires in match
equal to window dot location dot href
dot match here we will read the expiry
information using another edge x
expression from the url ampersand
asterisk so that's the second constant
variable we've created now we will say
if access token match and
expires in match in that case
the access token should be equal to
access token match of one then we create
a variable called
expires in equal to we'll do a typecast
to number and we will take the first
parameter from the expires in match
that's done then we will say window dot
set timeout and we're going to say
access token equal to comma expires in
multiplied by thousand then we will say
window dot history dot push state and we
will say access token we pass the second
parameter as null the last parameter as
slash and close this and we will return
access token else
we will say const access
url equal to https
accounts dot
spotify.com slash
authorize
client underscore id equal to dollar
client id ampersand response type equal
to token ampersand scope equal to
playlist dash
modify so we're actually building the
url that will now get generated so we'll
say modify dash public and redirect
url equal to dollar redirect uri so we
have constructed the url now that will
go out and get generated in the browser
and here we are going to say window dot
location equal to access url then we
will add the search criteria function
which accepts a term as a parameter to
search on here we will say constant
access token equal to spotify dot get
access token so we get a reference to
the same access token return we call the
fetch function and we're going to pass
https
api dot spotify dot com slash
v1 slash
search question mark that's the query
string that we will add type equal to
track and ampersand g equal to dollar
and we will pass term comma as the
header information we will need to pass
the authorization where we will say that
the pairer is dollar access token dot
then response
return response dot json dot then so the
return of this function once it
completes we will then call the next
function so json response
and then we will say
return response dot json after that
another then block so we'll now say json
response
and if
not
json response dot tracks
in that case we will return
an empty array else
we will return json response dot tracks
dot items dot and we will pass we'll
create track as
a variable with a lambda expression and
we'll create a temporary json object
with id and that's where we want to
associate track dot id that was returned
as the search result the name is going
to be associated with track dot name the
artist is going to be associated with
track dot artist of zero dot name the
album is going to be track dot album dot
name and the uri we will equate track
dot url so that completes uh this block
will open the next and we this will be
the save playlist which will take the
name and the track uris and here we will
check if not
name or
not track uris dot len in that case we
simply return out of the code and then
we declare a constant variable called
access token which will be equal to
spotify dot get access token so we get a
reference to the access token we then
declare headers authorization bearer is
going to be dollar access token and
we'll create a user id and now we will
return the fetch result where we will
pass
https api dot
spotify.com slash v1
me so that's the url comma headers will
be the header information then we call
the then function declare response as a
variable use the lambda expression and
access response dot json we use the then
block to declare json response
here we say user id equal to
jsonresponse.id and then we return fetch
https
api.spotify.com
slash v1 slash users slash dollar of
user id slash playlist so this is how
we've constructed the urls manually here
we will say assign headers to the
headers variable we'll assign method as
post so the data is sent as part of the
body and not as part of the url and as
the body we will say
json.stringify to convert this parameter
name
and then we will generate a response
variable to response dot json and then
we'll create json response with the
lambda operation we'll create a constant
playlist id which is equal to json
response dot id we will return fetch
https
api.spotify.com
v1 users
dollar user id slash playlist slash
dollar again we are constructing the url
so playlist id will be replaced here
then we will say tracks
and close this comma and here again we
will say headers would equate to the
headers variable be constant headers and
this
goes here okay everything fixed now so
here we're going to say headers should
equate to headers and
the method is going to be post and the
body is going to be json dot stringify
uris track uris and we close this we
close this block we close this block and
we close this block so that completes
our code uh of course one more thing we
have to do which is export this class
out so export default spotify and that
completes the code for
the
spotify.js which is part of our utils
class so let's move on now to the next
step so
here is
the client id that we'll have to exactly
match so i'll copy this client id and
provide it here so that's the client id
uh that we actually need and we could
also store it
out here
so that's the
client id and that's the redirect url
that we've also defined there and we
just create an access token if a access
token is true we return access token so
the access token is something that we
are going to do a match from
the moment we try and connect
with this particular url and you can
look here that this is the access url
that we are trying to connect with okay
with the client id and post fixed with
the redirect url right and then i've got
a simple search function which returns
an observable so we try to fetch data
using the search term that we provided
okay we try to fetch data using the
search term provided if we are
successful we get a response of the data
and accordingly we'll iterate over the
json response and get a list of tracks
out of it and do a mapping of this json
object to the track id name artist
information album name etc and here uh
just like a data access layer very
similar to a data access layer we've got
a save function which will save this
data to spotify as well so i've got a
save playlist and i've got search so
these are the two functions which will
go and connect to the spotify service
by using this client id and it will
allow me to
access that information in terms of
returning a stream of json data and will
then allow me to
go ahead and push that json data into
our application so now we
actually need to start up the
application so i'll go to the terminal
and rather let me go to view and
bring out the terminal so this is the
integrated terminal that's there in the
tool and it just opens powershell from
which you can actually fire your
commands so i'm going to say node
package manager npm start to actually
start up this application so that's
going to do a full compile and
so we will fire this up give access so i
need to grant access
to that port 3000
let's give it time to run and that's the
app now that
you can actually see here so this is uh
the search bar that we actually had okay
then we had the results we had the
playlist now the results is going to
consist of
a set of tracks which are maintained by
the track list and then you can take
individual tracks with the plus and
minus button and add them into the
playlist okay so that's how
it's typically going to work okay so as
you can view here i am just going to
search for an artist
and we click on the search button it
goes to spotify tries to connect there
and says
that i need to agree to the terms and
conditions
and i've just agreed to that so the very
fact that it actually
gave us
a confirmation link the moment we tried
to connect and execute our application
uh that's proof enough that it actually
went and connected to the
service there and tried to return a
value to us so this is what we did we
just added an artist we said search
and you can see now it's successfully
connected i've got a list of tracks
available from this artist and you can
see the plus buttons getting added on
the fly so that was the render action
these are
buttons that got added onto this list of
tracks dynamically the moment the search
results returned a value
so i can click on this plus sign and you
can see that the track gets added to the
playlist okay as in when i click here so
i've added a couple of tracks
uh if i go back to my dashboard of my
musical file application and that i've
created here in the developers portal of
spotify on
developers.spotify.com it's blank so now
i'm going to click on save to spotify
okay and that clears the playlist
so let me come here
and
now when i come out here we saw that it
actually got
successfully connected out here now i'll
have to log in to so this was the
development app that we actually created
on the developers portal of spotify now
we will go to spotify.com
so i'll just go to the spotify website
and it says do you want to launch the
web player and all that so let me click
on that so it just launches
and can you see here this is the new
playlist that just got added right and
there were four songs that i'd actually
added to the playlist and you can see
here those four songs have got added out
here okay so i can go here and
i can delete this playlist and say i
want to delete it okay so there's no
playlist now i'll go back here
i'll add two tracks and i'll say save to
spotify so that's how you actually saw
that the new playlist you can see the
new playlist has come back here okay and
that's the playlist uh the playlist has
got generated again and that's the new
playlist that
got created and we deleted it but it
still got created again and that
indicates the connectivity
that we successfully created with this
react app and the core concept of the
react app was breaking it down into
components which is the search component
then we created the track component we
created the track list to maintain a
list of tracks uh then we created the
search results which will generate a
list of results which further contains a
track list and this is the embedded
iframe which gave us the response which
is scrollable here and you can see that
the iframes we created allowed us to
scroll this uh with this embedded web
page inside the iframe container so with
that
i hope we've been successful with
explaining the concept of component
based design and architecture with react
and how important it is to create
individual components and the benefit of
that being that you can isolate change
request to a certain component you can
promote reusability wherever you want
the same feature to be implemented on
the page you can just inject that same
component and the same implementation
and the same features can be reused so
it promotes reusability it promotes
flexibility to change it isolates your
change request to single components
preventing the massive effort of
recompiling and retesting the entire
application as a whole
so this is your host amarjeet and i'll
be taking you once again to the similar
tour of angular
and you know it very well previously we
have developed a lot of projects in
angular and this time also we will like
to make sure that we offer you some very
consistent project this time where it
will help you to connect all the dots of
whatever you've learned in an angular so
this particular session will be more
specific towards the project so stay
tuned with me because this time we'll be
offering you a lot of beautiful gui
which can combine together
to understand how angular can be best
suitable for the front-end application
and to make it happen you understand
like in this particular project we'll be
having a basic angular setup ready so
you know it very well to develop an
angular application we have used a
similar technique called
downloading the angular cli version and
we have used ngnu and the name of the
project is project and this particular
project does nothing have only one
single component name called app as you
can see it right now here
under the src you have a got app folder
appcomponent.html
and here you see appcomponen.ts
so that is one of the very very basic
component angular can hold in
so
this edge table contains a very simple
message called welcome and component.ts
contains nothing special it is just
holding one title
and
app app.module.ts if you see it contains
nothing special whatever it comes as a
predefined preloaded it contains only
those particular type of modules
and in my app.module.ts sorry
yeah if you talk about call package.json
inside my package.json we have some
additional dependency added
which i will tell you like what
dependencies a part of angular which
comes as a preloaded are by default
available
now you can see here
animation compiler core forms localized
these are all by default are there a
part of that we have also taken
this bootstrap as an additional
dependency so we talk about called ng
bootstrap
okay which is the additional dependency
we have taken bootstrap jquery oper.js
rxjs which anyways comes by default and
here
these dependencies will be playing
additional role during your development
time okay rest everything gonna be
remain same as it is but yes these
additional dependencies like in jquery
poker and your save tslim
and you talk about like in bootstrap
okay jquery these libraries are
additional to those the one which comes
as a by default
okay so once you have those additional
dependencies added into your project do
not forget that in your angular.json
you need to have uh additional
declarations to be get added
okay as you can see now under the
scripts part
okay under the styles part you see the
under the styles we have kept our
bootstrap dot min.css
and under the scripts we have kept all
those necessary
dependencies with regards to our js
called demo
chart pie chart pi demo you talk about
bootstrap you talk about jquery so these
are the additional dependencies we have
kept under the scripts part which is
here under your wrangler.json
okay and under the styles we have about
bootstrap through which we can directly
include these bootstrap related stuff
directly into my project
so that would be the first thing which
will start with okay so
if i want to start my application i will
certainly say npm space start let me say
npm space
start
it is launching my application
okay please use sudo
now it is launching
and under the port number 4200 my
application will be
starting up now it is saying port maybe
this application is ready somewhere
so
let me check if it is available
okay so application is already running
so inside my 4200 if i try to run i can
see this by default message welcome
appears so that's the only thing with
regards to your project so nothing fancy
it is just a basic stuff your
application have some basic set of
dependencies added and along with this
uh you have some
new dependencies and you just you say
npm space start and under the localhost
4200 your project will get ready
okay so in my previous example you
remember like we have created and done
with our basic setup and now it's time
for us to go back and create some new
component into my project
now what are the first component i'm
looking forward for that is called
navbar for creating a navigation so
inside this first of all i want to open
the new one
okay so i want to say ng space g space c
space
nav bar
so let the new component get ready okay
so we have got never component ready
with me
so this is what my navbar is and inside
the snapbar i want to add some
additional dependencies inside my html
okay so here
i may have lot of tags associated with
me
but here i want to start with my body
tag
okay so this is what i want to start
with my body tag
okay and here onwards we want to start
all my development so within my body tag
i will be writing a lot of other tags
too but first of all let me try to have
some additional dependencies to be get
added here
so i want to add the div
and here i would like to have some
additional dependencies to be get added
as you can see right now it is for
jquery it is for your bootstrap it is a
scripts
okay this is for
charts this is for chart areas data
tables so these dependencies are very
much required in order to start your
basic development
okay and i want to continue
developing this example by adding some
new logic one by one
okay now what logic i want to add it now
so i will be using bootstrap as a basic
code
okay so first of all i want to use the
body
with some body
class equal to i want to give this name
called sb hyphen
nav
hyphen fixed
that is actually the bootstrap class
which we're associating with here
and here after that
we'll be starting with my div tag
so after body
here see this is the sb hyphen nav
hyphen fix which we have used now i'll
be using some
nav tag now
and inside my nav tag i want to say
class
equal to
sb
hyphen
top nav
space
nav bar
space
nava hyphen
expand
okay space nav bar
hyphen we want to use the dark theme so
i'll be using
nav for hyphen dark and space bg
hyphen
dark
so this is the first thing we are using
it now now inside my nav
okay we want to use few more important
details like i'm saying like anchor
okay so with this anchor i want to say
a
before hdf we want to say class
equal to navbar
never hyphen brand
okay space nav bar
or else we can say hrx
we can use this
just add this single quotation and just
say h ref hr is equal to
index dot
html to go back
and after this will be also using
this img tag also so we just use this
img
src will be using some logo
okay which will be there under the
assets
okay under the assets i'll be having
logo dot
png
okay and we would like to also
uh say some controlling this
some width and height so we just use
width equal to what 80 percent
okay and we want to use
height
equal to 120 percent
so where's 80 percent height 120 percent
alt is maybe something optional you want
to give it i just want to leave it now
we do not want to give art as an
alternative
and if you also want to give style
so i say style
equal to now i say padding
hyphen top
colon
here i say
10
pixels
okay that's it so that's where exactly
the main logic is let me try to bring
this back
okay and here the anchor tag is closed
after this i'll be using my
button diagonal
this button we want to add some class
class equal to btn
space btn
hyphen
link
followed by btn hyphen sm because i want
to have a small size button and i want
to say order
iphone 1
space
order
iphone
lg hyphen zero
okay
followed by id
equal to
sidebar toggle
what i'm saying sidebar toggle
and after that some more new properties
like in h ref i do not want to go
anywhere so i'm just saying
hrf equal to what
hash
in the single quotes
like this
okay and that's it
so within this button
i would like to offer
some i class so here i say i class i
class
equal to
uh
[Music]
okay fasfa hyphen bars
okay this is a special class available
and
that's it
which is there
now here the i class is getting close
and here the button is getting close now
okay so this is the first part of my
code now
okay now we talk about call navigation
or nav bar search so here i'm starting
with my
never
search
okay so inside my navbar search we would
like to offer some more new number of
fields so called form
okay so i start with my form
now with this form
i
may not say action for a time being so
i'm just removing this action from this
instead we are saying form class
equal to
d
d hyphen
none
space md
hyphen
inline
okay hyphen block
hyphen
block
okay so md hyphen inline iphone block
after that you have to suggest form
hyphen
and here you see inline because i want
to go ahead with the inline form
and also ml
hyphen auto
space mr hyphen 0
space mr hyphen md
hyphen
3
my iphone
2
space my iphone md
hyphen 0
so this is what all about our form but
within this form is not yet closed it is
just a first portion of the form plus
along with this will be also offering
the dip class so we just use dim
here i say
class
equal to
input hyphen
group
input hyphen group
and
now inside this input axis group i want
to use input class
input type equal to text
and here i say class
input
class equal to
form
hyphen
control
for hyphen control we would like to add
few more classes here first it is form
control type equal to what type it is a
type text and now we say
placeholder equal to
search
for
okay this is the property for me but i
want to use it
and
a part of that
search for we're giving it so since it
is giving so we do not need to give
double quotes
search for s single quotes is ok now and
now
area
hyphen
level equal to
search
one second let me try to make it
okay search here and
followed by a few more properties
so the first property i'm trying to use
it a part of this area search we say
area
hyphen
okay
described by and here we give the value
called basic iphone
hyphen
add on to
okay so this is how we are trying to add
it now
after this what next
after this we would like to use another
div tag now
div
and here we say
class
equal to
inside this class we may offer a few
more details
uh
okay like i can see input group
input iphone
hyphen group
iphone
append
okay that is a div class and inside this
div class
i would like to use also another button
here we say
class equal to
btn space vta
hyphen
primary okay type equal to what it is a
button
so
that's it
and after that within this button i
would like to use
i
class
equal to
fs space fa hyphen
search
okay that's it so this is how we are
making it
first and now we'll be going ahead with
the next level okay so let's get started
with the next point now so we have
finished our div and dip form now let me
try to organize it properly
okay
now the div div and this part is getting
close and now we would like to talk
about our network part
okay so here
i'm starting with the nav point so here
accelerometry
and here i give the name for never
just to tell you like this would be the
nava related
stuff
here i'll start with my url tag now so
inside my ewl i say you will space
class equal to
number
okay so we have a call navbar hyphen
nav
okay space ml
hyphen
auto
space ml hyphen
md
iphone 0
so that is for my ul so within this ul
i'll be having
some ally class also so we have got li
within this li i'm saying
class
equal to
now what are the details i want i say
nav hyphen
item
okay nav hyphen i item space
drop down
okay so now hyphen item space what a
drop down
now within this
li tag okay i want to use lot of other
tags too
so first tag i'm using this is called
anchor tag
okay
so
in this anchor tag we want to say a
and followed by
class equal to
well i'm saying nav hyphen
link
followed by drop down
hyphen toggle
okay after this space id
equal to
user
drop down
okay id equal to what user drop down
href
equal to you just make it as just a hash
because i'm not taking anywhere
after this hash we say roll
equal to
button so roll will be a button type
and the job doesn't get over here we
also have some option called
data hyphen
toggle
okay data hyphen toggle equal to drop
down
equal to drop down
space we also want to use some area
has pop-up
okay you can see there's a property
called idiot has pop-up so i just said
true
use exactly it does have
and we also want to say area hyphen
expanded
you see now area hyphen expanded we are
also saying
false
apart of that
we also want to use some image within
this
so
image
so in this image we want to say src
src will be entered
okay
assets under the assets it will be under
id
dot
png this is already sorry jpg
there's already one value available
inside this id png alt we don't want it
as of now
if you want you can add it otherwise i'm
just leaving it blank i'm just using
this option called style equal to
now
border hyphen
border
hyphen radius
okay this hyphen border it is how much
you want to give i'm saying 50
that is a css style okay and followed by
width
how much weight you're giving it i'm
saying 50 pixels
50
pixels
okay
that's the whole idea for this
now the anchor tag is getting closed
okay so here the anchor tag is closed
after the acme tag is closed we would
like to give another tip class now for
the drop down
so we say
this div class will have some of the set
of properties which is available i say
div
class equal to
drop down
okay hyphen menu
and followed by
iphone
menu

you can see this option called label by
okay equal to give the option name
called user
drop down i'm just giving the value user
drop down
value has been given now within this div
tag itself will be adding some new more
values
what those values will be i am saying

that's the value
for activity log
okay anchor tag is getting close now
here after that we use another tab tag

okay so in this div tag we want to use
class
equal to drop down hyphen item
drop down hyphen
item and
i would say by the dropping iphone
divider
drop down hyphen
divider as a value and
in the same div tag

we're using one more okay
and class
equal to drop down hyphen

drawdown item item hrx equal to
give the value the one which you want to
give it i'm saying hash
okay
it's ref equal to what hash
let me close this
yeah h f equal to hash and uh
we just use router link
equal to as you know it very well
in typical navigation we always use the
router link rather than normal href and
here we are giving the name call what
login
okay and here we can use
router link active equal to
active
okay
and here we get the name called logout
log
[Music]
out okay so that's the value which we're
giving it now anchor tag is closed and
here the div tag is closed li ul and nav
so let me organize it
this one

there's another div tag is getting
closed and after that
another dip drag will be included
okay
and that's it body will be closed post
that
okay so there are a lot of space let me
try to remove
that's it so now let me format it
let's avoid this always create confusion
so guys our navbar component is ready
and after that we go back and try to add
few more things into my code now we're
going to create a few more components
into my code so first component a part
of this
what we have seen i'm going to create
one more component name called toggle so
ng space g space c
space
toggle
okay a part of that we want to create
few more components here there is one
routes
so ng space g space c space
routes
okay
so this component is ready along with
this
as we know it very well
like uh there are certain components
which we have created we also would like
to create few more components into my
application
okay by saying
um ng
space g space c
space uh
[Music]
let's see
so under the routes we have got what
charts is another component which we
have seen now
okay now in a similar way i would like
to create one more component under the
routes and that is one for login
component is ready along with this login
we would like to create a register
and
along with this we would like to also go
back and create one more component here
that is also called
password
so charts login register password
so four components are ready now and
they're all inside what they're all
inside under the roots
okay so these all components are now
ready with me and we'll be basically
making all those components
associated inside my routes part
clear now so which component used what
that we have to basically consider it
now
so since they are all of the components
now
so under my
app.routing.model.ts we have to
basically provide a routings here now so
here we know conspire routes equal to
blank so let me try to say
path
okay path colon
if nothing is being given so the by
default component will be what
component will be
nav bar
component
so this network components automatically
comes up here
after that
if
path is of what
is static
component
is what
toggle component
okay and here we are saying
path match
colon
okay
along with this we're giving one more
path
colon login
so here
component
colon
login component
i'm going to put comma
component c small
okay now like this next we talk about
call path
colon
register
okay and here
component colon
register component
now let's talk about what path colon
what
change
password
so here we say
component
comma
component colon
which command we are trying to say
password component
component next
we want to say path
colon
charts
then
component column
charge component so these are the
components are now available to me so
these components are now all set and
later on we'll be combining all the
files together
in my system one by one
okay everybody so over all components
are now all ready so you see like we
have got navbar
which contains all the necessary
tags whichever is required for my
application
here we have a basically the login and
this login.component.html
actually contains all the relative part
which is
related to your login like you can talk
about call
email you talk about your password you
have a call remember me and forgot
password these type of details are
available inside your
logincomponent.html now so this is
basically the code okay which contains
your login related stuffs now so it
contains only few properties like you
talk about like email address
it contains what a password and only the
buttons through which user can
login through
followed by when i see my
password so this
password
file that is called
password.component.html
it contains the details
regarding to your password so that the
user can
give the password details or in case the
user has
or want to change the password so we can
give the details like okay you can enter
your email id
address where i can send the password to
you so here
we have this email address we haven't
implemented your
i would say any kind of
sending the email to your
uh registered email id that logic hasn't
been implemented but it's just for the
demo like how exactly you can bring this
password
forgot condition inside your system now
so this is what the password and here we
have a link for the login and here we
have all registration
followed by if you think about call
register register contains that
register.component.html and here if you
see there are a few details which i'm
expecting from the user like in first
name last name email password confirm
password so these are the quick fields
which i'm expecting from the user to
enter
and here it's a button for
you know
confirming a password and this is what
exactly the links which are available
for the login
okay and for the login.html file so this
is a simple registration form which is
available to me
and that is last which is available for
me for that for me that is called
toggling part
in toggle part we are just offering
the details with regards to your how in
case if you want to toggle you can
change the settings okay based on
between the settings and activity
okay so these are the links which are
available through which you can change
all different type of toggling part
whether you would like to enable or not
enable
this is something which is related to
your page in case if you click on that
link so 401 page 404 page 500 page which
will be available to us
now let's try to run the code and check
how the finance application really looks
like in
okay so now i'm trying to run my
application
by
saying
npm space start once again
okay
okay
and now i'm trying to say
in game space start
let the project start now
and we'll see how it really looks like
it
so it is compiling all the files
okay and finally let's try to execute
localhost 4200
let me see what is an issue right now
okay let me check meanwhile try to run
it run it again
okay now i finally uh i'm into my
current project right now so
it was the wrong location where the
project was available so
i just like to say npm space start and
let the project run
so project is picking up till the time i
say localhost 4 double zero
and beautiful guys this is how exactly
projects really looks like it
isn't is an amazing right now
see how beautiful your project really
looks like in
this is what exactly the dashboard you
have it and this is the nav bar which is
available to you
getting it now see how better and
beautiful it looks and organize so this
is like in real time dashboard which is
available you can see the bird days we
have it
we talk about you know company
announcement
quick links these are all basically
available these are the charts which you
can see can give some dummy values and
these are the charts will be really
available to you
so this is how the employee records
which we had it which we are displaying
it right now and this is how exactly the
chart looks like it
so weekly analysis and monthly analysis
this is a dashboard
and here the links are there but they
are all dummy links we haven't made it
but you can certainly make it further
okay you can search for
anything but it is not working right now
because it is just for the display
because nothing more than that it is a
home which you can see written like in
profile this is like the profile which
we have created
by default the name is called kate adams
uh and this is resignation like an
account it
and uh
like you can talk about like home under
the home you have a profile we have
called settings
so nothing is there as such in the
settings so it is just a static record
attendance
it will be bringing you back to the same
page we have a call confirmation
travel expenses these are basically the
dummy links which are available we
haven't made it
which you can
see new development
okay part of that you see like profile
we have it settings
account activity if you see we have
called login and register this three
page if you remember we have created it
under this system
so you can see we have a got login we
have a call register we have a call
password
these are you are able to see this now
when you say change password you see
like how they have given to you they're
not actually working but they're just
like in dummy option and you can see it
will be taking you directly to the sign
up option
okay
now here
in your
settings once again
you can look forward for the login
it works like in
a typical model how it comes
apart of that we also have this
call register
so these are the fields of registration
form
and
you see about activity activity we have
because these pages are available there
are basically dummy pages which we have
created download confirmation so really
it this project really gives you the
kind of sense of in real time how
your
application angular application can
really
make your
ui more attractive which are more
competitive in market so i hope you guys
love this project so we have developed
most of the codes by our own
except few
which we have taken it from uh
online that is nothing but call uh
especially those images as well as
uh what to say some javascript related
libraries if you see which we are using
it right now here you think about think
about this uh
your
navbar.com.html if you see like these
are the libraries we have taken it from
internet
because certainly we don't type it
because it is taking long time to type
certainly we have taken from internet
and some images also we have taken it
from the internet which are there under
the assets folder too
so if you see under the assets we have a
lot of images like an area chart bar
chart chart so this we have downloaded
from the internet
so hope you guys love this project thank
you very much and happy learning
