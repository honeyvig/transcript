welcome to today's video where we
explore a critical aspect of cyber
security that acts as a shield against
cyber threats imagine your
organization's Network as a fortress
with valuable data and services housed
within but how do we protect this
Fortress from external attacks in the
dynamic world of cyber security one term
stands out demilitarized zone or DMZ
it's not just a buzzword it's a
strategic te defense mechanism today we
delve into how a DMG Works using a real
world example and a compelling case
study in the vast landscape of internet
security breaches are unfortunately not
uncommon let's consider example where a
prominent company faced a significant
security compromise a XYZ Corporation a
leader in the industry fell victim to a
targeted attack on their web
infrastructure as cyber attackers
exploited vulnerabilities in XYZ
corporations web servers the potential
impact on users data and the company's
reputation was massive now let's see how
having a DMZ in place could have changed
the game but before we dive deeper let's
look at some staggering statistics
according to cyber security report 2023
67% of organizations fac data breaches
in the past year costing an average of
$3.8 million per incident so let's delve
into DMZ the silent protector of
networks and before commencing just a
quick info for you if you an aspiring
cyber security professional looking for
online training and certification from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts to
enhance your credibility then search no
more simply learns postgraduate program
in cyber security from MIT University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
a right choice this course is designed
to accommodate a diverse range of
Learners this course requires just a
bachelor's degree with a 50% of average
and no prior programming experience
needed and one plusus year of work
experience is preferred for more details

register your opinion in the comment
section below so let's get started so
the first thing we will see is what is
DMZ so the DMZ is a buffer zone that
exist between an organizations internal
Network and the external untrusted
network typically the internet the
primary purpose of a DMZ is to provide
public access to certain services like
web email and DNS service while keeping
the minimum or internal Network secure
the separation is achieved through
Network segmentation using Fireballs to
control and monitor traffic flow I will
show you the diagram for that but before
that we'll see why we need DMZ so let's
consider a scenario where we will be
operating without a DMZ so imagine a
company we will name it as XYZ
Enterprise which provides online
services and host its web servers
directly within the internal Network
without utilizing a DMZ so let's see so
this will be the scenario for that so an
attacker discovers a vulnerability in
XYZ Enterprises web server software so
it will get direct access to internal
Network exploiting this vulnerability
the attacker gains unauthorized access
to the web server so with direct access
to the internal Network the attacker
navigates to the internal systems
potentially compromising sensitive data
and critical infrastructure so the
consequences without DMZ you can see
that is the unrestricted access so the
attacker having breed the web server
gains direct access to the internal
Network without any barrier the second
is data compromise sensitive customer
data proprietary information and
critical systems are at risk of being
compromised and you can see like you
would have the third consequences that
could be the widespread impact the
attacker can move laterally potentially
affecting multiple systems and causing
widespread damage so now you could see
why we need a DMZ so the first reason we
could give is isolation of external
exess so with DMZ a DMZ acts as an
isolated Zone allowing Public Services
like web servers to be hosted separately
from the internal Network in case of a
breach the impact is confined to the DMZ
only and without DMZ operating without a
DMZ exposes the entire internal Network
to potential threats allowing attackers
unrestricted access and then we have
controlled access points so with DMZ
dual Fireballs control and monitor
traffic ensuring that only authorized
and necessary traffic passes between the
external and internal networks without
DMZ without control access points there
is a higher risk of unauthorized access
to critical internal resources and there
will be reduced attack surface also
so this is why we need DMZ now let's
move and see the diagram for the DMZ and
you could see that there are two
firewalls this is the Enterprise land
and then we have one firewall and then
we have the DMZ Network and then the
next firewall and then it's connected to
the internet so let's see the
Architectural Components for a DMZ so
this is the external fire fold the first
line of defense that is in the right
side that is positioned between the
external network internet and the DMZ so
it filters incoming and outgoing traffic
based on security policies allowing only
specific authorized traffic to enter the
or exit of the DMZ and then comes the
DMZ Network so this host the service
that are accessible from the external
network this includes servers like web
servers email servers and DNS servers
these services are isolated from the
internal Network but accessible from the
internet and then we have internal
firewall so this serves as the second
line of defense located between the DMZ
and the internal Network or the
Enterprise land it provides a further
layer of filtering ensuring that only
traffic meeting the strictest security
criteria can access the internal Network
so this was about the Architectural
Components now we will understand the
operational flow for this so in the
operational flow first we'll see the
incoming traffic so incom traffic from
the Internet is first intercepted by the
external firewall So based on predefined
rules the firewall determines which
traffic can process to the DMZ so this
typically includes request for web pages
email communication and DNS queries
server handling in the DMZ now we'll see
the server handling in the DMZ so once
in the DMZ the traffic is directed to
the appropriate server for example web
request go to the web server email
traffic to the email server so Etc these
servers are configured to handle
requests from the internet process them
and if necessary initiate outgoing
responses and then we have restricted
internal access so if a service within
the DMZ needs to communicate with the
internal Network for example a web
application requiring access to a
database the internal firewall evaluates
this request only traffic confirming to
the most string security policies is
allowed through this minimizes the risk
of external threats reaching the
internal Network and then we have
outgoing traffic responses from the DMG
servers are sent back through the
external firewall to the requesting
users on the internet the internal
firewall ensures that any communication
from the DMZ to the internal network is
legitimate and safe so these were the
operational flow now we'll see the
security mechanisms so the first
mechanism is firewall policies Define
which types of traffic are allowed or
blocked at both the external and
internal firewalls and then we have
intrusion detection and prevention
systems idps that is deployed within the
DMZ to monitor for and act against
malicious activity and then we have
service isolation so services in the DMZ
are limited to what is absolutely
necessary for Public Access reducing the
potential attack service and then we
have regular monitoring and update so
continuous monitoring and traffic and
updates to services and security devices
help maintain the security posture of
the DMZ so these were the security
mechanisms now we'll see the purpose of
a DMZ so the first purpose is Network
segmentation and isolation so the
primary purpose of a DMZ is to create a
physical or logical sub Network that
separates an organization's internal
network from external network such as
the internet this separation ensures
that any external access is limited to
the DMZ thereby isolating the internal
network from direct exposure to the
outside world and then the next purpose
is controlled access to Services by
placing services that need to be
accessible from the internet such as web
servers email servers and DNS servers
into the DMZ organizations can control
and monitor access to these services
without exposing their core internal
Network so these are the purpose and now
we'll see the benefits of a DMZ so the
first benefit is enhance security so the
DMZ provides an additional layer of
security it acts as a buffer zone where
incoming traffic from the internet can
be analyzed authenticated and logged
before reaching the internal Network in
case of an attack the DMZ can limit the
threat to the exposed Services
protecting the rest of the network and
then we have isolation of Internet
facing services so services within the
DMZ are separated from the internal
Landor which means that if a service is
compromised the attacker still does not
have direct access to the internal
Network and sensitive data this
isolation helps in containing potential
damage and then we have improved traffic
management with the DMZ in place
organization can better manage and
control traffic flow to and from the
internet this include applying detailed
rules of traffic routing prioritization
and blocking thereby improving the
overall efficiency of network traffic
handling and then we have Regulatory
Compliance so many regulatory standards
require that sensitive data be protected
from unauthorized access a DMZ helps in
achieving compliance by providing a
secure way to offer necessary Public
Services while safeguarding internal
data and then we have the next benefit
that is faciliated service management so
hosting services in a DMZ simplifies
management and monitoring of these
Services as they are logically grouped
in a separate Network this Arrangement
makes it easier to apply patches perform
updates and monitor for anomalies
specifically for internet facing
services and now we'll see the last
benefit that is scalability and
flexibility so DMZ allows organizations
to add new services or scale existing
ones without impacting the security or
performance of the internal Network it
provides a flexible framework that can
be adjusted as the organizations needs
changes and there you have it folks we
