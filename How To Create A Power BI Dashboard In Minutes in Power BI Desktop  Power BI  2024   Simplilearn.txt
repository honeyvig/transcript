description box below to find the data
science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with today's topic which is
about how to create powerbi dashboard in
a few minutes yes you heard me right you
can create a complete powerbi dashboard
or also known as a report in just a few
clicks and a few minutes now in this
particular video we are minimizing the
time in creating dashboard because
sometimes data cleaning process you
already know if you're an expert or if
you are a beginner in data analytics you
already know there are steps in data
report or a dashboard right first you
load the data from a source it can be
Cloud PDF Excel work CSV or anything and
after that you do some data cleaning
right you split the columns or you
eliminate some blank rows blank columns
and some irrelevant data which does not
fit or some um for more reference on
data cleaning you can also refer to the
video which is linked in the description
box below and so right that's the
process so basically you import the data
from The Source clean it transform it
and then load it and then create a
dashboard right so in this particular
video we have the completely cleaned
data set which is really available for
creating report which will be also
linked in the description box below if
you want to follow us along so um with
that uh let's get started right so
that's how it goes now let's have a look
at our data so our data has um some row
ID order ID a date ship date so
basically you can totally understand
this particular data set is about sales
report right let's say I'm working with
XYZ company which is based on data
analytics and I get an email from my
client that he or she wants to know how
exactly the sales are performing in what
exact States or countries and uh what
exact regions and what category of
products or subcategory of products and
what's the sales quantity ordered profit
right so let's say you have a one uh
category or subcategory or a product
which is giving you High number of sales
and profit right you want to improve
more you can increase the price or let's
say you have some product which is not
performing so well right so you can uh
offer some uh discounts let's say like
50% off so that you can move out the
product from your store right so some uh
basically if you analyze the data and
you come up to a decision where which
product is performing in which region or
state or country and which product is
performing and not performing in which
region state or country right you can
come up with a strategy for sales and
improve your Revenue so that's the
entire process right so with that said
so this is the data we have and let's
quickly jump onto powerbi and get going
with creating a report or dashboard
within a few minutes right so here we
are on the powerbi desktop so here
absolutely you can see you can import
data from Excel you can import data from
SQL Sero you can import data from a
blank table or use some sample data AP
from that you can also get data from a
different sources as well right see uh
we will be trying to do some automation
right so regarding the automation we can
also uh go through another video from
Simply learn which will help you
understand how to automate the process
of data transformation cleaning and
uploading so uh you can just give the
file location here the folder so I'm
going going to the folder here so it
will give me a new window uh you can go
to browse and I think I have my folder
in
downloads and uh Excel data sets um
Excel I think I'll be having that named
as sales report yes just click okay and
you have the sales report
here you can have a quick preview of the
data so here you have the options
combine load transform data right you
can just directly load because I've said
you that this particular data set is
completely clean and is ready for
reports right so you can just select the
data you want and just load right I'm
doing it this way because let's say uh
for let's not not let's say uh we have
uh the data here and a form in in such a
form that the data is from last 3 to
four years right so let me select it
this
way so in this case as well it will take
the Excel file and uh even if you add
some more data to it it will uh apply
the changes to it right so let's say uh
we have the data for the last four years
2020
209 2021 2 and 3 and since 2024 is not
complet completed yet we are not taking
that data let's say we enter into 2025
then the new data for 2024 gets updated
and loaded onto the same data table and
you don't have to uh you know process
the data once again clean it transform
it load it no that's not going to happen
you can just load the data you can just
drop the data on the Excel spreadsheet
and your dashboard or report will
reflect the new changes automatically
just by refreshing your dashboard right
that's the automation you can do so what
exactly automation is the process where
human effort is not involved and the
computer or your any uh tool that's the
job for you is called as automation
which reduces a lot of time of yours and
you can use that valuable time to plan
on the strategies to improve your
Revenue right that's the overall Moto of
data analytics now that's the uh preview
of the data I'm just going to directly
load it I'm not going to transform it
because uh it's completely clean and
transform data and ready for reports so
here you go and uh you can close if
there are my n errors you can just close
it and uh if you want to check your data
you can go to your data here and you can
have the sample data right here right if
you check the r date not ship date sorry
uh ship date can enter into uh 2023 as
well right so here you have 2020 and uh
the other dates right so you will have
okay let's go to the data filter so you
basically have four years not 2024 right
so uh that's the way if you just add the
2024 data it will automatically reflect
in the visualization now uh all that we
need is create a dashboard or report
which will help us analy some data right
so uh let's get started just double
click on the report section and here you
will have icon or visit which will ask
you what exactly you're looking for
preparing Q&A so I
want region wise sales and I want it in
a bar
graph there you go you have the region
wi sales and bar graph press on okay and
you have it and you can place it
somewhere in the corner then if you want
another one double click and you want
category
wise category
sales and let's take that in pie
chart category sales p and here you have
it press on agree and accept and you
have it over here and ear on-ear sales
in aine
graph sales
by date or sales
by sales by date line graph
here you have it accept that so that you
can identify which is the peak uh
performance ER or Peak Performance date
for us which gave us the highest number
of sales in a certain region right so
here we have it you can place it can
customize it right and now let's go for
subcategory double click and uh
subcategory I think we have a hph a
space there
sales uh the type of chart you want you
can go with the donut
one select that and
it so you have subcategory voice sale
and now let's go with uh region voice I
mean the country voice right so let's go
to the data again here so here we have
segment City State country okay let's go
with country now
right
country country
sales map chart so whenever you
have a region or state or a country
involved go with map charts it's the
best way to represent right so we have
considered European nations over here so
for that reason we have the European
States here and and uh now we can go
with let's go with the data once again
and have a look what else we can do and
shipment mode right so you have the
shipment mode as well so uh you can
identify what type of shipment mode
customers are majorly
preferring shipment mode bar
graph a so basically I think we have uh
three types of shipment mode
let's check the column name of shipment
mode properly ship mode it's not
shipment mode it's ship mode right so
let's type again ship
mode
bar
graph okay shipment mode
sales bar graph there you go so agree
accepted so you have standard shipment
is the most preferred one now now we
have this so let's add some kpis here so
uh kpi of
sales you will adjust that agree there
you go and let's add a kpi
for
profit and you have it
agree kpi for Revenue double click
let's check if we have a column called
Revenue quantity discount profit right
so let's go with
quantity and
discount so revenue is not added so it's
okay so you can identify which uh uh
product or subcategory is highly selling
in in number of quantities so you have
you'll have the Su of profit some of
sales sum of quantity and what else we
left the last one discount and rate
singles discount profit so let's
identify if we have offered
any okay so let's add a kpi or rate as
well if we are completely focusing on a
single product a single category we must
be having uh kpi for rate as well double
click somewhere kpi on
rate there you go accept it and you have
the
completely
formatted dashboard or sales report
ready for a meeting let's close all
these so that we have a better
visualization and you can just go to the
uh SlideShare mode or fit to the page
mode where you can have
it that's good so uh this is how you
create a completely functional fully
functional sales report or sales
dashboard just within a few clicks and
just within a few minutes let's say uh I
want the sales report only for central
region click that and it's completely
interactive and let's say we don't want
that click outside and you will have
everything back to the normal right and
let's say I wanted to focus on a
particular category technology category
alone they have these sales happening
and the subcategory of sales and what
are the products over here right you'll
have that and which is the country uh
happening to ship the most of them and
what's the shipment more preferred by
them and highest performing date or year
so here you can see 2022 June was the
highest performance for sales and uh the
lowest one is somewhere here in March
2020 or something right so that's how
you can create a fully interactive
dashboard or report based on sales data
in a few minutes and in a few clicks and
