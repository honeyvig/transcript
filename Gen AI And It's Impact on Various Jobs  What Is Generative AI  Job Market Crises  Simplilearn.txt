find the course Link in the description
box and in the pin comments so without
further Ado let's get started so let us
first understand what is generative AI
gen aai refers to artificial
intelligence systems that can generate
content such as text images and even
music based on the data they have being
trained on this capability allows AI to
mimic human creativity and thought
processes making it a powerful tool
across various Industries let us better
understand with the help of an example
let's look at a real world example open
AI chat GPT chat GPT is a stateof art
language model that is capable of
generating humanlike text based on the
input it receives it's being used across
various Industries to enhance
productivity and Innovation for instance
imagine you're a content creator in the
past you might have spent hours
brainstorming and writing articles
social media posts or even marketing
copy with chat GPT you can simply type a
few key ideas or topics and AI generates
high quality content just in seconds
this saves you time and allows you to
focus on refining and personalizing the
content to make it perfect for your
audience but it's not just about writing
chat GPT also helps software developers
let's say you're a programmer and you're
trying to solve a coding problem you can
input your code into chat GPT and it
provides suggestions debugs errors and
even writes code Snippets for you this
makes the development process faster and
reduces mistakes and that's not just all
customer service team uses chart GPT to
handle routine inquiries this means
faster response times for customers and
more time for human agents to handle
complex issues it's a win-win situation
so you can see how chat GPT are not just
to replace a job instead they enhance
you how to work making tasks more
efficient and allowing you to focus on a
job more important aspects of your job
and chat GPT is just one example there
are many gen AI tools out there
transforming various Industries now
let's talk about the capabilities of gen
Ai and why it's generating so much of
Buzz so what exactly can geni do well
geni is like a super smart assistant
that can handle a wide range of task
imagine having a tool that can write
essays generate codes create stunning
visuals and analyze complex data all in
a matter of just seconds that's gen AI
for you this versatility is changing the
job market in a big way it's driving new
levels of productivity especially in
creating jobs where people can now focus
more on High level thinking and less on
routine task think of gen AI as the next
big thing similar to steam engine
electricity and the Internet it's not
just about doing routine work faster
geni is opening New Paths for Innovation
and helping businesses reinvent
themselves let me give you an example to
make it more understandable meet Sam a
graphic designer Sam used to spend hours
creating design from scratch but with
the help of gen tools like d E3 Sam can
now put a few input ideas and the AI
generates multiple Design Concepts just
in seconds this frees up Sam's time to
focus on refining and perfecting the
designs making his work more creative
and efficient and it's not just about
creativity geni also can speed up
product development enhance hum customer
experiences and boost employee
productivity in a recent fall of over
2500 Executives 38 person said that
improving customer experiences and
retention was the main reason for their
gen AI Investments other key areas
include Revenue growth and cost
optimization and ensuring business
continuity so you can see the benefits
of gen are vast it's helping businesses
across the world innovate and stay
competitive by transforming how they
operate and deliver value to their
customers let's discuss the different
job sectors impacted by jna according to
a news report the biggest impact will be
on highly skilled professional workers
especially in white color jobs jobs here
are some of the key industries that will
see the most change Financial Services
we'll see a big impact as roles like
mortgage brokers legal professionals
accountants tax preparers and marketing
researchers are transformed gen AI will
automate and enhance these tools
boosting productivity but also leading
to some job changes in marketing writing
and graphic designing geni will
revolutionize how content is created
Professionals in these fields will to
adapt to new tools that can generate
ideas and draft quickly allowing them to
focus on Creative enhancements next are
the HR roles that will be completely
transformed as gen automates routine
task like payroll and employee data
management this will let HR teams focus
more on strategic functions like
Employee Engagement and development
interestingly while white colar jobs
will be the most impacted blue collar
workers will stay mostly the same genis
can't perform physical task but there's
increased demand for blue collor workers
due to growth of Premium goods and
services now you might be thinking what
are blue collar and white collar jobs
well White Collar jobs are typically
office based roles that involves mental
and clerical work like accountants
lawyers and managers bu colar jobs on
the other hand are more physical and
often involved manual labor like
construction workers electricians and
Factory workers in fact gen aai might
actually create more demand for blue
collor workers and even raise their
incomes as the economy adjust this is
because while AI can handle a lot of
mental task it still can't do physical
work and there's a growing need for
these Hands-On jobs let's break down the
impact of gen on jobs into three
categories at first we have automation
gen AI automates rules that involves
routine and repeative task for example
graphic designers might shift from
creating content from scratch to
improving AI generated content similarly
data entry and basic administrative jobs
are at high risk of being fully
automated next we have augmentation in
roles requiring substantial expertise
gen AI acts as a powerful assistant take
software Engineers for instance they use
AI tools like chat GPT to generate and
debug code more efficiently this helps
them focus on solving bigger problems
and coming up with innovative solutions
lastly we have the transformation some
job roles will change completely due to
geni human resource professional for
examples are shifting to rules focusing
on coaching and strategic planning
driven by New Economic models enabled by
AI automated augmented and human task
are the building blocks we use to
redesign job and unlock the true value
of gen these redesigned jobs must work
together which will radically change how
work gets done now let's see how
generative AI can change processes
within Organization for example let's
take uh zomato apps interface and
customer reaction zomato is a popular
food delivery app as an example zomato
rethought customer services and issue
resolution by combining AI chatbots the
cloud and human support to enhance the
user experiences if there's delivery
issue users can simply tap on the help
button in the zomato app and tell the
chatboard named Zoe or whatever the name
is that what actually happened no matter
no forms no waiting on the phone and no
being transferred from one Department to
another the AI determines the best
solution and if it can be resolved
instantly the AI takes care of it if not
human representative contacts the
customer quickly as gen AI becomes more
common in businesses professionals are
divided some are excited about their new
possibilities and efficiency gains While
others worry about the job Security
Professionals need to keep learning and
upskilling during the transition
continuous learning strategic up
Skilling and ethical AI integration are
key Industries must leverage ai's
potential while prioritizing human
values in conclusion generative AI is
transformative technology that can
revolutionize the way we work by
understanding the capabilities and
managing the risk we can harness its
