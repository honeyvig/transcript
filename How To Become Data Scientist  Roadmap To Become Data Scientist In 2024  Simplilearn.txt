hi everyone I am Mike and welcome to
this video by simply learn before we
begin if you enjoy watching these videos
and find them interesting subscribe to
our Channel as we bring you the best
videos daily also hit the Bell icon to
never miss any updates from Simply learn
now let's get started companies
worldwide have continuously gathered and
analyzed customer data to provide better
service and improve their bottom lines
in today's Digital World We Gather
tremendous amounts of data which
requires non-traditional data processing
methods and software data science helps
businesses understand and utilize data
effectively it uses math statistics Ai
and computer engineering techniques to
analyze large data sets by doing this
data scientists can discover insights
about past events their causes future
Trends and how to apply the information
having said that if you want to become a
data science expert and gain handsome
compensation packages look at the wide
range of data science programs offered
by simply learn in collaboration with
top universities across the globe by
enrolling in any of these certification
programs you gain expertise in skills
like statistics Python Programming data
analysis using SQL machine learning deep
learning natural language processing and
much more covering a wide range of tools
including python libraries like numpy
pandas and psyit learn as well as data
visualization tools like matplot lib and
Tablo you will no doubt catch the eye of
top recruiters so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a minimum
experience of one year is preferred to
enroll in these courses find the course
links in the description box below so
without further delay let's get started
what is data science data science is a
multi-is disciplinary field that uses
scientific methods algorithms processes
and systems to extract knowledge and
insights from structured and
unstructured data it combines computer
science statistics domain knowledge and
computer data visualization expertise to
solve complex problems make data-driven
decisions and predict future outcomes
what does a data scientist do a data
scientist extracts analyzes and
interprets data to uncover valuable ins
sites and inform strategic decisions
they collect and clean data from various
sources and analyze exploratory data to
identify patterns roles and
responsibilities of a data scientist
firstly data collection and cleaning
data scientists are responsible for
acquiring collecting and cleaning data
sets this involves sourcing data from
various databases apis or other sources
and ensuring its quality by handling
missing values outliers and
inconsistencies next is exploratory data
analysis data scientists perform edas
also known as exploratory data analysis
to gain a deep understanding of data
they use statistical and visualization
techniques to identify patterns
correlations and outliers which inform
subsequent analysis followed by that we
have model development developing
predictive models is a core
responsibility data scientists build
machine learning models to solve
specific businesses or research Problems
by selecting appropriate algorithms and
fine-tuning them for Optimal Performance
moving ahead we have data visualization
data scientists create informative
visualizations and reports to
communicate findings and insights to
non-technical
stakeholders followed by that we have
feature engineering feature engineering
involves selecting creating or or
transforming relevant variables to
improve model accuracy data scientists
are skilled in identifying the most
informative features for a given problem
moving ahead we have skills required to
become a data scientist here are the six
essential skills that a data scientist
should possess first programming
Proficiency in programming languages
like python or R is fundamental for data
scientists they use these languages to
manipulate data and build machine
learning models and and also develop
data analysis scripts next we have
statistics and Mathematics strong
foundation in statistics and Mathematics
is essential for understanding the
underlying principles of data analysis
hypothesis testing and machine learning
algorithms next machine learning data
scientists should have expertise in
machine learning techniques including
supervised and unsupervised learnings
deep learnings and reinforcement
learning they need to choose train and
evaluate models effectively next in the
list is data manipulation skills in data
processing cleaning and transformation
are crucial data scientists work with
messy and complex data sets so the
ability to prepare data for analysis is
the key skill followed by that we have
data visualization proficient data
visualization skills help data
scientists communicate their findings
effectively to both Technical and non-
Technical stakeholders tools like
matplot lib cbon or tblo are commonly
used moving a head we will discuss the
salary of a data scientist there is a
possibility that the salary will vary
depending on the company you're working
with as well as the level of knowledge
and experience that you bring with you
top companies like Google Snapchat open
Ai and many more are hiring data
scientists in the US according to glass
store the average salary of a data
scientist ranges between 150 to
$160,000
perom as for salaries in India the
demand for data scientists in India has
caught the attention of major industry
players with renowned companies such as
deoe Phillips slice and others actively
seeking to add these professionals into
their teams according to glassar the
national average salary of a data
scientist is 15 laks perom in India in
conclusion embracing data science isn't
just a choice it's a strategic decision
that can reshape how your organization
approaches data science with that we
have come to the end of this video our
team of experts will reach out to you as
soon as possible staying ahead in your
career requires continuous learning and
upskilling whether you're a student
