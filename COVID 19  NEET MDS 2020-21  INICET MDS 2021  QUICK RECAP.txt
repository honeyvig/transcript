having us i'm back here uh with one more
content on
kovid19 so as per the prediction and the
strategy that we have discussed for
inicit
it's good to see decent number of
questions from covid19
and the same thing can happen in the
upcoming neet examinations
so let's go into the top so covet 19 is
a one
this is which most of us most of the
population
okay most of the family members have
suffered in the
past few days okay so in this process
you may learn so many things
not academically but to increase your
awareness towards covet 19 we have
learned so much
so i'll just clear cut the things what
you
and i have learned in the process of
general information
to a proper literature
okay proper literature from academic
point of view
so covet 19 so the first
is is diagnosis right so
diagnosis is by a combination of few
things that is
the clinical features that includes the
symptoms and signs
the radiographical features and the
laboratory futures
so all these together combine to give a
proper diagnosis
means alone radiographic futures or
image modalities alone cannot be used
either in the diagnosis or either in the
screening even your ct
cannot be used for diagnosis and
screening your chest x-ray cannot be
useful for diagnosis and screening
they should be combined with the
clinical features and they should be
combined with the
laboratory findings to come out with the
proper diagnosis of this covet 19.
so they can ask you the first image
modality that is used in kobit 19 the
first
image modality or the first line image
modality that is used in the kovid 19
it is not ct it is chest x-ray
checks x-ray is the first image modality
that is used in the screen make a note
your chest x-ray is not useful for
diagnosis and it is not useful for
screening okay alone cannot be useful
for diagnosis and screening
even your ct ct is not useful for
diagnosis alone not useful for diagnosis
not useful for screening
okay very clear and make a note
if a patient if a patient of a
particular symptom signs
all these are regularly asked questions
right in your case based approach
so all these features like clinical
features giving and they can if they
clearly mention
the ct is normal or the chest x-ray is
normal may cannot
normal chest x-ray does not rule out
covet 19
normal ct scan patient may have normal
ct scan
but he may have see scovite 19 infection
patient may have normal chest x-ray
okay so normal chest x-ray normal ct
scan
does not rule out kovid 19.
very specific and very important is
your rtpc that is reverse transcriptase
pcr
is the one which helps the things to get
settled well
now okay so your rt pcr hope
most of you have heard this term that is
reverse transcriptase pcr
is 95 or more percentage
sensitive so this is the best way to
identify kobit 19 as of
now okay this is the best way to
identify the
kovid 19 as of now so what is the
difference what is the advantage of ct
now nowadays like everyone are being uh
affected or symptomatic and they want to
get results okay
so your rtpcr will take time okay
whereas your ct will be immediate like
once the patient is affected take ct
scan
okay the cd result is out and you will
see
the investigations on ct so ct the only
advantage
of course it helps in the diagnosis but
alone cannot help in diagnosis
but it should be combined with rt pcr
but ct is going to give you
the results immediately ct scan
is going to give results results
are immediately so if you want you can
make a note about the laboratory
findings uh which are seen in this cobit
19
the laboratory findings which are seen
in the kovite 19 are there will be
decreasing in the lymphocytic count
increasing in the c reactive protein
okay increasing in the lymphocytic count
and
increasing in the c react to protein and
decreasing in the lymphocytic ground
are some of the laboratory findings that
you can see
so when you go to this chest x-ray so
most of us this is a normal chest x-ray
you can see this is a normal chest x-ray
so when you see you can see the haziness
okay so that is the main thing that you
can see in
your covet 19 the peculiar radiographic
features in the covet 19 are hazing as
you can see
okay you can see this haziness like here
it's normal
here it is normal you can see this
haziness okay
uh in this particular tone you can see
this haziness
in this particular job so there is
altered of haziness the areas of
haziness
which can be seen on the city
city as well as city you can see them on
the chest
x-ray okay so that and if you go in
detail into these hazinesses
these hazinesses are of two types one is
crown class opacities that is called as
ggos
that is ground glass opacities and the
second one is
called as consolation okay so ground
glass opacities is the first line
it comes first and followed by as the
time increases
with the infection it will be converted
into consultation
okay and other important features most
of these c
cities as well as the chest x-rays the
peculiar features
of this kovit 19 one is bilateral
means you you you the affected will be
bilateral means both the sides of the
both the lungs left as well as right are
affected by lateral
and it is multifocal means you'll have
more number of focus multifocalities
it's not a uniform
it is multifocal most most of the lobes
will get
affected it's not single loop you can
see here one lobe affected here one lobe
tool up here three to four lobes are
affected
so most of the lobes get affected even
phyllops are also affected in few
conditions and the other important
aspect about this one is
most of these are peripheral okay you
can see peripheral
most of these are peripheral they are
outside they are not center they are not
center
they are outside they are on the
periphery so the three important
features that you have to make a note
about the ct
as well as the chest x-ray they are
bilateral both the sides
multi-focal different lobes are affected
in the lobes you can see multifocal
similarly like your amyloblastoma which
is unilocular and multi-ocular right
so unilocular unicystic amyloblastoma
multicystic aminological similarly
it's not at one point it is at multiple
areas
and most of these are periphery they
stay outside
okay they say outside the periphery of
the
peripheral borders of the lungs and if
you take the condition into
if you take the situation into
consideration they can ask you the most
commons
ground glass opacities are most common
than any other radiographic feature in
the ct scan one point
second thing multifocal are more common
when compared to that of the unifocal
that is a
other important aspect that you have to
make a note when we are talking about
the
cd scan or chest x-ray
so if you go detail into this this is a
ct cd
okay this is a ct scan so you can
clearly see
these yellow color uh markings okay
these yellow color markings are your
these yellow color markings are your
ground glass opacities these are low
color markings are your
ground glass opacities whereas your
green color markings okay your green
color
markings are your
space considerations these green color
markings are your
space considerations right so these are
the important things that you have to
make a note
okay these features are common both for
the ct as well
as well as for the x-rays and if you
if you see this particular thing into
consideration
okay the main aspects that you have to
make a note is one
is ground glass opacities so in the case
of your ground glass opacities where you
can see here
the groundless opacities where you can
see some
networks which are going here and there
these networks are nothing but the
underlining vessels
so in ground grass opacities you can see
the underlining vessels
whereas these groundless opacities after
few days they are going to
convert into considerations okay as the
infection increases okay so where these
vessels are going to
disappear the ct futures you do you need
to make a what about the ct futures
okay we have already discussed one
important cd feature is
ground glass or basically the second
important ct feature is
consideration and the other important ct
feature that you have to make a note
is crazy
paving pattern it's something like
around the periphery for example if you
take this groundless
appearance the periphery is something
like a radio opaque border right
so this radio quick broader is in such a
way that it looks like
bricks were arranged at the
circumference so that is called as
crazy paving pattern okay so these are
the most important things
the most common thing that you find in
ct or x-ray
just x-ray of cobit 19 patient is ground
glass
opacities okay so
you're clear like okay so what what are
the peculiar features coming to the city
and uh
ct and chest x-rays groundless opacities
consolidation
and craving crazy paving pattern
apart from this very specific features
of cb uh your cobit 19
are your multifocal bilateral and
periphery
even you can see most of these are
periphery here okay
you can see most of the features are
periphery here okay
or are periphery or are around the
outer side not on the inner side or the
central side
okay so as the patient is recovering
you can you can see the recovery also
from the cd
okay so for example a mild case or a
recovery case
only one lobe get affected whatever the
cases we have seen as of now the ct and
chest x-ray most of the lobes in the
chest were in the lungs were affected
but
when the patient is mild or in the
recovering stage only one
lobe can get affected okay
so that is very very important and
please do make a note
uh other important features uh about
your
rats okay so these rats is again the
most common aspect
for kobe 19 question okay a difficult
question can be given for a dental
student
on this rats okay so the rats helps in
level of suspection of seaweed see kovid
19 infection so
it starts from rats one to rad six very
simple as
it moves down the severity of suspection
increases
rad one is known and your ct findings
will be
uh yeah there will be normal okay
it is a low chances uh the abnormality
uh like the the i mean like the findings
may be similar to kobit 19 but can be
suspected by other like the patient may
have tb
but you you you when you're cross
checking the cds the series looks like
obvious 19. so that that is called as
law
and this next one is indeterminate
okay it is unclear okay it is unclear
about the coveted 19. next rats 4 is
highly the patient is highly suspicious
of kobe 19.
like if you take the features of
radiographic features you can see this
ground glass opacities or considerations
or you can see all the features
multifocal and everything
but but but you you're not
perfectly sure that it's going to be
coveted but there are high chances maybe
90 percent is plus chances of covet 19.
and
the next one is very high chances means
the features are very typical to covet
19
exactly the lobes the multi-focal
bilateral the periphery everything
mimics the kovid 19 situation so that
cases comes under very high
high and very high are more risk of i
mean like
they're like probably they will be covet
19. and the rat six is the one
in which you'll have all the features
and on the ct scan but the patient is
positive to rt pcr so that is
the highest okay so hope hope they can
ask you like
they can give you the case scenario and
they can ask you uh they can
they can add a ct finding or they can
directly give
uh the ct scan photograph and they can
ask you
about this uh rats whether it starts
from one two or ends at six
okay so that's an important aspect the
other important aspect like i just want
to give an idea
so when the patient is recovering or
when the patient is
mild recovery or the patient is
mild you may have only one
lobe get affected regularly it is
multifocal
multi-laws more than one lobe get
affected and other findings in cbct
your ct scan okay of of your lungs
of your chest which which may give you a
conclusion of other things is
so no pleural effusion regularly pleural
effusions are not seen in the copic 19.
so whenever you have a pleural efficient
i mean like regularly
a ct chest will have pleural effusions
when the patient is having a congenital
heart disease
or a bacterial uh
i mean pneumonia bacterial causing
pneumonia in such conditions
you can see this pleural effusion and
similarly you can see
lung cavities sometimes you have radio
pace it is
radio big radio opacities inside the
lungs completely here you can see
haziness
but regularly you can see lung cavities
okay lung cavities when you have lung
cavities
it's not covered 19 lung cavities are
most commonly associated with again
pneumonias
the bacterial pneumonia and the fungal
pneumonia pneumonia
and the next one is i mean like
all these features what we have learned
this opaque
ground glass radio basis all these
features are not only very specific to
covet 19 but specific to majority of the
viral pneumonia so uh once you diagnose
it as a viral pneumonia
with all these things what we have
learned then you have to confirm it
with rtpcr or other laboratory
investigations to confirm
it to covet 19. okay
so these are the things that we have to
take into consideration because
uh i mean the severe case of covad19
okay
the pneumonia is common so you should
differentiate whether the pneumonia is
basically due to covid19
or the pneumonia is basically due to the
secondary infection that is caused by
covid19
so you have to differentiate the
pneumonia whether it is viral bacterial
or fungal
so basing upon which the treatment plan
should be should be done accordingly
okay so i'm done for now uh probably we
are planning to come out with few more
uh
a few more uh stuff related to kobe 19
and latest
updates uh which can be predicted as an
mcqs
uh in your need 2020. okay uh
hope hope uh hope everything is clear so
please do make a note about the ct scan
and
the chest x-ray uh how they're different
what are the futures are seen and you
need to make a note about what is
sensitivity specificity related to
the diagnosis of covet 19 rt pcr
reverse transcriptase pcr is the best
one
for the diagnosis okay your ct scan
or your chest x-ray
cannot be alone useful for the diagnosis
of covet 19 cannot be useful in the
diagnosis cannot be useful in the
screening but the main advantage of
these is they are immediate
they are immediate okay so
done for now signing off dr srikad from
