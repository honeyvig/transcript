learning helps to get more command over
a subject it also enhances your skill
and improvises your performance
in this day-to-day life the development
of software has grown much and shown
more impact all the knowledge on
development comes from coding and
programming
so we bring you some tips to learn and
get experience over coding and
programming without any difficulty
hey everyone welcome back to a whole new
session from simply learn today we will
be discussing about coding or
programming tips in this session i will
help you learn coding and programming in
a simple way let us have a look for the
agenda for today's session
first we shall begin with understanding
what exactly does the term coding means
followed by that we will understand what
is programming
then we will get in touch with learning
the differences between coding and
programming after that we shall focus on
discussing some important tips to learn
programming and coding and finally we
will end our session by discussing the
benefits however before we begin make
sure that you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon so that you can never
miss an update from simply learn so
without further ado let's get started
with our first topic of this session
what is coding
computer does not understand the human
language so in order to communicate with
the computer we use some languages for
communication that requires coding
coding is a way of passing and
translating the instructions for
communication with the computer
moving forward let us understand what
exactly programming means programming is
a process of designing and building
executable programs to work on specific
tasks that involve analysis generation
and implementation of algorithms
many of the applications and development
involves and uses programming
this is all about programming now let's
get started with learning some
differences between coding and
programming
coding is a part of programming used to
help in converting the language into
binary codes which can be able to
communicate with the computer whereas
programming is a process that works on
creating specific tasks according to the
standards
the next difference is that the coding
is a basic step in implementing the
software whereas programming deals in
the depth of the implementation and
dealing with complex problems
coding works with simple projects which
can be finished in a shorter period
whereas programming deals with big
projects and possesses complete analysis
in the implementation of the projects
there are some fundamental differences
between coding and programming now let's
have a look at some of the best tips to
learn programming or coding so some of
the best tips to learn coding or
programming are practice consistency in
reading
deep learning
jumping directly into the learning part
online resources for reference
learning how to debug a program and
finally to learn how to represent your
project
let's dive deep into these tips the
first one we have is practice
practice is the best way to learn coding
or programming it takes a lot of time to
represent but helps more in gaining
knowledge
when you apply for a software job there
will be a technical round and they will
ask you to write some quotes practicing
helps you to clear those rounds and get
an opportunity to clear those rounds
quite quickly
it also improvises the ability to
identify the mistakes by yourself
the next we have is the consistency in
reading the main problem in learning is
the consistency when we work on our free
time it doesn't help much because of the
power of our brain
going on working daily helps to gain and
boost up your knowledge and helps to
think logically and improve our skills
so we have to work every day to learn
coding or programming
the next tip of the session is deep
learning
when you get deeply involved in the
subject we are learning it provides a
way to gain more knowledge and attention
over a subject the deeper we put in an
effort the more we get back
it also helps us in improving our
thinking skills it boosts the
performance while performing the tasks
the next step of the dock is jumping
directly into the learning phase if
you're going to learn something you must
start somewhere
it helps to predict and provide a
complete understanding of upcoming
topics
if you are learning coding or
programming you better start from the
basics it helps you more to grab the
attention over the subject and improve
your coding and programming knowledge
and the next one we have is online
resources
one of the accessible sources of
learning programming or coding is the
online resources there are plenty of
online resources like simply learn and
etc
these platforms are providing and
helping much in learning they also offer
free courses and videos with the best
concepts that you have ever seen
my choice amongst most of the platforms
is simply learn which helps you improve
your coding skills and moving forward
the following tips we have the debugging
making mistakes in code and programming
are very common
they are the key producers of learning
so it is good to use debugging to
improve your coding or programming
skills if you are good at debugging then
definitely you'll learn quite quickly
without any hassle
and most importantly the final tip of
the session is representing
representing the concept you learnt
plays a crucial part in learning it may
help to get more ideas and think more
profoundly about the subject teaching
someone discussing and sharing will help
to get more command over coding and
programming so it is good to represent
everything that you learned
so these are a few tips to help you
learn coding or programming
now you have an idea of coding and
programming tips now let us see some
benefits of coding or programming
coding or programming are playing a very
massive role in present day-to-day life
they are showing the capacity to do
anything in the present let us see some
of the benefits of coding and
programming
coding helps in improving presentation
skills developing creativity helping in
problem solving and teamwork there are
the best known benefits of coding and
programming
let us see some brief information about
the benefits of coding and programming
