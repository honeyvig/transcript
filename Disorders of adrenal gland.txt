hi witness there's a doctor streak on
some team MDS conquer now I will be
talking about internal and disorders in
neat and aims point of view the first
important aspect that to be focused is
about man syndrome okay man syndrome is
of different types so the first
important type is the type form so type
1 the easy way to remember is it
contains three major things they are
called as you can remember it as P P and
P that is parathyroid hyperplasia or
adenoma pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
and pituitary adenoma okay all these
three P's are present in man type one
symptom so apart from this in this
particular individual you can see facial
facial cutaneous Angie of I promise
subcutaneous or visceral lipomas and
this is mainly due to man one defect
okay that is man one gene defect which
is located on chromosome number 11 and
and this particular man one syndrome is
autosomal dominant you can remember that
all the types of men as men one man -
Man 3 and man for all are dominant you
can simply remember the man syndrome all
the types are dominant men are dominant
right okay
the next one is meant to okay men - is
also called as 2a that is meant to a is
also care strict with Sybil syndrome a
turn cordless Sybil syndrome okay in
this particular aspect you can remember
it as okay previous one it is a P P and
P right previous one it is P P and T
whereas this particular one is you can
remember it as P P and M okay M for
medullary carcinoma whereas P for
pheochromocytoma and other P is
parathyroid hormone parathyroid
hyperplasia or adenoma similarly like
that of men
that is ppm this the cord is ppm and it
is mainly associated with the defect in
the red team and it is located on the
chromosome number 10 and it is autosomal
dominant similarly to the type form the
next comes is type 3 type 3 is also
called as to be type 3 is also called as
to be type 1 is the code is P P P type 2
the cord is ppm whereas type 3 the code
is p.m. okay so P is pheochromocytoma am
for medullary carcinoma of thyroid which
is present in the 2a also then all that
most of the futures are seen with
megacolon or marfanoid futures all these
seen okay and similarly like that of red
gene similarly to that of your 2a and it
is similar to that of your 2 year that
is chromosome number 10 defect and all
are dominant it is autosomal dominant
the next one is you you you cannot found
this regularly in most of the books okay
but it's a newly added stuff and you
have to make a note that is man thought
it is also called as man X okay so these
are the futures which are seen in the
man x that is hyperparathyroidism pick
to Tacoma
pancreatic neuro endocrine tumor gonal
eternal renal tumors and thyroid tumors
okay can see more fair futures also in
this particular individual and this is
basically due to the defect of cyclin
dependent kinase inhibitor which is
located on chromosome con most of the
features are almost similar to that of
Man 1 okay the only difference between
Man 4 and Man 1 is the defect oh there
it is
man 1 gene defect here it is cyclin
dependent kinase inhibitor so you can
simply add a definition for man 4s all
the futures which are seen in the manual
okay
but if a mutation is diagnosed as cyclin
dependent kinase inhibitor then you can
diagnose this as
meant for okay hope you're clear most of
your questions with what is a common
between 2a to be water which is which is
the future that is seen in the sickle
syndrome futures that are seen in the
men for or else they can ask you the
chromosome number out they can ask you
to simply the mode of inheritance the
mode of inheritance is common for all
that is autosomal dominant a regularly
asked question in the stuff that we have
discussed yesterday when we were talking
about thyroid gland carcinomas is which
type of thyroid gland carcinoma is most
commonly seen in the men syndrome is a
commonly asked question the answer is
the medullary carcinoma because you can
see medullary carcinoma as a common
future in both 2a to be okay in 2a 2b
both the types you can see the medullary
carcinoma has a common future fear
cytochrome ax is common for it is common
for 2a to pee right so such questions
are most common for you in the
examination and please do make a note of
all the four types of this man syndrome
okay so once you are done with the men's
syndrome apart from this the most
important aspect where a number of n
number of questions I have seen is for
your cytochrome okay so before that we
need to talk about the eternal claim so
this is an internal gland which is close
in association with your kidney and I
didn't gland has two major parts in it
that is the cortex and the medulla and
the medulla will have this particular
type of cells which are mainly
responsible for pheochromocytoma those
cells are called as chroma
findt cells ourselves are called as
chromaffin cells which are the primary
cause for the occurrence of
pheochromocytoma
okay next important aspect when you're
talking about pheochromocytoma and the
question that is given in 2018 neat rule
of 10 is mainly associated you have
other rule of 10 which we have learned
in the cleft lip and cleft palate
surgery that is called less rule of 10
of millet rule of 10 of Malad is cleft
lip and cleft palate there is other rule
of 10 which is applicable for the
diagnosis or the confirmation of
pheochromocytoma so what this rule of 10
says okay the rule of tenses that ten
percentage of these tumors are extra at
another ten percent is our bilateral
means most of them are unilateral or
solitary
90 percentage of them are unilateral are
solitary but ten percentage are pine at
ten percent is our familiar 10 percent
is the current children ten percent is
our malignant most of them are benign
and 10% is the current man syndrome
which type of men syndromes they can be
seen in 2a and 2b 10% is that car with a
stroke okay
10% is they occur with recurrent they
are concerned with 10 chromosome okay we
all learned that both 2a and 2b are
associated with chromosome number 10
okay so you can add this as rule of 10
okay so all these are very very
important aspect whenever this tumor
occurs extra adrenaline
okay the most common site of occurrence
of extra adrenaline is the organ of
jukkalan okay this is the most common
site of occurrence of the extra
Donnellan tumor of this particular type
okay hope you are clear active now okay
and malignancy is 10% as many know this
is a benign tumor but malignancy can be
seen in ten percentage of the cases okay
so what happens okay you so come if
you're talking about the pathology that
is also cited with the
a particular tumor whenever you have
excess or whenever you have size
increasing the size of this adrenal
gland
okay the edenal gland is going to
produce non epinephrine as well as non
internally as well as internal okay it's
going to produce adrenaline and
noradrenaline
okay preferably it produced more non
internal in than that so that's a
question they can ask we just pleased to
make a note so coming to the clinical
features this classic trial is very very
important the classic triad contains a
recurrent high tech or episode of high
tech they can call as diaphoresis okay
and palpations the patient complaints of
you can see these symptoms very rarely
but the patient complaints of loss of
weight that is mainly due to increasing
in the energy expenditure you more
energy is spent so that the patient will
have loss of weight okay then the most
common symptom that you see in these
patients is headache okay the most
common symptom that you can see is a
headache and the most common
manifestation okay manifestation you can
see it as hypertension hypertension is
the most common manifestation whereas
the most common symptom is is I'll take
the patient complaints of frequent
headaches so in the case based question
they can give you this particular
Associated features because they can
give you they can consider it as men's
two or three syndrome they can give you
the extra features or extra tumors that
will present or they can ask they can
tell you that a simple sign like the
patient have a frequent or a severe
episodic headaches which make us to
deviate towards the CNS pain but it is
basically this particular tumor okay you
can have the loss of weight okay dude a
heavy expenditure of the energy and you
have several cardiac manifestations okay
that can be given in the particular
question about the description but in
this particular mode of questions where
I have seen multiple case based
questions on this area the best finding
that the gear is there will there
really tell that upon urinary
examination the patient has an
increasing in BM levels or urinary you
can have excess of catecholamines that
are secreted okay so this is a common
finding regularly or most commonly acid
blindly you can go over the answer like
whenever they talk about something like
vm ears are increased or catecholamines
have secreted then you can go straight
away for this particular option so but
you can see in the in the plasma you can
see meta nephrons and catecholamines
catecholamines meant and evidences are
nothing but they are the breakdown
products of the catechol immense pharma
logically you can try by giving glucagon
infusion to the patient whenever you
give the glucagon infusion and the
glucagon in this particular patient is
going to secrete extra catecholamines so
whenever extra katakana Mentzer and
raised the patient's hypertension will
be increased and the patient the blood
pressure you can monitor the blood
pressure so you the blood pressure will
be increased so by which you can
diagnosis but it's not frequently used
the most commonly used are the first and
second okay so coming to the other other
investigations that you can make a note
so as it is a soft tissue the best
option is MRI you can see in this
particular MRI there is the the other
you can see clearly these other the
these are the tumors that you can see a
bilateral tumors okay so Amara is the
best option either for Adele or
extraordinaire and particularly you can
use this in pregnancy women also with a
height with a good sensitivity and
specificity for identification of the
disorder okay you can use CT but MRI is
always the best option biopsies
everything like even when you're using
CT make a note you should perform this
procedure without any contrast
administration without any
administration of contracting
contrasting agent okay the main reason
like even if you do biopsy or any sort
of injection of contracting agent there
will be there will be hypertensive
crisis so which is which is not a good
indication
okay so biopsies
and city with contrasting agent are
contraindicated in these patients to
avoid the hypertensive crisis so coming
to the treatment plan okay so the
treatment plan is just the removal okay
that is adrenalectomy can be done and
preferable type of item elect amis
laparoscopic adrenalectomy you can do
laparoscopic a little ectomy and and
they can take a few few times they can
consider the size of the tumor also so
when you go for the laparoscopic at an
elective me make sure that the tumor
should be less than five centimeters in
diameter okay and you can add one more
point when the tumor size is more than
ten centimeters in diameter the best
approach of the diagnosis or the
treatment is by using iodine-131
radioisotope okay you can add this
particular point also okay so before
going to the treatment before before you
start the treatment okay so there are a
few pretreatment precautions that you
have to take so before starting the
treatment you have to do I mean like for
example if you take your eternal gland
at an L gland is increasing the size so
whenever your eternal gland is
increasing in the size what is going to
happen your nan adrenaline and or non
internal norepinephrine or epinephrine
values will be increased so when this
nany
these values are increased this has some
effects on alpha 1 beta 1 and beta 2
receptors what alpha 1 effects are it is
going to cause vasoconstriction it is
going to cause smooth muscle
construction also when it acts on beta 1
receptors beta 1 receptors is going to
increase cardiac output it's going to
increase the heart rate it's going to
increase the stroke warnings all these
are related to the CVS when it adds from
the beta 2 beta 2 is mainly concerned
with the smooth muscle relaxation okay
smooth muscle relaxation so all these
manifested manifestations has to be
counted
before you remove this particular gland
okay how to do that okay so there are
two things that you have to do before
you start this particular treatment or
before you're planning to remove the
eternal cordis adrenalectomy which is
the choice of treatment for this
condition that is called as alpha adran
genic blockers first you have to do
alpha a transgenic blockers then once it
is completed then you have to do beta a
transgenic blockers so once these two
are achieved then you can plan your
surgery so alpha is always the first
followed by beta then you can plan this
particular treatment so what to be done
in alpha the alpha processor will run
for somewhere around 10 to 14 days okay
what you have to do in this 10 to 14
days before the surgery is you have to
give the drug if you knock see bench
annamund this phenoxy benzene amount has
to be given to the patient for 10 to 14
days and the patient should be in high
sodium diet should be in high sodium
diet which is greater than 5 grams per
day before the surgery so by using this
the alpha transgenic blockers can be
done
followed by once the alpha I transgenic
blockage is done then you have to go for
beta engineer block is by using your
drug called as propanol so once alpha
and genic blockage is done beta original
blockage is done then you can plan for
your laparoscopic I didn't elect ami
surgery okay so so this is a very very
important in examination point of view
among the topics what I have mentioned
you to complete in the in the in the
particular topic of the disorders of
adrenaline and parathyroid okay needle
in Paris I did these two topics are very
very very very important and most of
them gqueues which were covered in the
last few years and which which can be
asked were clearly covered in this video
so please try to do this to this video
once or twice so that everything can be
retained with a proper mind map your
mind maps are very very important so
that your revision will go
okay all our main target is to revise
everything two to three times in the
last three months
okay so last three months game plan is
very very important where your mind maps
and your note says and everything plays
a very very vital role
okay signing off for now dr. Steven from
