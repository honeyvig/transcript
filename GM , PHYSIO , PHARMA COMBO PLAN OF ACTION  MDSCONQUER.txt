High Runners this is Dr srikan from Team
MDS conquer
so now I'm going to give a brief idea
that how you need to handle this
particular combination okay the
combination of
general medicine
Plus
General Pharma
Plus Dental Pharma
and
physiology
okay the first and foremost thing is
so most of these uh subjects which I
have mentioned
are integrated with every subject
in your preparation
so lets you take a general Anatomy yes
of course it is integrated there are
areas like nerve system it is integrated
there are many things it is included so
every subject has an integration like
you take oral surgery medical
emergencies will be integrated of your
gender medicine General pathology is
integrated oral pathology is integrated
oral medicine is integrated
pedo is integrated perio is India so all
the subjects are directly or indirectly
at least like 10 percentage sometimes 20
percenters will be integrated with this
particular combination you take end of
enter you have drugs right so drugs will
come under formal condition
you have acute infections chronic
infections that will be a part of your
medicine and physio the physio pathology
and everything
so so the next 30 to 35 days you will be
focusing on this particular combination
so uh I mean let it be a neat blueprint
or iron ICT blueprint so if you take
ionicd general medicine as it's
increated to most of the subjects it is
being ignored as a suggestion by most of
the mentors but questions will come
directly or indirectly so your general
medicine according to neat blueprint is
going to carry 15 marks your general
pharmacology is going to carry seven
General pharmacology means not the
chapter General pharmacology
pharmacology which is in general means
all the system based pharmacology like
git drugs CVS drugs CNS drugs a nesterx
okay the other endocrine drugs and
everything they are considered as
general pharmacology and the next one is
your dental pharmacology Dental
pharmacology is basically your La local
anesthesia which is part of your oral
surgery your general anesthesia which is
a part of your oral surgery and general
surgery and it will be coming under
general medicine emergency drugs
emergency trucks in your Wards and
followed by most of the dental related
Let It Be mouthwash is also going to
come under on in Dental pharmacology you
say the drugs used in indoor procedure
like what is triple antibiotic waste
what is modified triple antibiotic paste
and what are the drugs which are very
specific to each and every condition of
your period be water the drug of choice
in the case of anak what are the drug of
choices in the case of refractory
periodontitis there are many things like
you say like the complication of your
covid-19 myocoromycosis what is the drug
of choice used so all these are directly
are indirectly related to a dental
pharmacology questions okay you see what
is the drug of choice for oral syphilis
what are the drug of choice for
candidiases what are the rug of choice
for the dangerous stomatitis so all
these are going to come under your
dental pharmacology which will be
integratedly covered in all the subjects
when we are discussing about the
treatment plan drug related treatment
plan of that particular you like for
example you're talking about gingival
hyper growth okay the period stuff okay
drugs which are causing the gingival
hyper growth that is going to be part of
your dental pharmacology questions and
the next one is physiology which is
going to be seven marks for your
examination because Physio and
biochemistry together is going to carry
your uh 14 marks so physio is going to
be 17 7 marks so here the most important
thing is
for any disease okay so I'm just giving
an outline for any disease you talk
about a disease
disease will have
pathophysiology
so normal physiology you will be
discussing in your physiology chapter
pathophysiology will be discussed in
general pathology but General pathology
system wise pathology is not important
for a dental student so because
pathology is going to carry seven marks
only for us so we don't focus on
pathophysiology mainly of all the
systems we'll be focusing on very
limited area so pathophysiology what we
are going to learn system wise is is
integrated with general medicine for a
dental student it will be different for
a medical student it will be different
for a dental students and followed by
the clinical features and everything
will be discussed in subjects like your
general medicine oral medicine and the
treatment plans will be discussed in
your
pharmacology that is a drug related
treatment plans will be discussed in
Pharmacology other treatment plans will
be discussed in general medicine and
surgical treatment plants will be
discussed in your general surgeries and
oral surgery so all of these subjects
for a particular disease or a particular
system are integrated to each other
so here I told you to follow a
particular principle called as D and C
what is this D and C D for divide
and C for conquer
so here the most important thing is take
your body your entire body divide it
into different systems okay you have CNS
header is going to focus on like you
have head is going to focus on CMS then
there is something called as a renal
system there is something called as a
renal system there is something called
as a reproductive system there is
something called as a respiratory system
there is something called a
cardiovascular system there is something
called as nerves and muscles there's
something called as bones so first of
all I want you to divide the entire
combination of this physio of
pharmacology and general medicine you
divide it into system wise this is how I
have prepared the schedule this is how I
have prepared the smart videos this is
how I have prepared uh the the content
and I tried my best to integrate with
each and everything so that your reading
will be easy and your reading will be
meaningful so normally you open
physiology of physiology without
understanding the concepts okay then you
don't Interlink those physiology to that
of uh your general medicine you don't
link the original medicine to Pharma it
is it is not a right way of preparation
so most of the dental students in this
last eight to nine years of my
experience along with my preparation of
two years okay let consider it as a 10
years of knowledge over this mode of
preparation any student throughout the
preparation they are going to come out
and tell me that the most difficult
combination for me is this particular
combination
but if you read this in in a proper way
in an organized way in a way that how we
are guiding these things looks going to
be simple these links uh these things
these subjects are going to decrease
your psychological pressure and these
subjects are going to give you more
confidence in handling the examination
okay right so considering this so I have
divided into the into the in these parts
like okay you see uh faster I kept a
general pharmacology which is the raw
basics of pharmacology how this
pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics uh
what is zero order kinetics what is
first order kinetics drugs which are
following first order kinetics drugs
which are following zero order kinetics
uh you have different phases of testing
of your Pharma drugs so there are lots
of things like which will be discussed
in this particular subject a particular
chapter so I have given two days for
this in the schedule okay then I kept
G80
git okay git I have given you three days
okay where you are going to learn the
basics of in the physiology uh then in
in general medicine you will be focusing
mainly on the important uh things like
the first important thing is uh gerd is
very very important your Barrett's
esophagus and everything then peptic
ulcer is important duodenum ulcer is
important
ulcers your peptic and diode ulcers are
important your inflammatory bowel
diseases are important apart from this
you can focus on hepatic system
different types of like Hepatitis what
is a b c d e and followed by
you have jaundice okay and all these
things will be you have to cover it is
very topic specific okay because general
medicine
is not the same general medicine what
your general medicine what your medical
mbbs friends are going to read so most
of our questions will be on topic
specific means for a dental student if
it is git based system so these are the
topics which has to be covered and most
of your questions more than 95
percentage of your questions will be on
these topics only similarly now drugs
okay what are the drugs which are very
very important not all drugs are
important for a dental student there are
few drugs which are covered in the
videos are important you you read them
that is more than sufficient for you to
handle more than 90 95 percentage of the
questions in the examinations on this
particular subject
then I kept respiratory system so
respiratory system two days is
sufficient you can learn your physio
that is your lung volumes lung
capacitance oxygen dissociation carbon
dioxide dissociation curve okay uh and
all these things and you have a
particular disease like asthma is very
important COPD is very important uh like
in the recent neat examination you have
some questions on the chest x-rays so
chest x-rays top to bottom of all the
diseases will be discussed covid-19 will
be discussed here okay covid-19 will be
discussed in your respiratory there are
few other respiratory conditions which
are important will be discussed along
with the drugs used in the respiratory
system then I kept nerve physiology and
muscle physiology I have kept one day
where you are going to talk how the
conduction will takes place how the
muscle contraction will takes place what
are the different types of nerves what
are the functions and everything will be
covered here
then I kept four days for your
infections infections is
a general topic
it's a general topic it is covered in
general surgery it's covered in oral
pathology it's covered in oral medicine
it's covered in general uh General path
it covered in general medicine
everywhere it's going to cover so
bacterial
viral and fungal even in microbiology
infections will be covered when your
parasitology is also important but uh
you can you can do the parasites a
limited number of parasites that is your
entire epistolytica your tenure sodium
and all these are minimal parasites that
you have to make around particularly
malaria is again one important parasite
but I want you to focus mainly on these
three uh for these four days and I want
you to cover okay and then uh I have
given one day extra for infections if
you want you can keep it as a revision
Then followed by I kept CVS
I kept CBS for four days
okay you need to focus more on
hypertension infective endocarditis you
have to focus on Mi you have to focus on
ECC you have to focus on wall defense
mitral wall defect is very important
heart failures how you can differentiate
left and right heart failures
has to be covered then Endocrinology I
have given you three days time a basic
physiology a hormone secreted by each
glands what are the abnormal conditions
diabetes meloditis has to be covered top
to bottom and in this I have included
the reproductive system not very
important for a dental student but I
have included reproducted system I have
taken male female reproducted system
classes the basics which are important
to learn from physiology aspect maybe
general medicine related stuff are very
very less from the reproductive system
for a dental surgery but physiology
based questions can be asked
then renal system I have kept two days
then blood I have kept five days
okay then CNS plus CVS I have kept four
days
CNS and ANS is four days plus sense
organs one day okay right so endocrine I
told you right so coming to the renal
system I want you to focus mainly on the
physiology uh questions on anarch
general medicine part will be very very
less diuretics has to be done then
coming to the Bloods anemias are
important leukemias are important
anemias are important basic physiology
of the blood is very very important CNS
neurologists are important trigeminal
neurology is important glossopharyngeal
is important so everything
will be given as a proper checklist as a
system wise for you so that you can
focus on so the logic here is what is
this D and C principle D and C principle
is don't see all these things at a shot
you'll get panic so first of all I want
you to divide and Rule okay so how you
can divide this is part one
this is your part one okay basics of
Pharma git
to respiratory three nerve and muscle is
very simple no need to break your heads
infections don't consider it as a system
infections you can clinically correlate
you know more more about infection so
infections is going to be interesting
okay uh right so
one
two
three
s is four
endocrine reproductive is five
renal is six
blood is seven
ANS and CNS
plus your sense organs is eight so these
are the eight things that you have to
focus on okay it's going to be
interesting
okay it's going to be fun
the only thing is you have to give a
good time and second thing uh as uh as
as a dental student we are not exposed
to wide range of general medicine
related cases in our clinicals it's an
Open Secret okay the exposure is very
very limited here you should have that
imagination you should you should draw
that animation diagrams
I should draw the rough diagrams you
have to work on understanding the
concepts to make this subject
interesting okay the logic here is even
if you don't understand the concept you
can easily answer that 60 to 70 or 70 to
80 percentage of the questions in the
exam that's not a problem because most
of them uh general medicine related
stuff for physiology or pharmacology
related stuff they are going to ask you
integrated with a Dentistry only so you
can answer it but to make this subject
interesting or make this combination
interesting you should be more involved
in this you should have that particular
passion of imaginating the things
and correlating them clinically okay and
getting some analysis and getting some
Concepts because the medical emergencies
in your future Dentistry even if you
open a clinic or even if you uh like
even if you are practicing or you take
oral surgery or you take pedo you can
encounter this uh medical emergencies in
your clinic in your Orient the knowledge
what you gain is going to help you to
solve questions in the exam and of
course help you to give some proper idea
about the future medical emergencies in
your clinic or in your clinical scenario
where you are going to work so this is
an outline okay and
you have good number of smart videos
okay and you have mentors associated
with you to help you in telling the
concepts taking the care and a proper
checklist for every system will be uh
posted to you on the group okay uh as a
system wise and let's do this let's work
hard okay uh we have like three to four
mentors handling this particular
combination available for you all the
time for this upcoming 30 35 days okay
and let's do it okay let's enjoy this
particular combination the toughest
combination the most interesting
combination and the combination which is
going to yield you uh the best ranks
okay if you're targeting 500 below if
you're targeting for a government Dental
College this combination is damn
important okay because it's you
understand the things you organize the
things it's going to save your time
during the revision process it's going
to decrease your stress during the
revision process it's going to increase
your confidence during the revision
process okay so I'm signing off now take
care uh rest everything will be posted
on your groups let's do this subject
together okay I'll be I'll be with you
I'll be reading with you I'll be helping
you in all the possible ways to handle
this particular subject take care bye
