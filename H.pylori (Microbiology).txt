yeah
hi cordoning back here with one more
mind map the related to a very important
bacteria okay that is h pi relay so
coming to the description of it
anatomically it is a gram positive we
can see it is a spiral rod like shape
you can see its spiral a it's like rod
like shape and flagella are present
towards one and okay it is mortal
because of presence of a bunch of flies
alone one said that is low Potrykus and
flagella contains five to seven sheeted
polar flagella it is micro error philic
catalyze positive oxidase positive h2s
positive phosphatase positive and the
most important question for you in the
case based as well as in a in a normal
direct clinical question is rapid URIs
test which is very unique for this
particular bacteria there are few other
bacteria which are mainly concerned with
this rapid urease test but out of which
the most powerful is h parallel if you
want you can make a note of other
bacteria one of the most commonly asked
question is rapid you raise test is
positive for H power layer which is
hundred times more active than any other
bacteria and the second bacteria which
exhibits it is Proteus okay and other
bacteria which exhibit it is citrobacter
so all these bacteria have the property
of exhibiting this ureas test but the
most active and most powerful is h
parallel okay so apart from that it is
most commonly habitated
in your gastric mucosa and the most
common site of occurrence of multiple
colonies is gastric antral
okay so so basically the points to be
added are initially this this particular
bacteria will enter into the body after
an incubation period it's going to cause
mild gastritis mild acute gastritis so
and it lasts for about like two weeks
and in most of the cases the infection
still persist and it goes home okay goes
on ears and it goes on decades but the
patient will remember mine asymptomatic
so such cases are called as chronic
superficial gastritis okay so if you see
the histological examination of these
patients who are suffering from this
chronic superficial gastritis the
bacteria will invade or we'll be
presenting in only the the mucosa okay
and it does not invade the underlying
structures in it and bacteria has this
adaptation of maintaining or survival
because you know pH of stomach is
somewhere around one to two which is I
get a most common question your
physiology so even at this low pH levels
that a acidic pH levels the bacteria has
a habit of its survivability by doing
some modifications so apart from this
the most important points to be noted is
about the virulence II of the bacteria
okay so coming to the virulence II of
the bacteria you need to make a note
about one virulence factor that is that
is vacuole ating saito toxin which is
also called as BAC 8 and this is the
main this is mainly associated with
causing the peptic ulcer so this
organism this H para is the main
concerned organism for causing this
peptic ulcer for causing this peptic
ulcer so coming to the description of
this peptic ulcer the peptic ulcers can
be a the duodenum ulcers or gastric
ulcers but mostly it causes D or denim
ulcers do denim ulcers in about 80
percentage of the cases and in only 60
percentage of the cases it's going to
cause the gastric ulcer so please make
an order it's the most common organism
associated with the D or denim ulcer
followed by the gastric ulcer and very
few cases say it it also causes a tropic
gastritis
and gastric Eddy normal okay it's going
to cause a tropic gastritis and gastric
adenoma and they're coming to the
inflammatory mediators or
pro-inflammatory cytokine s which plays
a very important role occurrence of the
peptic ulcer associated with this
bacteria is
interleukin-1 beta so this is again a
very important point interleukin-1 beta
is mainly concerned with causing these
peptic ulcers in association with these
bacteria okay so so the next important
points to be added is about the
laboratory tests so already discuss that
rapid you race test is the most
convenience test okay so you have this
rapid ureas test is the most convenience
test and labeled that is either C 13 or
C 14 okay the same test either C 13 or C
14 urease breath test okay so C 13 or C
14 furious breath test is the most
accurate test okay so this is most
accurate test and this is most
convenient test okay so these are the
two tests that you have to make a note
okay so of two days that you have to
make a note and culture culture
techniques or isolation of batteries I
get a most commonly used you can use the
stool antigen test also and of course
you can have a seer logical test
by identifying the virulence II or by
they're using élisa élisa or any of
these can be used as a serial logical
test which are not that important so
most of your questions will move around
these two tests okay
how we are clear up until now so I will
be talking about the treatment plan here
because this treatment plan is is the
most commonly asked area in your form
ecology the treatment plan I hope you
remember that triple drug therapy for
peptic ulcer what we have learned in our
second year pharmacology part okay so
the triple drug therapy includes
different treatments that is one is the
first-line treatment the first-line
treatment includes two parts one is the
ISM and one and the two the one is
called as OCA
and which is used for seven to 14 days
and the second one is OCM which is used
again for 7 to 14 days so OCA in which
over means O'Meara's all see is cali
through myosin and a is a mock Salam and
over omeprazole kali through myosin and
metronidazole so these are the two
combinations which are used as
first-line drugs so this is called as
triple drug therapy and the second line
again includes one more rhythm that is
resumed third there is reason in third
which includes OB TM which is used for 2
weeks
ok this OB TM which includes omeprazole
be for a heavy metal that is bismuth
Tifa tetracycline and I am for the
maternity shoulder okay so this is the
main important points related to this
particular type of battery so apart from
this you can make a note that this H by
L is usually acquired in
okay as increases the prevalence of
occurrence of these organism increases
and coming to the reservoirs and humans
have the only reserved voice for this
particular bacteria and there is a study
that is clearly showing that man-to-man
transmission is by the fecal-oral or or
a frequent route the source of infection
is the gastric mucosa only as already
discussed it is most commonly associated
with the fecal-oral similar freak over
so it is most commonly seen with
children most commonly seen with low
socioeconomic status people and most
commonly seen with a poor oral hygiene
or are crowded areas where the food or
any of any of these things were easily
get polluted okay so this is how this
bacteria will cause infection
