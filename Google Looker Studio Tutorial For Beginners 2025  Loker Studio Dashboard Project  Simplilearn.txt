hi everyone welcome to Simply learn
today we will learn data analysis and
how to build a dashboard with Google
looker studio for better understanding
let's go through a simple use case on
analyzing sales performance so that we
can come up with a report to assess
improvisation in overall sales
performance now let's go through a
simple context here's the one let's
consider a simple case for our realtime
sales dashboard for business growth
let's imagine there's a client and the
client owns a business operating across
various regions and product categories
with goals to grow and improve
performance now let's discuss the
challenge the client struggles with
limited visibility into sales data
traffic to lead ratios and lead to order
conversion rates this lack of
information leads to missed
opportunities and inefficient resource
allocation now let's plan the solution
with our sales dashboard a real-time
sales dashboard provides a client with a
very clear view of critical business
metrics including sales by region and
state product category performance
traffic to lead ratio lead to order
conversion rate impact on business
strategy and much more let's discuss
that one after the other first one sales
by region and state the dashboard will
show realtime sales across regions and
states allowing client to identify where
which areas are performing well and
which needs more attention now the
second one product category performance
sales breakdowns by product category
will help the client determine which
products are driving revenue and which
may need more Focus this allows for
targeted marketing and inventory
management third one traffic to lead
ratio the dashboard will display the
percentage of web visitors converting
into leads if this ratio is low the
client can improve we usability and
promotional strategies lead to order
conversion rate tracking lead to order
conversions reveals how many leads
become customers a low conversion rate
signals the need for changes in the
sales process for improved checkouts
next ahead we have impact on the
business strategy the dashboard gives
the client actionable insights to focus
resources where they are needed the most
understanding which regions and product
categories are underperforming allows
for timely adjustments so in inclusion a
realtime sales dashboard enables the
client to monitor critical metrics
address inefficiencies and make
datadriven decisions that said if these

Interest now without further delay let's
get started with our Lookers dashboard
project so what are we covering in list
so we will be understanding what exactly
is looker or looker studio and then we
will learn how to create an account for
Looker Studio it's really simple it
takes just a couple of steps and
followed by that we will have a brief
introduction to Lucas Studio once we log
in once we have a web page which
displays a Locus Studio we will go
through the measures and dimensions and
also all the types of charts and cards
that we have in our inventory and
followed by that we'll get started with
check checking all the data sources
whether we can import data from a studio
like uh SS SMB which is Microsoft SQL
server or MySQL or if you can take data
from your Google Sheets or Excel file or
if you have any other website or
anything else do you need any extra
plugins so we will have a brief Lookout
on that and lastly once we have a brief
understanding about all the ins and outs
of Google Luca Studio we will get
started with building one of the real
real time looker dashboard for SES
performance I hope I made myself clear
with the agenda now let's get started
firstly what exactly is looker or what
exactly is looker Studio from Google so
just like powerbi and tblo looker is
also an online business intelligence
platform from Google that helps you
access analyze and visualize your
business data now proceeding ahead let's
understand how to create an account in
looka so to login or create a new
account account in Locus studio just
Google Locus studio and you will be
redirected to this particular search
results go to sign in options and here
just click on that and here you can see
a new uh web page and here you have the
Account Details so here I've logged in
with this user ID here uh I can see I
have logged in as my user id here and
here we have uh recent reports data
sources Explorer so if you have already
created a report let's say you have
already used lucus studio and created a
dashboard then you will have all the
reasons in here but if you have not
worked on any of the recent reports
you'll have nothing here so by default
um you will have these reports on your
lookus studio Google analytics for
report Acme marketing search console
report just for a demo purpose just so
that you have a brief understanding or
you can use this as a template and add
your data and if you want to create a
new uh blank report just click on here
and you can create a blank report and
here you can choose your
country and
Company so um let's type simply
Lear look
demo and agree to all the service terms
and
continue there you go you have success y
created all and here you have step two
and if you want um updates from looker
on a daily basis you can choose yes to
all but I don't want any of the updates
you can go with
no enter so you have a continue button
in the bottom right corner just click on
continue and you must be redirected to a
new page there you go now you can
continue with your actions
and if you check the data sources we
have a wide variety of data sources here
just click on create a new report or you
can click on data source to check the
data sources first there you go now you
can see we have resources from Google
analytics Google ads Google spreadsheets
you can also upload a file if you have
something in your computer or if you you
can also add some Microsoft Excel files
you can connect it back you can get
connected with Amazon red shift and a
few other
in case if you are having any other
third party databases then you can use
some of these connectors and get
connected to the source right now we
will use Microsoft Excel or you can also
upload a
file click here to upload files I have
something in my
downloads this is about the orders and
sales data so it's processing it's
uploaded
processing now the file has been
successfully uploaded now here you have
a few more settings that you can proceed
with let's say you don't want to keep
the column header or something like that
you can uh select those column headers
or specific r that you want to include
and eliminate them but I want to include
the entire sheet so let's go with that
option here and add and before that here
you might have this is the data set name
and here you have just one sheet let's
say your workbook had m multiple sheets
maybe 10 15 and here you can have an
option to select a specific sheet that
you want to work on and then add since I
have just one sheet in this workbook I
just proceed with ADD and shortly your
data should be added and you can also
have an option of renaming this
report so now you'll get a small window
which tells you you're about to add this
data to report so if you want this popup
to come every time you're trying to load
a data you can keep it but if not you
can just mark it as don't show this to
me again and just add it to the
report and here you go now let's try to
cancel let's try to rename this Untitled
report as sales performance sales
performance report now looker has
already started to create some of the
tables on its own so if you want to
continue with them you can but if not if
you can just eliminate or delete them
and here you have the data and these are
all your columns so uh the ones
mentioned as or noted as 1 to 3 are your
measures and the ones mentioned or noted
as ABC are your dimensions and the ones
uh you know indicated with a calendar
symbol are your dates right now these
are the columns you have and if you come
here you can see add a control where you
can select some dropdown slider slicers
and everything and if you select this
particular option you you have a wide
variety of charts and graphs that you
can make use of right and if you want to
add a text window or some text block you
can choose that from here if you want to
add some lines or shapes you can do that
right you have shapes right here and
lines right here and if you want to add
anything else than that like data or
build a chart here you go now these are
the few things that you need to focus on
correct and now you have all the
information related to the charts that
you can work on the data dimensions and
measures that you can work on and also
the shapes that you can include in your
dashboard now let's continue or try
start building the dashbo that you're
looking for now let me add a background
or a template where I want to have my
dashboard so you can do that by just
selecting add an image from my computer
and here you have um yes here you go
this would be my dashboard template or
the background for my dashboard where we
have some already existing names and uh
sections where we want to add some
charts right so if you could extract or
drag this around to fit the sheet you
have ear traffic leads orders Revenue
State product region category status all
states month- on Monon sales right so
there there you go now let's start by
adding a few filters add a control and I
want the drop down right place the drop
down where you want it I want it right
here and uh forget about the size we can
minimize or maximize the size and here
in the control field I want the odd date
so drag and drop it in the
field select the a date there you go now
you can expand or contract this
particular one to fit your required size
and here you have the audit date right
now you you can select the dates and if
you could expand this particular one you
can also select uh ear types
right so here you have yearly quarter
right just select year and you'll have
year wise dates here
or if you want a specific date you can
just add a specific date there and now
comes the traffic you can just simply
copy paste this one or you can let's
have a habit of creating uh that
particular one now let's go with the
kpis so you choose the add chart symbol
here you can go with the scorecard right
just select the scorecard and drop it
right
here and we can you know change
the size of it and in place of uh metric
we have a count so instead of that we
will go with the traffic which is right
here just click on traffic and the
aggregation should be U sum so you can
see the aggregation is sum if you want
to change you can change it by selecting
that edit icon right there now this is
your traffic and uh
apart from that you have leads here so
just go to chart again add a
card and drop it right
here so once you've dropped it right
here you can change the
size and in the dimension you have to
select
leads there you go and make sure that it
is sum so you have sum of leads and you
can even copy and paste it
so let's do that once
again for
Revenue so here you will be selecting
orders and for Revenue you will be
selecting revenue and make sure the
aggregation is
sum so we have the kpis we have traffic
leads orders and revenu set right right
there and you can select or copy the
drop- down option
here or you can add a new
one so we have copy pasted the state
here so instead of customer name we
might have to select the state name here
which should be right
here select the state and for product
you can select the your you can replace
the customer name with the product
name there you go and you're done now
let's have region wise sales here uh I
would like to add a chart maybe a byy
chart drop it right here so in dimension
you might have to select the region and
here you might have to select the yeah
it automatically selected so we have the
order numbers and it already segregated
in in terms of percentage right now I
can also decrease the size so that you
can fit it right here and each and every
color has a different region and now
let's proceed with the category now you
can copy and paste the same one or you
can go with a new chart now let's say we
go with
u a bar graph and d drop it right over
here now in instead of Dimension region
you go with category and instead of uh
any other thing okay it automatically
selected the categories and Order
accounts now you can minimize the size a
little
bit so that it fits the region we have
allocated for that and now we have
status now let's go with a different
type of chart we will go with the donut
chart here and let's drop it right there
and instead of category we will select
the order
status where which is right here now we
have the details for the orders
delivered in transit and cancel you can
minimize the size so that it fits
properly in the block we have created
for it now we will try the map chart
which will show us the sales happening
in overall American states so this is
where we will be going to including it
now add a chart and here you can select
uh okay add a chart and here you will be
selecting the map
chart let's go with the filled map
chart and drop it right
here and now here instead of order date
and delivery date we will add a
dimension
here and before that let's select the
orders order ID some of order ID and the
Tool Tech we will use the state
all here it is there you
go okay there is some data type issue
not a
problem let's try to change it to Geo
chart let's delete this
one and here let's add GE Dimensions
estate and Order IDE your orders to
Matrix
we will be having a map shortly it's
loading now you
can fit the dimension
to
map it's loading but not an issue let it
load slowly keep it over here and lastly
we have month-on-month sales so whenever
you're considering month on month or
whenever you're considering a calendar
which has date data type always consider
uh a line graph okay now record count in
instead of metric here let's say let's
go with
the drill down should
be
order
dat and here if you want you can drill
down and make it look like uh you have
uh the month on month sale you can
specifically select a date over here and
you can get it over here this
configuration data source improperly
configured let's try to reconfigure
that so Dimension should be ordered date
and breakdown should be
orders so okay it's loading so there is
some configuration error slowly loading
not to worry so there you
go so we have a fully functional
dashboard here now you can select any
specific State and you will be having a
completely interactive dashboard right
there or you can select only here so
that you can have only Washington data
so this is how it works it's completely
interactive now that's how you use
Google's looker Studio to create an
interactive dashboard for sales
performance and with that we have come
