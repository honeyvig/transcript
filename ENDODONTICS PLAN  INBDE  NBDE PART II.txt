hi everyone this is dr srikanth
from team inbd conquer
now i'm going to give a brief idea of
what we need to do
with our first subject that is
endodontics
so i feel like compared to most of the
subjects endo is a bit easy so this is
uh the game plan of endor in front of
you so for the convenience i have
divided the
endotopics into following things and
whatever i have mentioned are
most important things when compared to
the leftover thing so
among the list of the topics the biggest
topic is going to be others
okay so where many other topics are
being included but
the most important topics are as listed
above
that is the diagnosis part of endo
like apart from the normal diagnosis of
endo we are going to discuss the
diagnosis from
all the aspects okay so few few aspects
from
the diagnosis of i mean like moreover
will be oriented towards endodontic
diagnosis but
a bit of aspects of oral surgery or oral
radiology or oral medicine and many
other topics
are going to be discussed so that's what
called as integrated approach which we
have
discussed in the last class okay so
endo and like endodontic diagnosis i
want to keep
two days for you as you're going to
start it
and coming to the internal anatomy okay
so coming to the internal anatomy in
this internal anatomy we'll be talking
about the
individual teeth internal anatomy okay
whereas your external anatomy
is again going to be discussed in your
dental anatomy okay dental anatomy you
are going to talk both about internal
anatomy
as well as external anatomy of of course
in endodontic point of view
in internal anatomy is more important so
internal anatomy i'm going to drop one
day
so when i'm talking about the biology
all the cells that is
the the nature of pulp the nerves that
are present in the pulp
the cells that are present in the pulp
the vessels that are present in the pulp
and all the
all those stuff we are going to discuss
and i'm going to drop one day
and pain uh yes of course pain is again
internally related to your nerves and
everything
so it's going to be part of your pulpal
biology itself okay the same
and the axis opening is again internally
related with
the internal anatomy but axe opening
where i am going to talk about few
important instruments which helps in
axis opening and of course the shapes of
the different axis opening of different
teeth we are going to talk that is going
to be one day
so of course the biggest part is
instrumentation in endodontics so i'm
going to adopt two days for it
because i'm going we're going to talk
about all the types of instruments which
are used at different levels
or in different steps of endodontics
then comes the material aspect material
aspect is very important we're going to
talk two days
and we're going to talk about the
endodontic surgery for one day
and the results for one day so apart
from this this specific topic called
as others so what others contains
internally we're going to discuss on the
group okay so
we're going to discuss that on the group
so yeah this others will contain
your some some topics and definitions
about the working length
some topics and definitions about the
biomechanical preparation and how which
which has more advantages which is most
regularly used
and then we are going to talk about the
obturation obturation techniques
of course obturation materials we are
going to talk in materials but the
techniques we are going to talk in
others
similarly there are many other minor
important aspects which are very very
important in examination point of view
especially the case based discussions
case with so uh according to me at every
level we are going to talk about this
integrated integrated case based
discussions okay by giving uh by giving
the clinical features and
some information and history from the
patient we are going to talk about the
all the aspects what is the material of
choice
what is the treatment option what is the
diagnosis
and all these aspects are going to be
discussed in the case based discussion
so
we may start i mean like we'll have one
sort of case based discussion
in the initial phase that is during the
diagnosis part and further in
others will have two to three case-based
discussions okay
so where i'm going to drop two days
for others and followed by the
doubts and the students choice
so along with the revision doubts and
the students choice okay
we're going to have two to three days so
this is a rough schedule of endo what we
have planned for you
so considering endo as a first subject
so i'm going to give a bit more time and
compared to most other subjects and make
sure you try to give your best
make a note indo is completely
separated from operator industry so
indoor has
good importance and similarly your
operating industry will have the same
important it's not
like it's not the combination of endo
and operator consider as one subject
in your inbd okay maybe not only
in indian based entrances where indo and
operator
are considered as one subject whereas
most of the entrances throughout the
country
they are considered as two subjects so
hindu is
one of the special subject which has
good weight is
in your examination hall so it's going
to be easy and it's going to be special
so
give some care love so that you can
return this subject
for a good amount of time
yes done for now signing off dr srikanth
