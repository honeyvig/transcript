let me ask you a quick question
which of the following programming
languages is commonly used for
developing web applications a python B C
plus plus C JavaScript or D Ruby you can
pause this video and answer in the
comment section below alright so now
let's begin with the first topic that is
decide your goals for programming
so programming is a broad term that
encompasses a vast array of activities
from creating software applications web
applications to designing complex
algorithms that can solve integrate
problems this field is constantly
evolving and the possibilities of what
can be achieved through programming are
Limitless
first of all you have to decide what
kind of programming you want to do there
are various kinds of fields
in programming which you can explore for
example web development mobile
development embedded system programming
data science and analytics programming
Etc
so when deciding on a goal for
programming it is important to consider
your interests strengths and future
aspirations
start by asking yourself what type of
programming projects you what languages
and Frameworks you are most comfortable

programming so let's have a look at them
first is web development so web
development refers to creation and
maintenance of websites web applications
and other digital Solutions using
various programming languages tools and
Frameworks it involves the entire
process of building and deploying a
website including designing the user
interface writing the code and
integrating databases and other backend
systems
web developers May specialize in
front-end development which focuses on
the user interface now this UI is the
way we see and use our website
it includes buttons menus text boxes and
other elements that allow users to input
information or make selections
some web developers may also have
expertise in both front-end and back-end
development making them a full stack

some of the categories of programming
which you should keep in mind while
preparing or entering into the
programming world
now let's understand how to start
learning programming
so the first thing you will need is the
right mindset
while doing programming or coding you
will get stuck multiple times and that's
perfectly fine
in fact ninety percent of your
programming experience will involve just
looking at the screen and trying to find
and fix errors and books
the remaining 10 percent will be
dedicated to actually typing and
programming
it is essential to remember that getting
stuck is a natural part of programming
process and it's okay to feel frustrated
developing a strong mindset is crucial
to overcome these challenges and
achieving success as a programmer
so before you begin your coding Journey
make sure you are mentally prepared for
the ups and downs that come with it
The Next Step would be learning the
basics
you must start with one programming
language first don't get started with
multiple programming languages at the
same time this will make you confused
and you will not be able to understand
any of those languages deeply
so start with one programming language
first start learning and understand its
Basics there are many resources
available for learning programming
including online courses books and video
tutorials
find a resource that works for you your
learning style and be committed to it
programming is a Hands-On activity once
you have a basic understanding of
programming language start working on
simple projects to practice your skills
as you'll gain more experience you can
move on to more complex projects also
programming can be a challenging and
it's okay to ask for help when you get
stuck there are many resources available
including forums and online communities
the next is taking challenges
taking on challenges is an essential
part or aspect of programming for
beginners
as it allows them to develop their
skills and grow their knowledge in a
practical and engaging way
challenges can come in many forms from
small coding exercises to large and more
complex projects
one of the benefits of taking on
programming challenges is that it helps
beginners to build confidence and
self-assurance
by successfully completing coding
challenges beginners gain a sense of
accomplishment and satisfaction which
can help motivate them to continue
learning and improving
next is making a project
making a simple project is an essential
part of Journey of programming
especially for beginners it offers a
practical way to learn and apply key
programming Concepts and tools and helps
to solidify understanding and build
confidence
one of the main benefit of making a
simple project is that it provides a
tangible goal to work towards which can
help to motivate Learners and keep them
engaged
by working towards a specific projects
Learners are able to see the Practical
applications of the programming Concepts
they are learning which can make the
learning experience more meaningful and
memorable
another benefit of making a simple
project is that it allows Learners to
experiment and make mistakes in a safe
and controlled environment by working on
small simple project Learners can test
out different approaches and strategies
without the risk of breaking more
complex programs or applications
beginners can also use Version Control
Systems like GitHub Beanstalk Mercurial
git Etc
git is a version control system that
enables developers to manage their
source code and collaborate with other
developers effectively
it allows developers to track changes in
their code revert to the previous
versions merge changes made by different
developers and work on different
versions of the same code base
simultaneously
programming for beginners can be an
exciting and rewarding Journey that
opens up new opportunities for
creativity problem solving and
Innovation while the learning curve can
be steep taking the time to master the
basics and build a practical experience
through projects is the key to become a
successful programmer starting with the
fundamental concepts such as variables
data types and control flow statements
beginners can gradually progress to more
advanced topics like algorithms data
structures and software architecture
by practicing these Concepts through
projects Learners can gain a deep
understanding of how they work in
practice and build confidence in their
ability to create working programs
