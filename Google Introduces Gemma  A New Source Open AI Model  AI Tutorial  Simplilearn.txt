hello everyone welcome to Simply L
YouTube channel today we will explore
the hotest topics in the AI industry
Gemma in this video we'll dive into
topics like what is Gemma and we'll see
some Gemma features and capabilities of
Gemma after this we will look into
various Frameworks tools and Hardware
platforms of Gemma and we'll conclude
this video with future of Gemma and now
let's have the brief introduction about
Gemma Google has led the way in AI
research making substantial
contributions to the open source
Community by developing gamechanging
Technologies such as tensorflow B T5 JX
Alpha fold and Alpha code Google has
unveiled Gemma and llm designed for
responsible AI development continuing
this tradition Gemma harness is the same
research and technology that Propel the
gini models before jumping into what GMA
is here is a quick info for you if you
want to switch careers with a ml then
try giving simply learns postgraduate
program in AI machine learning from for
University in collaboration with IBM a
short this course teaches in demand
skills such as machine learning deep
learning NLP computer vision
reinforcement learning generative AI
prom engineering chat JP and many more
so don't forget to check out the course
link from the description box and pin
comment so let's start with what is
Gemma Google recently introduced the new
models called The Gemini these models
are big and meant for hard task however
the newly launched Gemma is a small and
lighter model its main purpose purp is
to help developers build AI in a
responsible way following Google's AI
rules JMA represents a suit of advanced
lightweight open models constructed from
the same research and Technology
utilized in the development of the
Gemini models formulated by Google Deep
Mind and other Google teams Gemma draws
inspiration from Gemini and its name
derives from the Latin term Gemma
signifying a precious stone in addition
to providing our model weights Google is
also unveiling tools that promote
developer creativity encourage
collaboration and promote the
responsible use of Gemma models now that
we have understood what is Gemma let us
now go a bit further it's obvious that
Gemma isn't the only llm out there but
what is this big deal about Gemma that
everyone is talking about that's what we
will discuss in this next segment Gemma
features so let's start with the number
one that is streamline design Gemma is
available in two configurations
featuring either 2B or 7B parameters
significantly reducing its footprint
compared to large models this translates
into quicker inference speeds and less
computational demand making it
particularly suitable for personal
computers and even mobile devices the
next is open source availability unlike
many high performance large language
models like gp4 B Gemini gma's code and
parameters are accessible to everyone
allowing developers and researchers to
experiment customize and contribute to
its advancement freely the next is task
specific variants in addition to pre-
train models JMA also provides
instruction tune models these llm models
are better knowledge Learners versions
tailored for particular task such as
question answering and summarization
this refinement enhances performance and
adaptability for real world applications
Beyond its technical features Gemma has
a broader impact it democratizes access
to Advanced llms encouraging Innovation
and collaboration with the AI Community
its potential applications span numerous
fields from personal productivity tools
and chat boards to code generation and
scientific research by lowering entry
barriers Gemma promises to accelerate
progress in natural language processing
and help shape the future of AI now
moving forward we'll see what are the
capabilities of Gemma so starting with
the number one that is compelling
narrative creation that utilizes gemma's
text generation capabilities to craft
lifelike and captivating stories then we
have seamless language translation
easily convert text between languages
with gemma's multilingual proficiency
and then we have noge presentation
utilize Jemma's question answering
models to offer enlightening and
informative answers and now coming to
the next capability that is innovative
content production push creative
boundaries by experimenting with poetry
script writing or code generation using
Gemma after successful completion of
features and capabilities of Jemma now
let's understand Frameworks tools and
Hardware platforms supported by Gemma
you can customize Gemma models to meet
specific application requirements like
summarization or retrial argumented
generation that is RG so RG is an AI
framework for improving the quality of
llm generated responses by grounding the
model wide ranging tool hardware and
framework supported by Gemma are number
one multif framework tools leverage your
preferred framework with reference
implementations available for inference
and find F tuning across multi framework
caras and fine tuning across multif
framework caras 3.0 native py to JX and
hugging face Transformers and then we
have cross device compatibility run
Gemma models on popular device types
such as laptops desktops iot devices
mobile devices and Cloud servers
ensuring broad accessibility to AI
capabilities and then we have
state-ofthe-art Hardware platforms
collaborating with Nvidia we have
optimized Gemma for Nvidia gpus spanning
data center servers Cloud infrastructure
and local RTX AI pieces guaranteeing
topn performance and seamless
integration with Cutting Edge technology
and last we have Google cloud
optimization utilize Vex a for a
comprehensive mlops tool set offering an
area of tuning options and oneclick
deployment with built-in inference
optimizations further customization
options are available through fully
managed vertex AI tools or self-managed
gxc facilitating deployment to cost
effective infrastructure across GPU TPU
and CPU on either platform so next let's
talk about future of Gemma gma's arrival
in the llm world is a big deal it's
smaller and easier to use than other
models opening up AI to more people its
open source nature encourages
collaboration boosting language
processing and shaping ai's future its
open source nature forers Global
collaboration driving progress in
understanding fairness and efficiency it
might Pioneer models that handle text
images sound and video looking forward
gemma's AI approach makes it accessible
to everyone we can expect more cool apps
and upgrades its open source status
ensures ongoing development in the world
