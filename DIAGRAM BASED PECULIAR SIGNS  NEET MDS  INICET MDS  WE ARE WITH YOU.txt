hi everyone this is dr g sayeth
team mds conquer so now i'm going to
discuss about the peculiar signs which
have been exhibited by many diseases
i think it's quite important for your
exam because many diseases have
their own unique or peculiar science
which i think you need to know them
clearly
so i've arranged them in an alphabetical
order so we'll discuss one by one
so coming to the first one the
asbo-hansen sign i think you're quite
familiar with this
so which states that when there is a
bullet and when we apply pressure on
that bullet
the bullet will spread laterally so it
is also called as
bullet spread phenomena and this is seen
with
pemphigus
okay so as bei hansen sign also called
as bullet spread phenomena
so when a pressure is applied on the
bullet the
bullet will spread laterally okay so
this is called as a asbo hanson sign
same with pemphigus vulgaris next
is the ospit sign so i think even you
know this so this is seen with psoriasis
so here you can see the scales of the
skin so when the successive layers of
this scaly skin
is being removed then you can find the
bleeding points
so which is nothing but the auspice sign
and this is seen with the patient
suffering from
skin disease called as a psoriasis okay
so when the successive layers of this
scaly skin is being removed
you can find out the bleeding points
there okay so this is the ospit sign
next the battle sign very important
because in an emergency ward
if you find a patient with a head trauma
and if you find the ecchymosis in the
mastoid
area or a bruise in the moisturized area
then it is called as a battle sign
which is quite important because the
patient has to be immediately attended
so this occurs after or followed by a
head trauma so it is nothing but
a chymosis or the bruise which is seen
in the mastoid region so that is the
battle sign next sign is a
