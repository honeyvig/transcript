is one of the most used open source
general purpose scripting languages that
is especially suited for web development
and can be embedded into html
now let's see how the code works
the server executes the php code and
then the client receives a generated
html however if a newcomer wants to
learn an open source scripting language
php is the right choice for rim
moving forward let us see who is a php
developer what job does he have to do
a php developer is a professional who
develops applications programs and
websites using the dynamic scripting
language called php

sounds
moving forward let us have a look at the
roles and responsibilities of a php

issues involving css html and scripting
often between a series of different
platforms and browsers

performance on all sorts of browsers
like mobile notebook tablet and solve
the issues identified by customer
feedback
once the website performance is done
ensure you analyze research and explore
various architectural considerations
relating to the system design process
including web usability the website's
performance and database design

alternatives for implementing new
application features

php developer should interact and work
alongside other development teams and
company management to solve conflicts
establish priorities select the best
solutions or develop criteria for new
