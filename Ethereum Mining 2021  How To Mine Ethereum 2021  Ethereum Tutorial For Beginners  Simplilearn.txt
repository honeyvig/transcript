ethereum is the second best
cryptocurrency in the world and due to
its popularity everybody looks up to its
performance in the crypto market
you do it it catches the attention of
every person more and more people
participate in this network
but how exactly to do it
and the answer is ethereum mining by
mining ethereum you can participate in
the ethereum network as well as
contribute to its performance in crypto
market
so in today's video we will focus on
ethereum mining and explore its concepts
hey everyone i am xiaomi and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
known on ethereum mining
in this video we will explore ethereum
mining and we'll go through some of the
fascinating concepts and components
revolving around it
first we will have an introduction to
ethereum
then we will understand what is ethereum
mining
then we will explore why should we mine
ethereum
we will look into the types of ethereum
mining
and then we will understand how the
ethereum mining process works
then we should explore how exactly to
mine ethereum
then we will discuss will the proof of
stake transaction kill proof of work
and then finally we will find out is
mining ethereum profitable
so without doing much ado let's get
started with the video
let's bring you up to speed on ethereum
ethereum is defined as a blockchain
based computing platform that enables
its developers to build and deploy
decentralized applications
and make sure all the transactions are
cryptographically secured in the network
ether is the cryptocurrency of ethereum
used to build decentralized applications
smart contracts and make standard
peer-to-peer payments
ether basically acts as fuel for the
ethereum network it tracks and
facilitates all the transactions
so that brings us to what is ethereum
mining
in simple words ethereum mining is a
process of creating and adding a block
of transaction to the blockchain network
of ethereum
it uses the proof of work consensus
mechanism for mining ethereum
all transactions taking place in the
ethereum network needs to get approved
by the miners
miners is a community of people using a
hashing script etas to solve
computationally hard puzzles for
successfully mining the blocks of
transactions in the ethereum blockchain
network
which helps secure the network from
attacks like hacking or manipulation of
identity
now let's understand why we need to mine
ethereum
the primary goal for mining ethereum is
to make money a data mining contract of
sectoring the network into a relatively
complex but profitable business
also miners receive a certain amount as
a reward for mining each block of the
ethereum blockchain network
including the transaction fees paid by
the users
thus italian mining benefits each and
everyone participating in ethereum
blockchain network
so
what are the types of ethereum mining
ethereum mining can be performed in
three ways ethereum solar mining
ethereum coal mining and ethereum cloud
mining
in ethereum solar mining you will get
rewarded only if you solve the puzzle
and mine dietary block first
since here you are competing with many
people and companies you have to be very
good at your work
also solar mining is only profitable
when you have plenty of resources with
you like 100 plus graphics cards
and in solo mining having so much
equipment may use a lot of electricity
and space leading to high electricity
bills and not everyone has a
considerable amount of area needed
intake and coal mining is the easiest
and fastest way to get started with
itaria mining
in this you work along with other people
together in a single pool
and if someone from the pool gets the
hash code correctly they share the
reward among everyone in the pool
we should consider a few important
factors before joining a pool like pool
size minimum payout and pool fee
pool size determines the number of
blocks you find in the ethereum network
and it shares rewards
as the number of miners increases the
chances to get rewards also increase
minimum payout is the minimum amount of
ethereum you need to mine before it gets
credited to your wallet
and 40 is the amount you need to pay to
continue using the pool
this amount is percentage based on the
amount of ethereum you're mining
ethereum cloud mining you pay someone
else with the equipment to my ethereum
for you
you pay some amount of money as peace to
them for investing their time and
resources
and in return they provide you with the
reward they gained by the mining
ethereum
bus
this technique of mining ethereum has
some pros and cons to
suppose you're not responsible for any
equipment damage you don't have to
acquire all the necessary equipment and
look for ample space to store it
you can set that observe market and
enjoy the reward for your investment in
interior mining
cons if the italian price drop then
there is no way you are getting your
money back the money you invested or the
fees paid to the miner is lost
and you can't ask the other person to
change the equipment according to your
concern
ethereum cloud mining is considered a
safer way for mining service providers
the guarantee a profit for the resource
they have purchased
now let's understand how the ethereum
mining process works
ethereum mining follows a specific set
of steps to function
step 1 a user requests a transaction
with the help of the private key of his
digital wallet account
then the request is shared worldwide
with the ethereum network
next the requested transaction is added
to a list of pending transactions that
needs to be added to the ethereum
blockchain network
step 4 the miner then verifies and
validates the requested transaction and
perform a complex mathematical puzzle on
the transaction data
step 5 once the request transaction is
verified
and it stores a copy of it in edm the
process of proof of work begins for the
respective block
step 6 when the notes of the ethereum
network verify at the checksum of the
state of the miner's block matches the
checksum of the updated state of the
email after execution of all
transactions
step 7 only after that the block is
added to the ethereum blockchain network
step 8 on successfully mining the block
it rewards the miner with some amount of
ether in their wallet
the block reward of ethereum is 3 ether
step nine the requested transaction is
approved and credited for the respective
wallet or wallet
each transaction is mined only once but
every participant of the ethereum
network verifies it
this makes me curious about how to mine
ethereum
tools you will need to be an efficient
miner for ethereum on your personal
computer are an ethereum wallet to store
all your currency on
gpu drivers or graphics card with a
minimum of 3gb ram
a mining software suitable according to
your hardware like gpu
and a compatible operating system
windows 7 or 10 with 64 bit
before getting started with mining
iteration you need to create an ethereum
wallet to store all your ether
fresh model t and ledger nano are the
most reliable and secure wallets in the
market of cryptocurrency
installing gpu drivers or graphics card
after creating your digital wallet you
need to update all the hardware
that is drives in your system
you can use two types of graphics cards
they are amd graphics card and nvidia
graphics card
claymore is considered the best
processor for mining ethereum on gp
drivers
now we need to follow a few
set of steps to get started with mining
step one download the latest version of
claymore dual miner for the operating
system
the latest version is claymore 11.0
step 2 click on the latest version of
windows and download the zip file
step 3 extract the files with claymore
11.0 to a folder on desktop for easy
access
open the folder to have a look at the
files
step 5. right click on start and then on
the edit option
step 6. edit the start.txt file and add
these lines
step 7 choose your desired pool from
these recommendations
you can also find better search results
than these according to your region
step 8 type in your full address instead
of mining pool address
step nine save your start.txt file
within new updates
remember while saving select type as all
files
and step 10 once you save click on the
clay.bat file to begin mining ethereum
now let's explore will the proof of
state transition field trooper work
the newly introduced concept of ethereum
2.0 roadmaps plans to upgrade to proof
of stake
consensus algorithm in which it will
provide all existing miners of the dairy
network with a limited time to earn a
return for the investment
this expected to be launched by the end
of 2021
or the starting of 2022.
it was supposed to be launched by
october 2020 but the history of delays
regarding this update is worth talking
about
nobody truly knows when ethereum 2.0
will be completed and introduced to the
crypto mining world
now when we know all about ethereum
mining this makes me wonder if ethereum
mining is profitable
the profit of any crypto mining majorly
depends on the cost of electricity in
that particular area
as a rule anything below
0.12 dollar per kilowatt consumes in an
hour is considered profitable
you can mine ether and turn it into a
vital source of income by analyzing
these figures like hash rate of ethereum
block reward number of blocks per day
and the coin price of ethereum
you can also use an iterating calculator
to figure out the daily revenue basing
it on these factors
or you can use this formula too
the predictions are made that the
ethereum price can rise and become more
stable in the coming few years so it is
an excellent opportunity to invest in
and save an ethereum
so this is all about ethereum mining we
have almost reached the end of this
