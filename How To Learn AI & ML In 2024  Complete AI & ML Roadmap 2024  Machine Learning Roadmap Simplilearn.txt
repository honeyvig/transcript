below dive into the link in the
description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your back
then try a simply postgraduate program
in Ai and machine learning from P
University in collaboration with IBM
this core teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
compter Vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engineering chat
GPT and many more so don't forget to
check out the course link from the
description box below and the pin
command so without any further Ado let's
get started so how this machine learning
road map will help you this machine
learning road map offers a clear and
structured path to mastering machine
learning by following this road map you
will not only gain valuable knowledge
but also develop a mindset gear towards
Innovation and adaptability so what is
machine learning and AI imagine a
computer that learns from data like a
student that's machine learning and
machine learning is a subset of
artificial intelligence AI that enables
computer to learn from the data and make
prediction or decision without being
explicitly programmed it uses algorithm
and Stat models to improve performance
or specific task through experience or
data input so Artificial Intelligence on
the other hand covers a broader scope
and involves developing computer system
that perform tasks typically requiring
human intelligence so machine learning
is a crucial component of AI providing
the capability to learn and adapt from
the data so now let's move forward and
see the steps for AIML road map so step
by step machine learning road map so
this stepbystep machine learning road
map guides you through mastering ml a
vital branch of AI typically over
several months to a year so depending on
your background so start with prequest
like programming python R stat and
linear algebra progress through
understanding data processing learning
algorithms and model evaluation and
optimization so this structured approach
combined with Hands-On projects will
solfi you ml expertise while preparing
you for the advanced topics and machine
learning applications in the dynamic
field so now let's get started this step
one master in mathematics so to excel in
machine learning a strong foundation in
mathematics is essential so focus on the
following areas the first one is lar
algebra and calculus so linear algebra
is the backbone of many machine learning
algorithms it helps you understand how
each algorithm Works whereas calculus is
crucial for optimizing algorithm used in
machine learning key concept include
like vectors metrix linear equations I
values differentiation integration and
gradient desent
the second one is probability and
statistics so probability and Stat are
fundamentals for analyzing data and
making prediction so here are some
important topics like probability
distribution descriptive stat hypothesis
testing regression analysis and basian
St so moving forward step two developing
programming skills Proficiency in
programming is essential focus on Python
and R the top language for machine
learning the first one python python is
a popular due to it Simplicity and
extensive Library like numai Panda
psyched learn so it's great for both
beginners and expert the second one is R
programming R is excellent for statical
analysis and data visualization
platforms like simply L offer
specialized sces in the r programming
the third important python libraries
learn libraries like nump for numerical
operations pandas for data manipulation
M plot leave and cbon for data
visualization and psychic learn for
machine learning
the third one exploring core machine
learning ml algorithms so once you have
got a good handle on math and
programming it's time to learn core
machine learning algorithm so
understanding these will help you solve
real world problems so here are some key
algorithms to explore the first one is
unsupervised learning algorithm explore
clustering that is K means clustering
and dimensionally reduction that is PCA
for understanding patterns in unlabeled
data the second one is supervised
learning algorithms learn regression for
continuous outcomes and classification
for discrete labels covering methods
like linear regression logistic
regression K years neighbor and support
Vector machine svms and the third one is
model evaluation and validation
understand evaluation metrics like
accuracy precision recall and F1 score
learn cross validation and performance
metric to assess model performance and
you can also learn other important
machine learning algorithm like
reinforcement learning gradient descent
and algorithm for slope understanding
step four learn Advanced Topic in
machine learning so as you advance in
machine learning the journey is
important to delve into more advanced
topic so these areas will deepen your
understanding and help you tackle
complex problem so here are some key
topics to focus on the first one is deep
learning and neural networks the second
is anible learning technique third one
is generative models and adversarial
learning the fourth one is
recommendation system and collaborative
filtering the last one his time series
analysis and
forecasting so for step five there is
learn
deployment so you have to learn how to
deploy models using flask D Jango cloud
services like AWS aure gcp then Docker
and kubernetes so deployment skills are
crucial for making your model accessible
and usable in real world applications so
moving forward let's see some machine
learning projects so work on real world
projects to apply your knowledge focus
on data collection preparation and
Capstone project in image recognition
NLP and there is one more predictive
modeling and anomaly Direction so
practical experience is the key to
solidifying your skills step seven
continuous learning and exploration so
stay updated with the latest development
by the following industry leaders
engaging in online communities and
working on your personal projects so
pursue Advanced learning through courses
and certification to keep your skill
shop so now moving forward let's see
machine learning career opportunities
with sell so the job market for machine
learning professional is booming the
average annual salary for machine
learning Engineers can vary based on
location experience and Company so here
are some roles like machine learning
engineer data scientist NLP engineer
computer vision engineer and AIML
researcher so let's see how much they
earn so the first one machine learning
engineer in us they earn around $153,000
and in India they earn around 11 lakhs
per the second is data scientist they
earn in us around
$157,000 and in India they earn around
12 lakhs per the third one is NLP
engineer in us they earn around
$17,000 and in India they earn around 7
lakh per the fourth one come to Vision
engineer they earn around
$126,000 in the US and in India they
earn around 6.5 lakh per the last one Ai
and mlz Searcher they earn around
$130,000 in the US and 9 lakh perom in
India so note that these figures can
vary on the website to website and
changes frequently the machine learning
road map provides a structured guide to
