on this exciting journey together
craving a career upgrade subscribe like
and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back then try a simpl postgraduate
program in Ai and machine learning from
P University in collaboration with IBM
this core teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
computer vision rein enforcement
learning Genera a prompt engineering
chat GPT and many more so don't forget
to check out the course link from the
description box below and the pin
command so without any further Ado let's
get started so what is machine learning
and AI imagine a computer that learns
from data like a student that's machine
learning and machine learning is a
subset of artificial intelligence AI
that enables computer to learn from the
data and make prediction or decision
without being explicitly programmed it
uses algorithm and Stat model to improve
performance or a specific task through
experience or data input so Artificial
Intelligence on the other hand covers a
broader scope and involves developing
computer system that perform tasks
typically requiring human intelligence
so machine learning is a crucial
component of AI providing the capability
to learn and adapt from the data so now
let's move forward and see the steps for
AIML road map so stepbystep machine
learning road map so this step-by-step
machine learning road map guides you
through mastering ml a vital branch of
AI typically over several months to a
year so depending on your background so
start with prequest like programming
python R stat and linear algebra
progress through understanding data
processing learning algorithms and model
evaluation and optimization so this
structured approach combined with
handson projects will solidied you ml
expertise while preparing you for the
advanced topics and machine learning
applications in the dynamic field so now
let's get started the step one mastering
mathematics so to excel in machine
learning a strong foundation in
mathematics is essential so focus on the
following areas the first one is linear
algebra and calculus so linear algebra
is the backbone of many machine learning
algorithms it helps you understand how
each algorithm Works whereas calculus is
crucial for optimizing algorithm used in
machine learning key concept include
like vectors Matrix linear equations I
values differentiation integration and
gradient descent the second one is
probability and statistics so
probability and Stat are fundamentals
for analyzing data and making prediction
so here are some important topics like
probability distribution descriptive
stat hypothesis testing regression
analysis and basian Stat so moving
forward step two developing programming
skills Proficiency in programming is
essential focus on Python and R the top
language for machine learning the first
one python python is a popular due to it
Simplicity and extensive Library like
numai Panda psyched learn so it's great
for both beginners and expert the second
one is R programming R is excellent for
statical analysis and data visualization
platforms like simply learn offer
specialized course in the r programming
the third important python libraries
learn libraries like numai for numerical
operations pandas for data manipulation
M plot leave and cbon for data VIs and
psyched learn for machine learning the
third one exploring core machine
learning ml algorithms so once you have
got a good handle on math and
programming it's time to learn core
machine learning algorithm so
understanding these will help you solve
real world problems so here are some key
algorithms to explore the first one is
unsupervised learning algorithm explore
clustering that is K means clustering
and dimensionally reduction that is PCA
for understanding patterns in unlabelled
data the second one is supervised
learning algorithms learn regression for
continuous outcomes and classification
for discrete labels covering methods
like linear regression logistic
regression K neighbor and support Vector
machine svms and the third one is model
evaluation and validation understand
evaluation metrics like accuracy
precision recall and F1 score learn
cross validation and performance metric
to assess model performance and you can
also learn other important machine
learning algorithm like reinforcement
learning gradient descent and algorithm
for slope understanding step four learn
Advanced Topic in machine learning so as
you advance in machine learning the
journey it's important to delve into
more advanced topic so these areas will
deepen your understanding and help you
tackle complex problem so here are some
key topics to focus on the first one is
deep learning and neural networks the
second is anable learning technique
third one is generative models and
adversarial learning the fourth one is
recommendation system and collaborative
filtering the last one is time series
analysis and
forecasting so for step five there is
learn
deployment so you have to learn how to
deploy models using flask D Jango cloud
services like AWS aure gcp then Docker
and kubernetes so deployment skills are
crucial for making your model accessible
and usable in real world applications so
moving forward let's see some machine
learning projects so work on real world
projects to apply your knowledge focus
on data collection preparation and
Capstone project in image recognition
NLP and there is one more predictive
modeling and anomaly deduction so
practical experience is the key to
solidifying your skills step seven
continuous learning and exploration so
stay updated with the latest development
by the following industry leaders
engaging in online communities and
working on your personal projects so
pursue Advanced learning through courses
and certification to keep your skills
sharp so now moving forward let's see
machine learning career opportunities
with cell so the job market for machine
learning professional is booming the
average annual salary for machine
learning Engineers can vary based on
location experience and Company so here
are some roles like machine learning
engineer data scientist NLP engineer
computer vision engineer and AIML
researcher so let's see how much they
earn so the first one machine learning
engineer in us they earn around
$153,000 and in India they earn around
11 lakhs per the second is data
scientist they earn in us around
$157,000 and in India they earn around
12 lakhs per the third one is NLP
engineer in us they earn around
$17,000 and in India they earn around 7
lakh per the fourth one come to Vision
engineer they earn around
$126,000 in the US and in India they
earn around 6.5 lakh per the last one Ai
and ml researcher they earn around
$130,000 in the US and 9 lakh per ANM in
India so note that these figures can
vary on the website to website and
changes frequently the AI ml road map
provides a clear and structure path to
help you navigate the exciting field
even if you are starting from zero so by
following this guide and consistently
enhancing your skills you can build a
successful career in Ai and machine
