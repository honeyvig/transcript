training now without further delay let's
get started with an introduction to tab
so the agenda for today's session is we
will understand what exactly is tab do
followed by that we will learn what are
the major companies who are dependent on
table and hiring T experts followed by
that we will also look at the salary
numbers of TBL experts in India and also
in United States of America followed by
that we will check a detailed
explanation on how to install Tabo and
how to get started with t followed by
that we will close the session by going
through a practical demonstration on
tblo desktop hope I made myself clear
with the agenda now let's get started
with what exactly is table so to
understand what exactly is table let us
imagine that you have piles of data in a
spreadsheet so you can see the Sample
Sales data right on my screen here so we
have some data set so we have names and
product names Etc but you are ought to
create some meaning out of this data set
so that your stakeholders or business
unit heads understand what exactly is
happening with your sales data but do
you think is it possible to make them
understand just by displaying this long
heavy spreadsheet right in front of them
no right it can't create a value it
can't create an Insight it can't create
a meaning right but what if you had a
practical dashboard which could show
everything to your stakeholder your
business unit head what's happening in
and across the country in and across
wherever your business is located right
maybe the top 10 products being sold in
a state or top 10 products being stld in
a region of that particular State the
top 10 people who are buying a lot of
things from you right everything in one
single dashboard the total number of
sales you made in a week month quarter
or year the total revenue you got the
total profit you made discount you
offered everything right this makes a
lot of sense to both your team leaders
or business unit heads or your
stakeholders or even you right so if
that is something which can be done then
tblo is your One-Stop solution right
tblo is one of the top business
intelligence tools which can help you
create live dashboards and
visualizations on your data sets and
extract some values and insights which
can turn things around for your business
right so that's what tab is TBL is a
business analytical software tool
developed by America TBL helps people to
understand visualize and make data
driven decisions in real time with
extreme agility and accuracy now that we
know what exactly is TBL let's also know
what are the TBL versions so TBL has
basically five versions and we dealing
with the first one which is TBL desktop
TBL data visualization application
facilitates to examine virtually all
type of structured data and generate
interactive graphs and dashboards and
reports quickly so tab desktop is
something uh
majorly freely available for the
Learners and there are also the license
versions so we also have the TBL server
version TBL is capable of offering
browser based data analytics and next we
have TBL online so this particular one
is the licensed version so this
particular version is used by the
Enterprise uh level users based on the
company and based on the data set maybe
they're connected to the live cloud
servers and Etc so this is the licensed
version and it's an online secure
cloudbased solution used for sharing and
collaborating on T views and dashboards
followed by that we have tap public so
this is also a public software freely
available as open source for the
Learners and it can visualize some basic
uh spreadsheets files or PDFs Etc and U
we will be working on that as well and
lastly we have the tab reader so tab
reader is let's say you are the
stakeholder or let's say you are the
client right and you don't know what
exactly is happening with your data and
you're not the one who's responsible for
the queries and the processes happening
on your data you just need the output
right you just need how things are going
you just need to understand the business
operations Etc so for you uh people like
the ones who are just solely U focused
on understanding what's happening need
Tablet reader right so the tablet
developer will develop all possible
dashboards and visualizations and send
them share them just to view only with
the view access right so the view access
will be supported by T reader on your
mobile phones on your desktops MacBooks
and everywhere you want to access them
and you will have only the view access
and you don't and you don't have to
worry about what's happening in the
background with the queries and the
process so that's what T read R so that
brings us to the five versions of Tabo
followed ahead we will deal with the
features of tab what exactly tab has to
offer you so tab offers you some robust
level security collaboration sharing
Trends and Predictive Analytics and live
and inmemory data so which is really
valuable it can deal with live memory
and inmemory data means it can process
your data on live and after that you
have informative and mobile view so we
discussed on this so you can access the
TA reader and a dashbo anywhere on the
go on a laptop or mobile and it supports
a wide variety of data sources it can
get connected to a spreadsheet it can
get connected to a PDF Cloud Server and
a database or real time rdbms anything
right so those are the some important
features of T proceeding ahead we have
the next part of today's session where
we will understand the top companies
which are hiring T experts so many many
companies basically the big four and
mang and many more for examp example
here we have accenta evi PepsiCo Deo
Wells Fargo Cap Gemini Walmart there are
huge companies who are mer so there are
huge companies which are very much
dependent on data analyst who know a
good understanding of tblo now let's
also discuss the salary numbers for a
Tabo expert as data analy so companies
are ready to offer Healy salaries for a
tblo expert when when it comes to
America a beginner level Tableau expert
can earn up to $50,000 to $70,000 peran
and if you're an intermediate candidate
let's say with one or two years of
experience then you can expect $70,000
to $90,000 per anom and if you're a
highly experienced candidate let's say
more than four five years of experience
you can expect $90,000 to $130,000 based
on the company you're working with and
the project you're handling and when it
comes to India the salaries you can
expect if you're beginner are 4 lakhs to
8 lakhs perom as a beginner and if
you're an intermediate candidate let's
say one to two years of experience you
can expect 8 lakhs to 12 lakhs perom as
a minimum and beyond that you can expect
12 lakhs to 20 lakhs and even more based
on the company you're working with and
the project you're handling so those are
some so those are some attractive
numbers for an aspiring data analyst or
a tblo expert now let's proceed to the
core part of today's session which is
about installing tblo onto your desktop
and running a practical demonstration so
now we have reached to the next part of
today's session which is dealing with
installing tblo into your local system
so we are working on the Windows system
so let's open a browser so I'm using
Bing so preferably you can go with
Google or anyone that you have just type
in t blue public download
there you go so you can see the first
link over here which is from tblo public
so just click on download or you can
just go to the website where you can see
some options and go with the one you
want so here we have some impressive
visuals and everything and uh download
tblue desktop public edition is the
option you want to choose so here just
download tblo public you can write down
your D details over
here download the app and your tabue
public is getting
downloaded there you go you can see the
tblo public desktop 634 bit being
downloaded for you and it is the 2024
Edition meanwhile we can work on our
data set
so we know that the next part of today's
session is based on a practical
demonstration for our T now uh the
Tableau is getting downloaded as you can
see here and meanwhile that's happening
let's try to create a data set for
ourselves using chat GPD so here I'm
creating a prompt for it so I'll need a
data set with about 10,000 rows with the
following details row ID order ID and
all these column headers so this is
completely a randomly generated data set
nothing is real about it right now here
we have the zones East South West North
Central and everything so we will be
considering the data for Indian States
right so we'll be using all the 29
Indian states and cities here yeah the
cities might be a lot more cities
belonging to their respective States and
if you uh scroll down a little we have
some popular food makers in India and
across the world so we will be borrowing
a little little bit of the companies
little number of companies right just um
you know two to three companies we have
Nestle cbury and IDC so these are just
randomly generated data nothing is real
about this data this is this data is
generated using chat gbd we're just
taking the names here to just make it
look a real uh you know valuable here
right so we have some uh categories so
three categories we're dealing with is
Nestle catb and IDC and subcategories
basically the products that we create
and product names and um we will be also
having some more input to the chat GPD
here so we'll be uh making sure that the
numbers that is sales quantity discount
profit rate and everything is accurate
and realistic and uh make sure that
we're also um selecting the city names
which belong to that particular State
not some random city names right so this
is the prom that I created for our
random completely unrealistic sales data
set so this is not an actual data set
which is available with the sales of
these companies this is completely
random generated now let's copy this
prompt and go to our chat GPT and uh add
it onto the prompt and let's wait for
the chat GPT to create a data set for
us so chat GPD is analyzing and it is
reading the entire promp and it is
understanding how exactly we are looking
for the DAT set and what are we
expecting from that dat set or from the
prompt we writing right now so don't
worry if you want to follow up with us
during this practical demonstration we
will be linking this particular prompt
for creating your data set in the
description box along with the data set
that we have generated right away right
so this has created us some data and it
has everything about the ship date
shipment mode customer ID custom name
city state country region product ID
product name right everything that we
required right now let's check the
progress on Tableau if it's completely
downloaded so that we can proceed with
the installation process and once the
Tableau is successfully installed we can
proceed with the Practical
demonstration I can see it's still
getting downloaded uh just about 2 to 3
minutes and we will be ready with the
DAT set and along with that the setup
file for tblo so if you go back to chat
GPT here somewhere we had a downloadable
link so there you go you can just click
on the download D set so that your D set
also starts getting downloaded and as
soon as we install our Tablo we can run
our analysis so the data set is ready
just a minute more and the Tablo setup
file will also be ready for installation
there you go the Tablo public desktop
64-bit 2024 Edition is now successfully
downloaded now just click on the open
files to run the exe file that is a
setup file for us there you go uh just
click on some license agreements and
don't send product data usage so you can
it's it's your option you can just click
on that if not you can just ignore that
now just click on install
there you go the installation has been
done so it is booting up so this is how
the tblue desktop looks like you can
connect to any of the files which is
Microsoft Excel text file Json uh
databases like Microsoft Access and PDF
files spatial files statistical files
and more on that if you want to get
connected to a server or a Cloud Server
you can also do that and here you can
see some existing top visualization on
the tblo website and apart from that you
have uh a few more options getting
started with TBL you've got some you've
got some tutorials on how to start
videos and uh sample data sets as well
and you have some loan on trail head
table Hands-On challenges right this is
from uh Salesforce on uh based on some
starting challenges on tblo so that for
for a beginner level it's user friendly
and helpful to learn tblo so far so good
so we will be dealing with the Microsoft
Excel in the next part so with that
let's proceed with the next part of
today's session which happens to be the
Practical demonstration on TBL now that
we have practically installed T and also
ready with the D set let's proceed with
the tblo Practical demonstration on the
D set that we just created now we might
have to switch to Tableau and the Excel
data set that we just created just a
moment so this is the data set that we
just created which has all the r ID
order ID order date shift date and
everything that we require the sales
quantity discount profit and everything
right so remember to save your file as a
DOT XML file it should be a workbook
right so so that the U tabue can upload
or it can get connected to this workbook
corre so let's get back to tblo now we
are connected to tblo and uh here we're
dealing with an Excel file so click on
Microsoft Excel and here you have your
workbook and you can can see it is saved
as.
XLS right so it's practically a workbook
just click open and it should load the
data shortly there you go now here we
have a brief view of what exactly you
loaded onto the TM Tablo right so we
have the data set right here so you can
have the audit dat ship date ship mode
customer ID customer name and everything
that we just created and now let's go to
the workbook so here you can see we have
the worksheets the dashboard and the
story so we will be creating a small uh
workbook right so we be we will be
creating a small worksheet like five to
six and we'll just link all those to the
dashboard and see how exactly it works
just go to the worksheet here and here
you can see uh the left section so
whichever is you know uh indicated as a
hashtag that's the measure and whichever
is indicated as an alphabet that is the
dimension so measure speaks for itself
measure is something which you can
quantify in the number and the
dimensions are which you can qualify
right maybe a customer name maybe a
Region's name or a state's name City's
name right now that we have a clear
understanding of the uh measures and
dimensions here you can see some filters
pages and you can see some colors sizes
text details and Tool tips and apart
from that here you have the standard
view fit the withth entire view so we
will be working on that as well and here
you can see show me options where you
can find all the types of charts that
you can just create using tab now we
have a brief understanding of how
exactly tab works and the story and uh
the dashboard and the sheets right now
let's try to uh create visualizations if
you're already the user of excel then
you might be having a brief
understanding how exactly using columns
works so in the same way we have rows
and columns here so these are the row
sections and these are the column
sections and if you want to use them you
can use them if not the alternate you
have your rows and columns right so you
can't go wrong with it so if you want
something to be on the columns you can
just drag and drop them and if you want
something to be on the row section you
can just drag and drop them now let's
create our first visualization let's say
I wanted to check the or country level
sales so you can just uh click on
country or state you can just drag and
drop the columns and if you want to
check the sales you can just click and
hold and drag and drop onto rows now tab
automatically creates a chart for you
which is the most uh feasible one and if
you want to change it you can also
change it and before that let's try to
um arrange these in descending order
right so that you can identify which is
the highest selling uh or which is the
high state with the highest number of
sales right and and you can do that and
if you wanted to differentiate between
each state you can also drag and drop
the state onto color which will give you
an individual color for each and every
state and if you can see this particular
section over here this acts as a filter
let's say you wanted to check the
details on only Maharashtra you can do
that or any other state maybe Kerala you
can do that and Andra Pradesh right so
you can do that uh so if you didn't want
the the type of CFT you have just
created created maybe the bar graph you
don't want that bar graph or column
graph and you wanted a map chart you can
do that just go to a show me and here
you can see the map chart just click on
that and it will be converted into a map
chart immediately right so here you can
see the color codes right you can
identify the darkest blue to have the
highest sales here and if you drag and
drop the sales onto the label here it
will practically give you the numbers so
that you have a clear understanding
which state or which part of India had
the highest sales so I think utak with
371 950 has the highest sales of the
darkest blue now you can name this chart
as country level now we can proceed
ahead and try to create another
visualization let's say I wanted to
identify region level sales so Dragon
drop Regional colums and sales to this
particular location and uh you can drag
and drop region onto the color so that
you have individual colors for
individual regions and you can drag and
drop sales to label so that you have the
accurate and exact number right over
here close this and uh let's type it as
region
wise
sales and here let's identify the
categories with maximum sales or maximum
number of quantity so you can drag and
drop the subcategory here and U quantity
and rows here maybe you can use uh map
chart and rename it as
subcategory sales so you can identify
which that which is that product which
is the highest selling one or the
maximum quantity so you can change the
uh you know aggregation to count we just
wanted count not sum so you have the
count of here and there you go and you
can also add quantity to color so you
have a different uh color for different
quantity now let's proceed with the
shipment mode so we can identify which
is that shipment mode which is highly
preferred by most of the customers so we
have first class same day second class
and standard class so we can drag and
drop the quantity over here and change
the aggregation of quantity to count
identify which is that shipping mode
which is highly required or preferred by
most of the customers and they can
choose a pie chart for that and it is
too small so you can fit to the entire
view now what you can do is uh drag and
drop shiping mode to label and the
quantity to label so that we have a
brief understanding of which shipment
mode is highly preferred by most of the
customers so it's clearly visible that
26745 from same day shipment is highly
preferred by most of the customers and
let's rename it as shipment
mode and now let's try to identify the
uh month-on-month sales so let's pick up
the audit date drag and drop it on to
columns and uh sales onto Crow and
whenever remember whenever you're
dealing with dates so whenever you're
dealing with month on month or week on
week go with a line graph so tblo will
automatically give you the line graph so
that's not a problem but if not you can
select the line graph now we don't
require the year here and we don't
require quarter here so we just need
month on month and we got it and sales
so you can see January February March
April May Etc and if required you can
add sales to labels and you have the
numbers over here to identify which was
that one month which gave you the
highest number of sales and it can also
identify which products with the highest
sold what's happening and everything
right so you can uh drop it as month on
month and maybe you can also U check
statewise sales or region wise we
already did that and you can you can do
a city-wise sales so we can identify
which is that city with the highest
number of sales
correct here you have it let's be it the
way it is because we will be using to
add a filter and identify the top 10
states or cities right so what you can
do is drag and drop the city
on to filters and here I want top 10
cities go with the field top 10 okay
apply and you have the top 10 cities
which are giving you the highest sales
right here and if you want maybe you can
add City to color and maybe you can add
the sales to labels to identify the
number of sales right now practically we
are having a brief understanding of how
exactly to create a visualization and
now let's create
dashboard Now to create a dashboard you
can you know select this particular one
which reads as new dashboard and here
the canvas size you can just provide a
range or you can just go to the
automatic so that we have this entire
range of screen to use I'll go with that
automatic there you go and here you have
the first country level sees drag and
drop that sheet right here and region
wise sales and you can just place it
anywhere you want and and we have
subcategory wise uh sales so I'll click
it up here and the shipment mode so I'll
place it here and apart from that we
have the month- on Monon sales so we can
place it anywhere somewhere over here
that's that should be good and remember
you can also adjust the space consumed
right and we can move the
subcategory
to okay to here there you go now it
looks pretty decent and here you have
all the filters you want which are
completely interactive now let's say I
want to identify the central region just
click on that and you have the central
region and maybe if you wanted to
identify products and details of every
sale that you made using the first flash
open mode you can do that and apart from
that you wanted to check the city wise
sales records you can do that right so
it's an interactive dashboard that you
can create using tab so that's how you
can work on Tab and you can also have a
complete SlideShare option here so you
can present the data right and that
brings us to the end of this session on
an introduction to table if you have any
