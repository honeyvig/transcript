comments and description box all right
so let's start with the first question
which is which practice is responsible
for moving new or changed components to
life or other environments so this is
the question and now I'll be telling you
the options so option A is release
management option b is deployment
management option C is change management
and option D is supplier management so
you can pause the video now because
we'll be answering the option the
correct option and then we will be
telling you the explanation of it so if
you want to pause the video you can and
now we'll be answering the correct
option so this is the question and now
the correct option for this question is
option b that is deployment management
so the deployment management practice is
responsible for moving new or change
components to live environments ensuring
they're properly installed and
configured it focuses on the actual
deployment process
release Management on the other hand
plans and schedules these changes but
deployment management does the actual
moving so yeah the correct option is B
that is deployment management all right
so now let's move on to the next
question which is question number two
which of these activities is carried out
as a part of problems management so
let's have a look at the options now
option A is creating incident records B
diagnosing and resolving incidents
option C escalating incident to a
support team for resolution and option D
is Trend analysis of incident
records so now you can again pause the
video if you want so we will be
proceeding with the correct option so
the correct option of this question is
option number D that is Trend analysis
of incident records so the problem
management focuses on identifying and
managing the root cause of incidents to
prevent recurrence so creating incident
records that is option A this is a part
of Incident Management not problem
management then diagnosing and resolving
that is the option number B this is also
part of Incident Management where the
goal is to restore normal surface
operation or as quickly as possible and
escalation incidents to a support team
for resolution that is the option number
c this is a function of Incident
Management to ensure incidents are
resolved
promptly and then the option number D
that is the trend analysis of incident
records which is the correct option so
this part of problem management ment
where historical incident data is
analyzed to identify patterns and
underlying problems leading to the
implementation of permanent fixes so
yeah the correct option is option number
D all right now moving on to the
question number three that is what
operating module outlines the Key
activities required to respond to demand
and facilitate value realization through
the creation and management of products
and services options are continual
Improvement service value chain
guiding principles practices yeah all
right so the correct option for this
question number three is B service value
chain so the service value chain
outlines the Key activities required to
respond to demand and create value
through products and services it
includes activities like planning
improving and engaging designing also
and delivering supporting so these
activities work together to transform
inputs into valuable outputs ensuring
value is co-created with stakeholder ERS
all right now coming to the next
question of itl for foundation exam
which is so what is a normal change all
right so now coming to the options which
are a change that doesn't need risk
assessment because the procedure has
been pre-authorized option b a change
that needs to be accessed authorized and
scheduled by a change Authority option C
A change that does not need risk
assessment because it is required to
resolve an incident and option D A
change that is routin in nature is fully
documented and the risk are well
understood so the correct option of this
question is option number B so normal
change requires a thorough assessment
authorization and scheduling by a charge
authority to manage its risk and ensure
successful implementation unlike
standard changes which are
pre-authorized and emergency changes
which are implemented quickly to resolve
incidents normal changes and follow the
full of change management process to
evaluate the potential impacts so yeah
option b that is a change that needs to
be accessed authorized is the correct
option all right coming to question
number five which is what is not a phase
in problem management all right so the
options are problem identification
problem control error control problem
classification so now the correct option
for this question number five is problem
classification so why so the problem
management typically involves the
following phrases problem identification
that is detecting and lodging problems
to prevent future incidents then problem
control analyzing problems to identify
root cause and prioritize resolution
efforts then error control that is
managing known errors and implementing
permanent solution to prevent recurrence
then problem classification it is not
considered a distinct phase in the
problem management process it may be a
part of identifying and analyzing
problems but it is not a Standalone Fe
so yeah option D that is problem
classification is the correct option all
right coming to question number six
which is your smartphone it is a
situational again yeah so your
smartphone isn't working properly you
call the toll-free number for your
service provider support center then
which practice would you reach that
serves as the entry point for all
contact between the service provider and
its users all right coming to the
options option A is problem management
option b is service request management
option C is service TK and option D is
Incident Management you can keep in mind
what we already answered in the previous
you can also answer based on that so now
we'll be proceeding with the answer that
is the correct option so yeah option
number c that is service desk so the
service desk is the practice that serves
as the entry point for all contact
between the service provider and its
users it handles communication for
incident service request and general
inquiries acting as a single point of
contact when you call the support center
for help with your smartphone the
service desk is a practice you interact
with first so option C that is service
task is the correct option coming to
question number seven which is which
service management Dimension is focused
on the communication system and
knowledge bases used by employees you
can have a look at the question first
now we will be proceeding with the
options which is information technology
organization and People Partners and
suppliers value streams and processes so
question is which service management
Dimension is focused on communication
systems and knowledge bases used by
employees so pick the correct option
according to you you can also pause the
video as I previously said all right so
the correct option of this question is
option number a that is information
technology so the information technology
dimension of a service management
focuses on the tools systems and
knowledge bases used by employees to
deliver and support services this
includes communication systems it
infrastructure and data management which
are crucial for Effective Service
delivery and support all right coming to
question number eight now which is the
next question so it is again a
situational based like you are working
as a part of an improvement initiative
and your team would like to release a
new module into the existing customer
relationship management system which
type of change should you initiate so we
have four options that is standard B
normal C emergency and D routine now you
can pick the correct option according to
you all right proceeding with the
correct option that is option b that is
normal so normal change is the
appropriate type for releasing a new
module into the existing customer
relationship management that is CRM
system normal changes require a full
assessment authorization and scheduling
by a change Authority ensuring that the
new model is properly evaluated for
potential risk and impacts before the
implementation standard changes are are
pre-authorized routine changes like
emergency changes are for Urgent issues
and routine is not a specific change
type in it so yeah option b that is
normal is the correct option coming to
the next question of itl 4 Foundation
exam that is question number nine so
your company has decided to install a
service management tool that provides
Incident Management as one of its
functions what is the benefit of using
an incident management system so this is
again a situational based of question so
you have read the question I believe now
let's proceed with the options option A
is it can provide automated resolution
and closure of complex incidents option
b is it can ensure that incidents are
resolved within the agreed upon time
frame in the service level agreement
that is SLA then it can provide
automated matching of incidents to
provide or non errors then the system
can provide specialized knowledge for
solving complicated incidents so four
options are there you can select the
correct
option all right I believe you have
selected the correct option and you can
pause the video as I already said now
let's proceed with the correct option so
the correct option is
C that is it can provide automated
matching of incidents to problems or
known errors so an incident management
system offers the benefit of automating
the matching of incidents to existing
problems or known errors this capability
helps streamline the resolution ution
process by leveraging historical data
and knowledge thereby reducing the time
and effort needed to address recuring
issues while ensuring SLA compliance and
providing specialized knowledge are
important the key benefit here is the
efficient linkage of incidents to the
known issues for faster resolution so
the option number c is correct one all
right coming to question number 10 so
how does service request management
contribute to deliver and support value
chain activity so this is the question
option A is it ensures that users
continue to be productive when they need
assistance from the service provider
option b is it collects user specific
requirements sets expectations and
provides status updates option C is by
initializing standard changes to fulfill
service request option D is it requires
pre-approved service components to help
fulfill service request you can select
the correct option and the correct
option is option number a it ensures
that users continue to be productive
when they need assistance from the
service provider so service request
management contributes to deliver and
support value chain activity by ensuring
that users remain productive when they
need assistance it handles request for
information advice and access to
Services helping users to continue their
work without unnecessary delays or
disruptions this supports the overall
goal of maintaining service quality and
user
satisfaction so yeah option number a is
correct one
moving on to the next question of itl
for foundation exam which is question
number 11 so which practice provides
support for managing feedback
compliments and complaints from users so
this is the question we have to select
the correct one option number a is
Change Control option b is service
request management option C is problem
management option D is Incident
Management all right now moving on to
the correct option among these four so
the correct option is option number B
that is service request management so
service request management provides
support for managing feedback
compliments and complaints from users
this practice handles various types of
service requests including requests for
information advice access to services
and even feedback mechanisms ensuring
user interactions are managed
efficiently and user satisfaction is
maintained all right coming to next
question that is question number 12 so
what what is expected outcome of using a
service value chain all right option
number a is the application of practices
option b is value realization option C
is customer engagement and option D is
service value streams you can take your
time all right so let's proceed with the
answer now so the correct option is
value realization that is option number
B so the expected outcome of using a
service value chain is value realization
the service value chain is designed to
create and deliver value by transforming
inputs into to outputs through various
activities it ensures that Services meet
stakeholder needs and provides the
desired outcome thereby achieving value
realization for both the service
provider and the
customers so option b is the correct one
all right moving on to the next that is
question number 13 what should all
continual Improvement decisions based on
option number a is detailed of how
services are measured option b is an
upto-date balance scorecard option C is
and carefully analyze data and option b
is a recent maturity assessment so guys
again I'm saying you can take your time
by pausing the video when answering the
questions you don't have to answer the
questions on ongoing video you can pause
it and answer on your own or you can
also listen to the explanation that I'm
giving after each and every question so
the answer the correct option that is
for this question number 13 is option
number c that is the accurate and
carefully analyzed data so all continual
Improvement decisions should be based on
accurate and carefully analyzed data
this ensures that decisions are informed
objective and based on real insights
rather than assumptions reliable data
analysis helps in identifying areas for
improvement measuring progress and
making evidence-based adjustments so
yeah answer number c that is option
number c is correct one now moving on to
question number 14 of itl 4 Foundation
exam what do customers perceptions and
business outcomes help to Define option
A is service metrics option b is the
total cost of a service option C is key
performance indicators that is kpis and
option D is the value of a service again
you can continue to guess or select the
correct option I'm going to tell you the
correct option so the correct option of
this question is the value of service
that is option number D so customer
perceptions and business outcomes help
to define the value of service value is
determined by how well a service meets
customer needs and achieves desired
business outcomes positive customer
perceptions and stressful business
outcomes indicate High service value as
they reflect the services Effectiveness
in fulfilling its purpose and providing
benefits to the users and the business
so option number D is the correct one
next question is which incident should
be logged all right option number a is
only an incident that cannot be
immediately resolved option b is any
incident that occurs more than once
option C is only incidents that are not
sold using self-help tools and option D
is every incident should be locked so
you can select the correct options among
these four options all right so the
correct option is option number D that
is every incident should be locked so
every incident should be loged to ensure
that there is a record for all incidents
regardless of their nature or resolution
method this comprehensive logging is
essential for tracking Trends analyzing
incident patterns identifying recurring
issues and providing data for continuous
Improvement logging all the incidents
helps in maintaining a complete history
of services performance and user
interactions all right moving on to the
next question that is question number 16
the question is service request and
their fulfillment should be question
mark that is Dash and automated to be
the greatest degree possible so let me
explain you the question so here the
question mark indicates what should come
here so the question is service request
and their fulfillment should be the dash
is here you'll have to fill this Gap and
automated to the greatest degree
possible so the question mark is
replaced by the option that we will be
giving you so option A is standardized
option b is uniquely handled option C is
creatively solved and option D is
ignored so which among the options
should come in place of question mark in
the question you can take your time all
right so let's proceed with the correct
option I hope you guys understood what I
meant so the correct option of this
question number 16 is
standardized so the correct option that
is a that is standardized request so the
correct option is a so the service
request and their fulfillment should be
standardized and automated to the
greatest degree possible standardizing
service request ensures consistency
efficiency and predictability in
handling them while automating speeds up
the process and reduces the risk of
human error this approach helps in
providing timely and reliable service to
the users so option A is is the correct
one coming to the next question that is
question number 17 what is a service
level agreement used for all right that
is SLA option number a is to measure the
performance of services from a customer
point of view option b is to measure the
performance of the service availability
option C is to measure the performance
of the service capability option number
D is to measure the performance of the
service from the service provider's
point of view all right reach each of
the option properly as they look
similar all right so the correct option
of question number 17 is a option A that
is the to measure performance of
services from a customer point of view
so a service level agreement that is SLA
is used to measure the performance of
services from a customer point of view
SLS Define the expected level of service
and the metrics by which service
performance is measured ensuring that
the service provider meets the agreed
upon standards and customer expectations
this customer Centric Focus helps in
maintaining transparency and
accountability between the service
provider and the customer so the correct
option is a all right now let's move on
to the question number 18 that is what
should be included in every service
level agreement that is SLA so option
number a is detailed measure to capture
availability of the system option b is
matrics for system response and time
option C is clearly defined service
outcomes and option D is number of
emails Cent per hour question is what
should be included in every SLA that is
service level agreement read the options
and choose the correct one this time I
hope you have chosen the correct one now
let's proceed with the correct answer
that is option number c clearly defined
Services outcome so every SLA that is
service level agreement should include
clearly defined service outcomes slas
are meant to set expectations between
the service provider and the customer
specifying what the customer can expect
in terms of service quality and
performance by clearly defining service
outcomes both parties have a mutual
understanding of the expected results
and the criteria for measuring Services
success which helps ensure alignment and
satisfaction so option number c is the
correct one all right now coming to
question number 19 which is a scenario
based again so your organization is
preparing to launch a new service your
manager is concerned that there is a
possibility that something bad might
happen which could cause the service to
fail and the desired outcome won't be
achieved so what term best describe your
managers of concerns so the options are
a outputs B risks option C cost or
option D utility choose the correct
option all right so now let's proceed
with the correct option which
is option number D I repeat which is
option number B that is
risks so as I said your manager's
concerns about the possibility that
something bad might happen causing the
service to fail and the desired outcome
not be achieved are the best described
as risk so in service management risk
refer to the potential events or
conditions that could negatively impact
the achievement of service objectives
causing harm or loss identifying and
managing risk is crucial to ensure that
successful launch and operation of new
Services can happen so yeah option b
risk is the correct one coming to the
next question that is the last question
question number 20 again this is a
situational kind of question so you have
been assigned to a team that has been
asked to identify how your consumers use
a particular service what the service
helps them to do and how the service
helps them to identify their tools which
of the guiding principles should be best
applied in your situation all right
option number a is focus on value B is
progress iteratively with feedback
option C is collaborate and promote
visibility and option D think and work
holistically you can take your time in
selecting the correct option and let me
tell you the correct option from my end
so the correct option is option number a
that is focus on value in this situation
the guiding principle focus on value
should be
applied understanding how consumers use
a service what service helps them
achieve and how it aligns with their
goals is all about ensuring that the
service dels value to its users by
focusing on value the team can ensure
that the service meets the needs and
expectations of the consumers thereby
maximizing its Effectiveness and
satisfaction so this is question number
20 that we have just answered all right
