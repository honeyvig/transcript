AI art and chat GPD can be used to
create unique and creative web design by
combining the power of artificial
intelligence and human input with AI art
you can generate visually stunning
Graphics patterns and images while chat
jbd can be used to generate text content
and provide suggestions for website
layouts and design element so hey
everyone you are already watching simply
learn and today we bring you this
informative video on chat GPT for UI and
ux before we begin if these are the
videos you like to watch then hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
get notified every time we upload a new
video without any further delay to get
started you can experiment with
different air tools to generate graphics
and use charge repeat to write website
copy create a Content strategy and
provide feedback on Design Elements it's
important to keep in mind that while AI
can help to generate ideas and create
stunning features I'm going to show you
exactly how you can generate these
yourself websites are going to be built
with air as well as tools like chargpd
in future so in this video I'm going to
explain the whole process and we are
going to have it right the entire
Website Layout for us all the content
the hero section and feature section and
much more this means that we can build
an entire website from the ground up
without writing a single line of code
and this will be a pretty damn good all
right we will start with the mid journey
in Google search we will write
Journey
this is an AI tool that allows you to
create the air that we are now seeing
all over the web to go to this you just
go to the midchairney.com and join the
beta it's easy to get started because
all you really have to do is join the
Discord when you do this it will open up
the Discord Community which you can
accept the terms and condition and start
creating your own AI Arts let's do this
now
here I have got the mid-journey server
and I'm going to head over to one of the
newcomer room here and and where
everyone is creating different types of
air the first thing we need to do is uh
to do a forward slash and type in an
imagine gave us prompt
we can request the AI any type of art we
are after here I'm going to type uh in a
beautiful
website
for
shoe
then I'm going to pass in dash dash
V4 which means uh the version 4 of the
mid 20 of air tool finally I'm going to
pass it in style stylized I'll do Dash
Dash
stylize it's basically how random we
want to be in uh it's between zero to
thousand and I'm just going to set it to
about 500 which is average to the enter
it will take a little bit of time this
will start working in the background
it's going to generate a low Fidelity
version of the website and the design
for this art and this low Fidelity
version will be iteratively updated to
be higher in resolution these four
examples that can be picked from and
then we can upscale them as well as
let's have a look at what kind of
results we get now one thing uh to
notice here is that we do get a bit of a
loading percentage bar and this is how
long it takes for the actual AI to
generate the image I usually takes
between one to two minutes but it will
essentially refresh and ping you once
it's complete so here is it is complete
and here are the four versions that we
got which are not too bad uh not that
great either they are a bit uh yeah I
suppose it's looking a funny in a way so
this is a way we can start being more
creative with our prompts so what I mean
that is by giving more context as to
what we want to do so here is a prompt
that we have created what I'm gonna do
is to pass it in the imagine once more
and I paste this prompt in this and I'm
going to give some more context I'm
going to pass it to the word UI
choose UI QX
UI ux website this basically means that
it's more or less focused on having good
UI and good at ux and being more like a
website rather than just a creative shoe
or a design and it's important to give
these context clues to the AI if you
want better outputs different types of
context clues you can provide is to find
a kind of style that you want uh for for
example
um how you want the design to look and
feel whether you want to to represent a
certain brand or much much more like
these are just simple examples but let's
take a look at the kind of results we
will get just from making these small
little changes to the design here here
you can already see a wait a minute look
it's a little bit more interesting we
have a bit of our sliders and what looks
more like a Nike shoes and also have
what look like a menu at the top and and
I really like this design that we have
here on the bottom and here it is
because it does look very much like a
website that we have got a bit for a
hero section or a hero satisfaction and
what's not so from here we can select
the version one uh so from here uh we
can select uh the version one two three
uh four to upscale and I'm going to
upscale version 3 where which is u3 and
this will give us a high resolution
version of this one particular design
that we again that we can start to take
uh to the market or even you can use to
build this again uh will take a little
bit of time it's going to process this
and uh to do and you can upscale in data
and let's run this in the background so
that you can see uh a wait a minute this
again will takes a little bit time to
process it's going to process this and
do an unscale or upscale in beta and
let's run this in the background so that
you can guys see what's the look so here
is the final result and this is looking
uh pretty and we have got a nice design
here for a shoe uh we have got a bit of
a hero section and we also have what
looks uh like a two call to actions and
we got some option here too at the very
bottom and as well as at the top we have
got these colors and that essentially
are looking like these shoes colors
being used as a part of the website
design so not too shopy let's select uh
the another one let's see for
yeah uh but I think we can do a little
bit more
um in terms of customization the design
for this website and I'm going to show
you how you can do this I'm going to
copy over this uh prompt once and for
this prompt this time I'm going to pass
a couple of extra things so let me just
uh maximize this
we are going to type
um as I have uh pasted that URL over
here so I'm gonna pass in the context
clues of like uh clues of Nike because
Nike made obviously website shows so
also
uh so we'll write it here
my key
here
repeat and I also I want it to be read
blue
green
and
or maybe uh yellow
and I suppose we want to uh else running
person
would be interesting
sorry person
uh it would be interesting to see how
that gets designed uh and I think that
there should be enough let's actually
improve the styling here uh one minute
let's change the styling
let's
let's have it 750 uh to make it a little
bit more creative and here are the
results I don't have a running person
but I do have a website that has
definitely started using the colors that
I recommended with Chinese air systems
to use so these website designs look way
more creative than we had previously
still we have this slider design this
website designs look way more creative
than we had previously we still have
this slider design here at the bottom
section where we can pick out different
shoes but even these shoes look damn
cool I can see that the Nike logo on
these and these are actually ones that I
would probably buy if I saw in the Nike
store but generally uh these also our
website because we have got the menus
here at the top of the right uh we got
the text so generally speaking uh these
are pretty interesting interesting
designs so now I have another option
here called version one two three four
what this does is actually allow you to
pick uh more Generations uh based on
actual image from these images or these
designs now from this design I actually
like the trail 3 and 4 I think it is
most I think
four because
uh it tails and red or it's a bit yellow
or blue so I'm going to select the
version
um four and that's going to create uh
four more version based on the specific
version for us let's take a look at the
what those that we got and here we have
got our results
uh where we have more examples of that
all of these looks very similar I think
the only difference here is uh Blue Line
a red line it seems to be shift and
change as well as a hero section
and you would normally have this menu at
the top right and something these shoes
here are a little bit inverted but
generally speaking this is the kind of
variations you can expect
now let's take a look at another way we
can generate Our Generations for website
now you can do is just uh jump into any
website and select any image so first we
will go to an app and website and you
can uh select any image that you would
like and I will actually go on here
and I'm going to pull in this image of
this shoe and but I do like the design
Aesthetics uh here we are going to here
and then we can copy the URL from here
but this time what I'm going to do is
type the Imagine
then I'm going to pass in the URL but we
have copy uh we will paste it here
again I'm going to write
we did it before we'll copy this
paste it over here
so what's going to happen here it's uh
it's going to have a look at this image
that we have defined in in terms of the
URL it's going to use this as a
reference point then it's going to take
a look at the prompt we have potent
which is the show prom
using the colors and it's going to try
to design
a website that has a similar Aesthetics
to that image which is really cool let's
see the result we get back looks like
that's ready
let's take a look at this so here you
can see that the design is Statics
uh wait a minute
static that is similar to the page scene
in this one
so this is more bubbly and colorful
image and now are represented very much
so in this design Aesthetics uh we have
these four elements here at the bottom
and if you have a look at the design
originally we had four elements here so
you can see that it's pulling in these
design Aesthetics to create a design
based on that and this is where you can
really start using the air art repeat
using the air tool to your own benefits
trying to combine different styles
customizing them and creating new and
independent and unique ones from there
so in this four I'm really like uh uh
the version of fourth one or the second
one is pretty so uh what I'm thinking of
doing is an upscale on this so we are
going to upscale uh V2 and we are going
to wait for that uh one minute is uh you
start CPT to write out the most of the
content for me and then I would I could
take this to a client to immediately
start trading so let's see the upscale
version happen if we take a a closer
look we will see that it has all the
main elements for our website including
a logo area a menu area a nice hero
image as well as a title tagline Button
as well the feature section so what I'm
going to do is to save this image to my
computer I'm going to save it and then
customize it a little bit but before we
do that uh we are gonna head over to a
GPD
here we're going to prepare the outline
for the website using some AI tools so
here I'm going to ask rgpd to give me
the product outline
for a website for shoes
including hero title
tagline call to action button and
section for features and details about
the shoe so let's see what charge
ability will comes back with
um it's pretty quick it's got a Title
Here call to action button features are
the table section and it's not really
telling me what these are these are
where we might need to be a bit more
specific as to what we wanted to do it's
given me uh it's giving me like broad
outline of the website and what it needs
so please I will write
please provide
then
for each one of these that I can copy
paste
trade
to the website
um hero title is here tagline call to
action buttons
features okay
and the details
okay detailed specification is there
okay reviews and rating
okay
so I think I have got enough hairs to go
by to Simply copy paste in the website
so let's start beginning to design this
I have opened this design up in the
Photoshop and I'm going to actually just
crop it into the main element over here
and I really want to capture this
image and I will crop it and I will
clear out the the rest and we can design
each aspects or each part of this design
bit by bit
I will save it over here
it's time to build our website so I'm
gonna head over to editor X
and I'm going to build this uh a website
and this I have login already and then I
will create to a new site and here I
will take an R2 dashboard and I'm going
to start by copy paste all the elements
from chat GPD as well as mid Journeys
trade and the first thing and I want to
jump back into the chat GPD here and
copy over our hero text so I will just
take it first
and I'm going to tab add title and I'm
going to paste it over here
and then I'm also going to grab the
tagline but before I will make it sure
to keep it over here
but before that
I will first I will
put one image over here
I will change the image
as I have already uh downloaded the
image
let's
upload that image
will open it
let's wait to get uploaded
yeah it's uploaded and now we will
update it
and let's make it big in size
okay so we will
we will change the size but first I will
remove this I will change the size for
this I will make it little small
next I will add the icon for
uh
for the company of the shoes that we I'm
going to make a website for I will add
this and I will update
make it small
and this will be the taskbar but
make the size uh small a bit
and we'll
insert one more picture
and it will be the logo of the company
that we are going to put over here
we will minimize it we can resize it
you can keep
the logo over here
in our next uh then I'm going also going
to grab the tagline over here so I'll
quickly
I'll pick this time
I will add the text
thumbs up over here
okay I make it
small in size
and we will
paste on
and finally let's grab a call to action
which says shop
and create a button button for that
so so here we have all the workings of
what we uh at least what we would need
at least
so for for the content
let's resize this first
now we will add we need to add the image
itself so instead of just having a
browser stock images or anything like
that we actually had our images either
done inside of the photoshops that we
have done before as from the mid Journey
as well as so I'm going to just drag
the image
and I'm going to change the image
and it should be here I've already
downloaded no I have to upload it I have
a collections of some
shoes uh let's see
and I will just install one I'll upload
this picture
it will take a bit of time let's wait
for a while
and once it's uploaded we will
we will update it
let's keep it like this
are we can
so we change our content place from that
to make it a fix in a place
so here we can
change this also
a pretty well
okay
so basically have this text happening a
little bit more
I'm creating here
we have seen how we can resize it from
this scroll bar
so now let's add one more uh picture
over here to make it look more better
let's take a picture from here
change the image
and upload from
computer
and it from
oh
we will upload it again sorry
and we'll update it
let's resize it
let's
let's turn it on
it's a make a transfer for the top top
most of the screen we will have a home
page so we will write a text over here
that will be
I'm going to make it small a bit in size
we'll add another text
it it will show about us
it will show about us section so we'll
write it over here
little small even though
let's make same size
speak more small
allow let's make it more like
okay uh the next next session will be
services
and the last one is context one section
foreign
one more option is there
that is a start button like uh we are
keeping the start button over here so we
will we are keeping this here so let it
be here
so next uh what I'm going to do I'm
going to select
add a section and I'm going to just have
a blank section
um
here I'm gonna do first I will add a
picture first as a background
let's do it I will add one picture let's
see I have downloaded or not
yeah I will download it wait a minute
uh Let It Be upload
I will update it
would be a hole for a whole page
so
let's add the pictures now
for another shoes
change the picture
I'm going to reopen this
and put
this
okay I'll update it
keep the pictures over here like
similarly we will upload three pictures
over here
oh after this let's keep it here
this here
we are going to add another title over
here
we need to believe it
and we are making it a bit
and deciding it
we will change the font for this
let's make this
yeah after this I we will start editing
the features of the shoes that's
go to chat gbd
let's take this first
paragraph
and make it small
we make it cold
we will add another paragraph over here
similarly we will make it for this also
and last we will add
a contact us
plus we will add a contact a section
over here again
so this is the final output
of 10 gbd or how we use chargpt and air
for our UI and ux design to create a
website or a web page or the land page
for the shows
so with this we have come to the end of
