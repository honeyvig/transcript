this program check the link in the
description box and P Inc comments so
without further Ado let's start with the
learning path for cloud computing by
following this learning path you will be
equipped with the knowledge and skills
needed to succeed in the dynamic field
of cloud computing so first we should
start with computer networking learning
computer networking is important for
understanding cloud computing for
various reasons some of its reasons
include foundation for cloud
connectivity computer networking serves
as a backbone for cloud services it's
like the highway systems connecting
different cities without Road that is
networking you can't efficiently travel
that is access Cloud resources imagine
your computer as a car and the network
as the road that leads to the Cloud
Learning networking helps you navigate
this road effectively then next is
resource sharing and collaboration
networking allows computers to share
resources like printers files and data
storage similarly cloud computing relies
on shared resources in data centers
think of it as sharing a communal
printer in your office in the cloud
resource Es are shared across users and
applications then next is security and
performance understanding networking
helps you secure Cloud connections just
as you lock your house Cloud networks
need protection efficient networking
ensures smooth performance imagine a
congested Highway and slow data transfer
affects Cloud application so this was
about computer networking now let's
understand what is the next thing that
we should focus on if we want to learn
cloud computing in 2024 the next thing
is is virtualization so learning
virtualization is essential if you want
to understand cloud computing because
virtualization allows you to create
multiple virtual versions of a computer
or server on a single physical device in
simpler terms it helps you make the most
out of the hardware by dividing it into
smaller independent units cloud
computing relies heavily on
virtualization to efficiently manage and
allocate Resources by learning
virtualization you gain a foundation
understanding of how to optimize
Hardware usage improve flexibility and
enhance scalability this knowledge is
crucial in the world of cloud computing
where efficiency and resource
utilization are key factors all right so
this was about virtualization next up we
have is operating systems learning about
operating system that is OS is indeed
relevant if you're driving into the
world of cloud computing let's explore
why first understanding Cloud
infrastructure cloud computing is built
upon the foundation principles of
traditional Computing which includes the
utiliz of operating systems a solid
understanding of operating systems
Concepts is crucial for comprehending
the fundamental infrastructure of cloud
services then Cloud operating systems
while cloud services providers abstracts
much of the complexity associated with
the operating systems there are specific
Cloud operating systems crafted to
facilitate the efficient resource
allocation in Cloud environments these
layers of cloud operating systems
effectively manage and coordinate
virtualized resources optimization
Computing storage and networking process
processes the next is significance of
operating systems in the cloud Dynamic
scalability although the cloud promises
scalability the operating system plays a
pivotal role in determining how
efficiently resource can scale up or
down self-surface and ease of access so
the operating system directly influences
how users interact with cloud services
impacting aspects such as self-service
functionality and overall ease of access
so this was about the operating system
now coming to the next one which is
databases in databases first we have
cloud services so Cloud databases serve
as the foundation of cloud services
playing a crucial role in efficiently
storing and managing data this enables
Seance interaction between applications
and the cloud environment a
comprehensive understanding of databases
essential for grasping how Cloud
platforms address data retrieval and
scalability advantages of cloud
databases first we have is cast
efficiency so Cloud databases eliminate
the necessity for expensive on premises
infrastructure they offer Flex ible cost
effective and scalable Management
Solutions then 24/7 availability the
cloud databases guarantee constant
access to your data ensuring it remains
always on integrated backup and Recovery
mechanisms minimize the risk of
associated with downtime then handling
large data sets Cloud databases provide
storage that dynamically expands based
on requirements accommodating
significant volumes of information so
this was about the databases now coming
to the next one which is get Cloud
certifications so companies increasingly
value Cloud certifications over
expensive degrees according to plural
site 87% of hiring managers prioritize
handon experience with Cloud
certifications over terish
qualifications then first we have is
Amazon web services AWS certified
solution architect AWS certified
developer AWS certified ssops
administrator AWS certified devops
engineer AWS Cloud practitioner so these
are some of the certifications of AWS
that you can opt for there are others
also but these are some of the
certifications that we have mentioned
now coming to the next one which is
Microsoft Azure so Microsoft certified
Azure fundamentals first we have is
azure fundamentals then Microsoft Azure
then we have Microsoft certified Azure
administrator associate then Azor
solution architect expert then Azure
devops Engineer Expert along with this
there are certain other certifications
also you can have a look at them as well
then Google Cloud platform in Google
Cloud platform there is associate Cloud
engineer
professional Cloud architect then
professional data engineer so this is
Google Cloud certifications remember
that cloud certifications landscape is
dynamic and new certifications May
emerge it's essential to choose
certification based on your career goals
so this was about the cloud
certifications now coming to the next
thing which is practice engaging in
Hands-On practice allows you to apply
theoretical knowledge reinforcing your
understanding and helping you develop
practical skills so let's dive into free
tires of offered by Major Cloud
providers AWS Microsoft and Google Cloud
let's dive into the free tires offered
by Major Cloud providers that is Amazon
web services Microsoft Azure and Google
Cloud these free tires allow you to
explore cloud services without incoming
