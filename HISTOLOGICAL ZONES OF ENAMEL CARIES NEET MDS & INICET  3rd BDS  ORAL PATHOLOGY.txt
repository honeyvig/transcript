hi winners this is dr srikanth from team
mds conquer
now i'm going to discuss about the
histological zones
of enamel cares of course this is an
important area
for your university examinations a short
answer
in your third year and followed by an
important area
for entrance point of view okay hope you
are very familiar with the
histological jones of enamel curious
and you can remember with a mnemonic a
keyword called as
td b s
okay so you can remember just with this
word called as
t d b s okay
so what is this tdb is t for
translate zone d for dark john
b for body of lesion s for
surface layer so nowadays i hope like
most of you are preparing for inic et2
so inact is going to ask a sequence
based question so they can ask you
what is the sequence of this
histological enamel jones
from inside outside or from outside to
inside
sometimes they may link with a diagram
also very simple don't need to go for a
complicated diagrams
even you are planning to write a
university exam
okay either in your mds first year okay
this is an important area
or either in your third bds if a
question is asked you can go with a
simple diagram
like this with different color coding
okay so from inside to outside
it is going to be t d b
s okay so now we'll try to
go a bit a bit deep into this particular
concept so what what happens in each
zone
what is the significance of each and
every john
from an entrance point of view and of
course you can write the same points
for your theory question also so
enamel carries zones are divided so you
can remember with tdbs
simple mnemonic so the zone one okay is
called as translate zone t
zone two is called as a dark zone and
zone three is called as in a body of
lesion and zone four is called as a
surface zone and surface zone is present
outside
whereas your transient zone is present
inside so
any carry starts from the surface mostly
like most except few carries
most of the kerysis starts from the
surface so surface is always present
whereas the deepest layer may be absent
in some types of
histological slides that's what the
point one says okay not
always present and of course as it is
the deepest zone
it is going to be the advanced front
means it is the one which is going to
guide it
it is something like an engine to the
train it is something like an engine to
the
occurrence of a dental caries and of
course it is the deepest of all the
zones because it is present in the lower
part
and transcendency is because of the
pores of the spaces
with a volume size of one percentage do
remember this is a volume size of one
percentage
is seen in the case of transient zone
whereas a normal dentin has a poor size
or a poor volume size of only zero point
one percentage means this zone has ten
times
more pore size right
so the second zone is called as dark
john dark john
is always called as positive zone okay
it is called as positive zone
it is usually present and i mean it is
basically due to the reduction of the
minerals
per unit volume because basically
demineralization
occurs here okay so keris is nothing but
a shift
of uh a shift of this demoniation
remuneration cycle towards the demon
relations side
that is the reason why the carriage
occurs and if you see the pore size the
pore size is two to four percentage
and uh if you see like if you if you
talk about the rapid advancing carries
it will be narrow in the rapid advancing
care is this zone
and it will be wider in the slow
advancing cares when a slow carries is
slow
it is wider kerys is rapid rapidly
progressing carries it will be narrow
and coming to the third zone that is
called as body of the lesion
body of the lesion is present
superficial to the dark zone
and it will be deep to the surface zone
it will be deep to the surface zone
and it will be superficial to that of
the
dark zone and if you take here the
there is a large portion of
demineralization when you compare with
the dark join when you compare with the
dark zone the portion of revelation will
be high
and if you see the pores i pour size or
the poor volume also
the poor volume also is very very high
in the case of body of the lesion
okay so ah and and you can check this
this is a clinical significance okay
shows an increase prominence in the
trial fringes so this this can be asked
as a question it was once given in the
pga
okay so shows i mean uh
increasing in the prominence of shreya
fridges is seen in the which of the
histological joan of
and i am curious is a question asked the
answer is john three that is the body
of lesion and coming to the last zone
that is called as
surface zone which is the outermost zone
okay uh
appears really unaffected okay sometimes
like if you see
subsurface demineralization okay hope
you remember your clinical
uh point that is called as white spot
white spot lesion okay so white spot
lesion is basically due to the
subsurface means surface is intact but
there will be demon relation subsurface
so
sometimes this surface may be unaffected
in some types of
sub surface demineralization
okay due to greater degree of
mineralization
and fluoride concentration what is going
to happen most of these lesions will be
healed
self-healed self-healed
self-healing will be there okay they can
be self-healed that is called as
uh you can you can consider it as
prevented industry
means you don't need to prepare a cavity
for this surface
zone because the accessibility of this
fluorides or your remineralizing agents
will be very high on the surface
so there are high chances that this area
can be remineralized again
if it is left untreated then the surface
enamel get damaged and the cavity will
be formed okay so the
if it if it is not properly treated then
it moves to the next level okay uh
hope hope you can check your ic dust
classification if you just correlate the
clinical
i see this there is something called as
i see the scariest classification
if you correlate that okay icdas 1 and
icds 2 will come under
surface areas okay the white spot lesion
is nothing but
it it moves around the surface zone and
the treatment plan for icds 1 and
icdhas2 that
involves the subsurfaces remineralizing
agents you can apply fluorides you can
maintain proper oral hygiene
you can apply remineralizing agents okay
that is cpp acp
calcium amorphous calcium phosphate can
be applied so that icy does one ice dash
through
can be healed which are present on the
surface zone
