welcome to this new video by simply
learn in this video we will be putting
together a light on various job roles on
data science data science is rapidly
growing field that has emerged as a key
driver of innovation and progress in
various Industries it involves the use
of advanced statistical and
computational technique to extract
insights and knowledge from vast and
complex data sets data scientists works
with a variety of data sources including
structured and unstructured data and use
tools such as statistical modeling
machine learning and data visualization
to make sense of the information they
play a crucial role in helping
organizations make data-driven decisions
that can lead to improved performance
greater efficiency and better outcomes
with the explosive growth of data in
today's digital age the demand for
skilled data scientists continues to
rise making it an exciting and rewarding
career path for those with a passion for
analytics and problem solving so if you
are looking to become one then do check

without any further Ado let's begin by
knowing various job roles in data
science so let's take a look at some of
the roles a data science plays in the
job market let's drill in there just a
little bit here so when you have a data
scientist they're going to perform
predictive analysis and identify Trend
and patterns that can help in better
decision making companies hiring data
scientists include Apple Adobe Google
Microsoft I would say that's even
expanding down to smaller companies you
know where you're talking about only 100
employees or something like that they're
starting to look at data scientists
because they need them to come in and be
a part of that team and the rule is
understanding challenges of a system and
offer best Solutions this should always
be the goal of a data scientist is to be
looking at the whole system and then
trying to find those patterns that are
going to best enhance the company or the
business or the whatever group maybe
you're working with the sales team or
the marketing team and you can see
languages pretty important to have a
these are a number of different
languages and again it depends on your
own specialty there's all kinds of
different variations but we have R SAS
python Matlab SQL Hive Pig spark you
should have release and knowledge of all
of these maybe a python programmer never
used our download it go through the
basics so at least you know what's going
on in R versus python because R is
pretty powerful for doing a very quick
display and then of course a lot of
things you can do in Python you have to
be able to do queries on database from
time to time create and modify
algorithms which can be used to reduce
information from large databases and
usually this is one of those things you
do at the beginning you set it up and
then you kind of Let It Go Until It
Breaks and you have to go back and fix
it because your query isn't working that
certainly is a very common thing to to
have happen especially if you're pulling
data off the web and the internet and
then we have some more companies that
are hiring data analysis like IBM DHL HP
and so we're talking about data analysts
the rule is responsible for a variety of
tasks such as visualization optimization
and processing large amount of data and
so when you talk about a data analyst
we're also we're still talking a lot of
the same stuff which you'll see we now
throwing in JavaScript and HTML in here
because that's pretty common with the
data analyst versus a data scientist and
you can see that SQL is still pretty
solid and also CC plus plus is pretty
big so some companies also use Java so
I'd put Java in the languages also on
that for a data analyst and then you
have a data architect ensuring that data
Engineers have best tools and systems to
work with and so companies hiring a data
architecture like Visa Logitech
Coca-Cola they create blueprints for
data management with the best security
measures I cannot highlight that a data
architect really spends a lot of time
with security measures that's big how
many hacks have we seen in the last year
on large companies have lost data for
millions of their customers and how
badly that affects them and we're
looking at languages as you see that SQL
is pretty solid across all of these
under a data architect XML that's one
that a lot of the data science jobs
don't really you don't see as much but
you're going to see more XML with the
data architect because there's a lot of
XML files that are that have your
security measures embedded in them and
of course your hive Pig those are Hadoop
systems we're doing some basic queries
so instead of doing the high-end queries
you know how these simplified query
systems built into Hadoop and Spark so
if you're using big data you're going to
want to know your spark also and then we
have our data engineer the data engineer
updates the existing systems with better
version of the current Technologies to
improve the efficiency of the databases
think admin here a lot of work tracking
down what version you're in of the
different programs what version of
python are you using what version of R
are you using what version of C plus
plus so companies hiring data Engineers
or like Amazon Spotify Facebook and they
develop construct test and maintain
architectures such as databases and long
scale processing systems and here we
have our languages our SQL our Matlab
SAS SPSS python Java Ruby C plus Pearl
Hive Pig you pretty much as a data
engineer at this level when you talk
about admin in and updating all these
databases need to know all the different
stuff that's being used in the company
and you're testing out these structures
to make sure they work and so you really
are talking admin level kind of setups
if you like spinning up an admin onto a
Google cloud service or Amazon cloud
service now you start to get an idea
what we're talking about because then
you can test it out up there and then
you can bring it back and update it to
the company statistician creates new
methodologies for engineers to apply and
so when we look at this this is where
we're digging into the math of Which
models to use what setup is going to
work what kind of activation do we have
on our neural network these little
tweaks are going to make a big
difference and we look for methodologies
at a large level what kind of data are
we going to be looking at how we're
going to pull it together companies
hiring a data engineer or we're talking
about statisticians we're talking about
LinkedIn PepsiCo Johnson and Johnson and
of course these companies probably hire
a little bit of everything but they have
a lot of statisticians working for them
and so we look at the role extract and
offer valuable reports from the data
clusters through statistical theories
and data organization and the languages
across the board we're still seeing SQL
are Matlab SAS SPSS data that's a new
one that we haven't seen in some of the
other roles python Pearl an older
version and that shouldn't be a surprise
because a lot of these companies
probably built a lot of the original
packages on Perl if you go look at
Johnson and Johnson and of course your
big data Hive Pig and Spark and then our
database administrator I mentioned the
other one is an admin they're more on
admin level for the software itself so
administrator is another level some of
the tasks involved are monitoring
operating and maintaining databases
installation configuration defining
schemas training users Etc and this is
interesting training users because when
you build a database and you define all
the different tables that are embedded
in that database and how they're all
connected the end user is going to have
that information otherwise you're in
trouble when we have companies hiring
data Engineers uh of course Tableau
Twitter Reddit the role ensures that all
the databases are available to all
relevant users again a little security
in there what role do they have is
allowed in and not and is performing
correctly and is being kept safe and you
better be ready to spend some time in
security because again that's a very big
thing nowadays with the number of people
who hack into these databases and the
languages are going to be covered you
have your c-sharp your Java SQL Ruby on
Rails XML again there's that XML because
a lot of your security is embedded in
XML files um python all the main players
depending on what the company's using
data and analytics manager so when you
see manager that means that somebody's
going to sit on top and organize the
people underneath so they're going to
improve the business process as an
intermediary between business and I.T oh
you better have some really good
communication skills for this one some
of the companies hiring a data Engineers
or a Coursera Motorola slack of course
these companies are hiring data
scientists in almost all of these fields
so the role oversees the data science
operations and assigns the duties to the
team according to skills and expertise
so that's a big one you better be able
to communicate what's going on help your
team members come out and be able to
communicate with other people so
sometimes your job is just being able to
get people to talk to each other the big
thing on that is is the whole
communication line going from one end to
the other because you can't communicate
all the information that everybody's
working on you have to pretty much come
in there and help people communicate
with there is going on and also know
what they're up to without being
micromanagement because that will crash
a company if you micromanage everybody
but if you just let them do whatever
they want and they never talk to each
other that will also destroy the company
you got to find that nice middle ground
and you really have to have an overview
of everything as a data and analytics
manager one of the things I mean you
know it's good to have at least one or
two solid bases of programming under
your belt for a data analytics manager
but you do need to have a very general
understanding of all the different tools
being used so that you know what's going
on with your different team members of
course sqlr SAS Java python Matlab all
of those are big business analytics so
this is when you're talking about your
bi or your business intelligence and
your business analytics very important
to know this is kind of a subdivision of
a lot of the other stuff we've talked
about a lot of the other roles we've
looked at so you possess specialized
knowledge of their business domain and
apply that knowledge and Analysis
specifically to the operation of the
business so you might be a specialist in
banking you might be a genetics engineer
so you know about genetics you might
just be General business helping the
marketing so a lot of companies hiring
data engineer Oracle Uber Dell and the
role act as a link between the data
engineers and the management Executives
so it's very similar to when you go back
up here we look at data analytics
manager a business analytics is going to
also kind of fill that role in between
but they're more specialized in business
and you better know SQL because we're
talking about a business specifically
most of the large companies are storing
their data that's up and running right
now that people are accessing to
purchase something on the Home Depot
website or the Uber they're logging in
you better know your SQL that's very
