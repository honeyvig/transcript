next we will discuss about placements
if you like to become a software
engineer developer or any field related
to it you must learn a programming
language in your first year
programming language is a computer
language that will help you to
communicate with the computer systems
like C C plus plus Java Python and many
more
now you might be wondering which is the
best language to learn in your first
year according to survey it's python but
my suggestion is if you are interested
in any of the product based companies
like Microsoft Google Amazon many more
you can go for languages like C plus
plus and Java you can also go for python
but python contains some of the inbuilt
libraries and inbuilt function by which
it might be not easy to understand all
the fundamental topics C plus plus is an
object-oriented programming language and
it is best for building the large scale
applications
it also plays an integral role in
building the operating systems web
browsers database Etc
when we say Java Java is also an
object-oriented programming language and
it has an amazing ability to move easily
from one computer to another computer
that is a flat mob independent feature
first we have to learn the basic of
these two languages like its input
output statement its variables data
types looping statements and many more
then move on to the data section
algorithms on these languages
data structure is a group of elements
through which data is stored and
organized effectively and algorithms are
used to fetch these datas for example
Instagram and Facebook
Instagram and Facebook will store their
data using the data structure Concepts
and we can use the algorithms to fetch
their data and do the operations such as
searching for any username deleting any
accounts Etc
in DSA we have many topics to cover like
arrays arraylist Stacks queues linked
list trees many more
if you have managed to cover till here
from your first semester then your first
year in your placement preparation will
be very high and successful
now you might be wondering from where I
can learn all this
go for any of the certification courses
like we have some on Java certification
training program and many more for which
the link will be mentioned in the
description you can also learn through
YouTube books websites articles and many
more
with this parallel College academics
will be going on so if you spend two
hours in a day achieving this will be
very easier
till now we have discussed what are the
things that you can take up in your
first semester
when it comes for second semesters you
can go in a two ways one is to engage in
accommodative programming by
participating in the events like
hackathon and ackerank contest
