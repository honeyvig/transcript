hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this session we
will learn about friend functions in c
plus so let's go ahead and have a look
at what we'll be covering today in this
session we will cover topics like why do
we need a friend function what is a
friend function in c plus plus then the
declaration of friend function and after
that we will learn what is a friend
class then we will understand features
of friend function and its advantages
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update so
first is why do we need a friend
function friend functions are used when
we want to access the private or
protected members of the class but
without the help of the objects it helps
us in avoiding the case where the
functions must be a member of both the
classes in order to access them or in
other words a function doesn't have to
be a member of both the classes in order
to access the class data a friend
function is also used to perform
operator overloading like functions
operators can also be overloaded and
because of the friend function it is
possible now let's understand what is a
friend function a friend function is not
a member function of the class and it is
defined outside the class
and we know outside members cannot
access the class data but the friend
function can access those private public
and protected class data because the
friend function is friendly with the
class
now let's move to declaration of friend
function the declaration of friend
function must be done inside the class
the friend function is declared using
the friend keyword then the return type
then the name of the function that is
made a friend of the class its
definition is done outside the class and
we don't use the friend keyword while
defining it but while declaring it
inside the class we use the friend
keyword now coming to the next topic
that is what is a friend class
exactly like a friend function a class
can also be a friend of another class a
friend class is that class that can
access the data members and member
functions of a class to which it is a
friend
we need to pass the objects of the class
to a member function of the friend class
if we want to access those private and
protected members
also if the classes are declared friends
then all the member functions of the
class will be a friend function to the
friend class
now let's have a look at the syntax here
we have done the forward declaration of
class table this will allow the access
of the objects of the class table
in the class club inside the class club
we have declared friend class table that
means the class table is a friend of
class club and it can access members of
that class after that we have defined
the class table without the friend
keyword as we can see
now coming to features of friend
function so here are some features of
friend functions so let's start with the
first one that is a friend function
can be easily invoked just like a normal
function it doesn't require any object
or so to invoke next is the scope of a
friend function is not limited it can be
a member of another class as well third
is a friend function can be declared in
any part that is private protected or
public parts of the class
fourth is the object of the class can be
used as an argument for the function and
the last is a friend function can access
the members by using the object name and
dot operator along with the member's
name
now coming to advantages of friend
function the first advantage is with the
help of friend function we are able to
access the known public members of the
class that is the private members the
second advantage is friend function
helps in operator overloading and the
third advantage is because of the friend
function we are able to share the
private information by a known member
function as friend function is not a
member function
last advantage is
fan function allows us to generate more
efficient code so these were some
advantages of friend function so now
let's go ahead and do some examples on
friend functions to understand it in a
better way so let's open our visual
studio code and do some examples
so first of all let's make a new file
let's name it friend one
dot
cpb
all right so now here we'll do a simple
program of friend function so let's
start
with including the header file has
include iostream
now we will write using namespace
standard
all right
and
inside the main function
first of all we will create an object of
a class let's say the name of the class
is salary and the name of the object is
s
all right after that we will
simply write return 0
and we will do the rest of this after
creating the class
so we need to first create the class now
we'll write
class
salary which is the name of the class
and inside this class first of all we'll
write private
access modifier and
here we will write
or declare
a variable named cell
after that now we will write or declare
the friend function so we know how to
declare a front function we'll write
friend keyword
then the return type that is int
and then the name of the
function let's say increment
and then the objects as we know we have
to pass
the name of the class with the object
because we want to access the private
member of the class
so salary s which is the object
and after the class we'll write the
semicolon
now we have to create or define this
increment friend function we'll write
int
increment
here we haven't used the front keyword
because this is the definition
now inside the arguments will pass the
the object
all right
now inside the main function
we will call this friend function so
first of all we will display a message
saying that
increment
is
that the increment in the salary is
and then we will call this
function
and we will pass this object
all right now inside this increment
function which is a friend function we
will use object as
dot operator and then
the name of the variable which is
private
now all we need to do is to
increment this salary variable
we'll write s dot cell plus
7000
which is the increment and then we will
return
s dot cell
all right now as we can see this
increment function which is not a member
function of this class
is accessing this private variable of
salary class and is incrementing 7000 to
the salary so now let's save it first
and let's try to run this
there is some error
let's have a look at that
um all right
yeah there is some spelling mistake
increment
now let's save it
and run it
so as we can see
increment is 7000
so this is the correct output
so this was a simple example of friend
function let's do another example
so here we will do an example of friend
class and we know friend class is a
class that can access the data members
and member functions of a class to which
it is a friend
so let's start first of all we'll
include the header files
hash include iostream
and then the namespace standard
and we forgot to name this file so let's
do it
let's name it friend
2 dot cpp
all right now let's proceed
into main inside the main function first
of all we will create an object of a
class
let's say the class name is
num2
and its object is obj2 object2 now for
now let's say we'll write only return 0
we'll do this part later onwards
now
let's create the class
all right so the class name would be
num2
num1 actually
but we know
in front class we have to do the forward
declaration so we will write
class
num
2
so this is a forward declaration of
class num2 now
inside class num1 first of all we will
declare a variable in private
so let's say the name of the variable is
n1 and is the data type and one is the
name of the variable
now we have to
do the declaration of friend class
so we'll write friend keyword
after that
class
num2
which is the name of the class
all right
after this
let's create this
first of all we have to put the
semicolon all right now let's write this
class
num2
so this is our friend class num2 we
haven't used friend keyword over here as
we can see
all right in this class we'll use a
private access specifier and
we'll create another variable n2
and
then we will write the public access
specifier and we will create a
constructor of num2 as this is the
name of the class and this is object we
have created so now we will create the
constructor of this class
num2
and now in this constructor we will
initialize
n2 with 65 or whatsoever number we want
because in the end we have to find the
average of
two variables
so this is the second variable n2
and we have assigned the value 65 so now
let's make the function of average
because we want to find the average of
both the numbers
so
enters the data type
avg is the name of the function let's
say
and inside this function we will
make an object of num1 class
and object name is obj1 now as we have
created the
object
by mistake we have wrote i
obj one so as we have created the object
of num1 class which its constructor
would be invoked which we will create
now but first of all
here we will write return
the average so we'll write obj one dot
n1
plus
n2
divided by
two
so as we know that obj one is the
object of num1 class so that is why we
have used obj one dot operator n1 that
is the name of the variable plus n2
divided by 2
from here we can find the average and
before that we have to create the
constructor of this class so
now all we need to do is
write public access modifier
now
num1
and inside this num1 we will assign the
value to n1 variable which is let's say
11
all right so
now in the main function
we have to call this function avj that
is the average function
and
we forgot to put semicolon over here all
right
now
we'll
display a message
average is
and now we will call the function
obj
2
dot
avg
which is a function
so here we are calling this function so
let's save this
so we have saved this now let's try to
run this one
as you can see the average is 38. so
65 plus 11
6
and 76
divided by 2 which is 38 so this is the
correct output so this is a fine example
of friend class
as we know class
num2 is a friend of class num1 so it can
access all the members of class num1
in class num2 we have created the
function avg
over here
this is the function avg
here we are doing the average of both
the numbers
and as class num2 is a friend of num1 so
we can create objects of num1 in
num2class
and after doing this
this is our output that is average is
38.
so this is an example of friend class
now let's do another example so here we
will do an example of friend function in
which a friend function is a friend to
two classes
and this would be an example in which we
have to do the product of two numbers so
let's start
first of all let's include the header
files as we have done previously
iostream
namespace standard
now let's save it
friend3.cpp
and
spelling is wrong
now
let's start with the main function
inside the int main first of all we will
create the object of class a that is a
and class b
object would be small b
and we will use these objects to call
the functions
but we will do that part later onwards
first of all we'll simply write return
zero over here
and now we will create the classes
all right so here we will create a class
but before that we have to do the
forward declaration of another class so
this is the forward declaration of class
p and now we can create the class a
and
inside the a class
we will declare the variable x let's say
now
we will use this public scope
and we will create a function within
this class let's say void
assign
now inside this function we will pass
the
variable i beca because we have to
assign the value of this variable i
to the variable x
so
we will assign the value of i to x
like this
and before that we have to do the
calling from the main function
so we will do that later first of all we
will create the friend function and here
we are declaring this friend function
void is the return type product let's
say is the name of this friend function
and a
comma b
are the arguments
now
let's call this
sine function
first of all so all we need to do is
we will make a call from this main
function
a dot assign
which is the name of the function and
let's say we have
passed the value
45 now here we will create the class b
inside the b class we'll similarly
create another variable y
and now
inside the public scope we will create
function
of the same name that is assign now in
this assign function we will pass
i as the argument
as we have done in class a similarly we
will do it over here we will assign the
value of i to this variable y once we
have done this
then
we will declare friend function as we
know that the front function is friend
of both of these classes so we have to
do it inside both of these classes we
have to declare the friend function and
now
we will declare the friend function in
this class as well
product
all right after the class we will use
the semicolon
now
we will create the friend function
so here we are defining the friend
function we use void product which is
the name of the function
um data type object name
all right now all we need to do is
we'll do the sum a dot x into
b
dot
y
and now we'll use semicolon so here a
dot x
will hold the value which have been
assigned that is 45 and now
b dot x
b dot y will hold the value which we
will call from here b dot
assign
here we are calling and we are assigning
the value let's say 20 you're passing
the value 20 and this 20 value
will be assigned to this y and
45 into 20 would be the product
so everything is done now all we need to
do is to call the
product function and as we know that the
product function that is the friend
function is the friend of both of the
classes so it can access the private
variables so we'll do that
product
a
comma b here we are calling this
now let's save this one and let's try to
run this
there are some errors
let's check them
class a all right
so we forgot to
make some space over here now let's save
it again
and let's try to run this
as we can see
the output is
900 so 45 into 20 is equal to 900 which
is the correct answer
and
it means the program is working fine so
this is a fine example in which a
function that is this product function
is a friend of both the classes that is
class b and this class a here we have
done the forward declaration and we have
made the friend of class a and here we
have declared the
friend function in class b
and as we can see that this product
function can use or access the private
variables of both the classes and so
this is by using the private variables
we we have done the product of both of
these numbers and its answer is 900
so these were some few examples of
friend functions you can try some more
examples on it it will enhance your
knowledge in c plus plus as it is an
interesting topic all right guys with
