hello everyone welcome to this video on
FMA W frames from Simply learn today I'm
going to walk you through what w frames
are why they are important and the
different types you can create so what
exactly are wiof frames think of wiof
frames as a blueprint of a website or
app just like an architect starts with a
simple sketch before building a house
wif frames help designers map out where
everything will go things like buttons
text images and menus they don't focus
on how things will look but instead on
how things are organized this makes wof
frames the foundation of any good design
now why do we need a wireframe imagine
starting a design without a plan it
could quickly become confusing and messy
so vof frames allow us to focus on how
users will interact with the design and
make sure everything works logically so
by starting with a wireframe we can
catch any problems early and adjust the
layouts before moving on to more
detailed design work saving us time and
effort down the line now there are two
main types of w frames low fidil and
high fidil low Fidelity wireframes are
like rough sketches they are quick to
make and focus on the basic layout you
can create them on paper or digitally to
get a rough idea of the structure and
high fidil wireframes are more detailed
and closer to the final design with more
focus on specific elements and how they
interact these are typically done
digitally using tools like figma so they
can be shared and adusted Ted easily and
speaking of paper and digital wi frames
both have their place paper wi frames
are great for quick brainstorming or
sketching out ideas on the go but
digital wi frames like those made in
figma are far better for collaboration
easy edits and adding more detail as you
refine Your Design so let's explore how
to create a wi frame so in this demo I
will show you an example of how we can
create a wi frame for a LinkedIn page
that for a mobile view so I've already
renamed my project as LinkedIn VI frame
and for the reference I have saved an
image from Google so let's first drag
and drop the image from the files to our
figma canvas like
this so we can just drag
it and drop it over
here make sure to resize
it yes I hope it's visible now next we
have to create a frame so for that you
can either go to the toolbar below or
you can simply press F on your keyboard
now after which you can select the
device from the right side panel that
you want your frame to be so I'm
selecting iPhone 14
plus we just need one frame now we have
to make sure that the screenshot or the
saved image and your frame is of equal
size so that your by Framing process
will be easy so let's just resize it to
the you know size of the pick now while
resizing which essentially means while
zooming in or zooming out make sure that
you press the shift key so that it
resizes uniformly like this yes I think
this is fine so now everything is set
and let's start with W framing so
basically we start by using the
rectangles so now again for rectangle
you can go to the toolbar or simply
press r on your keyboard so as you can
see here first you have a box to write
your name then you have the profile
photo a background
image the profile Al bio accept button
ignore button more button and about
section and the featured and finally we
have some tools down so let's start to
BU frame it one by one so first let's
just draw a rectangle over
here again we'll draw a rectangle for
the arrow button also we'll you know
place the arrow button inside it
later now we need another rectangle for
the background
image
yes and the profile picture is inside a
circle so either you can you know select
a circle or again you can go to
rectangle draw a
rectangle and you can curve the corners
right here on your right side corner the
radius like
this I think this is fine
we'll give this a different
color
yeah so we'll write the text later let's
fill the boxes our shapes first now here
we
have three
buttons let's draw the rectangle and
then Corner the radius like
before I think this is
fine so I've gone to the radius to 48 as
you can see here
think I'll reduce the size a bit Yeah so
now three more sorry two more buttons
are
needed so just copy paste
it so as you can see wi frame is just a
blueprint and it is mainly done so that
the stakeholders or your team members
get an idea about your project so you
don't have to waste much of your time
perfecting the shapes and icons or the
colors so your main focus should be on
the logic of the design
now let's just Mark these separations
between each sections for that also
we'll use
rectangle
yeah we'll just copy paste
this now we need some rectangles for the
featured
section so now as you can see I don't
want to you know Corner the radius of
these two sides just the upper part so
what you can do is you can select
the upper
part and uh
yes kept it
30 you can keep this 30 as
well so as you can see it has cornered
the radius of the top two sides the
bottom two sides are intact just like
that so that's why we basically use the
rectangle for every shapes and then we
Corner the IUS again let's do the
same here as you can see it's the half
of the image so I just need to Corner
this particular
side so this time will Corner only
the top left
corner we'll keep this also 30 as
well okay let's just adjust it a bit
perfect now let's move on to the text
section now again to add the text you
can go to the toolbar or you can just
press t on your
keyboard so first we have to type inside
this the font is pretty much small so
select your text go to your right hand
side
increase the font
size so I
think 24 is
fine just drag it a little
bit
yes now this is of blue color this
particular box so change the color to
Blue
yes now let's just quickly write the
texts over here
too so as you can see the ignore button
is you know a bit of grayish over here
so what you can do is you can select the
button go to the fill section so let it
remain black you can adjust the opacity
over
here like this and make it
lighter so this is how it's done and
also the Box should not be in gray color
so what I can do is I will just keep it
white just keep it white but I need the
outline for that I'll just give give a
stroke like
this perfect so I think I'll just copy
paste the same thing over here also
next let's type the about
section let's reduce the font
size I think 32 is
fine so as of now you can simply write
description so you know most of the
people like I have seen in V frames they
just write Laural lipsum that this so
it's better you know to give a dis like
you know to give an idea about what this
particular box contain so now while
people are viewing your VI frame they
know that this is about section and here
the description is to be written next is
the feature section
which even this should go to the right
hand side sorry left hand
side so let's just quickly finish it off
so next we have to design these tools so
for each of the tools for timeing we'll
just draw rectangles before filling it
inside again for wi frames you don't
have to take tension about the spacing
and
everything because it's just a rough
blueprint or a rough
idea so now let's see how to create the
shapes inside this but before that if
you interested in a career in uiux you

in the description box and pin comments
so now let's see how to create shapes
let's just zoom in a bit so the first
shape is of the
homepage so for that you have to select
the
pen so let's just yeah what's the shape
yeah
so again you don't have to give a
perfect drawing it's just that they must
understand what that particular position
is for so this is how you
draw click here just move your
cursor mark this particular Point move
your cursor Mark the point so this is
how you draw
I hope this is fine like the people will
understand this is for the
homepage so quickly let's just draw the
rest of the icons for rectangle the
shortcut is o in your
keyboard
for for
now let's see how the Bell icon is
created because it looks a bit tough so
basically what you can do is for this
also you just have to use the pen icon
but then as you can see there's a curved
Edge so let's see how that can be bought
with a
pen so for making a curve you have have
to choose the
pen click on your
canvas from this point drag the
mouse to look at the required shape stop
it then bring it
back
yes so I hope you got it I'll just zoom
it and do it once more so take the pen
click on the canvas go to the point
just click and drag the
mouse leave it over
there again drag the
mouse and
yes you got the perfect curve
so as you can see I have finished
drawing the icons I know it's not
perfect but I think this is more than
enough for the viewers to get an idea
about what is there in each position now
again similarly you know you can fill
these text you can you know draw the Aro
and everything so yes this is how you
can create your wireframe it's quite
simple isn't it so now we can also make
a wireframe clickable for multiple Pages
by adding the flows between the frames
so let me show you how that's done so
for example I've already wireframe the
login page of LinkedIn over
here as you can see it kind of looks
exact but again as I mentioned before W
frame is just a blueprint so don't waste
much time perfecting the shapes and
icons of the colors your main focus
should be the logic of the design so now
let's just make it clickable for
example I want the user to go to his
profile once he logs in so let's just
consider if this is that person's
profile so what I can do is I have a
sign in button over here so first go to
prototype which is on your right side so
as you hover over the shape you'll find
these plus buttons
so just click over there drag
it just a second I have to zoom out a
bit
Yeah so I will drag it to this
particular
frame so the trigger is on click so I
don't want this page to come while I
hover over it all you know while
dragging it I want it on click so let's
keep it on click action is navigating to
the animation I wanted smart
animate which means it's smooth you can
also you know change the duration the
speed so now let's just hit the play
button so here it is a signin page and
once I signed
in here is the profile
page so as you can see this kind of
gives a complete idea on where the user
will go after he clicks the login button
right so yeah this is it this is how you
create create a wireframe and then make
it clickable and now here's a quick tip
to make this process even faster so you
can use the FMA Community wireframe kits
now the figma community offers tons of
free wireframe kits made by other
designers that you can drag and drop
into your project so this is a huge
timesaver especially if you're in a rush
or working on large projects so to
access these kits you just have to go to
the community tab in figma and search
for the wif frame kit and browse through
the options so there's something for
almost every type of design project as
you can see here and they're
customizable so you can tweak them to
fit your exact needs so for example
let's just check out this load fil
wireframe so as you can
see this has so many examples which you
can just you know drag and drop like for
example if you want this particular
section instead of creating like if this
is exact section you want you can
actually you know drag and drop it to
your
canvas and you can also customize it and
edit it so this is pretty handy so that
wraps up our demo on how to create a
wireframe using figma I hope you found
this tutorial helpful in understanding
how wireframes help organize your design
