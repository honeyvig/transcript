hello everyone I am M and welcome to
this video where we will explore a basic
but important Concept in machine
learning the confusion metrics if you
are new to machine learning
understanding the confusion metrics will
help you see how well your model is
performing so let's start with a simple
example imagine you have built a model
to predict whether an email is Spam or
not so after training the model you test
it on new emails the confusion matx is
like scorecard that show how well your
model's prediction match the actual
results it helps you see whether your
model is getting things right and where
it is making mistakes for example your
model might correctly identify most spam
emails but it might also mistakenly flag
some non-spam emails as spams or it
might miss a few spam emails and let
them throw as if they were not spam so
the confusion Matrix lays out this
clearly so you can understand exactly
how your model performs so why is this
important because simply knowing how
often your model is correct doesn't give
you the full picture the confusion
Matrix helps you see the details of
models performance which is the key to
improving especially if one type of
error is more serious so by end of this
video you will clearly understand what a
confusion Matrix is how to read it and
how it can help you to fin tune your
machine learning models craving a career
upgrade

more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box
below and the pin comand so without any
further Ado let's get started so what
are confusion metrics and why do we need
them so in machine learning
classification is used to divide data
into different categories but after we
have clean prepared the data and trained
our model how we can tell if the model
is performing well so there is where
confusion metrics come in handy so a
confus MC is a tool that helps measure
the performance of a classifier in
detail it goes beyond just giving an
overall accuracy score it shows exactly
where the model is making mistake and
how it is classifying each category for
example if there is an imbalance in the
data where one category has many more
instances than other the model might
predict the majority category most of
the time and still show a high accuracy
but this wouldn't be helpful because the
model is not accurately predicting the
minority categories the confusion
matrics help visualize these outcome by
showing a table of all the predicted and
the actual values allowing use to see
where the model is performing well and
where it needs Improvement so moving
forward let's see confusion matrices
parts or how to create 2x two Matrix so
we can get four different outcomes when
comparing the predict actual values from
a classifier the first one is true
positive this is when the model directly
predicts a positive outcome you
predicted positive and it was actually
positive the second one is false
positive this happens when the model
incorrectly predicts a positive outcome
for something that is actually negative
or a predictive positive but it was
actually negative the third one true
negative this is when the model
correctly predicts a negative outcome
you predict a negative and it was
actually negative and the fourth one
false negative this occurs when the
model incorrectly predicts a negative
outcome for something that is actually
positive CU predictive negative and but
it was actually positive so moving
forward let's see some matrices of
confusion Matrix so this is a graph so
we know there are four parts true
positive false positive false negative
and true negative so this one is true
positive this one is false positive this
one is false negative this one is true
negative so just consider consider a
confusion Matrix made for a classifier
that classify People based on whether
they speak English or they speak Spanish
okay from this diagram you can see that
fine so these are some values TP FN FP
TN there is nothing two positive two
negative like this just from looking at
the Matrix the performance of our model
is not very clear so to find out how
accurate our model is we use the
following matrices the first one is
accuracy so this is the formula of
accuracy TP means true positive means
this 86 value so the accuracy is used to
find the portion of correctly classified
values it tells us how often our
classifier is right it is the sum of all
the True Values divided by total values
so in this case this is
88% okay 86+ 79 2 positive + 2 negative
divided by this it will come 88 2 three
okay and the second one is precision so
Precision is used to calculate the model
ability to classify positive value
correctly it is the true positive
divided by the total number of predicted
positive value so this is the formula it
is true positive divided by two positive
plus false positive so in this case the
value will come
87.7% okay and the third one is recall
so recall is used to calculate the
model's ability to predict positive
values
how often does the model predict the
correct positive values so it is true
positives divided by the total number of
actual positive values so in this case
the value is
88.9 okay and the last one is F1 score
so it is the harmonic mean of recall and
precision it is useful when you need to
take both precision and recall into an
account so in this case the value is
88.7 7% so now let's jump into the demo
part and see how we can get these values
accuracy precision recall and F1 score
from our data set using handson so I'm
performing this in Google collab so
first I will rename it to
confusion
Matrix okay so yes let's start so first
we will import some basic libraries of
python like numpy and the pandas so here
I like import numpy as NP
and
import pandas aspd why I'm writing this
npn PD because I don't want to write
again and again npay and pandas okay
this is a short form NP so everyone
knows I guess npay and pandas because
these are the basic Library so numai is
used for mostly linear algebra stuff and
pandas is used for the creating data
frames data processing or if you want to
read files CSP files like that okay yeah
so now let's import our data okay so
data equals to pd.
Dore CSV then file name data. CSV so I
will upload this file on the description
box below you guys can check out from
there okay yes so let okay what is
saying no such file or directory on data
or CSV I guess it's
there okay it's not let me import it
okay
yeah okay now file is there yeah it's
working fine so now let's
check okay F
Ros yeah so this is our data you can see
we have
columns withit data dot
columns okay so we have this 32 columns
in our data set ID diagnosis radius
means texture means parameter mean so I
just simply you know talk this data
there is nothing related to confusion
Matrix and all okay we have to just we
can perform you know confusion Matrix to
you know any data so head is used for
displaying top five rows of of our data
set okay if I will write data simply you
can see the full data okay with 33
columns and all the r right so uh now we
don't need this ID
and one is this unnamed data because
there is no
values okay so what I will do I will
write data dot drop
ID comma okay let me copy it because I
don't want any spelling
mistake
yeah copy paste here okay let me write
XIs = to
1 then comma in place equals
to
True okay let me run it okay if you
check data do head
now I guess there will be no ID and all
see there is now no ID and all okay this
we remove that LGE column as well un
name
32 okay so now what I have to
do I will write here data
dot
diagnosis equals to 1
if each was equals to
M okay
else
zero
for each in
data
dot
diagnosis
diagnosis yeah so if you can see there
is mmm value and there is you know
other values as well so for M I am
putting one for for the rest I will put
zero okay let's check
again yeah okay you can see it's done
replacement is done
basically okay so let's check the info
of the
data so these are some basic uh what to
say functions of
python so these are the column these are
the non Nal values these are the data
values okay float we have or int we have
okay so we have only two t type of data
sets so now what we will do we will do
normalization okay yals to data dot
diagonosis
diagnosis dot
values okay so here I will write
xcore data equals to
data.
drop
diagnosis
comma
XIs = to
1 okay here I will write x equals
to
xcore
data minus X NP do minimum value and the
xcore
data and divided by so I put using that
formula if you guys know okay divided
by
NP so I'm basically what I'm finding is
accuracy okay I'm using that formula NP
dot Max of X for
data then minus
NP dot main value then xcore
data
okay okay some okay access value is
wrong sorry spelling is
wrong now find
yes it's fine so now we will do train
test split so what is stain test dis
spit okay so first let me
route underscore
selection
import
train test split okay so what is train
test split so what we do we you know
split our data set into training and the
testing mostly we train and the some
part of data we test okay so here I will
set the ratio so xcore
train comma
xcore
test comma Yore
train comma
ycore test
equals to
train test
split then X comma y comma
testore
size equals to
0.15
means 85% we are on the training and 15%
we are on the testing part okay comma
random
State equal to 42 okay let me run it
it's working fine yeah it's working fine
so now let's see the accuracy from the
random Forest so I will write
from skar
do
emble
import random
random Forest
classifier okay then RF equals
to random forest classifier and
ncore
estimators equals to
100 and here I will set random state
to
1 okay then RF this is a short form of
random Forest do
fit
fit xcore
train comma Yore
train then
print random Forest
score comma
RF do
score then xcore test comma Yore test
okay now let's check how much the
accuracy so accuracy is coming
95% okay which is very good so now what
I will do I will create confus confusion
Matrix now
Yore
prediction equals to RF do
predict xcore test
okay and Y underscore true equals to
Yore
test okay so here now let's create the
array
skar
dot
matrix
import confusion Matrix
okay then I will write CM short form of
confusion
metric here I will write y
true comma y
prediction then confusion
Matrix so this is our array okay the
true positive and and this is
false negative and this is false
positive like this okay so now let's
create the visualization of confusion
metrix okay so here I write
import
cbor as
SNS and
import M plot
Li do p
plot as
PLT PLT means plot okay the short form F
comma ax =
to PLT do
subplots let's give the figure
size equals to 5A
5 then SNS do heat
map then confusion Matrix comma n not
equals to
true then comma line
width = to
0.5 comma line
color equals to let's give
red
then
fmt
to I don't need any
you know uh that decimal
values comma ax = to
X okay then PLT
do X
label y underscore
prediction then PLT
dot y
label then y underscore true
add the okay forgot to add
this Braes then PLT do
show yeah so as you can see this is the
Y True Values and this is the Y
prediction values okay this is the heat
map we have created so this is how you
can visualize your confusion Matrix fine
so with this we have come to end of this
