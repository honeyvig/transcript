hey everyone i am viva khandelwal and i
welcome you all to our simply learns
youtube channel today we will be
creating a unity 3d game project but
first let me tell you that we have daily
updates on numerous technologies
so if you are a tech enthusiast looking
for the latest technological innovation
then try subscribing to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon so you never miss an update on
simply learns youtube channel
let's talk about our game
since no matter how huge the globe in a
video game is it always has an end
however some games attempt to imitate an
unlimited world these games are
classified as endless runners
this 3d runner scheme is basically an
iteration of that in a typical endless
runner a game
where the player moves forward
constantly while earning points and
avoiding obstacles
the basic goal is to finish the level
without falling into or clashing with
the obstacles
still the level frequently repeats
itself indefinitely
gradually increasing the difficulty
until the player collides with an
obstacle
an example for an obstacle as you can
see in the picture is that black bar
that yellow obstacle and the purple
obstacle
now essentially to create a game like
that we will start with creating a
platform and some obstacles
then we will be writing a script to
activate those obstacles randomly
after that we will write a script to
infinitely generate that ground to
create an illusion of an endless
platform
we will also program game mechanics and
ui like score calculation score display
etc
then we will create a player object
finally we will write up a script to
control the player object
so without any further ado let's get
started and launch our unity software
let's start by creating a new project
this will be a 3d project
we'll name it
3d
runner
for the location we will choose
3d runner as
a game location
then we will hit create project
let's wait until it initializes the game
let's start by creating some folders
so we'll go here folder we'll name it
prefab
then
we will have
script
we will also be using
folder name material
and i guess that's it
if you'll need more then we will create
more
we can start by building a tile platform
that will be saved in a prefab
so we will make a game object here
so we will create empty
we will name it
a tile
prefab
we will be saving this game object in
the prefab at later
now we will
select this and create a cube inside
this
let's name this cube as platform
let's set the
reset the position for it
and let's scale it
to 8
maybe around 0.4
and then there should be around
30
on the second let's make it 20 so it
should be neat and clean when we can
work around it
now
i'll be having
six obstacles modification
but you can make as many as you need
so we will have to first make six game
object inside the tile prevent object
so we will select this
and we will create
empty
we will name it
obstacle
one
let's copy it
so that we can increase the process
then again create empty
copy paste and change the number two
let's screen first
one more
now that we have made six obstacles
let's take one by one and create
something on them
so we will create a new cube
inside this
now we will scale this cube
as
same width as the platform
and reduce its height
so let's
take the same dimensions
this is it this was around 0.4 so let's
take
something different 0.5
so it should be a little bit
bigger than the
platform and for the z let's take a
three
now this looks a little confusing
so
first
let's
bring this little bit up
and go to our material
and
let's create a material
material
let's give it a black color
so
black matte
then
let's select color
this is black
and
drop it
and this is our first obstacle
let's
name them as well so that we don't
mistake them for something else so
ospressd
dash
cube1
obstacle
1 coupon
now since our work with this obstacle is
done so we will just hide it
and we will go to the
obstacle 2 so that
we don't confuse items with different
titles
now for
this
obstacle we will need a couple of cubes
for the obstacle too
we will be leaving one free spot at the
bottom so that player is used to crouch
to avoid this obstacle
so
we will
insert a cube
let's get its height as
one then
five
eight
then
the right is two
now this
it should be easy to for us to
understand
there's still some gap
now there is not
but let's just do
a little bit
okay
then
we'll take this
and
now we will create the same duplicate of
this one
and put it
just adjusting to it
you
okay
and
now we will create a cube that will
cover this
so
we can just duplicate another one
and we'll change its dimensions
so
this one will have dimensions like
6
then y will be a little shorter so that
we have a space in the bottom
and
uh it looks fine
right now
at least for the normal eye let's add a
color so we can understand differentiate
between the
others
so let's create another material
let's give it a yellow color
i want
a little darker yellow
just look at this
now it's a little different from the
bottom
oh i can see the difference a little bit
yeah
now
settle up
you
okay
this looks fine
let's see it from all the angles from
top from bottom
there's an ample space for a ball to go
off if there would not then we will just
increase its size a little bit
let's name them as well
so these were
obstacle to part so obstacle to cube
one
and we'll name this one as we 3
now
let's remove this one
for the obstacle 3 now
now for this one we will have
we will basically have a copy of this
but there will be a hole in the middle
so the player will have an option to
either crouch or jump over it
so we will add
some cubes
cube
this
here's the cube
we will give it the dimensions of
the previous one so one
then this will get eight
this will get two
and here
yep it's all fine
we will make a copy of this obstacle
so we will duplicate it
and basically
on the other end of this
okay
now
let's have another cube
let's have a copy of this one
for the downside and we will give this
one
the scaling as
one
to decrease it and we will give
one
think a little bit
let's see what we have given for this
one
i think you can't compare this let's
increase it a little bit
you
now it looks a little
tighter and
thicker
you
okay now this one works
for this we have one high appropriate
height all right
let's give it a color as well
so we will be creating a new material
this one we will name it as
purple
matte
and let's give this some colors
purple
okay this one as it works
and now
this obstacle is also complete
let's give them name as well
so this is obstacle 3
so it will be given an obstacle 3 name
then we will have this one
we will give it obstacle 3 cube 2.
this nomenclature is important in a
sense if we have to
do some kind of debugging or
rectifying some error so we know which
cube
which cube is represent which obstacle
now for the obstacle 4
we will have a little bit
of
every obstacles so basically obstacle
four five six will be the combos made
from the obstacle one and obstacle two
so let's say for obstacle four we have
a duplicate of this
and we will add it to obstacle four
we can have another duplicate and we can
have
same in this one as well
so now let's hide this one for now
and for this one
let's name this one as obstacle 4
and cube1 and we will delete this part
now
for the combo let's take obstacle 2
first
so we will basically select each of them
we will duplicate them
and we will
pull all the duplicates and put it with
them
loop two
cube 3
and for this one we have q4
that's how we have obstacle now how will
this work so we will first select this
obstacle
and we will basically take this one here
around here
and then we will take the rest of the
cubes we'll select all three of them
together
and drag it here
so basically now this is a combo of
these two
so basically first black will come then
yellow will come
similarly
let's close this obstacle
for obstacle 5 we'll bring back this
she'll rename this one as well and give
it obstacle 5
q1
and
we will have all of the obstacle 3 part
we will duplicate it
we put it in obstacle 5.
two
three
q4
q5
now we will separate these as well
so we will send black one to here
further
and we will just select all four
different five of them and put it
let's not put it at the end so that the
next one which will come will have some
space between them
now we will close this one
and for this one this will be a bigger
one so we will
basically have these these these
we will duplicate these we'll put it
inside this
okay close this one then we will take
obstacle three these these
and we will
copy it
like duplicate it
and we will put it inside obstacle 6.
let's change the name
so obstacle 5 obstacle this will be
obstacle 6
q1
obstacle six
cube two
obstacle six
cube three
cycle 6
cube 4
obstacle 6
cube 5
obstacle 6
cube 6
and
obstacle six cube seven
now we will take this one we will put it
here
and we will take this one
and we will put it slightly here
and here
the whole cube
now let's have all the obstacles
enabled
and that's how you make obstacles
now what we will do is we will basically
select each and every obstacle one by
one
and we will change its stack to finish
this is very important because
this will basically
dictate
if these obstacles are finished
otherwise
the player will when will go right
through them
so
basically they need to be finished
three
select all of them at once
and then finish it
we'll do the same with the obstacle four
will select all of them together
and we will put a finish
cycle 5
select all of them as together
finish them
then obstacle six
we will take all of them together
and tag them as finished
we can also select all of them together
and then we can tag them as finishers
this is basically
important because to detect the
collision between them between the
player and the obstacles
if
it will not detect a collision then it
will never finish
the game
now we will need a few scripts to manage
object pooling and obstacle
activation to create infinite platform
so we'll go to our scripts
and we will create
a c-sharp script and we will name it
synth
underscore
platform
now let's go and check the code
here is the code
for object pooling and obstacle
activation
now here we will start with creating two
game object transform points start and
end these will signify where the
platform is starting and ending
now here is an obstacle array
to contain all the obstacle in the later
on
so this game object array will have all
the obstacles stored
now let's go to our first function which
is at random obstacle
basically this will be the function
which will activate all the obstacles
we will first call deactivate all
obstacles so that
from the start we don't start with an
obstacle right in front of us so that we
get a little bit of chance to start
getting warm up
then in the next line we have a random
generator so basically this is creating
a brand object and basically this random
number is generated
randomly between the length of the
object since we have six obstacles so it
will basically give random number will
get a random number between zero to five
because
obstacle array length will be from zero
to five
it will start from zero to five let's
say it select a 4 so basically obstacle
random number 4 will get activated and
that of that platform will come
this deactivate all obstacles function
will be responsible
for deactivating all the obstacles for
the first 3-4 seconds so that
the player can get warm up and play the
game
and have a fun
now
let's go back and make another script to
generate infinite platform
now let's create another script
we'll name this one
as simple
underscore
ground
now let's go and check the code for the
simple ground
generator
here we will start by creating a mean
camera
variable for the camera
another start point this will be where
we'll mark the location where ground
types will begin
then we will call tile prefab from the
platform from the other script
we have a moving speed
12 which will be the moving speed for
the
for our
platform
then
the types to respawn which will be
basically
before the platform ends how many times
it should pre-spawn it will be 15
which is basically equal to the one and
a half platform
then
how many times at the beginning should
not have obstacles this is the part
where i was saying we will have
we should have a little bit time to warm
up
then we will create a list
for the
platform for the spawn tiles
we will give next style to activate
variable as -1
at the start we will have the game over
as false and game started as false
basically our game is neither over and
neither started it
and the score will be started at zero
now we are creating here a constructor
for our simple co
ground gen script
we will go into our start function this
will be the first frame update which
will happen so basically when we press
play the first thing what will happen
will be from this entire function
so we will have a spawn position that
will be the start position so there will
be that
start pointer will be at
then we will have types with no
obstacles temporary
a temporary variable which will have
the value of tyres without obstruct
obstacles which we have like 5
then we will run a for loop
till the tiles to pre-spawn so basically
it will run for 15 seconds
15 tiles
then we will have our spawn position
keep decreasing according to tile free
prefab start location so basically tile
prefab will have its own start point
and
the camera will have its own start point
then here we are basically saying
till
this tile with no obstacle temp which
will have a value of 5
goes to 0 less than 0
it should deactivate all obstacles
or else
let's say when it goes below zero
then
it will activate the random obstacle
then the spawn position will spawn spawn
tile at the end position
and then the endless group will keep go
on
keep on going on and it will be randomly
activating a different obstacle each
time
then we will go to our update function
basically this will all happen only once
then this update function will work
this will work
once per frame so basically once this
whole function work
then it will again reiterate this
function
as long as all the conditions are
satisfied
so let's take our first one
it's saying if
the game is not over and it started
then we will move the object upward in
the word space by x unit per second
basically we will be increasing the
speed of highest the score we get
so longer we run
the more our score will be
then we have our camera which will be
running as fast as the platform is
running
so basically it will create an illusion
that the platform is still there only
the player is moving but instead it will
be the camera and the platform which
will be moving and the player will be on
the same spot
then we have game over
now game is over
or the game is not starter
it's an or function so basically there
is two position either the game is over
or the game is not started yet
so basically we are at the post date
so in this
if get key down key code speed it's an
input statement so basically it is
saying that when we will press space the
game will start
so now
when we will press space what would
happen
let's say it's a game over situation
then it will restart the game so we are
setting the scene
to active scene again so it will go back
to that start point and it will just
reload this scene
else if the game is not started yet so
that then we will game started will put
it as true
now it comes as our gui mechanics
let's say the game is over
so
it will print the text in a red color
and the label
the label is something is like a text
box where the text will be stored so we
are giving
the this width to that label
then we will be printing your game is
over and yours you scored
and after that we will just print the
score
then in the next line we will just say
that press space to start
to restart the game
now in case the game is not started then
we will another again
give the instruction in the red
and
the label
will have the same size as this
and it will say you can press space to
start the game
then we have
gui color as green
this will show this
our score
at the
top most corner
now let's go back to our game
and run few more things
now we will attach the sim platform
script to the tile prefab object
so we will drag it and put it on tile
prefab
so now if you click tile prefab
we have something called obstacle here
now we will select
we will go to tile prefab and click this
button so it will lock this screen
now we will select each of them
and we will drag it to the obstacle
so now it has all the obstacles
now we need to construct two game object
for the start point and the end point
which will be placed at the start and
end
at the end of the platform
so
we will have
an empty object
as
start
p
we will place it here
and
another object
this game object will be named s
and b
they're in the middle
let's tag them as finish as well
i think i make by mistake i've named it
tile prefab
let's end b
uh
now the
all of them are assigned
so now we will
assign the start point
start p
and end point
now we will save this style prefab
object into a prefab and remove it from
the scene
so
we will go to our
prefab folder
we'll drag the style prefab and put it
here
and we will delete this
now we will create another game object
and we will call it a simp ground
generator
so click create empty
and you'll name it
simp
ground
chain
and to this
i will attach
the sim concentrator script
then
i will change the main camera location
so
i will give it the position
as
10
one
minus nine
and the rotation
has
y as minus 55
now we will create a new game object
and we will call it start point
so
we'll create another game object
this time it will be known as
start
point
and we will give
and we will change its position
to zero
then minus two
then
minus fifteen
now
we will select the sim ground generator
object
and
in this
we will assign
main camera to this
then
start
start point
and the tile prefab
put it here
now
let's press play and watch
now
let's play space as you can see it is
giving us still some kind of issues from
the platform so what we will do is we
will again get our platform and then do
some changes
so we will just drag it here
we will delete it here
now the what could be the problem
so
usually the problem is with
either this and object it should be a
little higher
so this will be a
try and test try and test
it kind of deal
now we will go here we will give it a
and
then we will delete it
let's play it again
it's slightly work
just little bit more
so we'll close this again
we'll put it here
we will take this
point and we will just slightly increase
this
then we will delete
this
data back put it here back
delete from here
and then go to some content and put it
back here
and let's play again
now if you look at closely it is
completely smoother than before
okay
now our platform is created
our obstacles are created and they are
randomly activated as well
now we will create our player object
this will be a simple sphere which has
the ability to either jump or crouch
so let's create
a
game object and let's call it
player
object
and
we'll
have sphere inside it
let's call it
player sphere
now
i want to increase the size of this
sphere
let's increase it by 1.1 that would be
better
so it's not too small but not too bad so
that
even after crouching we have problem
let's give it a color so let's go to the
materials
let's create another material
we can have
a blue
matte
here
and remove this sphere
now let's create a script
we'll name it
simp
underscore
player
let's check this code
now here's the code
this boxed command basically says that
we will be requiring a component rigid
body for this sphere
we will give a gravity of
20f
and
a jump height of 2f
we will give
rigid body an r variable
and
grounded as false
we will have a vector default scale and
crouch as false
so in the start operation we will be
only running it once
so
basically a rigid body is given to our
object so that it follows the laws of
gravity
then in update we will give the ability
to the player
like jump and crouch
in the first if statement we are giving
the key code w as input
so
and grounded so basically the ground
that will work as
when it jumps it should always go down
and the r velocity will calculate the
score for the time it stays in the air
and goes back down
then in the case of crouch
we will have s as a key chord
to crouch
basically when we will crouch the sphere
will puncture
and slide through the gap
and when we will lose that button it
will again pre deform
then we have fixed update in this it
will always be working
whether the update for its start
function that's working or its update
function that's working so basically we
will be
applying the gravity manually for more
tuning control
void on collision stay so basically if a
collision occur then it will basically
stop
the ball
now the plot
to calculate the jump vertical speed
basically when we will jump it will
create this calculate the score for that
period of time
and
on collision enter will basically detect
all the object for which i have tagged
them as finished
as soon as they cache that it will
finish the
game
and it will print game over
now
let's go back to our game
now if you see the player object it all
already has the rigid body because we
specified that
in this
now
let's add another component to the
player object
let's add
we'll add a box collider
now we will put the sphere in front of
the camera
directly above the start point
so let's have
two views
let's make it a little simple and add
our prefab back to our screen
now that's a game screen
so
our player object is here and we want it
here
let's reset the player object and
sphere and
have the player object
it should be here
you
now this works
let's see the game view yes it's there
on the first screen
now let's delete the style fab
now finally let's add a canvas
we will
have a ui add canvas
and in this canvas
we'll have a row image
you
let's run it
and see if it's at the right side
yep it's at the right side
let's increase its size little bit more
now let's run it
here we have our scheme
let's place
space
as you can see we can go this this
we have a simple problem with the
placement of the
object
so player object
needs to be a little bit down
let's run it again
you
have a jump
shot
as you can see our game is working
flawlessly
we can do some minor changes
to rectify a little bit of bugs
from with the obstacles we need we can
decrease its size
you can let your imagination run well
and you can create more obstacles like
this
