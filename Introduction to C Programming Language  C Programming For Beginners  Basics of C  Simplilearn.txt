hey guys i am hosanya from the simply
learns team welcome to this video on a
brief introduction to c programming
language c is one of the most popular
general purpose and procedural
programming languages which also happens
to be one of the fundamentals if you
wish to learn program as most of the
programming paradigms of the latest and
most powerful languages are being
sourced from sick
more on that later without any further
delay let's get started with the agenda
for today's session
and while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
a sub to the channel would be
appreciated
all right
we will start off by understanding a bit
of the history of c language and how it
came into the id industry
next we will understand its important
and unreal the powerful capabilities of
c
advancing we will look at this
cutting-edge features that defines its
brilliance
later we will discuss some of the
popular real-world applications of c
that earned it some serious recognition
after that we will discuss some of the
advantages and disadvantages of c just
to help us with an overview of c and
learn where it stands in current i.t
then we will look at some of the popular
i.t companies and their domains that
employees see and are in constant hud
for developers and finally to get things
a little more interesting we will try to
wrap our heads around the technicalities
of c by writing up first c program
so i hope i have made myself clear with
the agenda and we are good to get
started
now let's begin with the history of the
c language
denis ritchie a computer scientist was
able to identify the gaps and tap out
the best features from both b and bcpl
languages to invent a new hybrid
hence she was born in 1972 at bell
laboratories a remarkably simple and
highly readable programming language
resulted in groundbreaking advancements
in the iit industry
it was when programmers started to reach
the saturation point due to the outdated
programming languages
programmers often face troubles with b
and b cpl the most advanced languages
served its purpose and successfully
solved the rooted in problems faced by
the major part of traditional
programming languages
sooner she started spreading its roots
into various i.t domains and spotting
with groundbreaking applications that
included graphics user interfaces and
fully functional operating systems
great we have a sound briefing on c and
its caliber
let us now understand what makes c so
powerful and would it be enough to drive
you to choose it to start building your
applications
slowly the widespread use of c started
to take over the i.t industry unraveling
the potential of c the designers began
to discover new possibilities that led
them to focus on the big picture a
complete operating system designed using
c
that's when the early windows and unix
operating systems came into existence
unix was the first ever fully functional
operating system to be completely
designed
developed and deployed using c it is one
of the most popular languages due to its
reliability and machine independence
also it owns the caliber to develop and
deploy powerful end-to-end application
level programs
google mozilla firefox and mysql are the
popular examples to name a few
another key to its success is that it
become a user-friendly and most
recommended programming language even
today c helps beginners learn and
understand computer logic and
programming fundamentals
now that we know how powerful c language
is let's move ahead and understand some
of the critical and cutting-edge
features of the c language responsible
for sea's high success
the designers at the laboratories made
sure that their programming language
solved the existing issues with b and b
cpu and the ones they had forcing the
most prominent one is the complexity of
a programming language c was developed
so that it incorporated building
functions to simplify mathematical and
logical implementations and set rules or
procedures to use them the approach made
it simple easy to understand and
implement while in a head-to-head
comparison to its forerunners it also
gives c an added advantage of platform
independence and portability
it combines the features of both high
level and low level languages resulting
in the faster execution and smoother
application development
hence she earned its patent as the first
middle level programming language
next
the whole c program can be divided into
individual and functional units it means
every individual function in the program
acts as an independent unit to perform a
specific task or an operation and is
also capable of running separately
c language comes with built-in libraries
and functions
this pre-written header file help user
borrow and run the mathematical and
logical operations directly from the
library helping them write simple and
complex programs easily and drastically
minimizing the development time
next
she follows the top-down approach to the
software development instead of classes
and objects a c program is divided into
accessible smaller units called
functions
the extendable nature of c allows
developers to add additional functions
to the c library and also it quickly
adapts to all the new features
c language contain a wide range of
built-in operators that are used for
different scenarios such as arithmetic
operator relational operator logical
operator bitwise operator and many more
lastly c introduced several memory
management functions within the standard
library header file and they take care
of allocating the allocating and
reallocating the memories in c
so i think you got a good understanding
of all the features of c
okay so let us move on to the
applications of the c language
let us look at the first application
c language is used to design operating
systems
as discussed earlier unix operating
system was the first ever operating
system designed entirely using the c
language later a wide range of android
and microsoft windows applications were
designed using c
next c is one of the most popular
languages and is widely used in
designing and developing embedded
systems for electronic gadgets also the
software burnt into the embedded systems
is developed using c
graphical user interfaces are becoming
increasingly popular in recent days
electronic equipment relays on a fully
fledged user interfaces for a better
user experience c is one of the
foundational languages to introduce a
simplified and user-friendly graphical
interface the early interfaces
incorporated a few visual and graphics
to interact with electronic devices
next
google file system was developed using
the c language as a storage platform for
generating and processing large volumes
of data
next we have mozilla firefox
mozilla firefox is one of the free and
open source web browsers coded using
early standard versions of c
c language is also widely used in
designing compilers and interpreters a
compiler translates the code from human
understandable format to byte code the
popular database mysql was also
developed using c the simplicity of c
enables mysql to perform data
manipulation task with is
now that we have some idea about the
applications of c language let's have a
look at some advantages and
disadvantages
c programming language is simple so it
is easy to understand
due to its open source nature it is
completely free resulting in almost low
or no cost
it has the fastest execution speed
because the entire c program is
translated once unlike the interpreter
which translates line by line
c language is portable because the
program written in one operating system
can compile and run on another system
with minimum compatibility issues
c library contains header files such as
standard input output function standard
utility function string handling
functions etc
it combines the features of both high
level and low level languages resulting
in the faster execution and development
so it is often called a midi level
language
let's now look at some of the
disadvantages of c language
c is a procedural language naturally the
concepts of objects and classes is not
present in c which is the major
disadvantage of the latest software
development styles
it does not support classes and objects
and c programs are divided into small
units called functions
c language can translate the entire code
in one go still it often fails to
recognize the critical runtime issues in
the compilation stage which happens to
be another potential disadvantage
and it does not have an exceptional
handling features unlike the popular
object oriented programming languages
like java python and few other languages
it lacks the features of try and catch
which is employed exclusively for
exception handling
again the c language does not have the
features of constructor and destructor
it may have memory management functions
but they must be employed manually at
the same time object oriented
programming languages like java and
python have automatic memory management
functions to take care of unused memory
they are called garbage collectors with
that let's get into the companies using
c and hiring software developers within
knowledge of c programming
and i'm sure you all are aware of the
companies so now let's have a look at
that
we have mastercard ibm flipkart dell
twitter github and twitch
the average salary of the software
developers in the united states of
america is 97
763 us dollars per annum in india the
average salary of the sea developers is
5 lakhs
okay so let me now move on to the main
part of this video your first c program
in c programming hash include is used to
direct the compiler to load the header
files in the program
stdio.h is a header file that stands for
started input output and various
functions such as printf scanf are
defined in standard input output header
files
main is a function from which every c
program execution begins
printf function is used for output so in
this program hello world is an output
backslash n is called an escape sequence
which denotes the new line character
in key takeaways i would like to point
out that
c is a simple and flexible language sees
a structural and procedural programming
language and it does not support the
concept of object oriented programming
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the introduction to c
language
i hope this session was informative and
interesting
