box and pin comment starting with the
introduction before that let's have a
little course
introduction so we'll be uh doing an
introduction to application security
what is application
security where it is used so as the name
says application security includes all
tasks that introduce a security software
development life cycle development teams
its goal is to improve security
practices and find fix and prevent
security issues within applications how
it is done why it is done that we will
learn along the journey along with
practical
examples application
security is not confined to a certain
area it's not confined to it as it seems
that it's it might be uh confined to IT
industry only but know uh you might have
heard
about attacks uh cyber security attacks
on government institutes energy and U
utilities Healthcare institutes banking
institutes so yes it impacts application
security impacts all of these
sectors how they impact we will be
seeing it while the journey is going on
our course would start with the
introduction which we are doing then the
Core Concepts what's software security
how secure software testing is done what
is cryptography a very important topic
and secure software life cycle
management skills that we'll be covering
would be web app scanning encryption
application monitoring error logging
oasp top 10 and API security the agenda
for
today web app security
application and web security all right
so what are the learning objectives for
today again the
basics Core Concepts of
security we'll be able to classify the
best
practices we will be analyzing one case
study that would be of uber we will see
what went wrong or what went good how
application web application security
would have done it better and we will
categorize the
requirements for a
foolproof security team what are the
requirements we'll be seeing it so say
if you have joined any organization as a
cyber security specialist
where would this course help
you see you you are given the following
tasks which you'll be able to do after
this
session
understand the vulnerability
stack what are vulnerabilities how
they're
classified which application is impacted
where to see which
vulnerabilities uh where on the net they
are visible is is there any database for
vulnerabilities how many of the these
are there what about the vulnerabilities
which were there in the history can we
find them we will be able to
understand the
organizations security
policy so whatever organization you are
working in currently you will be able to
understand their security
policy then you'll be able to to
review the core security
requirements whenever we talk about any
software so we talk about a
software we know it is something that we
use in our daily to day-to-day life
uh it is a firmware with which we access
applications what is secure software now
the same software of same application is
secured by means
of following attributes which
attributes
reliability
resiliency
recoverability when I talk about
reliability as the name says that is the
software dependable
it fulfills the purpose for which it was
created for example if I talk about
social uh networking sites the social
networking softwares so we know we at
once our mind will answer okay you are
talking about soft uh social connection
softwares so it's either WhatsApp
Facebook Instagram so these companies or
these softwares
have made a
reliability mind set up so whenever we
talk about social engineering these
softwares would revolve in our
mind when we talk about
resiliency resiliency mean
means that the software does not violate
any security
policy
so it's able to withstand the actions of
threat agents resiliency means
I downloaded the software today and
tomorrow it's demanding
ransomware to use my files are encrypted
it's saying that you cannot move forward
from this point so resiliency should be
there it does not violate
[Music]
any any security
policy r reliability was the software is
Dependable
recoverability as the name says so if I
remove any of the application from my
phone uh I have some restore point or
backup point from where I will get the
entire thing
back in same setup without any loss of
data
so software is able
to restore
operations when you buy a new
phone you simply have to login into your
ID which is Major it is if it is Android
you have to use your Gmail ID and entire
backup of applications from your
previous phone to your new phone it Clon
it so that talks about the
recoverability after software or secure
software we talk about web
applications what are web
applications these are nothing but
software programs that run on web
browsers if I open uh say any website
simply
learned what is this
this is a web application which is
running in my browser so anything any
application or any software which runs
on browser which runs on web is web
application talking about the flow let's
talk
about the flow how the data
flows I'll be using
different symbols
here so let's
say this is my database
server or I call it
DB this is my application
server this one is the web server
so all these things combined together
they work in background so these would
be the backend
thing all three of these
are
backend when I talk about the
applications if I seeing this so this
all is in front
end because it's directly on UI on which
I interacting with
it so front end would
be this would be
my web
browser and the system on which it is
running laptop or
mobile whatever device it
is so I I won't be using Cloud here but
yes this is front
end how would be the flow move my
database server will
fetch the address I searched for simply
learn application server will respond
that yes this is simply learn
application it
will the application server will respond
and the web server will then be showing
this to web browser
so now simply learn is visible on web
browser and
that is reflected on
my device which is either laptop or
mobile and this thing is front end so
just an overview how web applications
work which main components are in action
starting from database server in which
entire uh applications
entire simply learn things are hosted
application server on which the
application is
hosted web
server responding on web browser to your
laptop or
mobile application vulnerability
stack if we talk about
application vulnerability stack or AVS
as the name
says it will talk about
application irrespective it is web
application mobile
application Cloud
application any vulnerability that is
impact impacting this
application would be a part of
application vulnerability
stack so when you talk about
vulnerability what is
vulnerability anyone want to answer it
uh I won't be judging over it but yes uh
just to see how many of
you can answer what is a
vulnerability if I say uh any
application say if I say I won't be
naming any other application if I say
simply learn application is having some
vulnerability what does that
means does mobile app also require web
server in the back
end how is web server different from web
browser all right so I'll firstly answer
these two questions from vhan and VV so
Wan says how is web server different
from web browser ban web server is on
which the application is hosted which is
in the back end from where my web
browser which is Chrome it is fetching
that detail from some web browser on
which simply learn is hosted
so answering your question web browser
is
either
Chrome uh the one which is obsolete
Internet Explorer which is now not used
in its place we
have Microsoft
Explorer
Firefox so Opera Mini
so all these are web browsers
while web servers
are
Apache Apache web server we have some
web servers from Oracle Microsoft has
its own web servers Google has its web
servers AWS has its web
servers so that's the difference between
web server and web
browser does mobile app also require web
server in the back end uh vuv yes the
answer is if because you also use web
browsers on your mobiles so if you are
using uh browser say you want to see
your report card and you want to access
uh the website of your University or
college if you are using your mobile
browser you again are accessing
their web server in the back
end pradep says
web application and website what is the
major difference uh both of them work on
www
so web site and web application both
works on our
browser in Android Studio we use web
view which is like a server uh that's
true
veran vulnerability is the thing which
happens integrity and availability for
data so that that shows that uh you have
been good in the module one because
that's from where you are answering it
that's
good all right answer to this in two
different scenarios one scenario the one
I discussed uh where you are using
mobile application say which is mobile
Chrome which is Chrome or Firefox inside
your mobile now it is the mobile
application it runs on web servers
uh Edge again these are mobile
applications and they do have OBS
servers on which they will show you the
answers because they are browsers so yes
they have servers in the background
talking about other applications uh
although this answers your
question google.com is a
website yes yes it uh Google ultimately
uses servers database server google.com
when you search so searching here
although it is my default page but yes
google.com it is talking to its server
in the back
end and showing me this page so this
page is web page of Google or website of
Google so now you got your answer web
application would be if you're using
that Google application in your phone
that's the
application while anything which you see
on web browser is a website web app
server mobile app server do they run on
same server that depends upon company to
company if I'm having a big company like
Google or Microsoft I'll have different
servers so that if my web app is down my
mobile app is running it doesn't impact
it while uh if I'm a uh small cap
company or medium cap company I might
have both on same physical server or
same Cloud Server so I might use AWS
with different instances running for
mobile and web app or I might have even
if I'm smaller than that with low budget
I be having single physical server with
both of them running on it so depending
upon the budget I'm we were talking
about
stack when we talk about stack let's
start from the network
part when we talk about networks what
are the things that are under
attack we either talk about routers or
firewalls when we talk about operating
systems and these all are the things
that you need to know to be successful
in cyber security domain knowledge of
each one of
these applications would either
be either be open
source or licensed which are
commercial
database when you talk about DB there
are certain database that run in the
background
we have
Oracle
MySQL
[Music]
db2 and so on the list goes on but these
are the major on which the attacks are
targeted what are the
components web
server either aache
Microsoft
IAS custom web
application what issues do we see in
custom web applications this generally
happens when uh there is an application
already placed there uh there's a mark
uh application working and its source
code is available uh say in
gitlab so when you talk about it's
source code is there in gitlab you try
to customize it according to your wish
say Uber uh is there already placed in
gitlab the code is there I make some
changes according to my requirement
and uh generate a new taxi application
with some name say my name is herit so
let Let It Be harprit cabs or blue cabs
Yellow Cabs whatever
so I'm
using Code which is already there but
now I have made it customized according
to my
needs we can have business logic
flows
or we can have technical vulnerabilities
if I'm not into uh security thing I
might change something which could
induce a vulnerability in that
application in that customized
application not the original one because
I'm now playing with it so I might
induce some technical vulnerability in
it with with the changes I'm trying to
do but again that that depends upon what
kind of service you are taking from the
cloud provider if the security is
managed by them then you don't have to
fear anything if anything happens your
data is lost the cloud providers would
compensate you but that typically never
happens does web scrapping comes
into scrapping comes into this issue as
we try to extract info without
permission of the company uh if you
notice uh when I'm trying to answer your
questions I'm revolving in around simply
learn only due to same uh thing what
you're trying to question veran uh yes
uh when you try to say even even when we
will be
attacking uh websites it would be mostly
simply learn only because we won't be
attacking any other website of any other
company that could lead us in trouble or
jail so yes that's a very good question
if you try to fingerprint we call it
fingerprinting or
footprinting uh when you try to collect
data of any website or any company
through these means their sock team
their security team would come to know
that something is something fish is
happening and yes that might lead you in
trouble so permission of company is
necessary in most of the
cases all right
next point
is single page
applications as the name
says applications which run on a single
page they they are called single page
applications how they
work
uh say it's it's a design approach that
generates web pages dynamically with new
data from the web server instead of
loading entire new
pages
so every time you open single page
application that it autog generates the
data from web server and it uh
doesn't always go back to web server for
fresh linkages uh which could impact in
its loading so for faster loading Spa
generally uses ax to exchange data with
the server and JavaScript to manipulate
the elements on the existing
page so what does it use Spa
uses Ed
X why to
exchange
data with server
what else
is
used
JavaScript to
manipulate the
objects now uh how can I know
that what elements are there on any
website so let me show
you
so talking about single page application
this is simply learn I want to know uh
what things what are the back end things
working on this page I either I go to
inspect element
and uh use inspect element to go one by
one or I use some
bookmarks The Bookmark I will be using
would be Vaper and
Shan talking about
weizer it shows
that simply learn is using Microsoft
advertising for performance priority H
for marketing automation they using web
engage sales
Loft Amazon Cloud front is the WF which
is
CDN personal personalization is done on
web engage version
six so they're using pass platform as a
service so simply learn is hosted on web
application uh Amazon web services now
you know from
where it's fetching the data from the
analytics they using Facebook pixel
Google analytics Microsoft
Clarity loadable components
jQuery
cryptojs so these are the Javas
JavaScript
libraries if you want more click on more
info I guess it would be paid yes it's
paid you can export this entire
information if you want you can use same
thing for other
application the other application or
extension that I'll be using is
Shodan it
shows so I didn't know the IP address
from weizer so Shodan showed me that
okay this is
the IP address of Simply
learn it's on cloud we know that it is
AWS open ports are 80 and 443 uh in
network you will be I'm not YES Network
you have already done Enterprise
infrastructure so you know open ports 0
is for HTTP 443 is for
https so you can view IP details view
domain
details moving ahead it will show you
more details I'm not sure if it is paid
now no it is
not so it's on
Amazon it's the
ISP using Cloud
front Port 8 which is HTTP https
so these datas you can get from some
exential if you are good at coding that
is always a plus point because uh in web
application security there are two types
of testing one is static analysis and
the other is dynamic
analysis when we are doing static
analysis static analysis is is nothing
but source code review you review the
codes for that you should be good in
coding while if you're doing Dynamic
testing that means websites in motion
for those you you just need know how of
coding and not the entire code structure
so better if you are
having uh Java or python
knowledge if don't know coding that much
if you are a fresher then you can learn
it by heart that would help you uh in
long run but if uh your job your current
job doesn't require it so you may even
not go along with it I'm currently okay
you are in network site so I started uh
with networks
only uh I started with networks then uh
wireless networks data networks wireless
networks and now I inan cyber security
it it doesn't necessarily require you to
know the
website uh the programming but yes it
could help
you all right brief on it okay so edx is
a it is a set of web development
techniques uh when I'm using edx on my
client site on my system it get used to
create asynchronous web applications so
we can send and receive data from server
without interfering with the display and
behavior of existing page even though uh
this is working on your uh we are using
the chat within this application it is
not impacting any other functionality
while we are doing this session so this
is ax we are using Ajax it is just
utilizing a bit of the entire thing
without impacting anything that Dynamic
thing is called
ax so it is not changing behavior of the
existing page but we are still able to
check any example of spa if
possible
single uh this one example is the zoom
learning that we are doing uh we are
using meeting chat without without
impacting any other thing in simply
learn uh this application is again Spa
when I search anything random it will
provide me the answer although I know
harprit is nowhere inside it it will
just throw an error without impacting
anything else on the
page so your search did not match any
content it take it took a second or so
so without impacting this it's Spa using
Ajax after single page
application all right let's talk more
about a bit more
about how single page application works
let's
[Music]
see I don't want to save it all
right so
again this is my browser
this is my
server this is my
application this is the
response so my browser will send a
request what it is doing it is sending a
request server will respond
with st ml
file then okay this is in response to
your request let this the
file now the application sends an aex
request to fetch data from the
server just keep
correlating you open your Google Chrome
you searched for see simply
learn server provid added HTML file at
first then the
application
sends ax
request why it is sent to fetch data
from the server so now it is just
sending ax so that additional data from
server is requested without any impact
on this page which is already showing on
browser the final step would
be web page is
updated
using Json data so Json data is received
which is then updated on
your web browser so this is how it is
functioning in the background
of a single page
application is payment system with UPA
also Spa because once we reach to
payment page then it sends a request to
UPA and keeps polling if we have made
the payment or
not
so
uh there's another thing running in UPI
systems because there it works
uh two ways once it is uh interacting
with a server which checks that if
payment is made another it is
interacting with the server which checks
if you have provided the proper mpin or
OTP third it is interacting with your
bank from which the payment has been
made so it's a little different uh it's
not entirely Spa but a combination of
Spas at three different levels
all these three levels that I talked is
server and application gentic running on
same system or different is server and
application generating edx running on
same system are different since I'm
using this web
browser simply learn wants to talk with
me but I don't so if I'm
using this website on my local machine
that means ax is running on this client
system so this answers your question
that ax works on the same system on
which the web browser or web app is
running Json how it works
Json is a message that
you get say if you
are all right so if any response you are
getting in Json format you can simply
use uh Json
viewer uh I don't have Json sample
currently but let me see if I can get it
from
somewhere okay so
say if this is the Json data that we are
getting simply use it in viewer
it will show you data in this format in
tabular format that okay the employee
name is this salary is this and it's he
or she is married so this was the
code Jason we were simplified it in a
tabular
form so if this helps you in your daily
work what are the most common commonly
used Frameworks for developing Spas so
all the these Frameworks that we are
talking you might have heard about it
especially if someone of you is a
developer
reactjs which is
Javascript view
[Music]
JS Angular
JS so all these Frameworks are used for
developing spas
because Spa is a frontend technology
there therefore all these are the front
end utilities that we are
using so all right uh give me if you
could just to check kindly provide me
example of spa uh in your from your
daily
life from your daily
life provide me an example of
spa very easy even if
[Music]
you that that's that's the uh that's the
definition of spa but uh provide an
example all right one example is
Facebook you edit change anything you
see videos but it
doesn't change the basic
functioning what
else share prices display if it is a
good application then yes
okay otherwise if it is lagging then it
is not
ASP Gmail right Google Drive Right
WhatsApp WhatsApp
web okay the answer Twitter
perfect the answer which I am searching
for
SharePoint okay all right can say
because real time changes are there okay
perfect the answer which I wanted
to Google
Maps uh no because we are not changing
anything over
it uh
okay uh the answer which I was expecting
from you
people OT platform which is
Netflix yes venkatesh uh location can be
changed d dynamically but during that
time uh once your location start and
stop is set it doesn't have
to fetch anything uh anything new uh
since you are connecting to internet so
that's that's what it requires that's
the ultimate thing it
requires talking about otd
platform uh yes Gio uh Netflix Amazon
Prime all these
hundreds of people if if there's a match
of Indian cricket team uh hot star yes
so it CS load of a billion people
billion devices connecting to it and
still it is working without going down
or showing any symptoms of uh of
disconnection so that's that's where
Spas come into existence you are even uh
some someone who is not keen into uh
cricket they are working they are
watching some other thing over the same
application which might uh have some
different load level so cing to
different loads at same typ of YouTube
yes so all these are
SP all right one question I saw
currently is what is the difference
between single page and multi-page
applications
uh okay badri says Shan shows TLS 1.2
for security is this not a risk the
latest is 1.3 very good question uh
badri but uh sometimes it's the
compatibility issues
say the company in which I am currently
working they are also using TLS 1.2
because maximum of the infra inside the
company they support TLS 1.2 they
haven't shifted to 1. . 3 due to
compatibility issues of support so
that's why some companies are still
working on DLS 1.2 rather than 1.3 but
yes they do have the security team
working behind keep check which is
checking it regularly that nothing of
that sort happen uh any vulnerability
which is there for 1.2 they're not
exploited by
anyone uh was uh that is also secure but
every version every latest version is
more secure than the earlier one DLS 1.1
transformed into 1.2 due to more
security the version 1.3 is more secure
but it's not very compatible to the
infrastructures
yet 1.2 is widely used so chanit the
answer Sunil attempted the answer and it
he is pretty much right single page
application will interact for any new
changes from the web server it will not
uh load the entire page again and again
while multi-page applications
will for any change they will reload the
entire application so they are more slow
than single page
applications if that
answers yes uh badri answered that also
it is new page every time to the user
actions CRM is multi-age application
true I guess this uh you are talking
about the sap CRM
right are we having hybrid uh where
where
uh where are we having hybrid I I mean
I'm not getting the question Yahoo Gmail
is single
page they do not reload on receiving a
new mail they just keep new mail updated
I mean both spa and
MPA if people prefer multipage
application uh they are uh preferred
while using heavy applications so for
Spas are preferred for heavy
applications just as we discussed about
the OT things again the budget thing if
you don't have much budget you use
multipage application MPA example would
be anything uh say I'm not sure how many
of you have used medium which is a blog
site technical blog site so if you talk
about medium it is MPA any blog any
e-commerce website which is Amazon
Flipkart
which goes to a new page if you go to
Amazon regular it is one page go to
Amazon Fresh yes Sr answered Z SGI these
are all mpas
Wikipedia is MP a very nice example of
it are we having hybrid solution between
single page and multi-page applications
uh no
no uh no issues B
uh uh if an application is Spa it is
completely Spa if an application is MPA
it is completely MPA we cannot have a
part of it as SP and a part of MPA
because that part itself is divided into
multiple pages so if it is MP it is
completely MP if it is sp completely
SP all right just one question which one
is faster spa
or soan that is sp sp no doubt about
it Amazon Prime and Amazon mini all of
them are
SP so you all know Spa is
faster okay we know that the advantages
of using Spa is it is paid most of
resources loaded only
once uh data is preserved we require
less data what are the disadvantages of
using
sbaa uh whenever you click on that minv
thing it will redirect you to Spa rather
than the mpa part what about desktop
application which
application we we are talked about spa
and uh MPA already which application
which desktop application you are
talking about
again that depends which application
you're using if you're using anun uh if
you're using team viewer those are those
come
under mpas if you are using Netflix uh
application desktop application then
again it's
Spa navigation is maybe the issue with
spa or uh no okay what in navigation you
are not exact on the point but yes near
about
loading uh akib it it is faster so
loading is not an issue for SP loading
is an issue for mpa what are the
disadvantages of using Spa
applications since it is faster in
execution which do you think is more
prone to attacks is it SP or MPA no
there are dis advantages answer Sunil
has
already answered it so
the there are kind of attacks uh
injection attacks xss attacks which
we'll be seeing in uh
further uh Wes it is it is not the exact
thing but yes while while navigation
while in uh the data is in transit
there's there's scope of attacks because
uh not the entire thing is reloading not
the entire data is being feted but only
uh the data which is being transmitted
can be manipulated by
attackers they can simply inject
malicious scripts into
it so there was uh there
was there was recent attack which was
called that was a vulnerability in
JavaScript Java which is called log 4J
if anyone of you remember that
4G this was a vulnerability
which was there in every Java it was a
zero day
vulnerability every Java logging
framework was having it so whenever we
talk about vulnerability and it it
attacked any and every
application which was working on
JavaScript so this is one of
the
uh example
where how it got vulnerable
how it got vulnerable okay uh long story
short
uh Javas script was
having some a single line in the code
which was talking about the logging
thing a little change in
that line or that code or that script
made it vulnerable to changes in entire
Globe wherever Java was being used
uh so that resulted in this
vulnerability which was already present
there but was never
exploited next is
microservices when we talk about
microservices
so microservices are shorter Services
which are running inside bigger Services
it is an approach in which a single
application is composed of many Loosely
coupled independents services so
microservices emerged to address the
limitations of Monolithic architectures
which we will initially using such as
scalability flexibility
productivity to answer all those
things we got the concept of
microservices so what are the advantages
of microservices when a single code is
divided into multiple shorter codes so
updating the codes is more easy now
updating is
easier what
else scaling can be
done of each unit
independently what else fault
isolation if a part or a unit is in
fault it will not impact the entire uh
structure one point which I want to see
say updating is easier scaling can be
done independently fold
isolation what else okay I will give you
a
hint since these are different
units okay I'll just uh ask in yes or no
since these are in different units can
we use multiple programs in it multiple
Pro programming languages
so the answer
is
yes so basic and most advantageous thing
of microservices we can use different
programming languages defining different
structures different components
structures what do you think about
disadvantages hetrogeneous language that
is good yes that's the
answer uh chanj did you get the answer
now why it is
yes all right so think
about uh brainstorm on the disadvantages
what are the disadvantages the answer
lies here only
so the disadvantage number one
is disadvantage number one which you can
feel if you're using different languages
in a set would yes so the answer
is complex
structure complex or complicated we can
say what else what will this turn
into so if we talk
about Sunil badri
harjinder all of them they are pointing
to one thing which
says testing can become
complicated so when you have made a
complex or complicated structure and QA
has to test it then they have to test it
for different languages different things
different
services
so now let's let's talk about a case
study uh case study of
uber we are talking about Uber uh the
dexi application of course so Uber like
other startups it created monolithic
architecture for its
application but it forgot to include
scalability and stability in its
software uh I guess because it didn't
know it would be very popular worldwide
so it missed that scal scalability
part so it
used monolithic
structure when I talk about monolithic
structure what is what it is it is a
single TI application that compiles all
components all components in a single
program that means it was not working on
microservices all components were on in
a single
program what are those
components what were those
components client side user
interface server side business
logic Integrations
data access
layer so all of these components were
now in a single program rather than
running on a different services so that
made the application very
heavy and it now started making problems
for
Uber so for why because for even a Short
Change uh in the application they had to
go through the entire program see where
that particular function is change it
and failure of one
program failure of one
component could bring
down
entire system
so as the
services
increased it became very difficult for
Uber to
sustain that's when they shifted from
single program monolithic structure to
microservices so now when they shifted
to
microservices the load was less because
now it was
decentralized every unit was
independently functioning without
impacting the
other so now because they were
independent dependency on other features
was removed and from that from that
phase onwards Uber benefited by shifting
its architecture from monolithic to
microservices and that was a Learning
lesson for other uh applications which
were their competitions in Global
Market so talking about security
policy as the name says security policy
is an overall general statement produced
by Senior Management that dictates
security within the
organization so what is it what it
is an
aggregate of directives
regulations
[Music]
rules
practices all of these are aggregated
that prescribes how an organization
manages protects and distributes the
information manages
protects and
distribute the information for any
company you are currently working in
they have their own set of
policies some says you cannot plug in
USB uh in your
laptops some says you can plug in but it
won't
work some says no media connection is
allowed be at your own phone to the
laptop because you can steal the
information so this is uh how
different companies frame different
policies based upon their sense of
security how are these uh how to
make flowchart here let's see
okay what are the how can we divide it
into strategy I and tactical let's
see so
we start
with
laws
directives and
regulations followed
by the
policies followed by they call it
mandatory standard
s these are further followed
by detailed
[Music]
procedures
recommended guidelines
and base
lines top they follow top to bottom
bottom
approach
so till here
it's all
strategic and this
part this part is
strategic that means the core or VIPs
they make these things ciso CTO
CDO they sit together to make laws
directives and
regulations
policies while the mandatory standards
deta procedures these
are tactics
based so when we called about tactic
based that means the Tactical Team which
is there to see on mandatory
standards the guidelines and baselines
they are responsible for these parts the
lower
one talking about standards all right
talking about standards
standards are nothing
just okay I'll just write it here
only when you talk about
standards standards
are mandatory
activities
actions or rules
designed
to
support higher level
policies so standards are
basically designed to support these
higher level laws directives regulations
and security
policies they are very
specific technical they include
specifications for what Hardware you'll
be using what softwares you will be
using examples of standards that we talk
about in uh cyber security
is
aasp
mid these are the standards that we look
after when we talk
about s security so aasp MIT sence 25
these are the
standards talking about procedures what
is the difference between standard and
[Music]
procedure it's generally called sop if
you hear about sop it is they are not
talking about the source or anything
else it
is standard operating
procedure
standard operating
procedure what it is it is a detailed
step byep sequence of activities that
are necessary to perform a specific
security task
if someone some of you are working in
endpoint
security then you know that there's
certain procedure with which you check
for uh the endpoint
security uh so we have Network guys here
so there are procedures with which you
check for firewall rules there are
procedures with which you check for the
routing table
there are procedures with which you
change the routes if you are given that
access you cannot just go and change the
routes uh without opening a change so
first it will go to gap which is change
management board and then if it is
approved then you can change the
routes so that's the soap or procedures
or standard
operating procedure that we call it
procedures are at a lower level than
standards so
standards are at a higher level than
procedures as we can see in this flow
diagram so answer procedures and
policies are Dash are
they uh
policies and procedures are Dash option
a option A
is
unimportant option b
is
mandatory option C
is casual
option D
is none of these
so talking about
guidelines what are guidelines you know
what is procedure what is standards so
these are important when you set in
interview
for these are more of information
security things rather than cyber
security things they ask you for
standards procedure guideline what are
the differences
in
guidelines you
have guidelines as the name says they
are just recommendations they
are the recommendations
on on
how standards and
Baseline are implemented
oops so guidelines are the
recommendations on how standards and
baselines
are
implemented so that's
why uh guidelines are at the lowest end
because it doesn't talk about something
very necessary or
immediate what does it talk about
guidelines talk about
of different
levels
let's talk from the base which says why
we are doing
it what are we doing when we talk about
why it is defined in
policy when we say what are we doing
those are defined by
standards how are we doing it
that is done by
procedures and guidelines are just for
your information FYI
is guidelines or
recommendations see how we develop
a security policy where can we get uh an
idea from where we
can make a security
policy so let's
see let's do a short
activity
so we can have a Little Help from
a tool uh a web browser only so what we
are going to do we are going to develop
an application security policy uh using
a template from where we are going to
get the
template we are going to get that
template from
sans.org
which template okay it's free policy
templates is already there
so we need to have information security
policy so just click on
it home security policy
project so which policy do we need
we are talking about application
security so let's go to application
security we have web application
security policies you can download as
PDF or doc but since uh we will be
making changes according to our company
company name and all I will download
doc so it is getting
downloaded you can do it
sideways so let's do it together
so once you have done
it simply open it from the downloads web
application security
policy so you see
it the entire
policy you can remove the things you
don't
want so web application security policy
change the company name your company
name change it
here wherever it is company name just
filter it out you can remove the footer
header and Footers as per your
requirement so it will talk about
everything if any new or major
application is released third party or
acquired web application patch releases
emergency releases annual
review how we uh Define the sity which
are the high sity medium sity low sity
issues the standards that we are using
is
aasp so here you will just whatever
tools you are using just mention it here
you're using Color Linux as operating
system any other tool that you're using
mention it here blance policy is
here so you see standards policy and
processes here testing guide is
provided change these dates according
to how you want it responsible would be
your security
team just make summary of change what
have you changed is it
application uh
updation or anything related to it so
this is from where you can make your own
web application security
policy sans.org
so once you move to sans.org
I'll just share
this all right OAS is the standard that
we used
is the standard that we used for uh
taking care of the vulnerabilities in
our domain when we talk about a wasp
aasp has top 10 vulnerabilities which
keep on changing every four years so
latest one was in
2021 so this is our top
10 for for 2021 it was so I told you it
changes every four years so before 2021
it was 2017 before 2017 it was 2013 so
when we talk about top 10 it says what
are the most impacted vulnerabilities in
any web application we talk about
initially it was injection which was
mostly uh impacting any web application
now it is at number three now the most
impacted is broken Access Control
cryptographic failures is number
two insecure design is number four and
so
on I guess you people have done it in uh
Enterprise the first module that you had
covered with the other trainer I guess
it was part of that module not
sure so our next topic is
what's
secure
software
requirements when we talk about uh core
security requirements what are the core
security requirements with which your
training
started what are those three
requirements which should be there in
any case what are those
Triads so the core software requirements
are CIA
exactly it
says
[Music]
confidentiality
Integrity
availability so uh everything in cyber
security or information security
revolves around these core
values for
confidentiality uh okay apart from these
three there are three
extra
uh add-ons which says
authentication we call it AAA
authentication accounting
and
authorization when you talk
about
confidentiality that
means any sensitive data should be
protected at any cost
so sens
data should be
protected how we protected by using some
encryption
mechanisms we mask passwords other
sensitive information we we mask it we
do not store passwords or sensitive keys
in clear text we have key pass or
something like those type of tools where
we uh save
sensitive data like
passwords we use TLS to protect against
attacks just we had a short discussion
about DLS 1.2 and 1.3 they are just the
security measures we do not store any
sensitive information in log files
because it's easily visible the logs are
very easily
accessible when we talk about integrity
Integrity says okay as a person when we
talk of in lame language in Integrity is
your actions should match your words
that's that's how you say how integral a
person
is and cyber security that means any
data any data that was actually intended
to be
sent any data that was actually intended
to be
send from client
side to the server
side should be intact free of errors and
send as it
is so if my
client had to
send ABC that two in caps the receiver
should receive ABC that two in same
format in
caps and not uh some
other content which is unrelated XYZ or
something like
that should not be
so in other words all user inputs must
be validated for malicious or disallowed
content before
processing all published software should
provide a computed digital signature to
validate its correctness and
completeness so let's add that
requirement here digital signatures
so digital signatures are tested to
check if the content to be delivered is
integral and it is not uh it is not
amended on the
way when we talk about
availability availability
says it should be available 24 cross
7 so the software must meet all the
requirements of the SLA of 59 that means
should be available
at
99.99999% of the time these are the slas
that most companies uh adhere
to if I'm providing a service to any
other company so I would say that my
service availability would
be up with the
0.1% downtime so that's the availability
that I'm ensuring to my
client the software must be able to
support up to 300 users at any point
and point of time it should not be the
case as the load increases my
application is crumbling so availability
is availability also defines that
application do not crumbles under the
load what else should be under
availability what do you think should be
under the
availability one is
restoration as early as possible if it
is a P1 or high priority issue the
restoration should be within 1 hour of
the
disruption the last point
is no adulteration no modification
allowed during transition that is true
Disaster Recovery how do you do it how
how is disaster recovery
done you are very near to it but
backups what's the other name uh okay
backups
is uh if you are getting impacted and
you have some backup what during the
attack
snapshots okay a little far away but all
right one
word run more than multiple side what is
the one word for it fail
over so STI has answered it we call it
either failover or
redundancy yes uh that's that's that
only Network guy will understand badri
yes High availability
that's uh failover or redundancy would
be the uh main cost say if I'm having
two routers one of them fails I still
have the other router of some other
company working for me so that ensures
the availability of
services in case BT goes down airel is
still working tataa goes down BT is
still working
so that's where redundancy comes into
place moving forward
authentication all right what do you
understand by
[Music]
authentication it
says only authorized
persons would be
allowed
uh I have
some endpoint security for
for my
company if I want uh some third party to
use it only those some other person from
other company to use it for any reason
it should be my responsibility and only
that person who it is who who it belongs
to the credentials for which the
credentials are created only he's
allowed to use it again using MFA
multiactor authentication so that
provides the authentication
part for external users I'm talking
about MFA for internal users it could be
single sign on because we know that they
are using the company's domain if I'm
using at theat simply learn.com I able
to use engage X and learning learn
simply learn both with single sign
on authorization
says all right you have to be very very
clear the difference between what is the
authentication and authorization talking
about
authorization
uh only users with admin roles will have
permissions to execute
operations so authorization means the
level of access you are
having authentication means if you are
allowed to do it
authenticator users will have read and
write permissions that regular
users because they are allowed
authorized would be having the maximum
scope of
xes if we talk about
accounting so I saw someone talking
about
non-repudiation that comes under
accounting part why I made a change uh
in some server or some route in routers
or some firewall uh rule I made a change
and then I'm denying it I haven't done
it so accounting says we will simply
check the logs it will show the username
of the person who has made the changes
and thus supporting
non
reputation I cannot deny that I have not
done it because logs are showing
it so accounting is nothing
but
logs and what does log show it shows
identity what action you have taken on
which object you have taken the action
what is the time
stamp next part we will be discussing
about General
Security
requirements so the General Security
requirements
are session management we don't want our
session to be hijacked
nor we want it to get compromised in
between we are doing our
work errors and exception
management
config
parameters management
so when we talk about session
management so session management says
AAA
protocols summary on AAA protocols
sure so you you
have
AAA this one is
good best is
Wikipedia I was at session management
when we talk about session management
requirements it says each user activity
must be uniquely
dragged so if I doing something I'm
being traged
what I'm doing in what application say
if I'm using identity access management
then again it is tracked what I'm doing
in there if I'm using p which is
privilege access management what I'm
doing there there is being
tracked the user should not be needed to
provide their credentials once
authenticated so if I'm once
authenticated it would be very
irritating if they if uh it's asking for
credential again and again user session
must be explicitly invalidated when user
logs off or closes closes the
browser so if I talk about uh when
you use your mobile applications or web
app for banking
requirements even if you click on the
back button or refresh button by mistake
you have to relog in again and again
again so that's best of session
management thing I have seen where you
have to relog in again if
you want to take any
action which reloads the page so that's
a security thing which safeguards you
from any mm man in the middle attack
session identifiers used to identify
session must not be easily guessable not
been clear text so whatever cookies that
are being sent from your system they
should not be in clear text no one no
one if someone is using men in the
middle tools like BB Suite they should
not be able to see what data you are uh
you are transacting with your banking
website in clear
text error and exception management uh
so all the exception must be explicitly
handled using blogs error messages
displayed to the end user will reveal
only the needed
information security exception must be
audited and monitored uh why we are
doing error and exception
management when we will be talking about
the SQL injection attacks uh we were
talking about from where we will
know uh that the back end is an SQL
Server so the error that we are we would
be getting it would be showing that all
right uh SQL syntax error nothing found
in the DB something of that so something
of that sort you'll be getting so that
shows me that okay first thing that it's
an SQL syntax error that means the
database is SQL all my attacks now would
be SQL based there are certain payloads
uh which use SQ
attacks uh injection attacks Boolean
algebra and all we will be uh learning
about it in our main course
so that provides
me a hint that SQL is running in the
background so I will just move to as a
blue teamer as a defense teamer I will
move to
the programmer or developer and ask him
to not show this exception or this error
that we have SQL running in the
background so attemp SQL injection right
away so I will ask him to remove that
error by any means it should not be
visible on the
UI so that's how error and exception
management is
done when we talk about config
parameters management the configuration
file or web application such as database
connections they should be encrypted to
prevent unauthorized disclosure so
sometimes uh some files the config files
for web
apps are open in plain text rather than
encrypted or even some passwords are
hardcoded in this software code that it
cannot uh this this was one of the
recent example I uh came forward while
doing source code evaluation that
username password was hard coded in the
code itself so
that uh any attacker would have this as
a cherry on the cake that just open the
source code you have your username
password there only just use them loging
into the system and do whatever you
want all initialization and disposal of
global varibles should be carefully
monitored so wherever you are declaring
Global variables in the code you should
be very carefully declare those because
those could be called from anywhere in
the
code operational security
requirements
so operational security
requirements most critical flaw that can
impact any business or brand must be
addressed immediately
whenever okay what is the environment in
which uh we test the web apps before
deploying them on
prod what is that environment
called
uad testing environment or simulated
environment staging environment
sandbox yeah uh correct
sandbox so any flaw that can impact the
business and the brand must be addressed
immediately after thoroughly testing in
simulated or testing environment all
security incidents must be handled
following an incident management process
root cause of the incident must be
identified I'm not sure how many of you
have worked on root cause analysis so if
there is any incident uh either in cyber
security or networks or whatever domain
generally the stakeholders demand
for RCA root cause analysis so that
includes every step from the very start
to the very end how it was discovered
what steps were taken how it got missed
what are the Improvement
plans so these things are a part of
operational security
operational
security so what are
the requirements in deployment
environment we have talked about the
testing environment or
uat or sandbox what are the requirements
in deployment environment
first of
all in deployment environment I will
[Music]
check if software is deployed
on
internet
externet or
Internet Internet is which can be
accessed from anywhere interet is your
company Network inside your company's
intranet Extranet is governed by the
firewall determine if the software will
be hosted in
DMZ what is
DMZ
if the
software is hosted in
DMC and which ports are
available which ports are open or
available DMZ is nothing but
demilitarized
zone very important de
mized very important word and when you
are part of infra team you must know
what is
DMZ so talking about
DMZ just to check if we are having any
questions D militarized Zone yes but
what it
is
say all
right say this is the
internet this is the internet flowing to
your
company here it's a
firewall all right let it be a router
first it's a
router then a connection to
firewall although I guess DMZ was
also uh discussed should have been been
discussed in the infrastructure part but
again
I'll share it with you what DMZ is
because it is an important term
so anything between the internet which
is your
ISP anything between this
ISP and
your inet or your local
net
is DMZ or d militarized
z it do
contains router to router connection
this router is from from your ISP this
router is from your company so this
entire
region in between these is
called this entire region is DMC between
this router which is of B AEL or Tata or
BT and this router which belongs to
Simply learn say this is firewall or
switch and it further connects to the
systems inside
it is separated from rest of the infra
or it it is not I won't say separated
but it is a shared Zone it is a shared
zone between you and ISP so anything
happening here would be decided by ISP
and uh your company that who would be
responsible for for it so this entire
zone is DMZ Zone which is mutually
shared between it's just like the Zero
Zone between any two company any two
countries border this border lies with
country
a this border lies with country
B this Zone in between is DMZ
demilitarized if that helps giving an
example that this plays between
your uh your network and the internet
the space in between is
DMZ so if you are hosting
any
software back to a point if you are
hosting any software in DMZ if you
hosting any software in this space then
again uh this is one of the the risky uh
things to do so if it is here you should
have this internet uh this subnet
whatever subnet is this you have to keep
it under scan so you can use Nessa scan
or buite scan to keep checking about any
uh vulnerabilities that could impact
that
software here in
DMZ which privileges that will be
allowed in production environment very
important what privileges are
allowed generally privileges uh the
admin or root privileges are provided
only to
the very important VIP of that project
and not to
all we have to
determine
if
sensitive data is FL
loting so determine if the software will
use a load balancer and or a cluster
architecture so if we are using any load
balancer these all questions should come
into our mind when we are talking about
the operational security and development
environment
so uh we still have 7 minutes for this
class I will
be asking few questions to all of you
try kindly try to answer them tomorrow
we will be
starting
uh from a topic called anti-piracy
requirements archiving
and anti-piracy
requirements the website I'm using is
Wayback
machine in Wayback machine talked about
Uber I searched how Uber used to look
from the very
start I searched it browser
history it showed me every Uber website
Uber geek Uber humor but I was concerned
about Uber caps which is here uber.com
it says that it
has more than three lakh captures from
1998 to
2016 so I'm interested to see
it when I click on 1998 December 12 1998
this is how it looked like just like any
normal uh startup taxi
service clients Services press
uh mind it it is just a snapshot it
won't be interactive if you click over
it it won't interact when I clicked on
March
2014 this is how it showed me that login
sign up get it done sign up for
Uber
reliable feedback
matters and after that if I want to see
in 2019
so this is how it looked like in
2019 and we know that now it was working
on Spa after 2016 and
17 you click on ride you click on Fred
you click on Transit it will work in
that element
without uh reloading all the PES so this
is how it looked like
similarly if you want to look in
currents date say last year
July June 23 Uber looked like
this it's still loading since it's
fetching it from archive the loading
speed is
slow so this is what it shows
you
currently not only Uber you can have any
website site have
it any website say want to see
facebook.com or google.com any website
that you want to
see so since it's working in the
archives loading speed is slow now you
see it's showing you
Facebook this is how it shows in 2024
how it was back in time in
2006 in 2006 this is how Facebook looked
like email and password one on left side
corner now what is the main use of
Wayback machine uh although it is a part
of the data collection of any uh Target
but uh just to let you know sometimes
uh during uh the upgradation of any
website or any portal say if you're are
uh targeting any company uh I'm not
talking about Facebook or uh Uber just
an example
uh sometimes when you see the old
captures of any Target say even I'll
take an example of Simply learn even
though simply learn never existed that
time but yes uh sometimes in
initial
uploads initial snapshots you would find
any email address of uh of any ex
employee of the CEO or some important
figure so that email address could be
used to move inside that company I can
use that email address to start my
fishing attack to provide any payload
inside the company so that's why Wayback
machine is used and what it shows now
you know what it shows it
shows the older and the newer versions
of any website talking about the
extensions that I asked you to download
yesterday how to download them simply
use Shan extension download
and you'll be able
to download it for Chrome for Firefox
whatever you are
using similarly for webalizer
S go here download
it so that's how you will be downloading
the extensions loopholes unintentionally
yes uh if you have shared any number
which I can use that is it safe to
download on office laptop I guess uh no
one would question it because it is not
you are not attacking anything you're
just getting the information say uh I'm
using it on my office laptop only but I
do have some other extensions also uh I
have grammarly n and safe
web n and safe web provides you
an idea which uh which link is safe to
use and which is which might be
uh
fishy so if you're having these kind of
extensions I don't think any uh company
would have any issue with it because
it's not used for attacking anything but
just to get knowledge of the page you
are visiting you would be questioned
when you try scanning any uh any company
any website or any Target then you'll
come into action because that would be
visible in their infrastructure someone
is trying to do that I'm very impressed
that people are coming outside their
comfort zone outside their main domain
and uh trying to learn about the
security things that that was very
impressive of this
batch uh back to the topic that we were
doing so we had to discuss archiving
requirements
and anti-piracy
requirements when I talk about archiving
requirements archiving requirements ISS
uh if we want to Archive something any
data if we want to Archive does it
comply with regulatory requirement or
organizational policy can I archive
anything and
everything so first is
has to be in accordance
with
organizational
policies next is the parameters it
should Define
uh the
location
duration for
format uh generally as a cyber security
engineer I recommend my office or my
team to Archive the data for three to
five years only because anything after
five years at the team level is
irrelevant it might be relevant at the
upper uh stakeholders level but at the
base workers level anything more than 3
to five years is
obsolete it cannot be
used so when we talk about archive
requirements we will firstly think
of the
data or
information that needs to be
stored so our scope is
fixed after that we will determine the
storage space needed for
it what
else uh if the data is transactional
that is remote and online or will it be
offline
storage that means
data at
rest or
motion
or
online and offline
data we will be categorizing it on these
basis if you want to store data you want
to Archive data what would what would be
the best way to do it would it will it
be good to store it as read write or
will it be good to store it as read only
archives are always read only because if
it is read right anyone can distort the
actual
data so third one
is
ensure the data is not
rewritable that means it should be only
read
only so one mistake that companies
generally do they ignore the speed of
retrieval so when you are archiving data
you should keep in mind uh how fast you
can retrieve the data it it won't be a
good idea that you are backing up data
you are archiving data but you have
to uh it takes years to get it back or
months to get it back then it is of no
use so speed of retrieval is another
thing that should be in your mind uh
while thinking about archiving
requirements
what else what what
else the one point which I shared
earlier
is
duration duration to store 3 years 5
years depending upon what your company
finds
good what else any regulatory
requirement
that is required to store that
data generally any data which talks
about Finance or stocks or something
like that those are under regulatory
requirements otherwise it it might
simply be used for insiding trading uh
which is illegal
so the data that has to be archived has
to be under regulatory
requirements and last but not the least
least determine
the format you want to store it as CSV
you want to store it as PDF you want to
store it as Excel sheets only talking
about anti piracy
requirements so we all know what is
piracy uh creating a clone or duplicate
from a legitimate copy that comes in y
it's done for movies videos
games
so how to uh not fill a trap of
piracy digitally sign it
digitally sign the
software so if you digitally sign a
software there are very less chances
that it could be tempered word or
reverse engineering could work on it
increase the complexity of source
code so if you
increase the complexity of source
code that would if you increase the
complexity of source
code that would make it difficult for uh
anyone who wants to uh clone it because
he knows he don't knows uh which how
many microservices are running inside it
uh which microservice is talking about
which
unit what
else if anyone of you have uh
anyways used piracy did piracy you know
that there's the license key if if
anyone had ever used p ated operating
system you know that license keys are
either hardcoded inside that license
file or you find it over the Internet so
next part is do not hard
code the license Keys when you hardcode
it it's easy to use those those license
keys to make it look like original
Implement a dynamic license verification
checks why Dynamic checks because if uh
someone is using license key of some
other product on
his example would be operating system
only then if Dynamic checks are there
and we see uh license key missing for
actual product being used on piloted
product then uh the pired product would
face a
blackout so last would
be
dynamic
license
verification check
process okay Dynamic license
verification check process says uh how
check if the actual license key is being
used somewhere say if you are just
checking it one specif uh once in year
or once just when it was launched you
checked it once that okay license key is
at right place doing good Dynamics is
you have to keep repeating that check
process after every random number of
months days so that you got to know that
yes license is being used on the actual
or legitimate
software and it is not misused somewhere
else so that that works Dynamic
checks after that we
have
sequencing and time
requirements when you talk about
sequencing and time
requirement sequencing means
uh there shouldn't be any reason uh in
the loop uh in the code that it results
in a loop uh sometimes there are
infinite Loops that can occur due to
programming or logic errors so if
there's a loop preventing the program
from reach reach its exit condition for
example sometimes your system is not
having any physical issue but you start
it it shows you your
uh manufacturer say if it is HP it shows
you HP reboots again starts again shows
HP reboots again starts again shows HP
so these kind of infinite Loops from
where you cannot uh get out just by
restarting the
systems it utilizes your resources like
CPU and memory uh which may cause system
crashes or performance problems
sometimes it's it's your operating
system as a software which is the
culprit sometimes it is something that
you have downloaded say uh you were
using some application which was having
some issues which is interacting with
the operating system and a loop is
created these kind of things impact the
resource utilization and these Loops
have to be killed now uh if I talk about
python as a
language it has a while
uh okay how would a python show any Loop
any statement if it is
true while true it will
show say I said if it if the statement
is true print
this is an
infinite
Loop now this could be anything which I
say if it is true then infinite Loop
will start
so these kind of things in a code can
invite these kind of disrupting things
which could lead to your system
crashes so
how
to avoid
these we talk about need for data
classification when data is
classified it
enhances the Triad the Triad is nothing
but Cia
focuses
on Pro proper
control and
implementation if you have proper
control and implementation these things
would be under check sequencing would be
under check
hit
standardize the
requirements so how to ensure that that
these things are taken care
of how to make sure that these are taken
care
of uh if I don't want
anyone to touch my codee or to include
anything like this in my code which is
uh which I have authored what I will do
I will talk
about techniques like anti
tempering anti reversing
anti tempering anti reversing and code
signing if any could if anyone could
answer office cation what is off fation
what is the code of
fation so when we talk about code of
fation uh in the similar way that you
answered it's just making it making our
code hard to read uh or hard to
manipulate so if you make your code
complex or hard to read to secure yes to
avoid tempering or to secure it from uh
any attacker it's called code of fation
even if it get Le leagued or attacked by
attacker since it is off
fiscated no uh un encryption in a lay
man language is password protection so
we are not not uh provide it providing
it password protection yet we are just
making it complex to read
so securing from acher it is a type of
security yes type of security but how we
are providing that security we are just
making the code more complex or
unreadable
for anyone else means only I know which
microservice is running where how to
call which function in which place
making it more complex that only I know
how it is
executed yes yes that's that's the exact
in English meaning of what we are
studying but same in in similar way off
foration means making it hard for anyone
to guess your password so generally for
corporates password ofation means it's
it should be we have the GRC people here
they know what password of first is it
it is making it 18
digits uh it should be 16 to 18 digits
it should contain
capitals special characters Smalls yes
making it mix of all of these correct so
let me show you uh how you off uscate
any
code use of paraphrase with special
characters yes you can use paraphrase a
paraphrase is nothing that password only
with special characters
numerics let me show you one
example how can we off uscate any code
say I want I have something written in
JavaScript but I want to off uscate it
do we have any tool the answer is yes we
do have it how we can do it let's
see off
[Music]
skater W
do
firster so this tool is
for okay so this is just an example uh
this is a
code uh which says hello world the basic
code that we all
always talk about or we started our
coding with these kind of
codes if I ask it to off uscate this so
now do you know what was written inside
it so this is how the codes get off a
ated you just know that it's some
function is starting and here it's a
semicolon rest you don't
know it's showing hello world somewhere
here
distorted so this was my example if you
want to have any other code just try it
offers skate it you will see the output
here so you want to you don't want to
copy paste just upload your file off
uscate it share it to anyone you want
ask them to
uh
to recode it and it will show the entire
actual
code so this one is a good tool for code
ofation you can choose your options
according to you
you want to change it to something other
mangled dictionary so it will do
that so now it's just in dictionary
errors because I changed it
here change it to something other
mangled so it is mangled it will now
fate in mangled
manner so any way you like you will be
able
to generate any application server
security or network security incident
handling
related policy from this
page just have any sample
code you can get any code from gitlab
but say any sample code in
Python Python program to convert Celsius
to Fahrenheit
okay so we have this code with
us let's
have so this is the
code using offer
skater okay this is Javascript code off
first skater so I will
check for any JavaScript sample code in
JS JavaScript
example to swap two variables so we have
some code
for swap swapping two
variables I'm taking the commments along
so commments are
included using off offer
skater simply pasting it here it could
be my original
code or something from stack
Overflow off skate
it this is the output that it is
generating you see you cannot understand
what it
is so this is another
[Music]
example so these are JavaScript example
similarly you can find Python and other
good
examples all right your query was that
what is the requirement of doing it why
are we uh offes skating the code in the
very first place so we are are doing
offer cation uh to make it confidential
between if I don't want my code to be
read by anyone else I want to be read
only by
anubhab I would share it even if I share
it in group chat this one it would be in
offer skated form no one would know what
it is written but you know that I would
communicate it with you that it's off
sked just use any ND off a sker and
retrieve the actual code back so that's
where it is being used
perfect the offer skater itself is using
uh encoding it's encoding into whatever
you are asking it
to encod in so if you see here what is
this it is nothing just want to encode
it in hexad decimal it will encode it in
hexade decimal if I want to encode it in
some dictionary thing it will encode it
in dictionary dictionary
thing all right so talking about anti-
reversing techniques as the name
says perfect uh anti- reversing
techniques as the name says reversing
techniques that means somewhere it's
talking about reverse engineering now
what is reverse
engineering reverse engineering is the
process of analyzing software to
understand how it works towards gaining
knowledge to duplicate or enhance the
software when we talk
about anti- reversing for that firstly
we need to know what is reverse
engineering reverse
engineering is a term which you will
very casually uh listen while working in
cyber security field what does it
mean it's nothing but how you
analyze the
software software is already built it is
already there functioning well you
analyze the
software to
understand how it
works gaining knowledge to duplicate or
enhance it so if there are clones of
say if you go on uh if you clone own
some software say if
there's swiggy we also have
zato we also have
other examples
like easy
sh which are relatively newer
so if you see they are pretty much alike
these softwares are pretty much alike
they
work on similar model they work of
similar base similar examples
are
Ola
Uber in
Drive Blue cabs if you
see all of these
have similar UI structure even rapido
these these they are one point they are
competitors another point they have
similar applications they know that they
have
understood the customer requirement the
customer psyche even if it was started
by one here it's Uber here it's either
sui or zato don't know which one started
it uh but once the code was
there one programming one programmer of
the entire
team put in
efforts the code was
out
cloned made it for any other term any
other uh company so even if you search
for any of these codes as a programmer
you might find them
online the earlier versions or off first
versions but that would be enough for
you to clone it so this is nothing but
reverse engineering you are trying
to make it from something that is
already there generally programmers what
what do programmers do for any
application they have have an idea from
gitlab or stack Overflow the codes are
already there they have it from there
customize it according to our
requirement and then that's where
reverse
engineering is
used
so me as a person working in sui or zato
or Uber I wanton I won't feel good if my
code
is reversed or if reverse engineering is
being done on those codes for without
giving me any monetary benefit other
company's made using those codes so
that's where anti- reversing comes into
play that's where reverse
Engineers
are are stopped making these uh things
because that's again is illegal because
the copyright thing is already with the
original auor of that code so what do
you think is the best defense against
this reverse engineering things what
have we studied
it's called copy
paste okay in Layman it's called copy
paste right you copy paste and then you
customize it according to your wish okay
Aran says what is stack overflow stack
Overflow it gives you an idea of uh
codes means I have heard that program
rammers use tack
overflow to get an idea of codes they
are trying to
develop uh in other words we call it
inspiration we got inspired from that
code and that's why we
are making it better in our own infra so
Cod ofation is required if we copy paste
code C code officiation is required to
stop that copy base thing so this is the
answer of my question my question was
what is the best defense technique
against reverse engineering so answer is
offers skate the code you offers skate
it no one would would know what it is
written there so reverse engineering
would be a bit harder okay I remember a
question was there from someone uh that
if everyone knows that the code is offc
and how to decate it
what is the benefit of
it if I'm sharing the offer skated code
I will not let you know that it is a
code why would I let you know that is it
is a quote that's the uh that's the gist
of sharing that with you so only that
only the actuality would be shared with
anyone I would like to share my code
with for rest of all it is just crap
which we do not understand what it is
written just a random pair of strings
while the one say if I want Aran or
badri to know that it is actually a code
so I would let them know that just de
off offers skated it's uh offers skated
in hexa or binary de offers skated and
they will get the
code even if I'm sharing it in public
how would that be
offered
using the offers sked using the same you
will just upload the
file here where it's written office can
just use it and if I have already shared
that it's in hexa used hexa and it will
show you the exact code
otherwise there's uh decoder in BB Suite
once we will be doing BB Suite I will
show you there also
how uh these kind of encoded things you
can decode so we have multiple ways of
doing it one of this is using office
skater de off skater the other one is
using encoder decoder which is again a
part of bub suet those who are already
already working in cyber security field
uh they know what B Su is and how it's
working we will we will know it with the
course of time while we complete this
course hope uh the base of the class is
good today I got feedback that it was
fast yesterday but I Tred to make it
little lighter
today so in anti temp in we were having
anti-
reversing in anti- tempering we were
having anti
reversing code
signing and office
cation offer you know ENT reversing you
know what is code
signing anyone want to attempt code
signing what is code signing the name
says it all
so code
signing
perfect uh sign on code simple right
copyright
exactly
so code signing is the process of
digitally signing the code for example
if it is having some executables or
scripts I will have some private key of
the code order code signing ures that
authent authenticity of published code
besides proving integrity and anti-t
tempering
protection
uh
uh example of it is how to show that you
are the
other yes yes hashing is part of it uh
signing on code that those things the
private and uh what digital signing is
that would be covered under
cryptography
after after
this office things and
all there's a there's an application
called
grabify only if my company allows it to
run what is not
running how it is done code
signing talks about uh as as we saw an
answer from aren it talks about the
sharing of keys so there are combination
of keys that are shared so once you
digitally
signed uh the code you are it order the
private key remains with you only you
would be able to ex execute that code
even if you share it with others it
would be only read only and it it won't
be executed unless and otherwise you
share your private key which would be uh
checked with the public key and executed
so how that is done we all will so
cryptography will talk all about hashing
md5 hashing sh 256 all those things
we'll be covering there
depends uh because there are different
algorithms you can use variety of them
uh DH key
exchange uh I believe is
what earlier uh coders used now they
preferably use hash algorithm for 250
256 yes
uh
s256 is used currently
so I was talking about
grabify just want to show
you if it runs here
okay I believe this is uh the URL which
is not responsive on any
URL connection time
out so since we are talking about uh
cyber
security uh and you people want to have
a little hands on let me show you
something
uh for hacking since hacking module is
far away just an overview
there's a thing called ghdb or Google
hacking
database so in when we talk about Google
hacking
database we have variety of things
there present
online you can see vulnerable servers
here
can see index of confidential files with
ju
information again vulnerable servers are
there what El fil you can get filtered
things
uh web server error
message
footholds let's see various online
devices
it would show any online device so using
one of these
exploits this is what we
got so this is some camera which is a
live recording
camera of Le MC
College I'm not sure where it is but
with the time it shows 8:55
a.m. 3rd March 8:55
a.m. that most possibly
is us or
Canada you can
stop sometimes uh you even get the
controls of the camera you can rotate it
in left or
right so now you
have you can see somewhere in the world
using Google hacking database this is
one of the use one of the many
uses it provided you a hold of an online
device so you now as an attacker can
have
so all of this is for education purposes
kindly do not misuse anything try to go
overboard in things till you get
more about it you know more about it so
this is uh what I wanted to show you
just to uh keep your interest intact in
the
topics we'll be starting
with the new
topics next we are going to
start next topic would
be so this would
be software security Now we will be
talking more
about software
security so I was trying to show you
what Google is capable of doing other
than searching for our
queries so when you talk about Google
hacking
database it shows you all the exploits
uh which are
available I will just reset the filters
because it's showing filtered content so
it shows you vulnerable
servers files containing juicy
information but these are of no use for
me currently since I just want to show
you what Google hacking database is
capable of doing so to show you that
part I will just filter it with any on
online machine I will filter it for any
online machine so it's showing me the
different online
machines there's Brother
printer zerox printer laser jet
printer even in these I will just want
to see
cameras so not using much I will just
open open first
few exploits one is from Shilpa one is
from EST
takur one is
from
yes now you click on
these urls
so this is someone using this URL for
something
else no IP
camera I'm not a robot
here it's requesting you for login
credentials if you want to brute force
it try uh generally available default
username
passwords but that would
involve okay it says root password might
be password
okay I don't want his camera to be
logged so we have other cameras also
so now you have got control of some
camera in
some IC area snowy area with controls
here you you can move it the
right okay it is requiring assign so for
controls you would require sign
in similarly here's another camera in
bushes do you have
admin no we don't have admin for
so this is one of the thing that you can
do
using uh okay when you talk about t
browser uh you think when you are
visiting the dark web you safe
uh when when you enter to browser your
IP is broadcasted so when you try that
uh when you think that you would be
trying to attack someone meanwhile you
see that your Gmail is
misbehaving so this is my personal
experience I tried using Tor that was
the first and last time uh you you will
see something fishy at your end after
you try using to browser yes I'm talking
about to browser
only uh
how to use the DB as a hacker we will
see it this is just this is just uh this
is just a
trailer these sites record our logins
also uh no these are just the cameras
which they forgot to encrypt forgot to
provide encryption so even if I provide
you the IP address of my home camera you
won't be able to log
in uh that's true WESH uh we need to be
very careful in terms of handling that's
why I keep reminding that it's only for
education purposes no one would try
exploiting
anything what about Deep Web Deep Web is
nothing just uh one way to reach de web
is store browser which is also called
Onion
Browser uh I won't recommend you to
download it or to move around t uh
because very professional hackers are
already using those things there so you
won't even know when you get a victim
while you serve D web all right so any
more questions we are heading to our
next
topic software
security so as the name says
as the name says software
security software we already know what
software is
how uh they are used why they are
used uh they are just firmwares that
we use for our day-to-day
work what we will be learning in
software
security we will be talking about
what
are broken access
controls and their related
vulnerabilities we will
explain cryptographic failures
we will classify various applications
issues
using we will talk about what are
cve what are
cwe this these are nothing but common
vulnerabilities how are they named what
is their nor
clature and we will discuss some real
world
scenarios so a bit more interesting
topic than what we were doing
earlier here we would be talking about
aasp top
10 Sans
25 in better detail
I will remove all these tabs
uh let's see what AAS top 10
says so it is nothing just a standard
that we people use and it is a globally
recognized standard
globally
[Music]
recognized
standard used for
making websites
secure just to let you know uh even
though it is not part of your curriculum
but I will let you know that aasp top
10 is not just for
web applications but even
for mobile
applications
so covering because we are talking about
softwares web applications so this is
what we'll be working we do have simar
things for mobile also so if anyone of
you is more having
more in Mobile security mobile app
security then this is what you can refer
to and for web one point that
we talks about major vulnerabilities
globally in how many years these are
refreshed so the answer was in front of
you only when I opened that
link talking more about web
applications but for
mobile I'll just share you the link that
these are the top 10
for mobile let me share the latest
one we have a a v top 10 for cicd also
yes yes we do
have so even when we talk about was top
10 2013
so these were the OAS top 10 in
2013 which talked
about injection broken authentication
session management cross-site scripting
insecure D serialization these
were the things that were impacting
corporates in 2013 with injection at the
top broken authentication and session
management
and other things following
it when we talk about
2017 injection is still on the top
broken authentication is at second while
other in 2021 broken exess control is at
number one now what all these uh
loopholes are what these vulnerabilities
are and how it impacts our working in
cyber security we will be discussing it
in the session that's that we are going
to complete since we are talking about
aasp
2021 2021 would start with broken Access
Control cryptographic failures
cryptographic
failures injection insecure
design security Mis config
vulnerable and outdated
components identification and
authentication
failures you will be uh knowing it
knowing them one by
one software and data Integrity
failures security logging in
monitoring and
ssrf before I move into explaining all
this the place from where you will get
the best ideas of of everything which is
Port
sger so if you write any issue say csrf
is one of the issues I will just say
csrf Port
figer this tutorial would be providing
me enough detail of everything and
anything related to the issue uh this is
just to let you know if in case uh you
are trapped somewhere so that's where
you can simply use ports figure to your
defense
so back to we we were broken Access
Control when we talk about broken access
control as the name says that the access
control is broken somewhere so
unauthorized access to system
functionality
that
resources
uh and resources that creates
exploitable weakness
so when there's some unauthorized exess
to the system and it could impact that
system's functionality entirely that's
where broken Access
Control we say it is there
so what is example of it uh I don't
want anyone to login into uh a
website but again someone who is very
skillful
he checked out some loophole and was
able to access it uh we'll see how we do
it uh there are certain vulnerable
websites available on the internet which
we will be using to see how we can uh
take advantage of loopholes
and do this broken exess control thing
if I'm logged in with an ID of harprit
say this engage x.s simply
learn.com although this is some Zoom
meeting but yes if you say that I'm
logged in into my account
currently is it a way that I change here
something and I'm able to login into any
one of yours account so any these if I'm
able to do that that means the access
control is broken broken
somewhere usually it happens if there is
user ID present in the URL so we try to
change those IDs with some other user
IDs if you are able to login with that
user
not this URL but if some URL is having
an ID which belongs to her PRI say this
is some ID which belongs to her you
change
it use someone else say Chiran jit's ID
I know that Chiran jit's user ID is XYZ
whatever it is I placed that ID here
pressed enter and now this same
page says that the logged in user is not
not herit but
chanit so these kind of things we can do
using broken Access Control we will see
how we do
it uh but before doing the Practical
part we will be understanding how uh
these we will understand the theor
theory part first before we move into uh
doing the attacks understanding what
it's done how it is done when we talk
about access control vulnerabilities
what are the most common
things uh that
we keep in
mind so I'm talking about exess control
things when I talk about exess control
vulnerabilities
the example that I just
shared if I'm allowing the primary
key to be
changed to another users
account in this example it was her prit
and and chanit but you can use anyone's
ID to get access to that users's
account and how it was
done I used
bypassing re Access
Control checks by
using what did I modify by modifying
the what did I modify here in this
example uid where did I
modified where was this
modified in Link and Link is called as
Ry said arip said modifying the
URL so I modified the URL and I was able
to bypass
the control the exess
control what else does it
mean say uh if I'm changing this account
uh I'm using srishti's account and sisi
is having admin access I'm just a normal
user and sisi is having admin access so
does this mean that I'm able to elevate
my privilege
simply changing the IDS in the
URL I would be able
to elevate the
privilege because now I'm the
admin
so there's one application
available uh which is a vulnerable
application I'll side by side I'll try
to exploit that
also it is called a wasp Juice
Shop so here we have this
application it includes certain
challenges we will
do it one by one uh although this is
bonus than what you you are provided
from Simply learn we will be doing those
labs also side by
side all right so when I talk about this
account
thing I want to log in it says all
right uh just provide
your email password
okay I'll first say that I'm not a
customer yet let's see if I find any
fault here then we will move forward
trying to
register so her at theate yopmail.com
yopmail is disposable
email and some
password say my password is
harprit h
capital H A
harprit 123 all right I repeat the
password h a r
her 1 2 3 it says password matches now I
remove 1 2
3 password doesn't match perfect
and if I remove 1 2 3 from
here so I have
removed it from here now you see that
there's misconfiguration so even though
I have changed my password it still says
that both are matching and we can move
ahead so
let's move
forward it will take my password even
though it's eight digits and it is 11
digits so one of the was top
10 which
says M
configuration so you are seeing
misconfiguration here that even
though the condition is not met okay
let's see will will
it allow me to
register registration completed
completed successfully you can now log
in all right registration is successful
you can now log in now problem for me is
I don't know which password will it take
so let's see
her
bre
123 it says
no removing one
123 so you see that the confirmed
password was not
taken but the
one which I supplied earlier was taken
as a password
just to show you that I'm with the same
email address that I showed
you all right so that
was misconfiguration
part let's
see if we could find something else
let's see for injection okay
trying to
login
generally we
have
some some developers hard code the
default
credentials uh which is either admin
admin either admin password
all right it is not taking any of these
it is not taking admin it is not taking
password can I try
uh some payload I will try doing SQL
injection here for SQL those who know
what SQL is the language is it works on
queries it checks for your query in the
backend database that your query is true
it will execute it if the query returns
false it will not execute that query so
let me see
if I'm using Boolean algebra it
says either
admin or 1 is equal to
1 my password is
password it says it it identifies that
it is an object okay I will
use hyph to ignore anything after
this and I am inside as an
admin so what is this this is an
injection attack I'm using SQL injection
here this is how we are doing
it
so this one is an injection okay I would
be providing you one more
example uh what else can we do
[Music]
here what else can I do
here customer feedback complaint
support let me log out and I will do
something else
customer
feedback
Anonymous I hated
your apple
juice and when I say this I hate your
apple juice
62 1 62 12
okay what least rating I can give it it
is
one but the apple juice was not even
worth it for one so can I change it
control shift
I can I change that rating
where is it reflecting
here e
one way is you make changes
in the code
itself but I'll show you a
more unique way uh we will be using BB
suite for this information to pass
through I'll just
be let me use my BB
Suite so one uh thing would be to check
in inspect
element the other one would be using BB
Suite I'll
just turn on the BB suite and
connect from another site
okay all right so anab wants example
from another site so since we are not
attacking any main site we are uh using
vulnerable websites so let's let me show
you another site as
requested there's a site called
test.php
which is
etics so test.php is the other
side so
here if you
try to use
any because for injection you would
require something to put your payload
inside so you see your payload
executes these kind of executions these
kind of injection attacks are
called X SS
or cross site scripting
text the one that we already saw for the
other payload that was SQL injection
attack for admin
part
and this one was xss or cross-site
scripting here we use used crossed
scripting we used script what script did
we use and where do we get these kind of
scripts you get these from gitlab so if
I use
payloads for
accss you will get all these list
available online on
GitHub similarly for SQL injection
so just go there
and use these
for injection attacks kindly do not use
any kindly do not use any of these on
live web
applications I don't want anyone of you
to be suffering legally never use these
on live applications without permission
what codes to use for injection uh for
injection we are using these payloads
that I shared you uh you have to check
which payload works for which website so
cyber security is a field where you have
to invest ample amount of
time so using payloads from these lists
would require you to invest a lot of
time so these are for accss similarly if
you don't want accss attack you
want SQL
injection you will get that payload list
here so these payload list are for SQL
injection
attacks when you have provided your
scope you have to go through it which
payload works over it and yes that's
that's the most time consuming thing
which you'll see as
Reda what is payload payload is anything
uh which you use for the destructive
process so you
want your scope to destroy you use
payload so where else we uh use word
payload
if you know we use payload in defense
system so payload is whatever is inside
the rocket whatever is inside the
missile those things are payloads so
similarly payload means that data
portion payload
is used in a sense of
Destruction anything that you use
to yes in networking terms it is part of
the data payload
yes you talk uh in uh header things that
pay is there in part of data in
headers as Rajiv ran said it is the
capacity to carry malicious script query
to Target location for
sure okay so
this is a tool called BB Suite on which
I'll be showing you uh the method that I
I was showing you how to disrupt the
rating on any website we were doing that
on aasp Juice
Shop so BL s is again from Port
sger it has its
inbuilt
browser so I'll be opening the
[Music]
browser once the browser is open I'll
restore because it will open do shop
only one feature of BB is you you can
intercept the traffic that means you
control what traffic is
going
so here if
I say intercept is on that means
whatever
traffic is going here I'll be able to
see that
traffic in my proxy So currently let's
currently I'm turning on
off simply moving to the page where I
have to give the
rating
so we were at customer
feedback I had their say orange
juice so I didn't want to give them even
a single
rating but I know by Bard Mass the
result for this
is six
now when I'm trying to submit this I
will intercept I will turn on The
Intercept BB suit works as man in the
middle so you see the entire traffic it
is capturing it
is it is seeing that as man in the
middle it says okay you say orange juice
is sugary it's Anonymous all
right let's change this rating to
zero here is not possible i r zero but
now let's see I submit
it forward this
traffic thank you for your feedback the
feedback has been
taken so when the feedback has been
taken let's see if that feedback is
visible
anywhere so
I will turn off The Intercept
again so it would be
either all right so someone says I love
this some says great shop nothing useful
available here they all are having one
to five
ratings but let's see if our rating is
somewhere
here orange juice was sugary by
Anonymous and it is showing null
rating so this is how you can change the
course of
things uh which
[Music]
browser how do we connect all right I'll
just show it again this is
inbuilt browser in BB Suite so when you
move to proxy you have this open browser
this will open Chromium browser here so
Chromium browser is the inbu browser for
BB
Suite there are two ways in which you
can use BB Suite it is either
professional you can buy licensed
version or just for practice you can use
BBU uh Community version so some
features are available only in licensed
version
so you won't you you would have 50% of
these in community
version this is on the sameas ju site
yes uh this was the one that I got
interrupted in so yes it's in AAS Juice
Shop the same one in which we did that
admin part
and what else now since I'm using BB
feet we still have 10 minutes let's see
what else we can do using BB site
another part
so what else we can
use I forgot to turn on
The
Intercept click
here it is showing me something that
okay
uh uh harjinder BB Su is not a site BB
Su is a
tool BB Su is a tool uh it's not a site
you can download BB
Su
online please share the process to
download the BB Suite okay
simply B
suit just download it from here it will
download the Community
Edition guys sharing the uh processes uh
step by step would be
hard better would be if we we are just
revising it through video that would be
impressive
right what exactly we are trying to do
uh all right anyone who could answer
this why are we doing
it oh what uh what why are we doing it
what is the
agenda because we are studying was top
10 and
this is we are trying
to uh study a was top 10 using these uh
just like we did security
misconfiguration injection
attack broker Access Control uh we were
able
to take over the admin account so using
injection so broker access control all
these
things that's why we are studying BBU
and
deliberately vulnerable
application yes it is man in the middle
attack yes we are doing
mitm and mitm is taking a cue of what uh
communication is going on between two
sender and receiver
so where I
was yes I was trying to show you
something else if I send this to
repeater repeater is something that
repeat
things uh it shows me that okay there is
something called FTP legal. MD do not
take stress this is core things uh
because you stressed that you want
something practical I'm showing it but
yes uh uh this is something bonus apart
from what you you are actually having in
your curriculum but I'm always happy to
uh share more than uh you expect so just
something from my end uh what I'll do
here I will see okay it is talking about
FTP it's it's showing me that okay uh
FTB protocol is running and we are
getting a file legal. MD the file on
which I
clicked I clicked on legal. MD here
which says check out our boring terms of
conditions all right it was legal.
MD I would send
it and see response here okay it is
generating some
response what and response is the legal
information there's a legal file which
says I guess it is in some other
language is talking about something okay
here it is in English no some other
language all right no issues what I'll
do I'll see if we have anything else uh
inmd one file is legal on
which uh so when I change this legal
thing I remove legal with
MD and see if we are having some other
files here uh MD
files
okay if I remove even
FTP are we able to get. MD
something doesn't works
what if FTP is
back
and MD is removed we will see any file
any file transfer protocol
here let's
see 200 okay that means it is successful
all
[Music]
right if we are having any other
file 404 not found
any other file which is using
FTP 200 okay
so you see if I search for MD we have
got another
file Acquisitions
MD it says 12 matches all right
announcement which is an encrypted file
MD coupons.
MD legal. MD we already have seen let's
see if we are able to see Acquisitions
MD because acquisition MD is not visible
on their web page so let's see if it is
visible to see what's written in
Acquisitions
MD so you have find out a confidential
document this document is confidential
do not
distribute it shows their planned
Acquisitions this is the planned
acquisitions
we will be doing more practicals but yes
uh just to give you a chist of how cyber
security
works this session was necessary uh so
that you know where we are heading
to and if this uh Sparks interest in you
that this is this is what we do in cyber
security field hey everyone welcome to
Simply learn today we are going to talk
about some really interesting and
Powerful hacking gadgets you should know
about in 2024 but remember this is just
for learning we don't want anyone
getting into trouble so moving on the
best way to keep your computers and
devices safe is to know about the risk
so some risk are easy to cater using
strong passwords and don't download from
Bad websites and don't hand your
unlocked device to strangers but there
are also hidden dangers that can cause
big problems some tools look innocent
but can be very dangerous here has seven
gadgets that look normal but are
actually powerful hacking tools these
tools are made for Security Experts to
test system but they can be misused so
let's kick things off with a device
that's small but incredibly powerful
that is Rasberry Pi so Raspberry Pi is a
compact and affordable computer that has
revolutionized the tech world originally
designed for educational purposes it has
become a favorite among hobbyist makers
and even professionals despite its small
size it boasts impressive capabilities
including multiple USB ports HDMI output
and support for various operating
systems like Linux and Windows 10 iot
core the Raspberry Pi can be used for a
wide range of projects from simple
programming and gaming to complex iot
systems and home automation the
Raspberry Pi can also be dangerous
hacking tool with the right software it
can be used to perform a variety of
hacking task for example it can run K
Linux a popular operating system for
penetration testing this allows it to be
used for Network scanning password
cracking and even setting up Rogue
access points to intercept data its
small size makes it easy to hide and its
affordability means it's accessible to
many in the wrong hands this inent
looking device can become a powerful
tool for malicious activities now that
we have seen the potential of the
Rasberry Pi which by the way is one of
the personal favorites for tinkering
let's move on to another seemingly
simple but powerful device the Wi-Fi
adapter so Wi-Fi adapter might seem like
a simple device used to connect to
wireless networks but it can be a potent
hacking tool in the wrong hands these
adapters when paired with the right
software can intercept and monitor
Wireless Communications making them
invaluable for network analysis and
penetration testing for example they can
can be used with tools like air crack
ngng to crack Wi-Fi passwords hackers
can use Wi-Fi adapters to perform
attacks such as packet sniffing and man
in the- Middle attacks these activities
can lead to unauthorized access to
networks data theft and severe security
breaches it's like having a digital spy
in your pocket while essential for
legitimate security testing it's crucial
to be aware of the potential misuse and
to secure your own wireless networks
against such threats speaking of Wi-Fi
you won't believe how sneaky this next
device is let's take a look at a device
that takes Wireless heing to a whole new
level the Wi-Fi pineapple the Wi-Fi
pineapple looks like a standard router
but it is a sophisticated device used
for hacking wireless networks it allows
attackers to create Rogue Wi-Fi access
points tricking users into connecting
and revealing their login credentials
imagine connecting to what looks like a
free public Wi-Fi only to have your data
intercepted this device is capable of
advanced man inth middle attacks
monitoring and recording data from all
connected devices Additionally the Wi-Fi
pineapple can capture Wi-Fi handshakes
which can then be used to crack Network
passwords its powerful feature makes it
a favorite among penetration testers for
assessing network security but in the
wrong hands it can be used for malicious
activities highlighting the importance
of robust wireless security so from
Wi-Fi to Bluetooth which is everyone
these days right let's now explore a
powerful tool for Bluetooth hacking the
ubertooth 1 the ubertooth 1 is an
open-source Bluetooth testing tool that
appears to be a simple USB dongle
despite its unassuming appearance it can
monitor and analyze Bluetooth
Communications making it a valuable
asset for those testing the security of
Bluetooth devices think of it as a spy
for Bluetooth traffic the ubertooth one
can capture Bluetooth packets perform
Bluetooth attacks and even Explore
vulnerabilities in Bluetooth Network
networks its ability to dissect
Bluetooth traffic makes it a powerful
tool for both legitimate security
research and potential misuse
understanding its capabilities helps
highlight the importance of securing
bluetooth enabled devices against
unauthorized access and attacks
continuing with radio frequency tools
which honestly sounds like something out
of a spy movie so let's discuss the hack
rf1 and its versatile capabilities so
the hack rf1 is a versatile software
defined radio SDR platform that can
transmit and receive radio signals from
1 MHz to 6 GHz it looks like a standard
electronic device but can be used for a
wide range of hacking activities imagine
being able to capture and manipulate
signals across a broad spectrum with the
hack rf1 users can capture and analyze
various radio signals Jam frequencies
and even spoof signals to manipulate
communication systems this tool is
particularly useful for exploring and
testing the security of wireless
communication systems while it serves an
essential role in legitimate research
and development the hack rf1 also
demonstrates the need for robust
security measures to protect against
radio frequency based attacks so now
let's look at a tool that takes
advantage of a computer's trust in USB
devices and trust me this one sneaky the
USB rubber ducky so the USB rubber ducky
is a device that looks like a regular
flash drive but acts like a keyboard
typing commands into any computer it's
plugged into
hackers use it to execute pre-programmed
scripts that can steal data install
malware or take control of the target
device it's like a tiny digital ninja
this tool exploits the trust computers
have in USB devices making it a ENT
weapon for cyber attacks it's a reminder
to be cautious about plugging in unknown
USB devices as they could be rubber
duckes in Disguise ready to unleash
harmful commands and compromise your
system security so finally we have got a
real undercover Gadget here let's
uncover the secret capabilities of the
land turtle the land turtle looks like a
typical USB ethernet adapter but it's a
covered hacking tool used to Monitor and
infiltrate networks don't let its
innocent appearance fool you it provides
hackers with several capabilities such
as Network scanning DNS poofing and data
capture the land turtle can be
discretely plugged into a network
allowing access to gather sensitive
information and gain unauthorized access
its ability to operate undetected makes
it particularly dangerous emphasizing
the need for vigilance and robust
network security measures to prevent
unauthorized devices from connecting to
your systems so there you have it guys
we have explored some of the most
powerful and dangerous hacking gadgets
out there these tools can do a lot of
damage if they fall into the wrong hands
that's why it's so important to stay
informed and Vigilant about cyber
security hey everyone today we will
explore the world of cyber security with
hacker GP GPT specialized version of
chat GPT designed for ethical hacking
and cyber security in a digital
landscape where cyber attacks occur
every 39 seconds causing billions in
Damages annually hacker GPT provides the
essential tools and knowledge to defend
against these threats so hacker gbd
offers guidance on a wide range of
topics including security practices
ethical hacking techniques and scripting
for system security cyber crime damages
are expected to reach $6 trillion
annually making it a major challenge for
organizations and if we talk about some
of the breaches so in 2020 over 36
billion records were exposed due to data
breaches and the infamous Equifax breach
of 2017 where 147 million people's
information was compromised highlights
the importance of regular security
assessments and vulnerability management
these are the areas where hacker gbd
excels and hacker gbd strictly adheres
to ethical guidelines refusing to assist
with any unethical or illegal queries so
our commitment is to provide guidance
that adheres to legal and Professional
Standards helping you become a
responsible cyber security professional
so guys let's get started with hacker
gbt that equip you with the Knowledge
and Skills to defend against cyber
threats ethically and effectively so
guys this is Chad GPT and this is the
paid version of Chad GPT 40 and what I
was telling you is this is the explore
GPT section so here you can find all the
gpts that are created by Chad GPT open a
or the individuals or you can find the
companies who have created gpts so you
can found these are the recently used
and this is the most used hacker GPT you
can find other gpts also that is hacker
GPT and you could see that and they have
been used by 5,000 plus users and this
have been used by 10,000 plus users so
you can just search for ethical hacker
gbt here and it has been rated 4.5 Stars
10,000 plus conversations and these are
the conversation status if you need any
assistance and the capabilities you can
see here and the ratings given by users
and more by the Creator who has created
this so we'll start with this we'll
start the chat here and I want to tell
you guys that chity doesn't answer non
ethical questions so if you try to
extract that information from Chad jpt
that won't be possible but we can do a
bit
like we can cross a bit line with
ethical hacker GPT but that should be
used for ethical purposes only so I will
show you guys how you can utilize this
GPT and one more thing guys if you want
to create your own GPT you can also
create that also you can go to explore
gbt section and here's the create option
click on Create and here you can start
creating your gbt if you click on
configure you can write the name of your
gbd description instructions and the
conversation starters as you just saw
with the hacker gbt ethical hacker gbd
and the capabilities what you want to be
enabled you could do that and here in
the create section you could write the
prompts here and it will take that
information and use it for more purposes
and here you could attach more files
that could help create your GPD okay
guys so here you could see the
configuration and the preview of your
GPT and you can finalize that so moving
back we will get back to ethical hacker
gbt and start with our conversation with
him so starting with the first thing we
can do is we can ask him like how can I
perform a basic security assessment on a
web application so if I tell you guys
performing a basic security assessment
on a web application is crucial for
identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring
the application is secure and this
process involves using various tools and
techniques to test the application for
common security issues so you could ask
him that how can I
perform a basic
security assessment on a web
application and just wait for a few
seconds and you could have the response
from ethical haer gity so you could see
that performing a basic security
assessment on a web application involves
several key steps and these are the key
steps number one is preparation and
information gathering and how you can do
that these are the steps identify the
scope gather information then is the
Second Step that is reconnaissance and
you can use the tools BB suit ncto and
others similarly you could see all the
steps here so I won't be guiding or I
won't be reading what responses are
generated by ethical heog GB I have used
that and he provides very accurate like
I would say around 95 to 96% accurate
results here I want to show you guys how
you can utilize it so I will show you
prompts and what things you can ask him
so this was all about repeat so this was
about the general security thing now
we'll move to ethical hacking and we can
ask him how we can perform a SQL
injection attack ethically on a test
environment so these are the prompts
that you can write that would be how do
I perform
uh SQL
injection attack and that to ethically
if you write this that would be good on
a test
environment and if I tell you guys so
SQL injection is one of the most common
web application vulnerabilities and
understanding how to perform a SQL
injection attack ethically own a test
environment can help you identify and
mitigate this risk in your own
applications and you could see he has
responded and he has provided you the
steps that you can set up a control test
environment first thing then preparation
and you could use these tools then you
have the manual SQL injection testing so
these are the methods that you could use
that is or or 1 equal to 1 for the
database and automated SQL injection
testing so this is the command for that
and you could verify vulnerability
documentation reporting so you could see
that this GPD is capable of answering
the basic questions as we have discussed
the basics question till now now we'll
move to scripting and automation so here
you could see how he respond to this so
we'll ask him can you provide a python
script to scan open ports on a
network so let's see what he
provides provide a python
script and that to to scan ports
on a
network so scanning open ports on
network is a fundamental step in
identifying potential Val abilities and
a python script that can automate this
process making it easier to regularly
check for open ports and secure them so
this is the python script you can use
any ID and run on that and you could see
that he's explaining the code also yeah
you can ask him like can you explain the
code line by line and this hacker gbt
will do that for you and how to run the
script that also he has provided you and
similarly we can also ask him that how
we can write a bash script to Monitor
and log unauthorized login attempts and
if you want I can also run this prompt
how do I
write uh bash
script and that two to
Monitor and log unauthorized access
unauthorized login
attempts so we can monitor and log
unauthorized login attempts and that
would be essential for maintaining the
security of your system so as you can
see he has written A bash script and
that can help you automate this process
and this will provide realtime alerts
and logs for further analysis and you
could see that he's providing the
explanation
and how you can run the script and he's
writing the note also like you can write
more prompts if you have any doubts in
any of the script or any of the
responses that hacker GPT has responded
and he will definitely provide you with
good responses so now moving on now
we'll ask this ethical hacker GPT about
some specific security tools and we
could ask him about BB suit and so let's
write a prompt can you
explain how to
configure and use BB
suit or we can write for web application
testing so if I sum you up so BB suit is
a powerful tool for web application
security testing and understanding how
to configure and use it effectively can
help you identify and address a wide
range of security vulnerabilities in
your applications so you could see he
has provided the initial steps that
would be downloading and installing BB
suit configuring your browser to use BB
suit as a proxy and then intercept and
inspect traffic and then you can use it
for testing purpose logging and
Reporting and tips for Effective testing
so this is the response for the security
tools and if we talk about incident
response we can ask to write a script to
collect system logs for forensic
analysis so collecting system logs is a
critical part of incident response and
forensic analysis and this script can
automate processes that can ensure that
you have all the necessary data to
investigate security incidents
effectively so if I write here we can
ask this hacker gbt and I'm sure he will
provide the response for that and write
the script
so can you Pro provide a
script to collect system
logs for forensic
analysis so as I told you this is the
critical part of incident response and
we have covered about the tools that is
BB suit we have asked him about the
automation process General cyber
security question ethical hacking that
would be SQL injection attack and the
python script TOS can open ports on a
network so he can write scripts also
automation task and he could response
with the general cyber security
questions also and if you see here for
the incident response he has writed the
script to collect system logs for
forensic analysis so I won't be
explaining this code as we just looking
for the prompts that we can give to
ethical heg if you want you could just
ask him also that explain this code line
by
and here he has mentioned also the
explanation that is directories and
files to collect and after that he is
collecting the logs and that would be
copied in the directory that is he has
mentioned it a variable that is output
directory archiving logs clean up and
how to run the script so this was about
the incident response Now we move to
some Advanced topics and in advanced
topics what we can ask him is he how to
perform a man in the- Middle attack in a
controlled environment and and remember
this that you have to mention some of
the keywords that would be in a controll
environment and for that thing only he
will response or provide the response to
you so I will start here that how do I
perform a man in
the middle
attack in a control environment
so if you understand man in the midal
attack that works in a controlled
environment this can help you develop
better defenses against such attacks and
it's important to learn and practice
these techniques ethically so you can
see here that he's providing the
prerequisites and the stepbystep guide
how you can conduct a man in the middle
attack so first is set up the control
environment then install necessary tools
enable IP forwarding perform ARP
spoofing and then capture and analyze
traffic clean up and restore the network
and conclusion so you could just follow
with more prompts that I want more
information about setting up the control
environment just write this prompt and
this ethical Hecker GPT will provide
more responses to you so he will provide
you how you can set up the control
environment so now moving on we will ask
some more prompts and that could be
about the reverse engineering so we
could ask him that can you explain the
processes of reverse engineering a
malware sample or we can also ask about
honey port to detect malicious activity
that could be how can I Implement a
honey port to detect malicious activity
or what are the techniques for securing
a Docker container so we'll ask him one
prompt here let's see what he responds
to that so how can I
Implement
a honey port to detect malicious
activity so you could see that he has
started responding to that and if I tell
you the sum so a hyport is a security
mechanism set to detect deflect or in
mechanism to some manner and it
counteract attempts at unauthorized use
of Information Systems implementing a
honey Port can help you Monitor and
understand attack patterns and this is
the step-by-step guide to implement a
honey Port you can choose the type of
Honey Port prepare your environment
install and configure the hyport
software and these are all the commands
how you can configure it then you can
monitor and analyze the honey port and
regular maintenance and updates and this
is the simple handport using honey you
could install that and run these
commands so with that guys and in the
last we will also cover cyber security
policies and compliance so he could also
answer to those prompts also that you
can ask him that what should be included
in a company's cyber security policy and
you could mention which type of company
you are running so I will ask him that
so you could ask him that what should be
included
in know uh attech
companies cyber security
policy so let's
see so you could see here that creating
comprehensive security policy for an
atte company invols adding various
aspects and that would be introduction
first is the purpose for cyber security
policy scope rues and responsibilities
data protection and privacy Network
Security application security user
security awareness and training incident
response and management compliance and
legal requirements physical security
device and endpoint security so
similarly you could ask him that draft
me the company's cyber security policy
and start with the introduction so he
will provide you all the introduction
points and then you can ask him that
draft roles and responsibilities he will
draft that also so you could like break
it into parts and ask the ethical hacker
gbt and he will respond to you as it has
some limitations of some words and some
of the responses so you could ask him in
the breaking parts and he will respond
to you hey there Learners welcome to
Simply learn today we will see the
starting journey in cyber security that
is super exciting but can be a bit
daunting so to help you out we are going
to talk about some common mistakes that
beginners often make and how how you can
avoid them if you're just getting
started or looking to improve your
skills this guide will set you on the
right path so let's dive in and make
sure your cyber security career gets off
to a strong start so let's get started
and we'll see the worst beginner cyber
security mistakes everyone makes and
we'll start with the number one point
that is ignoring Basics so many
beginners rush into Advan topics without
mastering the basics which can lead to
confusion and frustration later on it's
a essential to build a strong Foundation
before diving into complex subjects if
we talk about number one is
understanding networking networking is
the backbone of cyber security learn how
data travels across networks different
types of networks like Lan and Van and
basic networking protocols knowing how
Network protocol functions help you
understand how attacks occur and how to
defend against them then comes mastering
operating systems so operating systems
are another critical area where whether
it's Windows Linux or Mac OS you need to
know how different OS work and learn
about file systems user management and
basic command line skills so this
knowledge is crucial for tasks like
malare analysis and system hardening
then comes the basic coding skills so
coding is an invaluable skill in cyber
security you can start with a simple
language like Python and learn how to
write scripts to automate task analyze
data and understand the logic behind
software vulnerabilities so basic
recording skills will help you
comprehend how attacks are carried out
and how to develop counter measures so
taking the time to master these Basics
will make advanced topics much easier to
understand and will set a solid
foundation for your career in cyber
security so remember it's a journey and
starting with the basics will ensure you
build strong lasting knowledge now we'll
come to number second point that is
skipping hands on practice so this is
also one of the cyber security mistakes
that beginners make cyber security isn't
just about Theory practical experience
is crucial and many beginners Focus too
much on reading and studying without
applying what they have learned this
creates a gap between knowledge and Real
World skills so the number one point
here is setting up a home lab so create
a home lab with an old computer or
virtual machine to practice what you
learn install different operating
systems set up networks and simulate
attacks in a controlled environment then
comes real world scenarios so use your
home lab to practice real world
scenarios like configuring fireballs and
detecting intrusions platforms like hack
the box and try hack me offer cyber
security challenges that mimic real life
networks and systems then comes building
confidence so Hands-On practice builds
confidence so solving real problems and
seeing the results of your actions make
you more comfortable with cyber security
tools and techniques and this confidence
is crucial when making quick informed
decision in this field so gaining
practical experience Bridges the gap
between theory and practice making you a
more effective and confident cyber
security professional so now we'll see
the third mistake that cyber security
beginners make that is lack of
documentation so documenting your work
is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect
of cyber security many beginners Focus
solely on learning new skills and
solving problems without keeping track
of their progress however good
documentation practices can can
significantly enhance your learning
experience and by keeping detailed notes
on what you learn the tools you use and
the methods you apply you create a
valuable resource for future reference
and this habit helps you review and
reinforce your knowledge making it
easier to remember complex Concepts
additionally well documented work allows
you to share your insights and solutions
with others whether through blogs
presentations or team collaborations it
also helps in troubleshooting as you can
quickly revisit your steps to identify
where something might have gone wrong so
in the professional World documentation
is essential for maintaining clear and
efficient communication within a team
and by starting this practice early you
will develop a habit that will benefit
you throughout your career and now we'll
move to the fourth cyber security
mistake for beginners that is waiting
too long to start applying for jobs so
common mistake many beginners make is
waiting until they feel perfectly
qualified before applying for cyber
security jobs this approach can be
counterproductive the truth is you might
never feel completely ready and waiting
too long can cause you to miss out on an
valuable opportunity so start applying
for jobs early in your Learning Journey
the process of applying and interviewing
is a learning experience in itself it
helps you understand what employers are
looking for and it can highlight areas
where you need to improve so early job
applications also provide you with real
world feedback and networking
opportunities remember many entry level
positions are designed for people who
are still learning and growing in this
field so employers often value
enthusiasm willingness to learn and
problem solving skills as much as they
do technical knowledge so by starting
early you can gain experience and build
confidence even if you are not yet
perfectly qualified and then comes the
next mistake that is trying to qualify
for all jobs so in the vast field of
cyber security trying to qualify for
every job out there is a common but
misguided approach cyber security
encompasses a wide range of specialities
from network security and ethical
hacking to incident response and
security analysis instead of spreading
yourself thin trying to learn everything
focus on a key few areas and become
proficient in them specializing in
special Fields make you more valuable to
potential employers it's better to be an
expert in one or two areas than to have
superficial knowledge in many so by
focusing on specific skills you can
develop a better understanding and
expertise that sets you apart from
others so this focused approach also
makes it easier to stay updated with the
latest trends and advancements in your
choosen areas remember depth of
knowledge often outweighs bread when it
comes to career advancement and job
satisfaction so this was all about
trying to qualify for all jobs now we'll
see the biggest mistake that is it
Foundation fallacy so many aspiring
service Security Professionals believe
they need a deep IT background to start
their career this is same as the number
one point but this is a misconception
while having a solid foundation in it
can be beneficial it's not a
prerequisite for success in cyber
security what you need are the specific
skills and practical experience focus on
learning about networks operating system
and security tools engage in Hands-On
practice through labs and simulations to
build Real World skills cyber security
is a field where practical knowledge and
the ability to apply Concepts matter
more more than theortical it knowledge
and many successful cyber Security
Professionals come from diverse
backgrounds including those with minimal
it experience so they succeed by
continuing learning and adapting to New
Challenges so don't let the lack of deep
it Foundation hold you back concentrate
on gaining the skills and experience
that are directly relevant to the cyber
security roles you are interested in now
moving to number seven that is not
attending cyber security events so
attending cyber security events is one
of the best ways to stay updated and
connected in the field these events
including conferences webinars and
meetups offer a wealth of information on
the latest trends tools and threats in
cyber security they provide a platform
to learn from experts gain insights into
industry developments and discover new
technologies additionally these events
are excellent networking opportunities
meeting other professionals that can
lead to job opportunities collaborations
and mentorship building a network within
the cyber security Community can provide
support and guidance throughout your
career and many events also offer
Hands-On workshops and training sessions
that can enhance your practical skills
so by actively participating in these
events you can demonstrate your
commitment to continuous learning and
professional development make it a habit
to attend cyber security events
regularly to stay engaged and informed
so this was all about number seventh
point that is not attending cyber
security events now moving to number
eight that is obsessing or which
specialization to choose so when
starting a career in cyber security many
beginners obsess over which
specialization to choose this can be
overwhelming and counterproductive
instead of stressing about making the
perfect choice allow yourself the
freedom to explore different areas of
cyber security the field is diverse with
specializations like penetration testing
incident Response Security analysis and
more take the time to experiment with
various topics and see what interest you
the most this exploration phase is
valuable for gaining a broad
understanding of this field so over time
you will naturally gravitate toward
areas that align with your strengths and
interest so remember your specialization
can evolve as you gain more experience
and insights early in your career focus
on building a solid foundation and
gaining exposure to different aspects of
cyber security this approach allows you
to make an informed decision about your
specialization when the time comes
