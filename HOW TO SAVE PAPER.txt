yeah hi friends welcome you all to
address conquer now I'm here to alert
you few important aspects related to all
the site ok how you need to utilize it
how you need to save it how you need to
do the things in a smarter way
ok first of all you need to open the
site WWE and ps4 koat.com
ok make a note it's not envious of the
doctor right now we'll be using this
site forever one out of the two months
so once it is done we'll be updating the
site so again we'll be posting a new
video recording the updates and that
modification is what we are planning for
ok so first of all you need to log in
you need to press the login button ok
then you need to login with the
credentials whatever we are kids ok we
have given you password and using it and
you need to use that credential and you
need to lock ok so before you press the
login button make sure that we press the
word remember me
ok or save your password so once your
login ok your account will be open this
is what the home base and if the on the
whole face your name will be displayed
off these are the options that are we we
are happy we are providing you on the
side and refer Billy use the remember my
password so whatever link we are posting
on the group for example you can
directly go take exams you can see the
exams that are present on the site right
now that 10 exams are all present on the
site so you can go with any of these
exemptions by clicking on this this the
question bar will be open ok so that is
one one thing and all and preferably the
mentor is going to post few question
papers that have to be must done and the
URL will be posted in the group that's
what the URL just posted on the group
you can directly click on the URL and if
you password and username are saved the
question paper will be directly open
that's what the question type of order
day so the questions and everything ok
are there and how you need to solve ok
so there are few options like continue
save review ok leave about all these
options
patience may be different for different
examinations going to be different for
aims and it's going to be different for
need but make sure that anyway we'll
give a mock exam in the aim side and
then in the need sight before you we go
with the exam right so because every
year they're modifying few sort of
software's according to the examination
but before going to the examination a
month before or 15 days before we they
are going to provide a mock exam so
that's not an issue so whatever we are
answering we need to mark it okay if you
can use a safe word if you're using a
sale I mean the color demarcation will
be a bit different okay if you are
keeping it under review the color will
be different if you are going with
continuous okay this is these are all
secondary options right now is this mark
so once you're done with the entire
examination once you're done with all
the questions you you are going to for
example and this okay I'm just marking
two questions here okay and I'm just
submitting so once you're done with the
examination you should submit so this is
going to give an idea if you are done
with if you if you are right in the
question it's going to give a green
color tick mark okay and York right
answer will be in the green color and if
you're going for a wrong question
if the into will be there wrong answer
and your right answer will be in green
color and the option what your template
will be in the red color okay so this is
almost like similar pattern to many of
the examinations where the key will be
out but now we have three examinations
one of the key is out so this is a
better to make you understand while you
are going to the revision because you
already did this question right that a
question number one you are perfect so
whenever you're going through the
revision you can just go with a question
number four where you went wrong so once
you're done with the question paper this
is this is the pushing paper with
answers okay how to save this simple way
is just like selected ctrl C just go
with an MS Word open a new MS Word
control and the same
controller and you're just pasting it so
it is pasted so when when you are
planning a revision when you want to
recap the same pepper you can just just
go with wrong options what you went I
mean you can just go with the revision
of the wrong questions rather than the
right questions and if you want to add
on few synopsis you can just add on in
your ms word and if you want printer you
can take printer or if you want to say
you can just sell for a better
preference II if you it will be good if
you say with the name like P Rio and
prefer Bunny the date okay much 13th
okay even just saved I think this is a
simplest way of doing the things right
so I hope you're very clear so if you
want to have a look over the exams that
are available right now on the side take
exam you can just click on the button
take the exam and you can just log in to
any of these these examinations and you
can finish the exam off and one more
important thing like the examinations or
the practice paper that are available on
the site will be similar to the schedule
right now we are dealing with video so
there are three practice paper software
available so after two days we will be
entering the prosthodontics so the
prosthodontics papers will be available
on the site right so once the pros fall
and / you're done with the exemption
done with our weekend examination there
will be again Brainerd
ok the new papers will be uploaded
according to the schedule and once again
if period and pros are coming in the
second round of revision these papers
will be again uploaded so just try to
follow the main intention of keeping the
practice sessions according to Shivan is
very clear once you're planning to give
an examination if you open take take
example if there are 200 to 300 or
examinations available on the site you
will be in a state of panic of course
you will be you don't know what to you
you don't know I mean you'll be in a
state of confusion
okay 240 when I will complete this that
question
the summertime so the main intention is
to make things incremental okay you will
have all your foods in increments right
five or six increments every day so for
us you'll have at a short in single
increment seem to seem too similar to
that will go with the schedule will the
will renewal the papers will more will
will change the map as a coordinate so
that's what that's what it's not about
like providing you limited so my main
intention is to provide you more than
five to six hundred odd examinations
before going to the final exam that's
what because majority of the online test
series or method of the other offline
coaching Center people the max Q 400 max
Fenig some specs but my intention is
very clear and open we will be exposing
you like if you are ready to get exposed
to the question papers more than 500
examinations is the plan of MDS conquer
for this year I hope you guys are ready
for that all the best and I think like
this video will definitely unlike you
about the strategy and about the easiest
way of doing things we are not going to
provide any previous papers because
there are few issues material and
everything will be updated or updated
within one or two months and probably
the only key option that is available on
the side and that is useful is take
exams and all the examinations what you
need to give it must will be the URLs
will be posted on the group thank you
all hope you have a better plans of
working more and more for a better
success and I hope this video will
definitely help at least like few people
thank you all MDS
