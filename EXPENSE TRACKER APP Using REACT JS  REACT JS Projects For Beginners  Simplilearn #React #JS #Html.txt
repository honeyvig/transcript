is mentioned in the description box
below and pin comment so without any
further Ado let's get started so guys
let's start with the expense tracker so
first we'll see the output exactly what
we are going to make so for that we'll
open the
projects that is expense Tracker
2
so this is our project
and let's make it live so this is our
expense
tracker and has some balance in it so
these are the
tractions transactions sorry uh now it's
free and you can enter anything that
would be the transaction subject
as
transport and in this I like paid the
amount so I will write in the amount
deducted and that would be around
30 and it has set the current balance
Asus
$30 and in the amount deducted $30 and
you could see the transactions that is
in expense and we have made it in the
red
section so so if you want to say like
you have credit your salary and that
would be
$330,000 okay so you want to add the
transaction it has added and the income
has added and now the current balance is
$29,990 so this is our expense tracker
so let's start making
this and close
this
so first let's create a folder for
this and we'll create a
folder we name it
okay so inside we will create one more
folder and name it as expense
tracker and and don't worry guys I will
copy paste the codee for you in the
description box so you could easily
access
it until
then our folder is ready now we'll open
the command
prompt and open the visual studio
code so you could use
any that is ID I will be using the
visual studio code and as I have been
using it since a great
time so you can use anyone that you have
Anson so let's start guys so you have
seen the output and now we will start
creating the index file that would be
index.html
file so you could also like integrate
the extensions here that would be the go
live server and you would only click
here and it will
automatically open the page in the
browser else you can just save it and
open it in any
browser so here we'll start the
HTML and starting
with so do type HTML and this tells the
web browser that we are using HTML 5 so
the latest standard for
HTML and after
that we'll write
HTML to
en okay and here we begin our HTML
document and specify that we'll be using
English so for that we have written this
syntax and now moving to
head we'll open the head
tag and here we'll set the meta
character set that would be to ensure
our page uses the Universal Character
set which includes most characters from
all known
languages so for
that write Meta Care
set
and that would be UTF
8
okay and after that we'll set the meta
name equal to viewport and we'll set the
content and device width also and we'll
set the initial scale so this will help
our page look good on all devices
whether it's a phone tablet or computer
so for that we'll write here that would
be
meta name equal to
viewport and after
that content equal
to
so the content would be width equal to
so I'll just increase the size of this
also so you guys could
easily see okay so I think now the size
is
fine okay so now moving on what we are
doing we are setting the width so width
would be equal to the device
width so it will be compatible with any
device
and after that we'll set the initial
scale and that would be equal to
1.4
okay and we'll close
this
now moving on we'll set the meta HTTP
equivalent so this is for older Internet
Explorer browsers to render the page
using the highest mode
available so we'll set this so if
someone is opening in the older internet
browser so he could also access this
page so for that we'll write
meta HTTP equivalent equal
to minus UA
compatible
and
content equal
to I = to
H and now we'll set the style sheet that
would be we will link a CSS file and
we'll name it at style. CSS which is
like the clothing for a page so it will
make everything look nice so for that
first we'll create the file and name it
that style. CSS okay and in the
index.html here we will just paste the
link for it that would be for the Styles
sheet so for that we'll
write
okay not
CSS okay and now moving
on we'll set the
title
and we'll set the title as expense
tracker
only so if you want all in caps you
could do that or else you could use the
running
one so here we'll close the head and
we'll start with the
body so if you guys want you could use
use the go live
option and see the
progress
simultaneously so we have just written
the head that is expense tracker so it's
here now moving back we start with the
body
and
here in the center tag we will add the
heading and we'll use the h2 tag for the
expense
tracker
okay
no
so you could see the progress
simultaneously and expense tracker is
here now moving back we will start a div
here so I put the title and expense
tracker in the center of the page so
everyone knows what this page is about
now we'll create a
diff and we'll name the class as
container only think of this as a big
box that holds all the parts of our
expense d
so we are creating this div for the
purpose now moving back we'll create the
div class and name it as
container
okay and
inside we'll use the H4
tag
for the current
balance
as you have seen the output so we'll
make the same output only and here it
would be the current balance we could
just make it in the same line only it
need not to be in this
indentation it could work on that also
and in this also now we'll use the H1
tag and give it an ID that would be
balance so it would be the current
balance
okay and currently we'll set it as
dollar
0.0
okay so now in this div only as this is
the main container we will create
another
div so for the current balance the H4
heading so this is a smaller title that
tells us next number is our current
balance and then we used the H1 tag this
is where we see how much money we have
starting and we will start it at
$0.0 then we see two sections we'll
create the two sections side by side
inside div only and name the
class we'll see like what we'll name it
and so in the first div we will make the
amount
credited
so where we will see how much money we
got and in the second if we will make
the money minus or to show how much
money we
spent so let's create
that so we'll create another
div and name the
class
is
that will be
inrease exponential
container or you could name
anything I would be naming
this and inside we'll create one more
Dev
and inside we'll use the H4
heading and that would be for amount
credited
okay and inside this only we'll have a
paragraph
tag and we'll give it an
ID that would be money
plus
okay and we'll have a class
here and make it as money plus
only so what it will do it will add it
so we
will make
that okay here we have closed the
paragraph tag then the div tag and
another div tag so so this is one of the
div for the amount credited and
similarly we'll create another div for
amount
deducted so let's create another div and
this would be for the amount
deducted so we'll create an H4
tag and here write amount
deducted okay simultaneously I will show
you guys what we are making so you could
see the current balance and that we have
set it to do 0.0 and we have set amount
credited that we have made and now we
are making amount
deducted okay
similarly so okay amount deducted and in
this we'll also use the paragraph tag
and give it an
ID and we'll name the ID as money
minus
okay and we'll name the class
here that would be money
minus and set it as minus dollar 0.0
okay so it's done and this Dev is
closed
now so let's
see what we have to create so this is
our expense
tracker that we'll be
creating and this is what we have made
till now so you could see that we have
set the current balance amount credited
amount deducted and now we'll set add
new transaction so we are creating the
HTML file here we'll just structure it
we'll add all the fields here and after
that using the CSS we will modify it and
make the color blue and have these boxes
or the cards and using the JavaScript we
will add the
functionality so let's first complete
the HTML file so we have closed the div
here and
now let's
see we'll start with the add new new
transaction okay we'll create this now
so moving back we'll use H3 tag heading
three and write add new
transaction okay that tag is closed now
we'll uh open a form here and give an
ID and we'll give the ID form only now
now inside we'll create a
div
and to the class we'll name it as form
control and inside this div we will add
a
label that would be label
4 and that would be text only
we set that transaction subject so what
transaction you want so you could add in
the transaction
subject so you could see here that we
have added the add new transaction and
then the transaction
subject okay moving
back we have created this label and for
this label add the in
type
okay so for this input type would be
text and we'll give the
ID that would
be
text and we'll have a
placeholder so Place Holder will work
that would be we'll just write enter
text and it would be showing the persons
that you have to enter text here
sorry so enter text or we could just
write enter the transaction
subject
okay
and
we'll close this
tag and now we'll go and see once you
could see that here is the
label that is transaction subject and
here is its input type similarly we will
create amount credited and amount
deducted so going back here the divis
closed and we'll create another div and
this would be in the form only so we'll
create another div that would be for the
amount
credited so inside this
div we will give it a
class and name as form control
only and create a label
here so level
four WR income
test
okay and inside we'll write amount
credited and here the label is
closed
and then we'll have the input type here
and for the form of number as this is
the amount credited and we'll give a ID
here and we'll name the ID
as uh income text only
okay you could give
any and then
we'll have a
placeholder and here we can write enter
the amount
credited
okay and here we will close this
stag so you would see that the div is
closed here and this is this div
okay so let's see here what we have
created we have created the amount
credited and similarly we will create
for amount debited so we'll copy paste
it and here in this we we have created
another div and then class we have named
it form control
only and instead of income text we'll
write here expense text and amount
deducted
and now coming to the input
type so it would be number only and
we'll change the
ID that would be expense text and for
the
placeholder we'll write and enter
expense amount or enter deducted amount
or enter amount
deducted so it's done
let's see so you could see that it has
added the three labels and the three
input
types so now moving
back what we'll create here now is
transactions so it will be the
transactions history and then we'll
create the add transaction
button so let's get back to our
ID so this will also be in this form
only and after this
div we will
have H3 tag
and in that will write
transactions and in the we'll create a
unordered list
here
okay so we'll create an unordered list
and we'll give it an
ID and give this ID name that would be
list and a
class and name the class also as
list so this H3 tag in these
transactions so this will be a list of
all the transactions we have credited or
debited now we are creating the
unordered list
so it would be like the treasure chest
where we'll keep all the transactions
recorded So so class equal to
list we have closed the another list but
before that to create the treasure chest
we'll add some functionality to it so
for
this we'll
have and inside we'll have a light and
we'll have a class
here and name it as minus so if you want
to stract any transactions or if you
want to cancel any transactions so you
can do
it from here and for that we are adding
the
functionality and create a span
here so write minus
400 and close the
span and now we'll create a
button and have a
class name it as delete
button
okay close
this
and place
the that would be the X symbol on which
we'll click and the transactions will be
deducted from there that will be removed
from there and now we create close the
button so we have closed the button
tag and now we'll close the all
tag
and the unordered list tag is closed
here now going back and you could see
the transactions here as you add the
transactions it would be displayed here
and if you want to cancel the
transactions you would just click on the
X that would be if you over it you will
go the x button if you click on that
that transactions will be
gone so now we'll add the button that
will be the add
transactions so let's get back to the
ID so after unordered list we will add a
button
so
we have a class and name it as
button and for the
button so button will be displayed with
ADD
transaction so we created the button for
the functionality we'll add the
functionality in the Javascript file so
we will create like close the form oh we
have
so here we'll close the
form okay and then we have the div tag
that is the main container tag that has
been
closed and
now the body is closed and the HTML is
closed so now we'll move to the CSS file
and here we'll create a Javascript file
also now only
script.js okay and we'll add this file
in HTML also so like after the div tag
we can add
it and for that we could write script
SRC that is script
Source equal
to
script.js and we have close the script
tag okay so this is our HTML file now we
will Design
This so let's move and create the CSS
file so let's create the CSS file and
first we'll import two fonts that would
be let to an open sense from Google
fonts it's like choosing two different
styles of handwriting for a web page so
for that we'll write at theate import
URL and inside this we'll paste the URL
for that and I have that URL let's
see where it is so you could use any URL
so I have the link
here so I paste it so this is the URL
for the
fonts
now now we'll create a root so this
would be like setting up a box of
crayons with specific colors that you
can use throughout your coloring book or
the web page so let's create a root
here okay okay so to close
it coming
back here's a
root and inside this
root we will create the variable name
and then the color for them so that will
Define a color that you can use later by
just mentioning its name so I'll show
you guys how I will do that so that
would be minus
minus
so for a box
Shadow write z
and that would be 1 pixel and 3
pixel
and B
GBA
inside right comma Z
comma
okay 0 1
pixel 2
pixel and
rgba that would
be 0
0a 0.24 so these are the
coding num so you could just have them
or search on the web and you could
Define it for your like Shadows colors
and for what you want to
use so now we'll set the primary color
for our expense
tracker okay so the primary color we
will set it as blue okay
coming blue so here we will write
the code for
the blue color that is
349 as I already remember the color
codes you could just see on the web and
use them now for the secondary
color so second color that would be
subtle
gray so for that we'll write the
code E7 E7 E7
okay and then we add the asent
color so asent color will Define as
red so for that we'll write
E7 4
c3c
and then we have H
Color if someone
HS that would
be
hash
2980
B9 so that would be the hor state color
and then for
the background of
income we'll Define a green background
for
it okay so for that we'll write the code
that would be D FF 0
d8 and then we'll have the expense
background
and for that we'll write the
code then
F2 d
d so this is the light red background
for expenses and then we'll have the
section
background so for that we'll Define the
color that would be the light background
for
sections so for that we have F9 F9
F9 okay and we have to close all
these
okay okay so we have defined the root
here and now moving on we will have the
box sizing so here we will tell every
element in our web page to include the
padding and Border in the elements total
width and height making it easier to
size things so for that we'll write the
syntax
star and here we'll write the Box
sizing and we'll set the Border
box
okay and after that we
will and now we set the entire color for
the like we'll set the background color
for our entire page and we'll choose the
open science font for all the text so
it's like a picking a paper color and
deciding what pen to use for writing so
for
that in the
[Music]
body first we'll set the background
color and that will set as white only so
for that we'll write the
code uh hasht F4 F4
F4
so
and now we'll set the font
family so set the font family for the
whole
body uh for that we'll
write font
family and inside we'll write open
sense
and and we can
write use this
font okay and we'll set the
color great
okay and now we go for the
container so this will style a box or D
on a page to have a maximum width of
we'll set the maximum width of 600
pixels that would be centered with the
margin and padding around it so it's
like drawing a rectangle in the middle
of a paper for main picture Okay so for
that we'll have the
Styles the
container first we'll set the max width
and that would be 600
pixels and we set the
margin that would be 20 pixels and that
would be Auto for
it and then we'll have the
padding that would be 20
pixels
okay so after setting the
container we will set
the color
and margin for the headings that would
be we have used heading tags
so we have used H1 H2 H3 H4 or any tags
so for
that we'll write H1 H2 H3
H4 and for
these we'll set the
margin as 10
pixels and font weight we'll set as bold
only
okay so now we'll set the transaction
card styling so the list we have created
Li so for that we'll write the
CSS so do list
Li so first we'll set the background
color so this part will style each item
in your list Al and they look like cards
with rounded Corners that will make a
Shadow to make them pop off of the page
and there will be a special left border
that changes color depending on the type
of
transactions so for that we'll write the
CSS so first we'll set the background
color
so we'll set the variable background
color for that
and we'll set the
section background okay and then we'll
set the Border
radius and that would be 8
pixels and and then we'll set the Box
Shadow and set the
variable box
Shadow and then we'll set the left
border there would be five
pixels and solid
variable and we'll set it as primary
color here we'll use these that we have
set in the
starting so we'll set the margin from
bottom and we'll set it as 10
pixels okay and now I'll set the
padding and padding also 10
pixels and now we'll have the list style
type and the
transition so no we won't add it so none
for it and then we have the
transition so transition will set
transform and that would be 0.3
seconds and that would be at e is
okay so they have set it for
list
and now we'll set for list li+ Li minus
so these lines give different background
colors to the list items that is cards
depending on whether they are adding or
subtracting
so for them uh if it's
adding so list
Li not
plus we'll set the background
color and that would
be
ausense background
okay and
now no no uh for li+ we'll set as income
background
okay and for the
minus we'll set the background color
that will be expense
background but we have set
earlier
and you set the Border left corner also
minus minus uh we have set the asent
color
okay and now we'll set the for also that
would be this will make each list item
slightly bigger when you hold your mouse
over it so giving it a neat interactive
effect I hold
and for this we have transform and we'll
set the
scale as 1.0 uh3 only okay it would be
sufficient for that and now we'll add
the CSS for button and interactive
elements so these styles are for the
buttons on your page and they get a nice
background color rounded corners and
we'll change color when you overload
them so for
that we'll
write note
button and delete
button so first we'll set the background
color and we'll set
as table and primary
color
okay for the button we'll set the color
as white
only and then we'll set the Border
padding so border would be
none so for
padding let's set the padding as 10
pixels and Border radius so those would
be
rounded we set the Border radius as 5
pixels and then we'll set the cursor and
set the cursor as
poter okay and then we have the
transition and set it
as background
color and set the transation at
0.3 e
okay so these we have set it for buttons
and
now we can set it for button hovers also
so now we'll add the CSS for button H
and delete button H so that would be for
the h
only so for that we write
button
h
delete button over and inside we'll set
the background
color and we'll set it as variable H
Color that we have already defined
above and after that we
will add the CSS for input
types so now we'll add the CSS for input
types and this will change the Border
color of input fields to the primary
color when you click on them or tab into
them making it clear when you are typing
so we have have the placeholders for the
input
types but we'll change the CSS then
you'll click on that or just tab on that
so they will just have a clear input box
so for that we'll add the CSS
that would
be
input and the type would
be
text and then we have
input and the
type is equal
to
number and for these we'll set the
Border as 1 pixel
and
solid and the color
is
variable secondary
color and after that we'll set the
padding for
this and that would be 10
pixels and then the Border
radius
so we'll set the Border radius as 5
pixels and then the margin
bottom and set as 10
pixels and then the
transition that is
bolor would be 0.3
and
E so you
could see
this let's refresh
it so let's complete our CSS file and
after these input type
focus and for the text also We'll add
one more CSS that would be
we will just copy from here
only add the
focus and inside we'll set the Border
color variable and
inside primary uh not the primary color
or you could just set the primary color
only
okay
and after this we'll set the section
background and
padding
so for that so we'll add the styles for
several sections of our page giving them
a light background color padding and
rounded corners for a software more
organized
look so for that we'll add that so just
see what will
do
so the classes we have defined in the
HTML file we will use
them and the form control also for that
also we'll add the CSS so it would have
a nice crisp
View and the list
items so for that first we'll set the
background color and we'll set as
section background but we have set
earlier
okay so section
background and after that we'll add the
padding and padding is 15
pixels and after that we'll add the
Border radius and margin
bottom and we'll add the Border radius
as 8
pixels and then the margin bottom
as 15
pixels and now we'll add for the
typographic
enhancement so this will make the
smaller headings and labels Stand Out by
coloring them and making them
bold so let's add the CSS for
this so for H4 and label that would be
the small heading and the label
we'll add the
color and that would be the primary
color
only and after that we'll add the font
we that would be
bold okay and after this for the media
screen this will be a responsive design
feature it makes sure that your
container box
adjust its size for smaller screens like
phone so the container we have created
for that we'll do the
CSS
and for that we'll set the media
screen and the max
width and we'll set it as 768
pixels okay
and he'll call the
container the whole
container and inside we'll set the
width as
90% and padding as 10
pixels okay
so this is a CSS
file and
let's dispose the previous server and
make it live again so we have added the
CSS and now let's
see first we'll add the JavaScript and
then we'll see what changes we have
quote on
this so so let's start with our
JavaScript file and here we'll add the
functionality so first we'll access all
the HTML
elements so for that we will create the
constants to get the HTML elements where
we show the current balance so to show
the current
balance we have the constant balance
variable and here we will use document
get element by
ID and that would be balance
only
so similarly we will add for the other
constants and now we will add for the
money
plus so that would
be what amount we are adding so money
plus and then we'll add for the money
minus
and then for the
list
and after that for
form and then
text
and then for
amount after that we'll add it for in
income text and expense
text expense
text
so we have called all the constants or
we have accessed all the HTML
elements so we have grabbed the place
where we will show the total income that
is money plus and then we have for the
sport where we will display the total
expenses so the first one is for the
current balance then we'll show the
total income money plus and then we'll
display the total expenses that would be
minus money minus and then where all the
transactions will be shown that would be
the list and then we have the form
element where we enter new transactions
and then we have the
text and the text input in the form that
is not used in this snippet and then we
have money sorry uh
amount so it is the amount input in the
form that is know also not used in the
snippet and then we have income text
that grabs the input field for entering
income and then we have expense text
that is used for the input field where
you enter expenses and now we will work
with the local storage so we have to
retrieve any safe transactions from the
browser's local storage and converts
them from a Json string back into an
array of transaction objects so for that
we'll use the Json door pass and use the
local storage to get items so for that
we'll write
and create
const local storage
transactions that would be equal to
json.
pass and
inside we'll
use local
storage Lo get item
and inside we'll pass
transactions so this we use the local
storage and now and now we'll create uh
transactions so if there are any safe
transactions in local storage or if they
are so we can use them otherwise or it
starts with an empty list so for that
will create
let and
transactions equal
to local
storage get
item and inside we'll pass
transactions and that is not equal to
null
and local storage
transactions so this is what we have
done that will check if there are any
safe transactions in local storage if
there are it uses them otherwise it
starts with an empty list okay so now
we'll add the transaction
functions so the first function We'll
add would be add transaction only so
this function will run when a new
transaction is submitted so we'll create
the function
here so
function add
transaction e do and we'll use the
prevent default
okay
and after that
we'll like we'll use the F stoop for
handling income
input that would be so we have used e do
PR default that stops the form from
submitting in the default way which
would reload the page and then we have
the function then checks if the income
and expense fields are not empty and
creates transaction objects with an ID
description and amount so if the amount
is an income it's added as a positive
number if it's an expense it's added as
a negative number so for that we will
create
that inside this function only we'll use
the handling income input so for that
we'll write if income. text. val. trim
and that is not equal to n null
sorry
so
so inside we will declare a variable
constant income
transaction
and that would be equal
to inside we'll give it an
ID generator
ID or generate
ID and the
text is
income and then
amount that would be
plus
income text do valum it will add it to
that and we will close it here and then
we'll push the
transactions so transactions.
push and inside we'll pass the income
transaction that we have got the trans
transaction and then we'll add the
transaction
Dome and inside we'll pass the income
transaction okay so we have done it for
the income input and and similarly we'll
do it for the expense input
and for that we'll just copy
it and use it similarly for the expense
input
so now we'll do it for the expense
input so expense. text value. trim and
then we have expense
transaction and we have generate ID and
and instead of income we'll write the
expense and here we are adding plus
income text we
will minus
expense text to value and here will
transaction don't push expense
transaction and similarly in the add
transaction Dome we will
pass the expense
transaction so here now we'll update the
values and update the local storage
every
time so trans repeat so transactions.
push it adds the new transaction to the
list of transactions and at transaction
Dome it updates the web page to show the
new
transaction and then we have update
values that we'll do so it will
recalculate the balance total income and
total
expenses for
that just write update
values and then we'll update the local
storage so that will save the updated
list of transactions to the local
storage so we'll write update
local
storage and it will update it for
that okay and we have not CL the if so
we'll close it
here and then we'll clear the input
Fields also after adding one transaction
will clear the input Fields so finally
it will clear the input Fields so they
are ready for the the next transaction
entry so for that we'll
write income
text do
value and that would be set it to null
after the
transaction and similarly for the
expense text
value that two would be set as null
after the
transaction and then we'll get the
document do get element by
ID
and the
text do
value so the text that is the
transaction subject for that value also
that would be restore to
default okay now we'll generate a random
ID so this function will create a random
number to use as an ID for each
transaction ensuring each one is unique
so for the transaction
ID we'll generate
it so we'll write a function for that so
we'll create a
function and name it as generate ID
so for that will generate a random
transaction ID we'll use the
math
and
Flo and to generate a random number
we'll use the random
function so now we will create another
function that would be add transaction
do so this function adds a new
transaction to the web
page so we'll create the function for
that and let's start with
it so
function and we'll name it as at
transaction Dome and inside we'll pass
the
transaction
okay and
inside first we'll create a constant
sign and we'll determine whether to show
a minus 4 expense or a plus 4 income so
for that we'll write declare a
constant or a variable named as
sign
so transaction do
amount if it's less than
zero then
minus
[Music]
else
plus okay so we have defined for the
sign and now we'll create element that
will create a new list item for the
transactions so for
that we will declare a
variable
item
and use document do create element
okay we'll use the create
element and and inside we'll pass the
list
and here we will add a class to the item
for styling depending on whether it's
income or
expense so for
that we'll use item do class
list note add and
here transaction amount
that will be transaction do
amount and if it's less than
zero then
minus else Plus
and here we will set the HTML inside the
list item showing the transaction text
amount and a delete button so for that
we'll use the item do inner
HTML that would be equal
to that we'll write
dollar transaction.
text
and we span
here so first we'll write The
Sign
then L then we
have math do absolute function
and inside we'll pass the transaction
amount so transaction do
amount and here the span
closes and now we'll move to the button
class so what show transaction do
text okay span
started
okay okay for HTML we have used the back
link or back
comma and
here we will create the button class
CL use the delete
button and we'll set the functioning on
click that is to remove the
transaction
and inside we'll
pass the transaction note
ID and
here the crow symbol or the X symbol it
will be used
to remove the
transaction and now close the
button now we will append the child
or for
list and pass the item through
it so we have added the new list item to
the transaction list on the
page with the list out append child so
now we will create another function that
will update the balance income and
expenses so we'll create a function and
name it as update
values so let's progress with that we'll
create a function and name it as update
values and we will create a variable and
name it as amounts
and what it will do
is it will create an array of all
transaction
amounts so with that we have created a
variable amounts and inside
we'll write transactions do
map and
inside pass
transaction
transaction do
amount and then we will create another
variable that will be
constant
total so that would be equal to amounts.
reduce so
inside
pass
item not to fixed and inside we will
pass
two so we have created an arrow of all
transaction amounts and then we have
created a variable
total and that would be calculate the
total
balance and now we will create a
variable income and calculate the total
expenses so the three lines will update
the web page to show the calculated
total income and expenses so let's
create the variable
income and that would be equal to
amounts do
filter inside we'll pass
item so if item is greater than
zero
4315 and now we'll use to
ruce and inside we pass count and
item and that would
be plus equal to
item and then we'll use the two fixed
and pass it as
two and now we'll update the balance do
in a
text and that would be equal
to dollar
dollar and
inside
total
and then money uncore
plus
do inner
text equal
to l dollar dollar
income and then we have money minus do
in
text
and that to equal
to dollar
dollar
expense
so these three lines will update the web
page to show the calculat total and
income and
expenses and now we'll create another
function that would be the remove
transaction and inside we'll pass the ID
for that so let's create a
function
so function and we'll name it as remove
transaction and inside we'll pass the
ID so inside
this
so
transactions equal to transaction
filter note ID and that is not equal
to and after that we'll update the local
store
storage and use the inet
function
okay and now we'll create the function
to update the local storage so in this
what we have done is we have removed the
transaction with the given ID from the
list and we'll save the updated list to
the local storage and reinitialize the
app to update the
UI now we'll create a update local
storage function so this function saves
the current state of transactions to
local
storage so for this we'll create a
function update local
storage and inside we'll use local
storage set
item and inside we'll pass
transactions and Json note sting
IFI and inside we'll pass the
transactions
and after updating we will initialize
the app that will reconsider it so we
have converted the transactions array to
a Json string and Sav it to the
browser's local storage now we create
the init function so this will
initialize the app when it loads or
needs to be updated so for that we'll
create a function function
init and inside
this we will use list do inner
HTML and then we'll use
transactions for
each and pass the add transaction
Dome and then we'll update the
values
and here we will call the init
function and now we'll ensure the doome
is fully
loaded so the first that is list out in
our HTML it will clear the transaction
list on the web page and then this
transaction for each it will add each
transaction to the web page and this
will update the displayed totals and now
we'll add the event listeners
so first We'll
add
document
dot at event L
now and inside we'll
pass do content
loaded comma
function
so inside this we'll add another that
would be form. add event now and in
inside we will pass
submit comma
function and inside will prevent
default
and now we'll call the transaction
function that would be add
transaction and then we'll clear the
input fields that would
be income text do
value that would be equal
to and X P to text
value we'll close
this
and
this
so the first one that is document add
event listener it waits for the web page
to load before adding the submit event
listener to the form
and this form. add event listener it
adds an event listener to handle form
submissions and E do prevent default it
prevents the default form submission
action and the add transaction function
it calls the function to add a new
transaction and this will clear the
input fields for income and expense and
now we'll add another event listner that
would be form dot add event listener and
inside we'll pass
submit and add
transaction so this will add an event
listener to the form for the submit
event calling add transaction when the
form is submitted so here our project is
complete and it's showing so you could
see that
our
project is ready and you could add any
transaction subject that could
be
movie and the amount deducted for movie
was
$60 and I pressed the enter or you could
just add transaction and it will
automatically move
there and you could add any subject that
could be salary
credited man amount credited could be
$4,000 so this is our expense trackers
