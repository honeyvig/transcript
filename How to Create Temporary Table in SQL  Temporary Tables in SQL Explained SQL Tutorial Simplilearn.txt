hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel in the session we will
learn about the temp tables in SQL but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
Technologies if you're a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn now now without
further Ado let's get started with our
onepoint agenda that is temp tables in
SQL so what exactly are temp tables in
SQL so temp table is a temporary table
so the term temporary is
self-explanatory you know that every
database in SQL has tables right now
let's say you created 10 tables in your
database and you close your MySQL
workbench you you close your database
and you restart it after a while and
then you will have all your 10 tables
intact in your database but temporary
table is not like that it is something
different which has its existence until
the session of the database is running
let's say you open the database now you
have the session of the database running
you created the 11th table as a
temporary table and that particular 11th
temporary table will be existing in the
database only until the current database
is running and active once you close it
once you turn it off or once you
restarted the temporary 11th table that
you created will die or it will be
eliminated so that is the meaning of
temp table now let's see how we can
create a temporary
table so the syntax is completely
similar to the temporary or to the table
what we usually create right it is
similar to the table what we regularly
create but the only catches we will be
using the keyword temporary create
temporary table table name which is US
defined name and inside that the
parameters may be the employe ID student
ID employee name student ready name Etc
right so this is how we create the
temporary table now let's quickly get
back to the cql workbench and try to
create a temporary table add some data
into it and try to display the temporary
table if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are back
on the SQL
workbench and meanwhile we are logging
in you might have a question right when
you say that the temp table will be
existing or running only until the
database is active then why create those
temporary tables in the workbench right
the sole purpose of using temporary
tables is in a few cases the
intermediate results of the data
analytics process are important and you
can have a quick reference on the
intermediate results and you don't want
them to be existing in your database in
a permanent basis right for such
scenarios you can use a temporary
database now here on my workbench we
have a simple code for creating a
temporary table so I'll be creating the
temporary table on the name of student
and we have student ID integer data type
student name workare and uh department
and student ID will be the primary key
now let's use the database that is use
simply learn database to get access and
uh we have the access now let's quickly
see what and all tables we have using
the show command
show
tables
enter and we have two tables employee
and employee table two but not
student right now let's quickly execute
this control
enter and now let's use the insert
command same like we inserted in the
previous tables insert into table name
student parameters ID name department
and values comma separated values
student ID name and department or group
whatever he took in college right now
let's execute this
code control enter there you go the data
has been successfully included now let's
Select Staff from St that is view the
contents in this particular table we
have the values in this particular table
and let's also see if we have that
particular data included in the database
or not let us show
tables there you go it's not included in
the database but it is active when you
try to you know print the values in that
particular table which is in the
database it will show you but when you
try to fetch that particular existence
or the permanent existence of that
particular table it will not be present
and this particular table will be active
only until the database is active now
let's restart this particular work pitch
I'm closing
it restarting
it now if I run this I will not get it
you can see the error the
database right okay let's have the
database selected
and let's try to run the
command there you go table simply learn
DB do student does not exist right
previously when you try to execute the
table was giving us values now we have
the error saying the table does not
exist right that is how temporary
database runs now with that we have come
to an end of this session on temp tables
in SQL if you have any qu regarding any
of the topics covered in this session or
if you require the resources that we
used maybe PP or demo code then do let
us know in the comment section below and
our team of experts we'll be more than
happy to resolve all your queries at the
earliest until next time thank you stay
