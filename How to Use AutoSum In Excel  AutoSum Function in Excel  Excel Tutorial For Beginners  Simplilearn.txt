hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about autosum function in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without further
ado let's get started with our one point
agenda that is auto sum in excel for
that let's get started with the
practical mode now on my screen you can
see the sales of four quarters from
different regions that is east west
south north and central now you might
want to calculate the sum of sales
happened from all the regions in q1 or
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened in one region of all the
four quarters
that is either you want to calculate the
sum of all the regions from quarter one
or you might want to calculate the sum
of
all the quarters in one region right so
to do this you have some simple
functions in excel so you might see me
you have some function etc right for
that you might want to go into the
you know equals to mode and fetch some
option and subtotal or sum of you have
to select the function from here but
what if i tell you that there is one
simple easy shortcut where you just have
to make one single click and you'll have
all the sum right so that seems
interesting so on the top in the home
bar select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation
so you have different aggregations here
some average count numbers maximum
minimum more functions here you might
want to select the sum and you can get
all the summation numbers here
so i'll select one cell so the second
query where we wanted to calculate the
sum of all these sales happened in east
region with all the quarters included
that is this one
c2 to f2 right so let us select g2
and
select the autosum option and here it
will automatically select the range for
you that is c2 to f2 if you want to
change it can also you know change it
like minimize the number if you just
wanted to calculate the sum of three
quarters you can do that so now we want
four quarters so select enter and there
you go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of east region now if you
simply drag it you will have the sum of
all the four quarters of all different
regions
now let us calculate the summation of q1
of all the regions that is this one
select autosum and it will automatically
select all the cells for you
that is
from
c2 to c6 right press enter and you'll
have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here
of all the q2 sales of all the regions
q3 sales of all region and q4 sales of
all region
now let us try to change the colors that
you can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's just total sum or
right you just have a reference to
identify it
now similarly to this one as well
so that's how you implement autosum in
excel and with that we have come to an
end of this session on autosum in excel
