hello everyone welcome to this video on
micro interactions in figma from Simply
learn whether you are a designer with
some experience or just starting in the
world of uiux understanding interactions
is key to making your designs more user
friendly so imagine you using an app and
you tap on a button to submit a form or
you scroll down a page to see more
content so these are examples of
interactions basically the ways users
engage with the element on a website or
app so they are super important because
they guide the user smoothly from one
step to another now let's talk about
micro interactions now these are small
details that happen when users interact
with your design for example have you
ever noticed when you like a post on
social media and the Heart icon gives a
little bounce or when you drag a file to
the trash bin it gives a quick animation
of the trash closing these are micro
interactions they may seem tiny but they
help improve the overall user experience
by providing feedback making your design
feel alive and responsive and in figma
you can easily create these small but
powerful moments using its prototyping
and animation tools and in this video
we'll be covering some cool examples
including a subscribe button that
responds when clicked a toggle switch
that smoothly switches between on and
off States and a fq accordion that
expands and collapses with a simple
click and a page Bottom bar navigation
that animates when switching tabs and
also a sidebar menu that slides in and
out for easy navigation and by the end
of this video you'll know how to create
all these micro interactions in figma
and bring your designs to life so let's
Dive Right In so let's start with the
Subscribe button so basically I want the
Subscribe button to be plain in color
and once I press the Subscribe button I
want it to zoom in a bit with red color
fil so here I already have my main frame
ready where we'll be trying it out so we
will be placing our subscribe button
over here basically so let's just start
creating it so let's draw a rectangle
first you can press r on your
keyboard so first let me just check that
if the size is
fine think I have
to yep I think this is perfect right
let's just zoom in a bit now let's just
round off these edges Corner these edges
so just Corner the
radius yes that's perfect and let's just
write the Subscribe text inside the
shape so initially I want this to be
white in
color yes let's just increase the font
size a
bit yes 15 is fine what you have to do
is you have to frame the selection so
select this shape press shift sh key
select the text go to the bottom toolbar
and frame
selection so this is your first frame
now let's just rename the frame as empty
because we won't be having colored in it
so basically we need more than one state
for animation so let's create two more
copies of
this yes now let's just rename these
frames as transition and and let's just
rename it as red filled because finally
I want my button to be red after
subscribed and here let's just change
this text to
subscribed yeah so now we have to create
a component set of these so for that
select all and go to the button Toolbar
to create a component set like
this select everything go to the toolbar
and create a component set
let's rename the component set as
subscribe button yeah next step is to
fill the color inside each of the
buttons so even though we need the
button to be you know plain before the
click it is important to fill the
confidence with the same color like all
the components with the same color for
transition but then you can adjust the
opacity of the color so I'll just show
you so that you get an idea so basically
you know after subscribe I want it to be
read right like the but but
color so let's just select this
button let's give this red color so we
have kept it test FF 00 I think we'll
put the text color we'll keep the text
color as black
itself just a
second just a second
fill let's just keep it black for now
we'll give this a stroke and let the
opacity be 0%
percentage yes now here this is a
transition state so let the opacity be
let the color be the same ff0000 0 then
let the opacity be 75
percentage yes and this is the Subscribe
button where we need the opacity to be
100
percentage let's just
yes cool now the thing is I want the
Subscribe button to grow a bit and
Shrink slightly during the transition
it's kind of a popup so I will make the
transition state frame a bit bigger so
this is a transition state thing so I
will just make it you know a bit bigger
this just slightly I also align the
text you know because I we need a just a
small popup during the
transition so now this is all done now
it's time to add the animations so for
that we have to go to the
Prototype on your right
side and now let's add the flows between
the
suggested plus signs so let's edit the
first
flow so here we want on click because
we'll be clicking the Subscribe button
and on click it will change change to
the transition state we need smart
animation now there are so many options
here so select smart animate we need
ease in and ease out of around I think
200 millisecond is enough
yes now let's draw the second floor now
the second floor we don't want it on
click because you know we'll click the
Subscribe button only once so I just
want it to be dark red after a delay so
let's just give after
delay the least we can give is 1
millisecond so I think that would be
fine and we need to change it to Red fi
we'll give the same smart animate EAS in
and E out and here we'll you know just
reduce to around 100
millisecond yes so now let's just copy
so now this is a component so now let's
just copy the first frame and paste it
in the main frame copy this and pasted
it over here yes
see here as you can see the Subscribe
button you know we have just blacked it
out so let me just you know change the
color of the
text now here it's reflecting as right
so now let's just play and see the
outcome yes so as you can see the
Subscribe button which had no color as I
clicked it gave a subtle pop and went to
red button as I had imagined so this is
pretty cool so this is how you know you
design a subscribe button or a like
button for example or a save button Etc
so now let's move on to create a toggle
switch so basically I want to create the
toggle switch for this particular alarm
so as you can see my main frame is ready
and we'll be adding the toggle switch
over
here so let's do
it so first let's create a rectangle as
before and just check if the size is
fine yes
perfect let's just zoom in a
bit let's curve the
edges yes now let me draw a circle
inside for the circle the shortcut on
your keyboard is the letter
O so now you have to do a frame
selection for these two elements so
select the element hold shift key select
the other
element and do frame selection so this
is basically your on state so I will
rename this Frame as on
state so in the on state I want the
background to be yellow in
color here
yellow and I want my button to be black
in
color yes so as I told you for adding
transitions or animations we need more
than one
state so let's just duplicate this
Frame yes let's just rename this as off
State yeah now in the off
State my button would be
here I think the placement is fine yeah
I want the background to be light gray
because that's
usually the color for an off State give
the button a dark gray
shade
think no yeah I think this is fine
now let's create a component set of
these two frames you just have to
select just a
second yeah you just have to select
everything and create a component set
you'll rename the component set as tole
switch now let's add flows by going to
prototype like how we did earlier for
the Subscribe
button so when I press this button I
want it to go to the off State
again this is on click we have to change
to the off State it's smart
animate we don't want it is easy and EAS
out we actually you know there are more
options I think custom spring so like
you know it actually I wanted to you
know be in a spring action so I'll just
give custom spring so if you give custom
spring this is how the animation would
look like so now let's just give the
same flow backwards with the same
settings
yes done so once it's done let's copy
the first frame and let's paste it in
the main frame so this is our first
frame we pasted it in the main frame
just a
second so as you can see it works and it
gives us smooth transition for toling
switch so now before we move on to the
next interaction Kickstart your design

enroll now to transform your career and

course Link in the description box and
PR comments so now let's create an FAQ
accordion so this is basically the FAQ
model seen on Google so where we'll
press the question and the answer comes
in a drop- down menu so let's create
that one so first let's create a
rectangle and then let's you know write
a question Inside the
Box what is
uyux
design the text is not visible so let's
just first change the text color just
increase the size to 20 or I think 25
would be
fine let's just align it yes so now
let's do frame selection for these two
objects like for the rectangle and the
text so as you might have seen the basic
steps remain the same for creating micro
interactions so let's
just do frame
selection and rename the frame as
question now let's create the answer
part just a second let's let me just uh
so is fine now create another
rectangle make sure it's of the same
size
now let's just copy
paste
expression okay bring to
front
yeah now we have to provide the answer
so basically I have just you know I have
the answer over here so let's just drag
it and adjust it
let's just frame select these
two this question this stream let's
rename it as answer now let's create a
confidence set of these two by selecting
everything let's rename the component as
a PQ now let's add the animation go to
prototype it will be given smart animate
with Easy in and out
same
backwards
yes now we'll select this particular
frame copy it to the main
frame let me just
address adjust the frame size now let's
just play and see how our fpq section
looks
like this is pretty cool so this
basically looks how an FAQ section looks
like Google search page isn't it see how
easily we made this transition so now
next let's see how to create the sidebar
menu that we usually see in
apps so I'll first show how I want it to
be so that you'll get an
idea
so yeah basically I want my animation to
look somewhat like this so first we'll
be having the main page and when I click
a button you know I just wanted to zoom
out sorry zoom in in a bit and the next
page should right up so let's see how
this is
created so here I've already selected
two
frames so first we have to create a
frame so let me just check out the
resolution of these
screenshots okay it's
46129 this height is 98.85%
yes so we have created a frame of equal
size and now we have to layer the two
images one by one inside the first frame
so make sure that you know the sequence
of the frame that you layer is correct
so the thing is basically I want
this as my first frame like while I'm
using the app I want this as my first
frame and I want this to zoom in a bit
while I click a certain button
so the second page that I
want we kept
here the first page that I
want will be layered above
it
yes so let me just you know rename this
Frame as closed let me just duplicate
this
Frame
yes now in the second frame is named as
open so in this state I want the this
particular
image to look small just a
second
yes to be somewhat like this now this is
not a perfect
example you know I just want you to know
how such an animation can be done that's
all yep so now I have to create buttons
so like for time being we'll just create
some shapes
so I will just give a small square as my
first icon and here I would like to
represent my close Button as a small
circle for
example let's keep that black in
color yeah let's just zoom in a bit now
we have to edit or you know like make
animations for these particular shapes
so let's just do that again create a
component set of these two
now let's just prototype
it same we need on click smart animation
e and
out same goes for the other way
around yes now I'll be placing this
button over
here maybe over
here let's just consider this you know
as the menu button or whatever and let's
just take this circle and place it in
this particular page where you'll be
using this as a close
button let's just place it over here now
let's just prototype these
two now let's just see the
result this is amazing
so this kind of looks like a complicated
animation but see how easy it was to
create so you know you can experiment
more on this this is just a basic
example you can experiment more on this
now finally let's create the page Bottom
bar navigation so basically the you know
Bottom bar that you find on apps so I'll
just show you the result first ex so
that you know you'll get an idea of what
I'm going to create so here we have the
home the profile the search and the
settings so basically basically when I
you know press profile I want such an
animation when I press search I want
such an animation when I press home I
want such an animation so this is what
we are going to create now yes so here I
have already got my icons ready I hope
it's visible to you let's yeah so first
let's create a
frame and now let's draw four rectangles
and curve them and then we have to place
them in equal spacing
yes let's just do it
quickly yes so as you saw in the example
first I have the home button let me just
copy it here me just paste it here just
a second there is some
issue
yes this is my home I can just bring it
here like this
this is my
search this is my
settings now I'll just duplicate these
frame four
times let me just bring it
down it's going and getting pasted over
here so let's just align them linearly
so that it's easy to edit one
more so right now we have four
frames let's zoom in a bit so as you saw
initially I want my home to be red in
color and a text to and I want to place
this over
here
okay now let me write the text over
here and I want this to be red in color
the color was
ff0000
% so as we have discussed during the
Subscribe button also so while coming to
the next one I actually don't want a
color but I have to give the same color
for the next frame also but you just
have to adjust the opacity so I'll just
give you an example for example while
I'm in the home page I want this button
to be red in color and I want it to be
written as home right now this is
basically for our profile page so here
what I'll do is here also for the button
I'll just give the same color but my the
opacity will be 0
percentage okay but so as you can see
it's still there but the opacity is 0
percentage likewise here I want it to be
profile just change this
first
yeah this
F here we give green
color so here we'll give but here also
we'll give the same color in the rest of
the frames also we'll be giving the same
green
color what was this
color just a second 3900 yeah so you
have to give the exact
color but the opacity will be 0
percentage so you have to do likewise in
everything so I will just quickly do it
because it will take a lot of time so I
just quickly do it and come back to
you so once that's done we can now give
the animations so let's go to prototype
so when I on the profile section it must
go to this it's smart animate ease in
and ease out from here also we'll go to
the second frame so all the profiles
while click should go to the second
frame now all the home for example while
clicked should go to the first
frame so follow this
pattern and draw flows for each of the
icons I hope you understood like for
example the search button like whichever
search button it is you have to go to
the third frame so you can draw the flow
from each of the
frames to the third
frame settings will go to the fourth
frame so basically while hovering we
want these shapes to expand so what you
can do is like the home will come from
from the
left so we can actually the design yeah
so we can actually you know move the
shape toward the left because the home
while playing will you know this
particular Circle will come from the
left side so we are giving it to the
left
similarly similarly the rest for example
this settings they come from the right
so you can give it to the right side so
basically what you have to do is you
have to align all these shapes shes like
for example the shapes enclosed by the
home icon you have to shift it towards
the left and the shapes enclosed by the
rest of the icons you have to shift it
towards the right so now let's see the
result
yes this is pretty
cool as you saw you know the home is
coming from the left settings is come
going to the right so this is why we
adjusted the shapes at the end so yeah
you have seen some cool instances where
micro animations are used now before we
wind up I have a quick question for you
guys what is a primary purpose of using
micro interactions in figma when
designing user
interfaces option A you have to add
complex animations for visual appeal
option b to guide users through tasks by
providing
feedback option C to enhance the layout
structure of the design and option D to
reduce the number of screens a design so
you can give your answers in the comment
section and we'll be checking your
answers and addressing any queries so I
hope you liked our tutorial I hope you
got a basic idea of how to create micro
interactions so it's pretty simple it
might look complicated but then of
course you just have to spend a bit of
time and do it properly and then it's
pretty simple so hope you like this
